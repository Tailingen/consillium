Artesunate Ointment for the Treatment of Anal HSIL in HIV-negative Participants
This is a phase II double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of artesunate ointment for the treatment of HIV-negative men and women who have anal high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (anal HSIL)
Anal High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion|Anal HSIL|Anal HPV Infection|AIN
DRUG: Artesunate ointment|DRUG: Placebo
Complete and partial response by week 18, Number of participants with complete and partial response after four 5-day cycles of artesunate ointment, 18 weeks
HPV clearance, Number of participants who do not have detectable HPV infection, 42 weeks|Complete and partial response after week 18, Number of participants with complete and partial response after week 18, 30 weeks|Complete and partial peri-anal response after intra-anal ointment application, Number of participants who have complete and partial peri-anal response after 4 5-day cycles of intra-anal ointment, 42 weeks|Persistence of response, Number of participants who have complete response and do not have recurrence of anal HSIL, 42 weeks
Safety of intra-anal artesunate ointment, Number of participants who do not have any drug-related serious adverse events, 42 weeks
Eligible participants in this study are randomized 2:1 to receive either artesunate or placebo ointment for the treatment of anal HSIL. Both groups receive four 5-day cycles of ointment, at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. Participants are followed closely with anoscopy or high resolution anoscopy (HRA) at weeks 8, 18, 30, and 42. After the week 18 HRA visit, participants who have at least partial response will be followed with HRA at week 30.

Participants who are found to be non-responders at week 18 will undergo standard of care ablation.

Participants who are found to have anal HSIL at weeks 30 or 42 will be followed according to standard of care procedures.

Primary Objective: To evaluate the complete and partial histopathologic response to four 5-day cycles of artesunate ointment in adult patients with biopsy-proven HPV-associated intra-anal HSIL (18 weeks).

Secondary Objectives:

Efficacy:

To evaluate the viral clearance after four 5-day cycles of artesunate ointment To evaluate complete and partial intra-anal response To evaluate complete and partial peri-anal response To evaluate persistence of response throughout the study window

Safety:

To evaluate the safety of artesunate ointment for the treatment of intra-anal HSIL.
