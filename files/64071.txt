Telemedicine Follow-up for Routine, Low-Risk Oculoplastic Surgery
The investigators propose utilizing a simple telemedical protocol to allow patients to substitute the first post-operative visit with a remote survey that includes essential post-operative history, vision measurement, and photographs, all of which can be provided using a personal computer, tablet, or smart phone. The investigators have selected for this purpose a subset of oculoplastic procedures involving the eyelid and lacrimal system that have well-reported low rates of serious complications, since high-risk procedures will likely always require close, in-person care. The investigators hypothesize that telemedicine follow-up for the first post-operative week after low-risk oculoplastic surgery will decrease the time burden on patients without compromising their satisfaction or increase the risk of late post-operative complications.
