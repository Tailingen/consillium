Gleevec Administered Preoperatively to Reduce Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the use of Gleevec in initially non-resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors can lead to allow complete resection in 20% of cases.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a specific, immunohistochemically KIT+ mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. The identification of KIT+ tumor has become more important after introduction of target treatment with KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Despite this progress, GIST patients presenting a tumor larger than 5 cm have a 10 year survival between 10% and 30%. Indeed, the risk of microscopic spreading of the tumor during surgery is very high since intra-abdominal organs are in close relation to each others. To improve survival, it seemed logical to use preoperative Gleevec to reduce tumor size and improve efficacy of the surgical procedure.
