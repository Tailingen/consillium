Using Tumor Models to Determine Treatments
The purpose of this study is to see if using Patient Derived Organoids (PDO) to choose a drug for the treatment of pancreatic cancer individually for each patient is useful. The study will look at the number of participants who have a response to their assigned drug.
Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma|Advanced Cancer|Epithelial Tumor
DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Ponatinib|DRUG: Brigatinib|DRUG: Colchicine|DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Neratinib|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Ceritinib
Objective response rate (ORR), 3 years
Disease control rate (DCR), 3 years|Duration of response (DOR), 3 years|Progression free survival (PFS), 3 years|Overall survival (OS), 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to cobimetinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to cobimetinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to ponatinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to ponatinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to brigatinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to brigatinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to colchicine, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to colchicine, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to selinexor, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to selinexor, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to ceritinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to ceritinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to abemaciclib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to abemaciclib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to neratinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to neratinib, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to doxorubicin, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to doxorubicin, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort A assigned to etoposide, 3 years|Number of side effects experienced with participants in Cohort B assigned to etoposide, 3 years
PDO is a three-dimensional experimental model grown in a laboratory from patient's tumour tissues. PDO is used to test different drugs and select the drugs that may work for treating the patient's cancer. Researchers will review participants' PDO drug results from other studies from which they participated in and will identify the drug that seem to have the best effect on the PDO model. Participants will be offered to receive that drug during the study.
