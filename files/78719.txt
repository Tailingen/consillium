Neoadjuvant PD-1 Plus TIGIT Blockade in Patients With Cisplatin-Ineligible Operable High-Risk Urothelial Carcinoma
To learn if the combination of atezolizumab and tiragolumab can help to control bladder cancer when it is given before surgery to remove the bladder and tumor.
Metastatic Malignancy
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab
To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To evaluate overall survival (OS)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Safety Objective:

•To evaluate the safety and tolerability oftiragolumab and atezolizumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk UC who are ineligible for neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.

Secondary Efficacy Objectives:

* To evaluate pathologic T0 rate after neoadjuvant treatment with tiragolumab and atezolizumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk UC comparing to historical data (about 10% in patients with high-risk disease).
* To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).

Exploratory Biomarker Objective :

• To assess immunologic/molecular responses to tiragolumab and atezolizumab in patients with muscleinvasive, high-risk UC who are ineligible for neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.
