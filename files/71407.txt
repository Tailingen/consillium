Emergency Room HPV Self-Sampling Study (ACT NOW)
The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an evidence-based public health intervention using HPV self-sampling approach in an opportunistic setting to increase cervical cancer screening among screening non-attendees, particularly those uninsured or underinsured, who use emergency services to access medical care. The proposed pilot study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of HPV self-sampling among women at a safety net hospital emergency room. Participant recruitment and self-sample will take place in the waiting rooms in the ER. All women sitting in the waiting room will serve as the source population for the study and will be approached and invited to participate in the study.
