Treatment Resistance Related With Gene Expression Profile of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
The investigators perform a retrospective microarray gene expression profiling study of FFPE from a cohort of DLBCL patients with whole genome cDNA mediated Annealing Selection and Ligation (WG-DASL) assay. The investigators also study the pattern of microRNA from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The results of gene expression profiles and microRNA is correlated with clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Number of patients who relapse or progress after 1st line chemotherapy, two years
Number and type of genes and microRNA which are significantly related with relapse or progression (P < 0.05), two years
