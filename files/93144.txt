Early Phase Clinical Trial About Therapeutic Biological Product Mix for Treating CEA Positive Rectal Cancer
Conducting an early phase clinical trial to assess CEA Antigen Presentation Therapeutic Biological Product Mix activity that suggests the potential for clinical benefit of CEA positive rectal cancer patients.

1. Treat CEA positive rectal cancer via Trained Immunity.
2. Activate human CEA Protein Antigen Presentation Reaction.
3. The human antigen presenting cells (APCs) can treat the CEA protein antigen into small peptide fragments, and then kill CEA positive rectal cancer cells in vivo.
