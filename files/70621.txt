A Trial of Postoperative Whole Brain Radiation Therapy vs. Salvage Stereotactic Radiosurgery Therapy for Metastasis
The aim of this study is to evaluate non-inferiority of salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the patients who received surgical resection for brain metastases in comparison with postoperative whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

A randomized phase III study is started in Japan to compare postoperative whole brain radiation therapy with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery in patient with one to four brain metastases from lung, breast, and colorectal cancer.

Total of 270 patients will be accrued for this study from 21 institutions within three years. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The secondary endpoints are proportion of performance status (PS) preservation, proportion of mini-mental status examination (MMSE) preservation, and adverse events.
