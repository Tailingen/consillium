Phase 1/2 Clinical Study of HY07121 Powder for Solution for Infusion in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, open-label, phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of HY07121 in participants with advanced solid tumors.

Tumor biomarkers will be tested using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scored using Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) and/or Combined Positive Score (CPS) algorithm., Up to 2 years
The study starts with a dose escalation part (Part 1) followed by a dose expansion part (Part 2). The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug HY07121 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if any) and/or the recommended dose(s) (RD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Additional purposes of the study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) properties, immunogenicity, correlation of the biomarkers and PK profile with anti-tumor activity.
