Olaparib in Patients With HRD Malignant Mesothelioma
In this study, researchers will give olaparib (a drug) to mesothelioma patients who have specific changes in their DNA (known as gene mutations). Researchers will give this drug to each patient on the study to find out if it will help the patient's tumor shrink or stop growing.
Mesothelioma|Homologous Recombination Deficiency
DRUG: Olaparib
Objective Response Rate of Patients to Olaparib, To determine the percentage of patients with mesothelioma tumors (containing certain gene/cell mutations) that shrink or stop growing as a response to olaparib., Two years.
Overall Survival of Patients Taking Olaparib, To determine the length of time patients on the study are still alive after taking olaparib., Three years.|Progression-Free Survival of Patients Taking Olaparib, To determine the length of time patients taking olaparib can live with mesothelioma without their cancer getting worse., Two years.|Frequency of Treatment-Related Side Effects/ Adverse Events, To determine the frequency of treatment-related side effects/ adverse events reported among study participants. These side effects will be assessed by attribution (source), type and grade. Adverse events/side effects will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 5)., Two years.
