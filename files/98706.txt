EktoTherix™ Regenerative Tissue Scaffold for Repair of Surgical Excision Wounds
The purpose of study is to assess the safety and performance of EktoTherix™ Tissue Repair Scaffold in the treatment of full-thickness, dermatologic wounds created by the surgical removal of non-melanoma skin cancers.

EktoTherix™ is a medical device developed by Neotherix Limited, manufactured by the polymer processing technique of electrospinning. Described as a "tissue scaffold", EktoTherix is placed into the surgical wound to help the patients' own cells repair the wound, enhancing healing and improving quality (including cosmetic outcome). The tissue scaffold is completely absorbed by the body during the healing process, which means that there is no need to remove it when the wound is healed.

All patients recruited into this study are treated with EktoTherix, are seen weekly until they heal and seen again at the final follow-up visit three months post-surgery.

The investigators hypothesise that the use of EktoTherix will increase incidence of complete healing and result in an overall better cosmetic result of the healed wound.

DEVICE: EktoTherix
Incidence of device related adverse events, The primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate the safety of the EktoTherix Tissue Repair Scaffold through the incidence of device related adverse events identified during the study, including clinical infection, whether the wound has healed by the final clinical assessment and any clinically significant laboratory results at three month post-surgery assessment., 3 months
Cosmesis (cosmetic outcome is assessed by the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale (VBSAS) score (clinician's assessment) and by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The cosmetic outcome is assessed by the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale (VBSAS) score (clinician's assessment) and by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score (patient's assessment). The VBSAS scale assigns a numerical score by summing individual ratings for pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and height or depression of the wound or scar. The VAS score is a number, between the worst (0) and the best (ten) cosmetic outcome, representing the patient's perception of the treatment.

The cosmetic outcome is evaluated when the wound is healed (if prior to or on Day 42 Post-surgery Assessment) and at the 3 Month Post-surgery Assessment., 3 months
