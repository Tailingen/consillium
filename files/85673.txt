Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant DNA and Adenovirus Expressing L523S Protein in Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to examine the safety and immunogenicity of a therapeutic vaccine regimen with recombinant DNA and adenovirus expressing L523S protein in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer. The vaccine regimen will consist of two fixed doses of recombinant DNA (pVAX/L523S) followed by two doses of recombinant adenovirus (Ad/L523S). The trial will evaluate the dose escalation of Ad/L523S through three cohorts of patients.

BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant DNA- pVAX/L523S|BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant adenovirus- Ad/L523S
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the vaccine regimen administered as two doses of pVAX/L523S and two doses of Ad/L523S.

The secondary objectives of the study are:

* To provide initial evidence as to whether CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses specific for L523S protein can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of Ad/L523S
* To provide initial evidence as to whether antibody responses specific for L523S protein can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of Ad/L523S
* To investigate the extent to which dose escalation of Ad/L523S affects the elicited immune response
