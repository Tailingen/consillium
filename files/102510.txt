A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Mosunetuzumab (BTCT4465A) in Combination With Polatuzumab Vedotin in B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It will consist of a dose finding portion followed by an expansion phase for second line or later (2L+) participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) DLBCL and 2L+ R/R FL. In addition, subcutaneous mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin will be evaluated in participants with at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (3L+) for the treatment of R/R mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and in participants with 2L+ R/R DLBCL.
