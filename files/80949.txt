A Study of BTX-A51 in People With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is an open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) as well as preliminary efficacy of BTX-A51 capsules in participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The study will be done in three parts. Part 1a (Monotherapy Dose Escalation) of this study is designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of orally administered BTX-A51 in up to 35 participants who are evaluable for toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, it is planned that an additional 15 participants will be enrolled in Part 1b (Monotherapy Cohort Expansion) of this study for additional experience with safety and efficacy, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) which may or may not be different from the MTD. After determination of MTD and RP2D from Part 1a, Part 1c (Azacitidine Combination Dose Escalation) will enroll up to 30 participants.

Continued treatment will be available under this study protocol for up to eight 28-day cycles (Continued Treatment Phase) if the Investigator judges the benefit outweighs the risk.

Once BTX-A51 treatment has completed, participants will be contacted by telephone every 3 months for up to 2 years after their last treatment for survival status and anticancer therapy (Overall Survival Follow-up).

Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as a severe or clinically significant adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value (Grade 3 or greater, unless otherwise specified) starting with the first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, unless it is clearly related to disease progression, intercurrent illness, preexisting condition, or concomitant medications. DLTs are based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0., Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Number of participants with non-serious AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the participant's symptoms according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values; toxicity will be graded and reported according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Number of participants with 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant 12-lead ECG findings; toxicity will be graded and reported according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Number of participants with echocardiogram (ECHO) abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant ECHO abnormalities and/or AEs, such as elevated or abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or abnormal Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS), Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant vital sign values; toxicity will be graded and reported according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Number of participants with physical examination abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant physical examination findings; toxicity will be graded and reported according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Up to a total of eight 28-day cycles (approximately 224 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The DLTs are to be evaluated for determination of the MTD. The MTD will be the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate of 0.3. If there are ties, the higher dose level when the isotonic estimate is lower than the target toxicity rate will be identified and the lower dose level selected when the isotonic estimate is greater than or equal to the target toxicity rate., Up to 28 days (one cycle) for each dosing cohort in Phase 1a|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), The DLTs are to be evaluated based on cumulative safety/PK data in participants treated in Phase 1b for determination of the RP2D (which may or may not differ from the MTD), Up to 28 days (one cycle) for each dosing cohort in Phase 1b
