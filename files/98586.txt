Diagnostic Accuracy of 3-dimensional Imaging Device on Polyps and Adenomas During Colonoscopy
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if 3-dimensional (3D) imaging device works to correctly classify colon polyps and adenomas during colonoscopy to guide the selection of proper treatment procedures. It will also learn about the safety of 3-dimensional (3D) imaging device. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does 3-dimensional (3D) imaging device improve the correct classification as well as size and depth evaluation of polyps and adenomas during colonoscopy using pathology as gold standard? What adverse events do participants experience during colonoscopy and polypectomy?

Researchers will compare 3-dimensional (3D) imaging device to traditional 2-dimensional (2D) imaging device to see if 3-dimensional (3D) imaging device works to improve classification and evaluation accuracy.

Participants will:

Undertake colonoscopy examination and polypectomy using 3-dimensional (3D) imaging device or 2-dimensional (2D) imaging device.

Be followed-up to 30 days to record potential colonoscopy-relevant adverse events.

endoscopic diagnostic accuracy of polyps and adenomas, The overall proportion of correct classifications by endoscopy compared to the gold standard (pathology) in lesion level, 1-7 days after polypectomy
Modified high-risk adenoma (mHRA) detection rate, mHRA were defined with one of the following features:1. diameter ≥10 mm or 2. (tubulo)villous adenomas or 3. with high-grade dysplasia or 4. sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). SSLs were defined as lesions with at least one crypt showing a characteristic sessile serrated lesion-type appearance, 1-7 days after polypectomy|Adenoma detection rate (ADR), The number of participants with at least 1 adenoma divided by the total number of participants, 1-7 days after polypectomy|Polyp detection rate (PDR), The number of participants with at least 1 polyp divided by the total number of participants, 1-7 days after polypectomy|Clinically relevant serrated polyp detection rate, Clinically relevant serrated polyps are defined as ≥10 mm serrated polyps (SPs, including hyperplastic polyps, SSLs, and traditional serrated adenomas) and \>5 mm SPs in the proximal colon. Clinically relevant serrated polyp detection rate is defined as the number of participants with at least 1 clinically relevant serrated polyp divided by the total number of participants, 1-7 days after polypectomy|early colorectal cancer detection rate, early colorectal cancer is defined as high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion less than 1000μm (SM1), 1-7 days after polypectomy|the accuracy of the evaluation of invasion depth, The overall proportion of correct depth evaluation by endoscopy compared to the gold standard (pathology) in lesion level, 1-7 days after polypectomy|the confidence of endoscopy diagnosis, the diagnostic confidence of the lession classification by the endoscopists, during endoscopy diagnosis before polypectomy by the endoscopists|the accuracy of lession size evaluation, the proportion of correct estimated lession size by the endoscopists during examinaion with other endoscopists estimated by acquired images, 1-7 days after polypectomy|The colonoscopy-relevant adverse events, aspiration pneumonia, perforation, bleeding, splenic injury/rupture, death, or others requiring hospitalization within 30 days after the colonoscopy, 1-30 days after polypectomy
