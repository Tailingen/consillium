Study of Proscavax Vaccine in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer vs Active Surveillance
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a prostate cancer vaccine named Proscavax (Prostate-specific antigen(PSA) / Interleukin-2(IL-2) / Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF)) in patients with localized prostate cancer. The goal of the study is to determine if vaccine administration results in a change in the rate of prostate cancer progression when compared to a no-treatment control group of active surveillance patients.

The researchers are interested in evaluating the proportion of participants with prostate cancer progression at 2 years following administration of Proscavax or active surveillance, the effect of the vaccine on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time and the assessment of adverse events in these patients.

Eligible patients in this study will include men who are 18 years and older and who have a previously untreated early stage prostate cancer regardless of the date of diagnosis.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Proscavax
Prostate cancer progression measured by PSA test, Determine prostate cancer progression in patients receiving Proscavax vaccine (Arm 1) versus patients on active surveillance (Arm 2) by measuring change in PSA levels in patients in both arms, At pre-study, and then every 3 months till 2 years, starting at week 7 for both arms|Prostate cancer progression measured by digital rectal examination (DRE), Determine prostate cancer progression in patients receiving Proscavax vaccine (Arm 1) versus patients on active surveillance (Arm 2) by performing digital rectal examination (DRE) on patients in both arms, At pre-study and then every 6-months for 2 years|Prostate cancer progression measured by prostate Biopsy, Determine prostate cancer progression in patients receiving Proscavax vaccine (Arm 1) versus patients on active surveillance (Arm 2) by performing prostate biopsy on patients in both arms, At pre-study and then every 12-months for 2 years
PSA doubling time, Determine the time for the PSA level to double, At pre-study, and then every 3 months till 2 years, starting at week 7 for both arms|Assessment of Adverse Events, Confirm safety and tolerability of Proscavax vaccine, From first injection until 30 days past the 24-month assessments
This study will have 2 arms and patients will be randomized 2:1 into the Proscavax treatment arm (Arm 1) versus the active surveillance arm (Arm 2).

In study Arm 1, 6 doses of the vaccine will be administered intradermally at weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, and 15, followed by maintenance booster injections once every month which will alternate between low dose IL-2 alone (at weeks 19, 27 and 35) and Proscavax vaccine (at weeks 23, 31, 39) for 6 months.

In study Arm 2, patients will undergo active surveillance and will not receive any Proscavax vaccine treatment.
