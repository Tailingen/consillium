CIBMTR Research Database
The primary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of observational data that can be used to study HSC transplantation and cellular therapies.

A secondary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of data to study marrow toxic injuries.

Objectives:

To learn more about what makes stem cell transplants and cellular therapies work well such as:

* Determine how well recipients recover from their transplants or cellular therapy;
* Determine how recovery after a transplant or cellular therapy can be improved;
* Determine how a donor's or recipient's genetics impact recipient recovery after a transplant or cellular therapy;
* Determine how access to transplant or cellular therapy for different groups of patients can be improved;
* Determine how well donors recover from the collection procedures.

A Comprehensive Source of Observational Data to assess Stem Cell Transplant, A primary outcome is to have a comprehensive source of stem cell transplant data that can be used to assess topics such as:

* Recipient Recover time
* How recovery after transplant and other cellular therapies can be improved
* Long term outcomes after transplantation and other cellular therapies
* How well donors recover from collection procedure, Anually - on average
A Comprehensive Source of Data for Marrow Toxic Injuries, In the event of a radiation exposure accident, the NMDP has a radiation injury treatment network, whose purpose is to collect data to understand the outcomes of patients treated under these circumstances. Any patient who is treated for a marrow toxic injury at a center participating in the NMDP's Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN) is eligible to participate in the Research Database., anually- on average|Prospective Assessment of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Patients with Medicare Coverage (17-CMS-SCD), This protocol supports data collection for a sub study titled 17-CMS-SCD, an observational study to compare survival of patients 15 to 50 years of age with sickle cell disease who receive allogeneic transplantation compared to those receiving standard of care treatments.

* To provide a mechanism to Medicare Beneficiaries with sickle cell disease for claims coverage for allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant.
* To provide data requested by Medicare under its coverage with evidence development (CED) process to make payment on claims for HCT using the existing research observational database for the CIBMTR, annually - on average|Prospective Assessment of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Patients with Medicare Coverage (10CMSMDS-1), This protocol supports data collection for a sub-study titled 10-CMSMDS-1 with objective to prospectively examine outcomes of allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant in adults \>= 65 years of age with myelodysplastic syndrome to determine whether their outcomes are similar to those in younger patients.

* To provide a mechanism for Medicare Beneficiaries with myelodysplastic syndrome for claims coverage for allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant
* To provide data requested by Medicare under its CED to make payment on claims for HCT using the existing research observational database of the CIBMTR", annually - on average
Prospective Assessment of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Patients with Medicare Coverage, This study is the main protocol for the following two sub studies. Details for these sub-studies are found under separate NCT numbers.

* Multiple Myeloma Medicare Study (NCT03127761): 17-CMS-MM
* Myelofibrosis Medicare Study (NCT02934477): 16-CMS-MF, annually - on average
