Prospective Assessment of Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors and Current or Prior History of Carcinoid Syndrome or Diarrhea Undergoing Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy With or Without Telotristat Ethyl
The NET-PACS trial is a Prospective Assessment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors and current or prior history of Carcinoid Syndrome or diarrhea undergoing peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with or without telotristat ethyl. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of serial in-depth assessment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors and current or prior history of carcinoid syndrome or diarrhea undergoing treatment with PRRT using telotristat ethyl compared to placebo. We aim to report and describe from a patient's perspective the multi-faceted impact of carcinoid syndrome in patients with NETs and the changes on treatment while getting PRRT using telotristat ethyl compared to placebo.

FACT-QS global QoL Score, Feasibility of in-depth assessment of changes and improvement on treatment in patients undergoing treatment as determined by FACT-CS global QoL with PRRT using telotristat ethyl compared to placebo. The FACT-CS global QoL is the primary endpoint. Scores will be derived using FACIT guidelines and will range from 0 to 12 with higher scores denoting a better level of functioning.

A repeated measures ANOVA will be applied and statistical significance of fixed effects of treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction will be assessed using a Wilks' Lambda Approximate F test., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months
To describe and report from a patient's perspective the multi-faceted impact of carcinoid syndrome in patients with NETs and the changes on treatment while getting PRRT using telotristat ethyl compared to placebo., Linear mixed effects regression model will be utilized to describe longitudinal changes in QoL as measured by the identified FACT-CS scales. Fixed effects for treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction along with a random effect to account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements will be included. Graphical plots of the estimated mean and associated 95% confidence intervals by time point in the study will be produced., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months|ATo report changes in patient reported outcomes (PRO) in the diarrhea domain in patients undergoing PRRT receiving telotristat ethyl versus placebo., Linear mixed effects regression model will be utilized to describe longitudinal changes in QoL Diarrhea domain as measured by the identified FACT-CS scales. Fixed effects for treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction along with a random effect to account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements will be included. Graphical plots of the estimated mean and associated 95% confidence intervals by time point in the study will be produced., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months|To report changes in patient reported outcomes (PRO) in the flushing domain in patients undergoing PRRT receiving telotristat ethyl versus placebo., Linear mixed effects regression model will be utilized to describe longitudinal changes in QoL as measured by the identified FACT-CS scales in the flushing domain. Fixed effects for treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction along with a random effect to account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements will be included. Graphical plots of the estimated mean and associated 95% confidence intervals by time point in the study will be produced., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months|To estimate the need of rescue short-acting somatostatin receptor antagonist in patients undergoing PRRT receiving telotristat ethyl versus placebo., Linear mixed effects regression model will be utilized to describe longitudinal changes in frequency of rescue short acting somatostatin receptor antagonist use. Fixed effects for treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction along with a random effect to account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements will be included. Graphical plots of the estimated mean and associated 95% confidence intervals by time point in the study will be produced., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months|To estimate the weight-gain in patients undergoing PRRT receiving telotristat ethyl versus placebo., Linear mixed effects regression model will be utilized to describe longitudinal changes in weight. Fixed effects for treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction along with a random effect to account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements will be included. Graphical plots of the estimated mean and associated 95% confidence intervals by time point in the study will be produced., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months|To estimate the changes in bowel movement frequency and/or consistency in patients undergoing PRRT receiving telotristat ethyl versus placebo., Linear mixed effects regression model will be utilized to describe longitudinal changes in frequency and/or changes in consistency of bowel movements. Fixed effects for treatment arm, time and treatment arm by time interaction along with a random effect to account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements will be included. Graphical plots of the estimated mean and associated 95% confidence intervals by time point in the study will be produced., From enrollment until completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to six months
