Randomized Study of Spinal Anesthesia Compared With Traditional Epidural Anesthesia Concerning Peroperative and Postoperative Pain After Open Nephrectomy in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma
The study aim to study whether spinal anesthesia (using: bupivacain, morfin och klonidin) can be better than epidural anesthesia during and after open surgery for renal cell carcinoma. Per- and postoperative pain after spinal anesthesia with klonidin can be reduced and, thus, shorten the hospital stay and rehabilitation of the patients.
Pre- and Postoperative Analgesia|Spinal Anesthesia|Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: klonidin|DRUG: epidural anesthesia
postoperative mobilisation index, Using a number of variables an index of mobilisation has been created; eg pain (10 graded scale), malaise, intravenous substitution, eating in dining room, Walking outside ward room, passage of stool, carrying urinary bladder catheter, can mobilise out of bed without help, within the first 30 days (plus or minus 5 days) after surgery
time of hospitalization, time in hospital after surgery until discharge, within the first 15 days after surgery
Need of rescue analgetics, the total amount of analgetics used besides the spinal infusion or the epidural infusion used, within the first 15 days after surgery
