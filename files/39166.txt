SHR-1210 Combined With Apatinib in Treatment of ED-SCLC After Failure of First Line Standard Therapy
This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of intravenous (IV) SHR-1210 at 200mg,q2w in combination with Apatinib at one dose (375mg). Comparison of 3 different dose schedules in subjects with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer. SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a new kind of selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

The study is composed of two parts. Part 1 of the study will determine the safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib in first 6 subjects of each arm. The second phase of treatment was carried out by selecting one group of administration mode and the tolerated dose of Apatinib. Part 2 of the study will determine the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib in 39 subjects.
Small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: Apatinib
Adverse Event, Evaluation of adverse event rate according to CTCAE v4.03, 24 months|ORR, Objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 (Response was assessed with CT or MRI using RECIST v1.1, Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to\<10 mm; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Over all responseï¼šCR+PR), 6 months
OS Rate, Overall survival rate, 6 months|PFS, Progression-free survival according to RECIST v1.1, Imaging assessment was performed on C1D28 and every 8 weeks after C1D28 until radiographic progressive disease (PD) was documented.|TTR, Time to response according to RECIST v1.1 (Response was assessed with CT or MRI using RECIST v1.1, Time to response (TTR): date of first dose to date of first documented CR or PR), Imaging assessment was performed on C1D28 and every 8 weeks after C1D28 until radiographic progressive disease (PD) was documented.|DoR, Duration of response according to RECIST v1.1 (Response was assessed with CT or MRI using RECIST v1.1, Duration of response (DoR): DoR will only be performed in subjects who have a confirmed tumor response (CR or PR) after treatment, Imaging assessment was performed on C1D28 and every 8 weeks after C1D28 until radiographic progressive disease (PD) was documented.|DCR, Disease control rate according to RECIST v1.1 (Response was assessed with CT or MRI using RECIST v1.1; Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to\<10 mm; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Disease control rate (DCR): CR+PR+SD, Imaging assessment was performed on C1D28 and every 8 weeks after C1D28 until radiographic progressive disease (PD) was documented.|OS, Overall survival, on average of 2 years
