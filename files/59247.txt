Study to Evaluate Blood and Urine Kidney Injury Markers to Facilitate Early Detection of Renal Adverse Drug Events in Pediatric Cancer Patients Treated With Nephrotoxic Chemotherapy
This study is to investigate blood and urine kidney injury markers (especially Uromodulin) in pediatric cancer patients treated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy. Uromodulin is a marker to detect and monitor tubular injury and renal function.
