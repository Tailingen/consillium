Safety and Efficacy of Cryoablation for Abdominal Pain Associated With Pancreatic Cancer
CUC10-PAN09 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation therapy on the relief of epigastric/abdominal pain associated with pancreatic cancer.
Pain|Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
Abdominal pain reduction following cryoablation of the celiac plexus, Measured by the average difference of pre- and post-treatment worst pain in the last 24 hours (baseline), within 24 hours of the cryoablation procedure, 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks as measured on the numeric 0-10 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Scale, 3 Months
Duration of abdominal pain relief, Measured from the cryoablation procedure to the return of the abdominal pain, 3 Months|Cryoablation Procedure Information, Number of cryoablation needles used, freeze and thaw cycles and times, method of thaw and ice formation, During the procedure on the procedure day (an expected average of 3 hours)|Hospital Duration, Date and time of admission and discharge, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 day|Difference in average pain scores, Measured from baseline to within 24 hours of the cryoablation procedure, 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks as measured on the numeric 0-10 Brief Pain Inventory Scale, 3 Months|Percentage of subjects able to reduce analgesic medications, Measured from baseline to within 24 hours of the cryoablation procedure, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post cryoablation procedure, 3 Months|Time to maximal epigastric/abdominal pain relief after cryoablation, The safety endpoint for this study is to assess the incidence and severity of intra-operative events, post operative adverse events, serious adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects related to the cryoablation procedure, 3 Months|Time to recurrence of epigastric/abdominal worst pain at or above baseline, Measured worst pain score in the 12 week follow-up period as measured on a numeric 0-10 Brief Pain Inventory Scale, 3 Months|Subject satisfaction with the amount of epigastric/abdominal pain relief from cryoablation procedure, Subjects will answer questions regarding their satisfaction., 3 Months|Safety assessment, The safety endpoint for this study is to assess the incidence and severity of intra-operative events, post operative adverse events, serious adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects related to the cryoablation procedure, 30 Days post cryoablation
CUC10-PAN09 is a Supportive Care, Phase 1 multicenter, prospective, single arm study with subjects serving as their own control. This study is to enroll patients who will undergo cryoablation of the Celiac Plexus. Subjects will be followed for 3 months post their cryoablation procedure.

Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of extremely cold temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool in the fields of general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery (including lung), Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology (colon/rectal) and urology (kidney).
