NM32-2668 in Adult Patients With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1, dose-escalation study with expansion cohorts to evaluate NM32-2668 for safety and immunogenicity, to determine the maximal tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose, define the pharmacokinetics, to explore the pharmacodynamics, and to obtain preliminary evidence of the clinical activity in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors.
