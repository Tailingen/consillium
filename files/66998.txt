Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in Combination With Propranolol and Chemotherapy for Treatment of Advanced Hepatopancreabiliary Tumors (BLOCKED)
A single-arm, interventional study combining Immunotherapy and propranolol with/without chemotherapy and propranolol

1. Pancreatic Cancer Durvalumab will be administered once every 4 weeks, in combination with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (day 1/8/15) and continuous propranolol. Tremelimumab will be given on day 1 of cycle 1, which may be repeated at the time of progression in eligible patients.
2. HCC Durvalumab will be administered once every 4 weeks in combination with continuous propranolol. Tremelimumab will be given on day 1 of cycle 1, which may be repeated at the time of progression in eligible patients.
3. Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC, Cholangiocarcinoma of the gallbladder or bile ducts) Durvalumab will be administered once every 3 weeks, in combination with cisplatin + gemcitabine (day 1/8) and continuous propranolol. Tremelimumab will be given on day 1 of cycle 1, which may be repeated at the time of progression in eligible patients.
