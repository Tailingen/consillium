Video-assisted Hyperthermic Pleural Chemoperfusion vs Talc Pleurodesis for Refractory Malignant Pleural Effusions.
Aim of this study is to compare two methods of pleurodesis for refractory malignant pleural effusions, in terms of safety and efficacy.
Safety of Intervention|Efficacy of Intervention|Cost Effectiveness
PROCEDURE: VATS hyperthermic chemoperfusion|PROCEDURE: Bedside talc slurry pleurodesis
Recurrence of pleural effusion, 2 months following intervention
Morbidity, Postoperative period (7 days following intervention)
The study compares prospectively two groups of patients with refractory maignant pleural effusion. Group A consists of patients undergoing video-assisted hyperthermic pleural chemoperfusion (with a pump machine) and group B includes patients undergoing bed-side tube thoracostomy and talc slurry pleurodesis.
