A Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant Sotorasib in Combination With Cisplatin or Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for Surgically Resectable Stage IIA-IIIB Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With a KRAS p.G12C Mutation
This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed chemotherapy for patients with surgically resectable stage IIA - IIIB (T3-T4/N2) (based on AJCC 8th edition), non-squamous NSCLC with a KRAS p.G12C mutation. The primary objective of the study is to determine whether neoadjuvant therapy with 4 cycles of at least one dose of sotorasib plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed can be administered safely and result in improved MPR rate in patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutant non-squamous NSCLC compared with the historical control MPR rate for platinum-based chemotherapy alone.

DRUG: AMG 510|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Patients with surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant non-squamous NSCLC as assessed by major pathologic response rate in resected tumor specimens, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Objectives

Primary:

* To evaluate the efficacy of induction with sotorasib (AMG 510) in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed in patients with surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant non-squamous NSCLC as assessed by major pathologic response rate in resected tumor specimens.
* To determine the safety, tolerability and RP2D of sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed as induction therapy in patients with surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant nonsquamous NSCLC

Secondary:

* To evaluate the efficacy of induction sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed in patients with surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C mutant non-squamous NSCLC as assessed by : Objective response rate (ORR), Eventfree survival, Recurrence-free survival, Overall Survival (OS), Complete Resection (R0) and Pathologic complete response rate (pCR)
* To determine the safety and tolerability of sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed as induction therapy in patients with surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant nonsquamous NSCLC.

Exploratory:

* To evaluate biomarkers of response to induction sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed in surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant non-squamous NSCLC.
* To assess modulation of tissue and/or blood markers in response to induction with sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed in surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant nonsquamous NSCLC.
* To evaluate mechanisms of adaptation and/or resistance to sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed in surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant non-squamous NSCLC.
* To evaluate immune modulation in tissue and the periphery in response to induction sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed in surgically resectable KRAS p.G12C-mutant nonsquamous NSCLC.
