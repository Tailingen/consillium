A Phase I/II Clinical Trial of LBL-034 in Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and efficacy of LBL-034 in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (R/R MM).
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: LBL-034 for Injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR \[including the rates of Strin-gent complete response(sCR),complete response (CR) ,Very good partial response(VGPR),and partial response (PR)\], evaluated based on the 2016 IMWG criteria(Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) and 2013 IMWG criteria(Cohort 4), refers to the percentage of study subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response. It was used to evaluate the efficacy of LBL-034 in Phase IIa study ., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy).|Dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）, DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment.DLT is defined as toxicity (possible adverse events related to LBL-034) during the DLT observation period . It was used to evaluate the safety of LBL-034 in Phase I study ., The DLT observation period starts from the first dose until 4 weeks after the full dose first administration (including the step-up dosing period, if any).|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the hightest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycles. It was used to evaluate the tolerability in Phase I., The MTD observation period starts from the first dose until 4 weeks after the full dose first administration (including the step-up dosing period, if any).
Cmax, Maximum drug concentration in plasma after administration., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Tmax, After administration,Time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects.Immunogenicity refers to the performance that can elicit an immune response., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), MRD-negative rate: Refers to the percentage of subjects who achieve MRD negativity at any time point after the initial dose and before disease progression or the initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Duration of Response(DOR）, DOR is defined as the duration from earliest date of disease response (CR、PR 、iCR or iPR) until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause(if occurring sooner than progression)., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|sBCMA, serum B-cell maturation antigen(Detect the change of sBCMA in serum), From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)
A multicenter, open-label, phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of LBL-034 in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

This trial includes two parts: phase I and phase IIa study.

The dose escalation and dose expansion studies for LBL-034 will be conducted in the phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability and determine RP2D.

The efficacy of LBL-034 in the treatment of R/R MM and R/R leukaemia plasmacytic (plasma cell leukemia, PCL) will be evaluated in Phase IIa study.Phase IIa clinical study will be conducted after obtaining the RP2D.Determine the specific dosing regimen in Phase IIa based on the safety, PK and other data from Phase I clinical studies.Phase IIa clinical study includes 4 cohorts.This trial requires collection of biological samples from all subjects for relevant testing.

This clinical trial will enroll 342 patients in Phase I and Phase IIa studies.
