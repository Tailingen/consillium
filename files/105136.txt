A Study of CPX-351 (Vyxeos™) With Quizartinib for the Treatment of FLT3-ITD Mutation-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a research study to be done at multiple sites in participants with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that have a mutation in Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD). This study is to learn more about an investigational drug, quizartinib, being tested with the anti-cancer medicine CPX-351 (also called Vyxeos™), which is approved and widely used to treat AML.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and survival of patients receiving the combination of CPX-351 and quizartinib.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: CPX-351|DRUG: Quizartinib
Number of Patients With Treatment Related Adverse Events After Taking CPX-351 and Quizartinib, Counting the number of patients with treatment related adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability., Collected during treatment and for 30 days after last dose, approximately 35 total days for the 1 patient treated.|Number of Patients With an Overall Response Taking CPX-351 and Quizartinib, Overall response is defined by the International Working Group response criteria (Cheson et al 2003) as having a complete remission (CR) - a complete morphologic response with complete blood count recovery absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μL and platelet count ≥100,000/μL) or a complete morphologic response with an incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) - absolute neutrophil count \<1000/μL and/or platelet count \<100,000/μL), from cycle 1 day 1 (each cycle is 28 days) until disease progression for up to 2 years post treatment
Median Time to Platelet Count Recovery, Time to platelet recovery is defined as the time to when the peripheral blood platelet count is \>50, 000/ μL, from cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days) for up to 24 months|Median Time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Recovery, Time to neutrophil recovery is defined as the time to when the peripheral blood ANC is ≥500/μL, from Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days) for up to 24 months|Number of Patients Proceeding to an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT), Patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) following treatment in induction and consolidation therapies., up to 60 days after consolidation therapy|Median Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression, confirmed by bone marrow biopsy., from diagnosis of relapse or refractory AML until disease progression for up to 2 years post treatment|Event-free Survival Time, Defined as the number of days until evidence of PD by bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, or death, regardless of cause. Patients who are alive without a disease response assessment of relapsed disease will be censored at the last adequate disease assessment date. Patients without a disease response assessment will be censored at the first date of treatment., from day 1 for up to 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the first date of treatment until death as a result of any cause. For OS time, patients that have not died or are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive or the date of last contact., Up to 8 months|Number of Patients Who Develop Late Responses, Late responses as defined by the International Working Group response criteria (Cheson et al 2003) as having a complete remission (CR) - a complete morphologic response with complete blood count recovery absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μL and platelet count ≥100,000/μL) or a complete morphologic response with an incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) - absolute neutrophil count \<1000/μL and/or platelet count \<100,000/μL, up to 4 years|Number of Patients Who Can Receive Consolidation and Maintenance Therapy, Patients who proceed through induction to next stages of consolidation and maintenance, approximately 3 months|Treatment-related Mortality Rate, As determined by the number of treatment related deaths during study treatment, Observed during treatment and for 30 days after last dose, so approximately 35 days for the 1 patient treated.|Percentage of Patients Who Achieve a PR or Molecular Complete Remission, A PR is defined as persistent disease by morphology but with a \>50% reduction in the blast count/cellularity ratio compared to the most recent BM biopsy prior to treatment. A molecular complete remission is defined as no evidence of disease by bone marrow biopsy/aspirate by morphology, immunohistochemistry, or flow cytometry, and FLT3 mutation by MRD analysis., from cycle 1 day 1 (each cycle is 28 days) until disease progression for up to 2 years post treatment|Mean Elapsed Time for Patients to Achieve Molecular CR, The mean time to achievement of a complete morphologic CR with persistent disease detected by flow or molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis., From Date of First Treatment to up to 2 years|Quizartinib Tolerability After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT) or Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI), Defined as the number of patients who received quizartinib and proceeded to alloHCT or DLI as part of this study and had treatment-related adverse events, From Date of First Treatment, up to 2 years
This is an open-label, two-part Phase II clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability as well as the efficacy of administering CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin liposome complex) with quizartinib. CPX-351 is a formulation of two drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin, that is administered as the first part of treatment to get rid of as many leukemia cells in your bone marrow as possible. Quizartinib is an investigational drug made of a protein that inhibits FLT3 and will be given after CPX-351 has been given. The plan for administration is divided into three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance.
