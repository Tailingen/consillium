Fludarabine, Cytarabine, Topotecan in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The study is designed with drugs used frequently in the treatment of AML, but with a new combination less toxic,and effective in AML multidrug resistant.

Justification:

* The AML patients with primary resistance or relapsed in the first 12 months after CR, have second line chemotherapy low response rate .
* These patients with AML with primary resistance or relapse, that reach remission after a rescue treatment, have an interval free survival and a global survival very short
* Probably the resistance to the treatments is in relation to different forms expression of the MDR.
* Complete remission is considered valid evaluation, because every patient who should obtain a CR can be considered to be eligible for a possible curative treatment: Ara-C administration to high doses or the TPH treatment
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cytarabine
To treat with the combination FLAT patients with acute myeloid leukaemia that they present a primary resistance, one month|â€¢To treat with the combination FLAT a relapse in the first 12 months after reach the first CR with standard treatment, one month|To treat with combination FLAT patients can't receive the standard treatment due any cause, one month
Improve the interval free survival and global survival, one year|To avoid the toxicities produced by other chemotherapy in this type of patients, 4 months|To determine the existing association between the response to the treatment with FLAT and the expression of Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) in the acute myeloid leukaemia, 6 months
It is a protocol opened, multicentric, led to end to increase a) the rate of complete responses, b) the duration of the response, c) the free survival of disease and d) the global survival.

The included subjects will be patients with primary or secondary AML that they have not achieved the CR after the standard treatment with an anthracycline or derivative associated with Ara-C or have relapsed in the first 12 months after having achieved the RC. Also patients with AML that, for any reason, they could not receive the standard treatment with anthracycline and Ara-C, will be included

Cycle of induction. The patients will be treated by FLAT according to the following scheme:

* FLUDARABINE, 30 mg/m2 i.v. (In 1 hour) on the 1st to 4.
* CITARABINE, 2 g/m2 i.v. (In 4 hours), four hours after finishing the fludarabine, on the 1st to 4.
* TOPOTECAN, 1,5 mg/m2 i.v. (In 4 hours), four hours after finishing the cytarabine, on the 1st to 4.

When the patient starts recovering the hematological counts, and providing that has not blasts in the peripheral blood (SP), he will become a medullar revision (MO):

* If MO presents severe hypocellularity without blasts,no therapeutic measurement will take and there will repeat revisions weekly and MDR's study up to the CR or the blasts appearance.
* If in MO persist blasts (\>5 %) but have diminished less than 50 % of the initial number, the induction will be continued by the FLAT's second shift.
* If in MO persists more than 50 % of blasts of the initial number, the patient goes out of the protocol and it will be treated as an agreement by the criterion of the center.

The patients who have managed to enter CR will receive a cycle of consolidation as soon as possible and always within 2 months from the day in which they received first FLAT's dose. The cycle of consolidation consists of another FLAT's scheme to the same doses.
