Study of PF-06940434 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
Open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics and clinical activity study of PF-06940434 (Integrin alpha-V/beta-8 Antagonist) in patients with SCCHN (Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck), renal cell carcinoma (RCC - clear cell and papillary), ovarian, gastric, esophageal, esophageal (adeno and squamous), lung squamous cell, pancreatic and biliary duct, endometrial, melanoma and urothelial tumors. This study contains two parts, single agent dose escalation (Part 1A), dose finding of PF 06940434 in combination with anti-PD-1 (Part 1B) and dose expansion (Part 2). Part 2 Dose Combination Expansion will enroll participants into 3 cohorts at doses determined from Part 1B in order to further evaluate the safety of PF-06940434 in combination with anti-PD-1.
