Marker Guided Breathhold Radiotherapy in NSCLC
Proof of concept study evaluating safety and performance of a gel marker (BioXmark) used for image guidance in deep inspiration breathhold radiotherapy (DIBH IGRT) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DEVICE: BioXmark
Visibility of the injected gel marker during the course of radiotherapy delivery, Stability of the geometrical configuration and visibility of the injected gel marker in 2D kV x-rays and CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) acquired throughout the treatment course and quantified by vectors and contrast to noise ratio (CNR), 3 months|Number of pneumothoraxes in relation to placement procedure of the gel, Counting number of pneumothoraxes caused in relation to the placement procedure of the gel, 0-1 week after placement of gel
