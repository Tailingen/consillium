Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home
This study aims to assess the usability of the innovative Audio + Radio (AURA) system in enhancing personalized supportive care for cancer patients and caregivers during the post-ostomy care transition by collecting information on patient's daily activities and answers to survey questionnaire, and enabling access to this information through a voice assistant device.

BEHAVIORAL: Audio + Radio (AURA)
Satisfaction with the AURA system, Satisfaction with the AURA system will be assessed by the 9-item Participant Satisfaction Scale measuring the level of program satisfaction ranging from 1=not satisfied to 5=extremely satisfied. Higher total score indicates greater program satisfaction., 1-month followup survey|Perceived ease of use of the PRISMS program, Perceived ease of use of the AURA system will be assessed by the 23-item Usability Scale measuring the ease of use in three aspects: general, content, and navigation. The scales range from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. Higher total score indicates greater ease of use., 1-month followup survey
The investigators will assign up to 30 cancer patients with newly created ostomies for cancer treatment with curative intent and their primary caregivers to the AURA or usual care groups (up to 30 patient-caregiver dyads, a total of 60 individuals). AURA is defined as a system that connects audio-based voice assistant devices with radiofrequency (RF) sensing technology to gather relevant patient information automatically, interactively, and with context-awareness and to store a patient's health records that otherwise had to be measured and entered manually into an electronic system. Additionally, the system enables user's access to this information through a voice assistant device. The users of this system will be the entire care team, consisting of the patient and their family members as well as the caregivers and healthcare providers at remote sites. If results indicate that the pilot trial is feasible, the investigators will design and conduct a definitive trial to examine the efficacy of AURA, a potentially scalable intervention that can be disseminated through oncology clinics nationwide to enhance post-treatment care for cancer patients with ostomies who transition from hospital professional care to self-management at home and their caregivers.
