System Biology of Spleen Deficiency Syndrome
Spleen Deficiency Syndrome(SDS)is a widely researched issue, but due to the limitations of the research methods, the scientific mechanism of SDS is biased and not comprehensive. SDS would be researched in this project deeply and systematically with modern life-scientific methods. Based on the previous work, the participants, with SDS, suffering from Qi deficiency syndrome--chronic superficial gastritis--chronic atrophic gastritis--gastric cancer would be included, and the corresponding research would be conducted at the molecular-cell-gastric tissue level, and at the same time, systematical biological database of SDS would be built by systematical biological methods, such as pioneered SPARS sequencing technology created in our research group, proteomics and metabonomics. Under the above work, the investigators would conduct data mining and molecular network analysis, and then verify the key functions. By analyzing the systematical biological features of syndrome and its relationships with constitution and disease, this study would provide a new basis for objective reality of syndrome, and also offer a crucial premise of revealing biological basis for syndrome correctly, which is of important theoretical and practical significance.
