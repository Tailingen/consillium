Study of Tesetaxel in Japanese Patients With Solid Tumors
Tesetaxel is an orally active tubulin-binding inhibitor of the taxane class. Evaluation of tesetaxel in Japanese patients has been limited. This study is being conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of tesetaxel administered orally once every 21 days to Japanese patients.
