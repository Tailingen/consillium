First in Human Study of TUB-030 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the drug TUB-030 works to treat solid cancer in adults. The study will also explore the safety of TUB-030. The main questions it aims to answer are:

To determine the safety and tolerability of TUB-030 To determine the maximum tolerated dose of TUB-030 as a single drug given to patients with solid cancer Researchers will also compare doses of TUB-030 in two specific cancer types, in patients with head and neck cancer and patients with non-small cell lung cancer, to see if TUB-030 works to treat these two solid cancer types and to determine the best dose.

Participants will:

Receive drug TUB-030 every 3 weeks Visit the clinic once every 3 weeks for checkups and tests Answer patient reported outcome questionnaires about their symptoms
