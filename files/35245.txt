Pilot Study of IT Topotecan and Maintenance Chemotherapy for HR-EBTs in Children < 6 Years, Post Consolidation
Pilot study to determine feasibility of adding intrathecal chemotherapy and maintenance therapy after high dose chemotherapy for treatment of newly diagnosed HR-EBTs in patients less than 6 years of age.

To determine the feasibility of adding intrathecal (IT) topotecan and maintenance therapy after high dose chemotherapy for treatment of newly diagnosed HR-EBTs in patients less than 6 years of age., Feasibility failure will be defined by ≥5 patients who stop maintenance therapy (all IT and oral agents) due to excessive toxicity, deemed attributable to maintenance therapy, At completion of maintenance therapy (approximately 48-54 weeks after start of maintenance therapy)|To test the feasibility of centralized diagnostics and national tumour board review for clinical management of HR-EBTs, Feasibility of centralized diagnostics will be defined as:

* 80% of patients will have central review and central molecular testing performed before timely start of therapy (\~4 weeks post-surgery)

Feasibility of national tumour board review will be defined as:

* 80% of patients will be reviewed within treatment timeline of within \~4 weeks post-surgery, Within 4 weeks after definitive surgical resection, prior to start of induction chemotherapy|To establish a national HR infant brain tumor trial platform for future studies, Data will be gathered on whether platform is able to support future research projects, facilitate collaboration in Canada, and improve clinical outcomes for this population, At study completion (anticipated average duration of 2 years per participant)
To determine progression free and overall survival and patterns of failure for all enrolled patients, Time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) up to two years following completion of treatment, Up to 24 months following completion of maintenance therapy|To describe the toxicities of adding intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy and maintenance therapy after high dose chemotherapy for treatment of newly diagnosed HR-EBTs in patients less than 6 years of age, Incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) related to study treatment, 30 days after last dose of study treatment
To test the feasibility of prospective banking of tumor tissue, serial plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for all enrolled patients, To determine number of samples collected and bank CSF for potential future circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA analyses), Through completion of study treatment (anticipated duration of 18-24 months per participant)
This is a pilot study to determine feasibility of adding intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy and maintenance therapy after high dose chemotherapy for treatment of newly diagnosed HR-EBTs in patients less than 6 years of age. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria will receive 3 cycles of multiagent chemotherapy induction (vinCRIStine, cyclophosphamide, CISplatin, etoposide) with IT cytarabine and hydrocortisone, and 3 cycles of consolidation with CARBOplatin, thiotepa, and autologous stem cell rescue (as per CCG 99703). Maintenance chemotherapy will then be given immediately after the completion of consolidation therapy and consist of risk-stratified oral chemotherapy using either "Maintenance A" (48 weeks) using tamoxifen and retinoic acid or "Maintenance B" (54 weeks) using metronomic isotretinoin, celecoxib, etoposide, temozolomide, and cyclophosphamide. Both arms of maintenance will receive monthly IT topotecan.

Following the end of treatment, patients will be scheduled for a follow-up visit every 3 months for 24 months to evaluate PFS and OS. Approximately 15 patients will be recruited as part of this clinical study.

Patients aged between 0 and 6 years old at the time of enrollment will be eligible. This study will only enrol patients with high risk Central Nervous System Embryonal Brain Tumors (CNS-EBTs) with histologic and/or molecular confirmation of diagnosis for ATRT intrinsic to the brain and spinal cord, group 3 and group 4 MB, pineoblastoma, CNS neuroblastoma, ETMR, including embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), ependymoblastoma and ETMR not otherwise specified), medulloepithelioma, CNS embryonal tumor with rhabdoid features (INI-1 intact) and CNS embryonal tumor, not otherwise specified.

Response to treatment will be evaluated using the modified RAPNO (Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology) 1.

This study will also explore the genetic landscape of CNS HR-EBTs. Our biological study will include genomic analyses of tumor and CSF with use of epigenomic analyses (methylation profiling) arrays, Nanostring sub-typing studies, Next generation sequencing analyses for DNA and/or RNA.
