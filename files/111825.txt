Personalized Neoantigen MRNA Vaccine Combined with Adebrelimab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
This is a phase IIT , it is an open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of personalized mRNA tumor vaccine RGL-270 targeting tumor-specific neoantigens and Adebrelimab (a humanized PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) in patients with resectable NSCLC and those with NSCLC who have relapsed or metastasized after first-line standard therapy.
