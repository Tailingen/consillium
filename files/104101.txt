Energy for Lymphocytes
CERTIM is a cohort created in July 2015 to set up a multidisciplinary follow-up of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

From the CERTIM cohort, we conducted a longitudinal, prospective, observational study (ELY) in two tertiary university centers (Cochin hospital and European Georges Pompidou Hospital), which included patients between August 2016 and October 2019 and ended follow-up in April 2020.

Patients were treated with nivolumab, at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or pembrolizumab, at a dose of 2mg/kg every 3 weeks. The investigators report findings from an evaluation of rest energy expenditure (REE) assessed using indirect calorimetry in the outpatient setting before treatment with checkpoints inhibitors.
