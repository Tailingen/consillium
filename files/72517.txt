Testing Home-based Exercise Strategies in Underserved Minority Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy: the THRIVE Study
The purpose of this research is to determine whether a 16 week, home-based, aerobic and resistance exercise intervention will increase physical activity levels in Black and Hispanic breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer patients.

The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

* Supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (SUP) - virtually supervised 16- week aerobic and resistance exercise performed at home via Zoom.
* Unsupervised aerobic and resistance exercise (UNSUP) - home-based 16- week aerobic and resistance exercise.
* Attention control (AC) - 16-week home-based stretching.

This is a randomized control trial of Black and Hispanic patients who have been newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer and are being prescribed chemotherapy to determine the effects of home-based exercise on levels of physical activity. It will also evaluate the impact of home-based exercise on cardiovascular (heart health) risk factors.

The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations of body composition, blood tests, fitness and strength assessments, and surveys at study entry and follow-up visits.

Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) Supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (SUP), 2) Unsupervised aerobic and resistance exercise (UNSUP), or 3) Attention control (AC).

Participation is expected to last for 8 months.

It is expected that about 135 people will take part in this research study.
