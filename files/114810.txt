Evaluating Genomic Testing in Human Cancer & Outcomes of Targeted Therapies
This is a substudy (Part 2) of a larger two-part clinical trial including both observational and therapeutic (interventional) cohorts to assess the progression free survival ratio of patients treated with a targeted therapy based on genomic analysis results and recommendation by the Markey Cancer Center Molecular Tumor Board (MCC MTB).
Cancer
DRUG: Therapeutic Intervention
Progression Free Survival, Proportion of patients achieving a PFS ratio â‰¥1.3., 2 years
This prospective, single-arm trial in patients with refractory metastatic cancer will compare the Progression Free Survival (PFS) using a treatment regimen selected by the MCC MTB with the PFS (time to tumor progression) for the most recent regimen on which the patient had experienced progression (i.e., using patients as their own control).
