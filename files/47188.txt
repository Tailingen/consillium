The p53 Colorectal Cancer Trial
Single center, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are selected for treatment with dose dense Cyclophosphamide every second week based on TP53 mutation status; i.e. only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may be included in the treatment arm.

DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Objective response rate (ORR), Partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) as defined by the RECIST criteria, 4 months
Possible molecular markers of therapy response/resistance and survival outcome beyond TP53 mutations will be examined., Tissue and blood sampling at baseline and whenever treatment is changed, 10 years|Number of patients with treatment response among patients harboring TP53 mutations belonging to particular mutation subgroups, Tissue and blood sampling at baseline and whenever treatment is changed, 10 years|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Stable disease (SD) \>6 months, PR or CR, 5 years|Recurrence-free and overall survival, compared to historical data, Survival analyses, All patients will be followed for 5 years or until death to record survival outcome|Safety and tolerability of the study treatment including recording of number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Clinical examination and blood samples, Every second week during the treatment period from start of treatment, and thereafter every second month for 5 years or until death
