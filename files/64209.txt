Sequential Therapies Modeled on Evolutionary Dynamics for Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to test a treatment strategy with currently approved drugs to see if it is practical to administer the available drugs in a new way that researchers hope could be more effective in treating metastatic breast cancer.
