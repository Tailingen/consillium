Combined Treatment of RFA and Sorafenib on Recurrent HCC
RFA is a routaine treatment of recurrent HCC. Recently Sorafenib was reported to be a promising drug to treat late stage HCC. But few studies were related with its effectiveness on recurrent HCC. So the investigators hypothesized that combined RFA and Sorafenib might reduce the frequency of recurrence and improve the overall survival and disease free survial.
