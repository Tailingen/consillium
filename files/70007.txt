Lenalidomide vs Placebo Maintenance Therapy Following Melphalan Prednisone VelcadeÂ® Induction Therapy in NDMM
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of Lenalidomide versus Placebo maintenance following melphalan, prednisone and velcade induction therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

After the study is unblinded, subjects in treatment Arm A (Len 10 mg) will remain on study therapy at the Investigator's discretion and subjects in treatment Arm B (placebo), will be discontinued from study treatment. Subjects who discontinued from study treatment for any reason will enter the LTFU Phase.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide
Overall Survival (OS), Is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Approximately 6 years
Safety; Adverse Events (AE) [type, frequency, and severity of AEs, and relationship of AEs to investigational product (IP) SAEs, laboratory abnormalities, hospitalizations, and SPMs, An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study., Approximately 6 years
The planned total number of evaluable subjects for PFS was approximately 351 (234 in the lenalidomide treatment arm; 117 in the placebo treatment arm) and the study will be conducted in European countries. However, due to the significant enrollment challenges and the changes in the NDMM treatment practices in subjects who are not eligible for transplant, such as the recent approval of Revlimid in NDMM setting, the DMC recommended to close study enrollment. Study enrollment was closed on 12 October 2015.
