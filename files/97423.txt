Evaluation of Ocoxin-Viusid® in Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The investigators hypothesized that with the administration of the nutritional supplement Ocoxin-Viusid® is expected to improve the quality of life and enhance tolerance to chemotherapy in at least 70% of patients diagnosed with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, treated at the "Hermanos Ameijeiras" Surgical Clinical Hospital. Phase II clinical trial, open, multicenter, nonrandomized.

Quality of Life: EORTC QLQ-C30, Life quality measurement through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 (ORTC QLQ-C30): an integrated system for assessing the healthrelated quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. It's composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., 12 months
Nutritional Status of the patient during Chemotherapy, Variations in the patient's nutritional status will be considered, measured by body mass Index (a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women), 12 months|Adverse Events-AE during Chemotherapy Test, A test with the following questions:

Occurrence of an AE in the subject \[Yes, No\]; Description of the AE \[Name of the event\]; Duration of the AE \[Difference between the start and end date of the event\]; Intensity of the AE \[According to CTCAE version 4 it will classify in Light, Moderate, Severe, Life-threatening consequences, Death related to AE\]; Seriousness of the AE \[serious or not serious\], Attitude with respect to the treatment under study \[No changes, dose modification, temporary or definitive interruption of the study treatment\], Result of the AE \[recovered, improved, persisted or sequelae\], Causal relationship \[According to WHO algorithm it will classify in very probable, probable, possible, improbable, unrelated, not evaluable\], 12 months|Hematology test, Levels of Hemoglobin, Platelets, Hemogram with differential in blood extractions., 12 months|Blood Chemistry test, Measure levels of GPT, GOT, Creatinine, Glycemia, Bilirrubin, Alkaline Phosphatase, LDH in blood., 12 months|Compliance with the treatment with chemotherapy (CT) and Immunotherapy (IT) test, Test with the next parameters: if the administration of chemotherapy (CT) and Immunotherapy (IT) treatments will be considered at planned time, number of the cycle administered out of date, days elapsed since the previous cycle and, cause that caused the administration of the CT/IT outside the planned date. In the case of the dose, the medication in which it was modified will be taken into account, as well as the modified dose., 12 months
