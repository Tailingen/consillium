Relationship of PNI and Clinical Outcome in Patients Undergoing Brain Tumor Surgery
There are several predictors of clinical outcome in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery. Among those, nutritional parameters and calculated nutritional index are known to have ability to predict mortality and clinical outcomes in some patients with brain tumor. However, there are lack of consistent results on predictability of nutritional index and clinical outcome in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery.
Clinical Outcome
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: prognostic nutritional index calculated from laboratory parameters
predictability of prognostic nutritional index for mortality after brain tumor surgery, Odds ratio of prognostic nutritional index for postoperative mortality, From date of surgery until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 50 years
predictability of prognostic nutritional index for acute kidney injury after brain tumor surgery, Odds ratio of prognostic nutritional index for postoperative acute kidney injury, From date of surgery until the date of acute kidney injury from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 50 years|predictability of prognostic nutritional index for renal replacement therapy after brain tumor surgery, Odds ratio of prognostic nutritional index for postoperative renal replacement therapy, From date of surgery until the date of renal replacement therapy from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 50 years|relationship of prognostic nutritional index for length of hospital stay after brain tumor surgery, Odds ratio of prognostic nutritional index for length of hospital stay, From date of surgery until the date of hospital discharge
In this retrospective study, we evaluated the relationship between prognostic nutritional index, which was calculated from laboratory parameters, and clinical outcome including mortality in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery.
