The Safety and Efficacy of Combined Microwave Ablation During Limb-sparing Surgery in High-risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a high risk of recurrence when invading surrounding structures, and the optimal treatment strategy for safe surgical margin is still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined local inactivation by ablation in STS during limb-sparing surgery in high-risk STS patients.

Overall survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to last follow-up or death., From date of diagnosis until the date of documented death, assessed up to 5 years (up to 5 year)|progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) was the time from surgery to disease progression or death, From date of surgery until the date of first documented disease progression or death, assessed up to 5 years|Local disease-free survival (DFS), Local disease-free survival (DFS) was the time for local tumor recurrence after surgery., From date of surgery until the date of first documented local tumor recurrence, assessed up to 5 years
Postoperative complications, Serious postoperative complications were recorded according to CTCAE 4.0, including severe wound healing problems, deep infections, bone necrosis, wound burn, persistent pain, and major neurovascular injuries., Post-operation 3 months
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a high risk of recurrence when invading surrounding structures, and the optimal treatment strategy for safe surgical margin is still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined local inactivation by ablation in STS during limb-sparing surgery in high-risk STS patients. Investigators collected data retrospectively from participants diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma who were treated at a tertiary medical institution from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022. This study was approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee (XJS2022-101-01), and all participants provided written informed consent. The participants were divided into two groups (MWA and control group). The MWA group received surgical resection combined with local lesion inactivation by MWA, while the control group underwent standard surgical resection alone. Non-specified sarcomas are treated with the AI(Doxorubicin+Ifosfamide) chemotherapy regimen, while Ewing's sarcoma is treated with the standard recommended VDC ((Vincristine + Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide)/IE(Ifosfamide + Etoposide) chemotherapy regimen.
