Evaluating Skin Appearance Following 5-Flourouracil Cream for Treatment of Actinic Keratosis and the Effects of Topical Agents
This proposed project will be an open-label, split face, randomized controlled pilot study. Up to 60 patients with diffuse facial actinic keratosis will be enrolled in the study. The purpose of this study is to understand the change in skin appearance throughout 5-FU treatment course and to examine whether a topical corticosteroid and moisturizer can decrease severity and duration of skin inflammation after 5-FU treatment course.
