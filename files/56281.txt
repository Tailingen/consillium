Tamoxifen in Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer
RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight liver cancer by blocking the absorption of estrogen. It is not yet known whether receiving tamoxifen is more effective than no further therapy in treating patients with primary liver cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare high-dose tamoxifen with no further treatment in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be surgically removed.
