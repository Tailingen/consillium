Safety and Efficacy of Momelotinib in Subjects With Polycythemia Vera or Essential Thrombocythemia
This open-label study is to determine the safety and efficacy of momelotinib in participants with either polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) who have not yet received treatment with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.
Polycythemia Vera|Essential Thrombocythemia
DRUG: Momelotinib
Overall response rate, For the PV Cohort, overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with all of the following at some point during the treatment period:

* Hematocrit \< 45% in the absence of phlebotomy that lasts at least 4 weeks
* White blood cell (WBC) count \< 10 x 10\^9/L that lasts at least 4 weeks
* Platelet count ≤ 400 x 10\^9/L that lasts at least 4 weeks
* Resolution of palpable splenomegaly that lasts at least 4 weeks

For the ET Cohort, overall response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with all of the following at some point during the treatment period:

* WBC count \< 10 x 10\^9/L that lasts at least 4 weeks
* Platelet count ≤ 400 x 10\^9/L that lasts at least 4 weeks
* Resolution of palpable splenomegaly that lasts at least 4 weeks, Up to 24 weeks
