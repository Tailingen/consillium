Safety and Efficacy of SBRT in the Treatment of Thoracic Malignant Tumors at Different Sites
SBRT (stereotactic radiotherapy) can provide a higher dose to the target area without increasing the risk of surrounding normal tissue / organ injury in selective cases. At present, SBRT has been widely used in radiotherapy of lung cancer and it can also play a better local control for lung metastasis.

However, there are parallel organs and series organs in the chest, and different organs have different tolerance to radiotherapy, so the toxicities of SBRT in different sites are different, and the prescription dose is also different.

This study intends to make a detailed division of the chest region and explore the safety and efficacy of SBRT in different areas. It is divided into four types: chest wall type: the lesion is directly adjacent or overlapped with the chest wall; peripheral type: the lesion is more than 1cm away from the chest wall and more than 2cm away from the bronchial tree; central type: the lesion is less than 2cm away from the bronchial tree; ultral-central type: the lesion is directly adjacent or overlapped with the mediastinal structure.

48-60Gy / 4-10f (EQD2 = 62.5Gy \~ 99.7Gy) was given according to the location of the tumor. Main outcome measures are local progression free survival and radiation toxicities; secondary outcome measure is overall survival.
