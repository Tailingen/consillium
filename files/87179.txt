A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD), and Preliminary Activity of Tiragolumab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma or With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a Phase I open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary activity of tiragolumab administered as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab and/or daratumumab or rituximab in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) or R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

In the Phase Ia part of the study, tiragolumab is administered as a single agent in participants with R/R MM or R/R NHL.

In the Phase Ib part of the study, tiragolumab is administered in combination with atezolizumab and/or daratumumab in participants with R/R MM or with rituximab in participants with R/R NHL.
