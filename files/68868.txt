The treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) presents a challenge to physicians due to the lack of treatment options. Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione, which, compared to anthracyclines and anthracenediones, has significantly reduced cardiotoxicity while maintaining good antitumour activity. The applications of pixantrone can be manifold: elderly patients with a second relapse who are unsuitable for transplantation or CAR-T cell therapy, young patients refractory to 2 previous lines of therapy as a bridge to autologous transplantation, bridge to allogeneic transplantation or CAR-T cell therapy, and salvage therapy for relapses after a transplantation or CAR-T approach. In particular, pixantrone could be one of the most suitable agents to link patients to CAR-T cell therapy due to its safety profile and its ability to induce a rapid response in patients sensitive to this agent. However, data in normal clinical practice are still lacking. Hence the need for an Italian multicentre collection to collect as many cases as possible of patients who have received pixantrone as a bridging therapy to allogeneic transplantation or CAR-T cell therapy.
