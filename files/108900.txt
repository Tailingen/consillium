DRUG: Necitumumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as any of the following events graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, when the event occurred within 21 days from Day 1 in Cycle 1 and was considered to be definitely or probably related to necitumumab and/or gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days, Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia except for transient febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 neutropenia with fever ≥ 38.5 degrees Celsius (°C) for ≤ 24 hours), Grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring platelet substitution, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia), any toxicity leading to the omission of necitumumab on Day 8 or 15 (for participants for whom necitumumab was delayed from Days 8 to 15) during the Cycle 1., Day 1 to Day 21 in Cycle 1 (Up To 21 days)|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants who are alive at the time of study completion or are lost to follow-up will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive., From Date of Randomization until Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 39 Months)
Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from date of randomization until first radiographic documentation of measured progressive disease(PD) defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. PD was at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions with reference being smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm,or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions,or 1 or more new lesions.If participant does not have complete baseline disease assessment,PFS time censored at date of randomization,regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death observed for participant.If participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of data inclusion cutoff date for analysis,the PFS time censored at last adequate tumor assessment date.The use of new anticancer therapy prior to occurrence of PD resulted in censoring at the date of last radiographic assessment prior to initiation of new therapy., From Date of Randomization to Measured Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 39 Months)|Phase 1b: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response or Partial Response (Objective Tumor Response Rate [ORR]), ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of nontarget lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease (Up To 39 Months)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response or Partial Response (Objective Tumor Response Rate [ORR]), ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of nontarget lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease (Up To 39 Months)|Phase 2: Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF was time from the date of randomization until the date of the first observation of radiographically documented progressive disease (PD), death due to any cause, discontinuation of treatment for any reason, or initiation of new anticancer therapy. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. Time to treatment failure was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for participants who did not discontinue early, who were still alive, and who have not progressed., From Date of Randomization to Measured Progressive Disease, Death Due to Any Cause, Discontinuation of Treatment or Initiation of New Anticancer Therapy (Up To 39 Months)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimensional 3 Level (EuroQol-5D-3L) Index Score, EQ-5D measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. 3 severity levels: no, some, severe problems. The index score was calculated from a set of item weights to derive a score on a theoretical scale of 0 to 1, with 1 representing the best health status and zero representing death based on item weights for the Japanese population. One Cycle = 3 weeks and it can be delayed up to 6 weeks., Baseline, Cycle 4 (Cycle = 3 weeks)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimensional 3 Level (EuroQol-5D-3L) Visual Analog Scale (VAS), EQ-5D VAS allowed participants to rate their present health condition. Possible scores ranged from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). One Cycle = 3 weeks and it can be delayed up to 6 weeks., Baseline, Cycle 4 (Cycle = 3 weeks)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), The LCSS is a validated and reliable instrument to assess lung cancer-specific symptoms and their impact on QOL.The LCSS total score was defined as the mean of the 9 items of the scale and the average symptom burden index (ASBI) is defined as the mean of 6 symptom-specific lung cancer questions. Each of the 9 symptom or summary items is assessed on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), with 0 representing no symptoms or better QOL., Baseline, Cycle 4 (Cycle = 3 weeks)|Phase 1b: Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Necitumumab, The Cmax is observed maximum serum concentration, taken directly from the serum concentration-time profile., Cycle 1 (C1) Day 1 (D1) and C3 D1: Predose, End-of-infusion and 1, 3, 6, 24, 96, 168 h post-end-of-infusion|Phase 1b: PK: Cmax of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, The Cmax is observed maximum plasma concentration, taken directly from the plasma concentration-time profile., Gemcitabine: Cycle 1(C1) Day1(D1): Predose, End-of-infusion and 0.5, 1, 2 h post-end-of-infusion; Cisplatin:C1 D1: Predose, End-of-infusion and 3, 21, 93, 165 h post-end-of-infusion|Phase 1b: PK: Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) of Necitumumab, The AUC(0-infinity) is area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time., Cycle 1 (C1) Day 1 (D1) and C3 D1: Predose, End-of-infusion and 1, 3, 6, 24, 96, 168 h post-end-of-infusion|Phase 1b: PK: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, The AUC(0-infinity) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time., Gemcitabine: C1D1: Predose, End-of-infusion and 0.5, 1, 2 h post-end-of-infusion; Cisplatin:C1D1: Predose, End-of-infusion and 3, 21, 93, 165 h post-end-of-infusion|Phase 2: PK: Minimum Concentration (Ctrough) of Necitumumab, The minimum observed serum concentration (Ctrough) of Necitumumab was evaluated., Predose Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, and every 2 cycles after Cycle 5|Phase 2: Number of Participants With Serum Anti-Necitumumab Antibody Assessment (Immunogenicity), A participant was considered to have an anti-Necitumumab antibody response if anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected at any time point., Baseline up to 30 Days Post Last Infusion (estimated up to 39 months)
