A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Relugolix (TAK-385) 40 mg Compared With Leuprorelin in the Treatment of Uterine Fibroids
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Relugolix (TAK-385) 40 mg administered orally once daily for 12 weeks, compared with leuprorelin injection (once every 4 weeks, 1.88 mg or 3.75 mg subcutaneously \[SC\]/time) in patients with uterine fibroids.

Percentage of Participants With Total PBAC Score of <10 From Week 6 to 12, PBAC score was used to measure volume of menstrual blood loss. Participants used sanitary products designated by sponsor and recorded the numbers of tampons or towels used, clots and flooding in patient diary. Three diagrams used which represented a lightly, moderately stained or completely saturated pad/tampon. Following scores assigned: 1) 1, 5, or 20 points for each pad; 2) 1, 5, or 10 points for each tampon; 3) 1 or 5 points for each blood clot of \<1 cm/=1 cm/\>1 in longest diameter; 4) 5 points for each episode of flooding.

Only the largest myoma among those measurable at visit 1 was measured throughout the study. On the assumption that the myoma was spheroids, the myoma volumes were calculated using 3 diameters (D1, D2, and D3). D1: the longest diameter of the myoma; D2: the longest diameter of the myoma which was perpendicular to D1; D3: the diameter of the myoma which crossed the intersection of D1 and D2 (intersection "Z") and was perpendicular to D1/D2 plane. The formula used for calculation is Myoma volume= D1\*D2\*D3\*π/6., Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24|Percent Change From Baseline in Uterine Volumes at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24, A transvaginal ultrasound was performed for determination of uterine volumes. On the assumption that the uterus was spheroids, the uterine volumes were calculated using 3 diameters (D1, D2, and D3) measured as shown below: D1: the longest diameter of the uterus (unit of length: cm); D2: the longest diameter of the uterus which was perpendicular to D1 (unit of length: cm); D3: the diameter of the uterus which crossed the intersection of D1 and D2 (intersection "Z") and was perpendicular to D1/D2 plane (unit of length: cm). The formula used for calculation is Uterine volume=D1\*D2\*D3\*π/6., Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24|Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and Follow up, Anemia-related measurements consisted of hemoglobin, which were determined at the central laboratory., Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and Follow up (up to Week 28)|Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score, Pain symptoms were evaluated using the NRS score. NRS score is a self-reported instrument assessing pain from 0 to 10. Higher scores reflect greater level of pain., From Week 6 to 12, from Week 2 to 6, from Week 18 to 24, and for 6 weeks before the final dose (up to Week 24)|Change From Baseline in Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL)- Symptom Severity Score at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and Follow-up, UFS-QOL was a 37-item self-reporting tool for evaluating QOL in participants with uterine fibroid. It includes eight symptom-related questions and 29 HRQL questions across six subscales (concern, activities, energy/mood, control, self-consciousness, sexual function). The total symptom severity score is ranging from 0 to 100. The higher scores indicate greater severity., Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and Follow-up (up to Week 28)|Change From Baseline in Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL)- HRQL Total Scores at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and Follow-up, UFS-QOL was a 37-item self-reporting tool for evaluating QOL in participants with uterine fibroid. It includes eight symptom-related questions and 29 HRQL questions across six subscales (concern, activities, energy/mood, control, self-consciousness, sexual function). The total HRQL score is ranging from 0 to 100. The higher scores indicate better QOL., Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and Follow-up (up to Week 28)|Number of Participants Who Had One or More Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values of Vital Signs, Vital signs included sitting blood pressure (after the participant has rested for at least 5 minutes), body temperature (oral or tympanic measurement) (degree Celsius \[°C\]) and pulse (beats per minute \[bpm\]) is reported., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants With TEAE Related to Weight, Number of participants with TEAEs of which threshold was 5% or above in either treatment group related to weight was reported., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants With TEAE Related to Standard 12-Lead ECGs, Number of participants with TEAEs of which threshold was 5% or above in either treatment group related to ECG was reported., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values of Laboratory Test, Number of participants with any markedly abnormal values in laboratory tests collected throughout study is reported. WBC = White blood cells, AST = Aspartate Aminotransferase, ALT = Alanine Aminotransferase, GGT = gamma-glutamyl transferase, ULN = upper limit of normal or upper reference limit., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants With TEAE (Bone Density Decreased) Related to Bone Mineral Density, Number of participants with TEAEs of which threshold was 5% or above in either treatment group related to bone mineral density was reported., Up to Week 28|Number of Participants With TEAE Related to Biochemical Bone Metabolism Markers, Number of participants with TEAEs of which threshold was 5% or above in either treatment group related to biochemical bone metabolism markers was reported., Up to Week 28
The drug tested in this study was called Relugolix (TAK-385). Relugolix was tested to treat people who had uterine fibroids.

The study enrolled 281 patients. Participants received relugolix placebo and leuprorelin acetate placebo in run in period for 3 to 6 weeks. After run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in 1:1 ratio:

* Relugolix 40 mg
* Leuprorelin 1.88 or 3.75 mg

Participants received relugolix tablets once daily along with leuprorelin 1.88 mg or 3.75 mg subcutaneous injection once in 4 weeks for 24 weeks in treatment period.

This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 32 to 40 weeks including run-in period of 3 to 6 weeks and a treatment period of 24 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a final visit 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
