Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Adjuvant Chemotherapy With or Without Radiotherapy in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Endometrial Cancer After Surgery With Curative Intent (MK-3475-B21 / KEYNOTE-B21 / ENGOT-en11 / GOG-3053)
The purpose of this study is to compare pembrolizumab + adjuvant chemotherapy with placebo + adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed radiographically by the investigator or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence, and with respect to overall survival (OS). The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab + adjuvant chemotherapy is superior to placebo + adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, with respect to DFS as assessed radiographically by the investigator or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence, and with respect to OS.

The DFS as assessed radiographically by BICR or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence, will be presented., Up to approximately 42 months|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) as Assessed Radiographically by Investigator or by Histopathologic Confirmation of Suspected Disease Recurrence by Combined Positivity Score (CPS)-Determined Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Status, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, distant metastasis, secondary systemic malignancy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The DFS as assessed radiographically by investigator or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence by CPS-determined PD-L1 status will be presented., Up to approximately 42 months|Overall Survival (OS) as Assessed Radiographically by Investigator or by Histopathologic Confirmation of Suspected Disease Recurrence by Combined Positivity Score (CPS)-Determined Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Status, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The OS as assessed radiographically by investigator or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence by CPS-determined PD-L1 status will be presented., Up to approximately 54 months|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) as Assessed Radiographically by Investigator or by Histopathologic Confirmation of Suspected Disease Recurrence by Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) Status, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, distant metastasis, secondary systemic malignancy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The DFS as assessed radiographically by investigator or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence by tumor mutation burden (TMB) status, will be presented., Up to approximately 42 months|Overall Survival (OS) as Assessed Radiographically by Investigator or by Histopathologic Confirmation of Suspected Disease Recurrence by Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) Status, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The OS as assessed radiographically by investigator or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease recurrence by tumor mutation burden (TMB) status will be presented., Up to approximately 54 months|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 54 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 52 weeks|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. Participant responses to questions 29 ("How would you rate your overall health during the past week?") and 30 ("How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?") are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). A higher score indicates a better overall health/quality of life status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 combined scores will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 54 months|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Physical Function Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much). A higher score indicates a better quality of life. The change from baseline in physical function (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5) score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 54 months|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Symptom Specific Scale for Endometrial Cancer (EORTC QLQ-EN24) Score, The EORTC-QLQ-EN24 is a 24-item questionnaire developed to be used in conjunction with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of endometrial cancer patients. Participant responses are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much). A higher score indicates a better quality of life. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-E24 score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 54 months
