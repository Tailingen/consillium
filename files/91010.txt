Study to Assess Clinical Activity of Zelenectide Pevedotin in Participants With Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a global, multicenter, open-label study that aims to assess the efficacy and safety of zelenectide pevedotin in participants with NECTIN4-amplified recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior therapy (see inclusion criteria below). The study will comprise of 2 cohorts. Cohort A will include participants with hormone receptor positive/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative \[HR+/HER2-\] breast cancer, whereas Cohort B will include participants with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Investigator, Percentage of participants with either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to approximately 3 years
Number of participants reporting adverse events (AEs) and Serious adverse events (SAEs), Safety will be reported as incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events using NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, DoR as measured by the time from first documentation of objective response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, Percentage of participants with confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), Up to approximately 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, Percentage of participants with CR, PR or SD â‰¥16 weeks, Up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival, OS is defined as length of time from the first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to death (due to any cause)., Up to approximately 4 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, PFS is measured by the time from the first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression, or to death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 3 years|Time To Progression (TTP) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, TTP is defined as the time from first dose of study drug administration until first evidence of disease progression, Up to approximately 4 years
