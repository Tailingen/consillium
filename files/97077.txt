No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice.

It is planned to enrol 200 subjects in up to 30 sites in Russian Federation. The average number of patients per site is planned as 6 - 10; there are no restrictions on minimum and maximum number of subjects per site in this study.
