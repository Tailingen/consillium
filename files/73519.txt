Proton Radiation for Unresectable, Borderline Resectable, or Medically Inoperable Carcinoma of the Pancreas
The prognosis for patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are not surgical candidates is poor. Patients characterized as having "borderline resectable" disease treated with preoperative chemo-radiotherapy fair somewhat better - although many of these patients are not converted to resectability. It may be argued that intensification of local and regional therapy might 1.) Increase the share of patients able to undergo curative surgery and 2.) Improve the local disease control interval and extend survival for patients who remain unresectable. Therefore, the purpose of this research study is to determine if an increase in the number of surgical resection pancreatic adenocarcinoma is higher than historical data by using a combined treatment of proton radiation with capecitabine (oral chemotherapy).
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: Proton Radiation|DRUG: Capecitabine|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection
Overall survival at 12 months after radiation therapy, The trial is designed to allow detection of an improvement in the 12 month overall survival rate to 75% compared to the expected historical rate of 50%., Approximately 12 months after radiation therapy.
Surgical resection rate., Increase share of marginally resectable and unresectable patients being converted to resectable., 3 months following the completion of radiation therapy.
Participants as part of this research study will receive Proton radiation over 6 weeks with oral chemotherapy (capecitabine) only taken on radiation days.

In addition, If surgery is an option, then surgical resection will be performed at least 8 weeks after treatment with radiation and chemotherapy.
