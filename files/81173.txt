Establishment of a PDT Patient Registry
This is a non-intervention patient registry to gather data on the use of photodynamic therapy under real-life conditions. It will involve up to 20 sites in USA.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: No intervention
PDT Outcome, Collection of information on patient characteristics, disease sites, and utilization of prior or combined treatments to evaluate the impact of these parameters on the treatment outcome, Up to 5-year follow-up
The purpose of this patient registry is to collect information about a patient's cancer treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), used alone or in combination with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients will be registered either before or after PDT is performed, regardless of the indication. Analysis of this information may help to refine the treatment care. Data collected in the registry includes patient characteristics/demographics, disease characteristics, treatment details (photodynamic therapy, radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, etc.), side effects, and survival outcomes. By participating in this registry, patients will not be asked to do anything that would not ordinarily be done as a matter of routine care including clinical assessments, laboratory tests, radiology procedures, and treatments. Information on disease, condition, and treatment will be recorded in the registry during routine visits.
