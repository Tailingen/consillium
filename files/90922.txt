A Trial Using ctDNA Blood Tests to Detect Cancer Cells After Standard Treatment to Trigger Additional Treatment in Early Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
c-TRAK TN is a multi-centre phase II study, consisting of a circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) surveillance component and a therapeutic component. c-TRAK TN aims to assess whether ctDNA surveillance can be used to detect residual disease following patients standard primary treatment for triple negative breast cancer, and will assess the safety and activity of the investigational medicinal product pembrolizumab.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab

During the randomised component of the trial (prior to implementation of protocol v6.0 on 16 Sept 2020), patients would undergo serial ctDNA surveillance every 3 months from the point of registration and completion of primary treatment for their triple negative breast cancer. ctDNA surveillance was blinded and the detection of a ctDNA positive result on or before the 12 month ctDNA surveillance assessment triggered randomisation to treatment with pembrolizumab or observation (on a 2:1 ratio). The patient and their treating team were only informed of the randomisation if allocated treatment.

Patients without a positive ctDNA result within 12 months of starting ctDNA surveillance, continued to have blinded ctDNA surveillance every 3 months up to 2 years total.

Following the implementation of protocol v6.0 (16 Sept 2020), patients were asked to transfer to the non-randomised component of the trial, all patients who were previously randomised to observation and remain in active ctDNA surveillance would transition to the non-randomised component of the trial following re-consent, and allocated pembrolizumab at the next positive ctDNA result.

All patients will be followed up every 6 months until disease recurrence, specific withdrawal of consent for follow up, or until sponsor advises no further follow up is required.
