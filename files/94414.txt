Analysis of Pedicle Screw Accuracy to Plan Using Medtronic Mazor Robotic System
The purpose of the study is to assess screw deviation from pre-planned trajectory using the Mazor X robotic system in patients undergoing posterior thoracolumbar arthrodesis procedures between T2-S1.

DEVICE: Pedicle screw instrumentation using Mazor X robotic system
Total deviation (mm) from the pre-planned screw entry point, Total deviation (mm) from the pre-planned screw entry point includes: deviation in angle of insertion in the axial plane (degrees), and deviation in angle of insertion in the sagittal plane (degrees) from an O-arm spin after screw placement., study completion average 2years
Accuracy assessment for degree of pedicle breach, The secondary outcome will include traditional accuracy assessment for degree of pedicle breach utilizing the Gertzbein and Robbins classification system., 6 weeks post surgery
This trial will prospectively evaluate screw deviation from pre-planned trajectory using the standard of care Mazor X robotic system. Patients undergoing posterior thoracolumbar arthrodesis procedures utilizing pedicle screw instrumentation at previously uninstrumented levels for degenerative conditions, spinal deformity, spinal infection, trauma, or neoplastic processes between T2-S1 will be asked to participate in this prospective cohort study.

This single centered study will enroll up to 50 patients to achieve a total number of 250 screws for assessment. Subjects will be followed till discharge following surgery. All subjects enrolled in the study will be recruited from a pool of subjects eligible for posterior thoracolumbar arthrodesis surgery.
