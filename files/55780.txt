Phase I Study of MK-0683 in Combination With Bortezomib in Participants With Multiple Myeloma (MK-0683-098)
The primary purpose of this clinical study is to determine the recommended clinical doses of vorinostat (MK-0683) and bortezomib administered in combination to participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). It was hypothesized that administration of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib is sufficiently safe and tolerated well enough to permit further study in participants with relapsed and/or refractory MM. Study results are based on data collected up to the data cut-off date of 20-March-2011.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Bortezomib
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) During Cycle 1, The number of participants with ≥1 DLT during Cycle 1 is reported. A DLT is defined as an event considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment, and either: 1) a Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic event (except for manageable toxicity by supportive care or non-prohibited therapies, or a transient increase in alanine aminotransferase \[ALT\]/aspartate aminotransferase \[AST\]); or 2) a Grade 4 hematologic toxicity except neutropenia or hemoglobin decreased (neutropenia was a DLT if it was Grade 3-4 with fever ≥38.5°C; Grade 3-4 with an infection requiring antibiotic/antifungal therapy; or Grade 4 and lasting ≥5 days)., Up to 21 days
Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE), The number of participants with ≥1 AE is reported. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study product(s), whether or not considered related to the use of the product(s)., Up to 346 days (up to 30 days after the final dose of study treatment)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From 0 to 24 Hours Postdose (AUC0-24hr) of Vorinostat Administered With Bortezomib on Days 1 and 11, The AUC0-24hr of vorinostat in plasma on Days 1 and 11 is reported in participants who also received bortezomib., Predose and 0.8, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours postdose on Days 1 and 11
