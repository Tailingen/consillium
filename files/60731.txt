Effect on Tumor Perfusion of a Chemotherapy Combining Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) in Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease with conventional treatments having little impact on disease course. Novel approaches are urgently needed to address inherent resistance to the current therapies and to identify new drugs or combinations that will have a high chance of success in pancreatic cancer patients. This proof-of-concept trial is studying the "dynamic" tumor response after the administration of a short course of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) (a) during a window interval (4 weeks= 1 cycle) before surgery in resectable pancreatic cancer (cohort 1 = 21 patients) and (b) during at least 8 weeks (2 cycles) in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (cohort 2 = 10 patients).

Dynamic tumor response rate as defined by a 40% modification of tumoral perfusion and cellular density parameters., In order to detect changes in the tumor microenvironment and to monitor treatment efficacy, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) and Diffusion Weighted-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) constitute tools more and more used. The acquired data can be analyzed using a pharmacokinetic model to obtain quantitative parameters relative to tissue perfusion and vascular permeability (Ktrans, a volume transfer constant of contrast agent between blood plasma and the extravascular extracellular space; Apparent Coefficient Diffusion as a surrogate marker of tissue cellularity). DCE/DW-MRI will be achieved before each chemotherapy treatment (and also before surgery for resectable patients). Each patient will be his/her own control by comparing serial imaging results with those of the baseline MRI., 4 weeks (duration of 1 cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable patients); 8 weeks (duration of 2 cycles of treatment for locally advanced and metastatic patients)
Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) V4.0., Number of participants with (serious) adverse events will be considered as a measure of safety of the whole therapeutic sequence (gemcitabine+Abraxane+surgery for resectable patients; gemcitabine+Abraxane for locally advanced/metastatic patients), 12 months

Pancreatic cancer is a hypoperfused tumor, characterized by a high stroma density precluding cytotoxics delivery to the epithelial tumoral compartment. There is thus a rationale for combining chemotherapy and antistromal drugs like nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), a solvent (CremophorÂ® EL)-free, albumin-bound form of paclitaxel that has been initially developed to reduce the toxicities associated with Taxol injection while maintaining or improving its chemotherapeutic effect. This unique protein formulation provides a novel approach of increasing intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-mediated transport process allowing transcytosis across the endothelial cell.

Abraxane has been approved for commercialization in 38 countries, including the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, China, India and Korea for the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer. Abraxane alone and in combination is being evaluated in a number of cancers, including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors.
