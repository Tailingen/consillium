An Ultrasound Imaging Technique to Measure Tumors in People With Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or Gastrointestinal (GI) Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to see if ultrasound images that are analyzed by a special computer program can be used to measure the size of PDAC tumors in the liver as accurately as CT scans that involve contrast material (also called contrast-enhanced CT scans). All participants in this study will have pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that has spread (metastasized) to the liver, and all participants will be scheduled for a routine CT scan that will measure their cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ultrasound
measurement differences between ultrasound tumor volumes, Measure the range of volumetric changes of liver metastases observed between rUS1 and rUS2. We will correlate the rate (%) of tumor volumetric change between the rUS1 and rUS2 to the rate of change between the two CECT., 1 year
