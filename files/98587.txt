A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Atezolizumab in Combination With Obinutuzumab Plus Lenalidomide in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of induction treatment consisting of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab plus lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), followed by maintenance treatment with atezolizumab plus obinutzumab plus lenalidomide in patients who achieve a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease at end of induction.
Lymphoma, Follicular
DRUG: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) [TECENTRIQ]|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) at End of Induction (EOI), as Determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) Using Modified Lugano 2014 Criteria, Complete response (CR) was evaluated through use of PET-CT scans, using the Modified Lugano 2014 criteria. Response was determined by the IRC., 6 months (up to clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 23 October 2018)
Percentage of Participants Achieving CR at EOI, as Determined by the Investigator Using Modified Lugano 2014 Criteria, CR was evaluated through use of PET-CT scans, using the Modified Lugano 2014 criteria. Response was determined by the Investigator., 6 months (up to CCOD of 23 October 2018)|Percentage of Participants Achieving CR at EOI, as Determined by the IRC and Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria, CR was evaluated through use of CT scans, using the Lugano 2014 criteria. Response was determined by the IRC and by the Investigator., 6 months (up to CCOD of 23 October 2018)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (CR or PR) at EOI as Determined by the IRC and Investigator on the Basis of PET-CT Scans, Objective response was evaluated through use of PET-CT scans, using the Lugano 2014 or modified Lugano 2014 criteria. Response was determined by the IRC and by the Investigator., 6 months (up to CCOD of 23 October 2018)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (CR or PR) at EOI as Determined by the IRC and Investigator on the Basis of CT Scans Alone, Objective response was evaluated through use of CT scans alone, using the Lugano 2014. Response was determined by the IRC and by the Investigator., 6 months (up to CCOD of 23 October 2018)|Percentage of Participants With Best Response (CR or PR) During the Study as Determined by the Investigator on the Basis of CT Scans Alone, Best Response was evaluated through use of CT scans alone, using the Lugano 2014. Response was determined by the Investigator., 30 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During Cycle 2 of Study Treatment, Does limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any one of the following events occurring during Cycle 2 of treatment and assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment: - Adverse event of any grade that leads to a delay of more than 14 days at the start of the next treatment cycle; - Hematologic adverse events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia); - Non-hematologic adverse event, except IRRs, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, Day 1 - Day 28 of second cycle|Serum Concentration of Obinutuzumab (mcg/mL), The following abbreviations apply in the table: Ind C = Induction Cycle; D = Day; Maint M = Maintenance Month; TRTC = Study Drug Completion or Early Discontinuation; PK FU = Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Follow-up; YR = Year, Baseline up to approximately 59 months|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab (mcg/mL), The following abbreviations apply in the table: Ind C = Induction Cycle; D = Day; Maint M = Maintenance Month; TRTC = Study Drug Completion or Early Discontinuation; PK FU = Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Follow-up; YR = Year, Baseline up to approximately 59 months|Serum Concentration of Lenalidomide (ng/mL), The following abbreviations apply in the table: Ind C = Induction Cycle; D = Day; HR = Hour, Baseline up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants Positive for Human Anti-human Antibodies (HAHA) to Obinutuzumab, The following abbreviations apply in the table: Ind C = Induction Cycle; D = Day; Maint M = Maintenance Month; TRTC = Study Drug Completion or Early Discontinuation; PK FU = Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Follow-up; YR = Year. All baseline and post-baseline samples from participants were negative for HAHAs to obinutuzumab and the results are shown below., Baseline up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants Positive for Anti-therapeutic Antibodies (ATAs) to Atezolizumab, The following abbreviations apply in the table: Ind C = Induction Cycle; D = Day; Maint M = Maintenance Month; TRTC = Study Drug Completion or Early Discontinuation; PK FU = Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Follow-up; YR = Year. All baseline and post-baseline samples were negative for ATAs to atezolizumab and the results are shown below., Baseline up to approximately 59 months
