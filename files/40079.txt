A Clinical Trial of Esophagectomy for Esophageal Carcinoma
Brief Summary The pathological type of esophageal cancer (EC) in most patients in East Asia is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Surgery is the primary treatment for EC. This study compared the feasibility and safety of mediastinoscopic-assisted transhiatal laparoscopic esophagectomy (MATLE) with video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy (VATE).

Thirty-five eligible patients with ESCC were assigned to the MATLE group, while seventy matched patients were assigned to the VATE group. The study compared perioperative outcomes and lymph node dissection between the two groups. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier method was employed to estimate Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS).
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: mediastinoscopic-assisted transhiatal laparoscopic esophagectomy (MATLE)
Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS), Disease-free Survival (DFS) was calculated from the date of the operation to the date of tumor recurrence or the last follow-up. Overall Survival (OS) was calculated from the date of the operation to the date of death or the last follow-up. Follow-up was conducted via telephone or outpatient service., DFS : From date of surgery until the date of first documented progression , assessed up to 100 months; OS :From date of surgery until the date of death, assessed up to 100 months
