Evaluation of the Mixture Myoinositol:D-chiro-inositol 3.6:1 in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of increasing the proportion of D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in a combination with myo-inositol (MYO) in improving fertility in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Sixty women diagnosed with PCOS will randomly take twice a day for 12 weeks a capsule containing 550 mg of myo-inositol and 150 mg of D-chiro-inositol or capsules containing 550 mg of myo-inositol and 13.8 mg of D-chiro-inositol.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrinopathy in women of childbearing age. It affects 4-8% of the population and of them, approximately 74% present anovulatory cycles and, therefore, fertility problems.

Both myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are 2 natural substances that have been shown to improve ovarian function and metabolism in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.

The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of 2 ratios of myo-inositol /D-chiro-inositol on parameters related to the fertility of women with PCOS.

It is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week clinical trial which will be conducted in 13 public and private hospitals from Spain.
