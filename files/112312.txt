The GAstric Precancerous Conditions Study
Gastric cancer afflicts 27,000 Americans annually and carries a dismal prognosis. One reason for poor outcomes is late diagnosis, as the majority of gastric cancers in the United States are diagnosed at a relatively advanced stage where curative resection is unlikely. Gastric precursors (such as atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) are precancerous changes to the stomach mucosa which increases risk for subsequent gastric cancer.

The Gastric Precancerous Conditions Study (GAPS) is an observational study of patients at elevated risk for gastric cancer. Investigators seek to recruit patients from endoscopy unit of Stanford Health Care, a large academic network of hospitals and clinics serving Northern California. Investigators will recruit patients who are both symptomatic (e.g. dyspepsia) and asymptomatic (e.g. referred for screening), and individuals both with known precursor lesions (such as intestinal metaplasia) or at high risk for carrying precursor lesions. A component of the study is long-term follow-up of individuals with gastric precursors. This is to understand their risk factors for histologic progression and regression. During both index and subsequent endoscopies, the study team will collect biospecimens (e.g. blood, saliva, gastric tissue).
Gastric Cancer|Intestinal Metaplasia of Gastric Mucosa|Helicobacter Pylori Infection|Atrophic Gastritis
Histologic Progression or Regression Assessed by OLGA Score, Histologic progression or regression will be evaluated using the Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) score. This score stages the severity of atrophic gastritis based on histological findings., at least 24 months after enrollment|Histologic Progression or Regression Assessed by OLGIM Score, Histologic progression or regression will be assessed using the Operative Link on Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM) score. This score stages the extent of intestinal metaplasia., at least 24 months after enrollment|Development of Dysplasia, The presence or absence of dysplasia will be assessed as an indicator of histologic progression., at least 24 months after enrollment|Development of Carcinoma, The presence or absence of carcinoma will be assessed to evaluate disease progression., at least 24 months after enrollment
