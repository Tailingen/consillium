Surgery Following Immune Checkpoint Inhibitions for Controlled Disease in Recurrent or Metastatic dMMR/MSI-H Colorectal Cancer
Surgical resection for residual lesions could significantly improve the prognosis in metastatic colorectal cancers (CRCs) after systemic treatments, yet the necessity of resecting residual lesions after immune checkpoint inhibitions (ICIs) remains controversial in mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) diseases. We retrospectively enrolled recurrent or metastatic dMMR/MSI-H CRCs who received surgerys from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Patients without disease progression after at least 2 cycles of ICIs were included. Demographic and clinicopathological data were collected and analyzed. Relapse-free survival (RFS) after surgery were analyzed.
Colorectal Cancer
Disease-free Survival, defined as the time from randomization to the first appearance of one of the following: primary tumor recurrence, or death without cancer event; or censored at date of last follow-up, up to 5 years|Overall Survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Participants who were alive or lost to follow-up at the time of the analysis were censored at the date they were last known to be alive, up to 5 years
