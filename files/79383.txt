Biliary Metal Stent Study: Metal Stents for Management of Distal Malignant Biliary Obstruction
The primary purpose is to compare patency of two different types of biliary metal stents, i.e. covered versus uncovered Nitinella metal stent. Secondary purposes are to determine frequency of complications in the two groups, e.g. cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.

DEVICE: "Nitinella" ; SX-ELLA Stent Biliary (biliary metal stent)
Clinical follow-up every month, starting one month after stent insertion. Clinical and/or laboratory signs of stent dysfunction?, 12 months after stent insertion
