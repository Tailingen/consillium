A Study of Atezolizumab in Unresectable or Advaced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
This is a national, single arm, phase II trial in patients with diagnosis of unresectable or advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma who experienced progression after platinum-based chemotherapy.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, Advanced|Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, Unresectable
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Objective Response Rate, The number of subjects whose best confirmed objective response is a CR or PR, divided by the number of treated subjects, From the time of initial response until documented tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)
Progression-free survival, The time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined by RECIST v 1.1, or death, whichever occurs first, Baseline up to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)|Duration of response, The time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression as determined by RECIST v1.1, Baseline up to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)|Overall survival, The time from the date of the start of treatment until death from any cause, Baseline up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation|Safety of atezolizumab, The incidence of treatment-related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Baseline up to 60 days after the last dose of the study drug or until another oncologic treatment is initiated, whichever occurs first|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Scores, Change from Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Scores as Measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Baseline until 1 year after treatment discontinuation or death, whichever occurs first|Patient Functioning and Symptoms Score, Change from Baseline in Patient Functioning and Symptoms Score as Measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module LC-13 (QLQ-LC13), Baseline until 1 year after treatment discontinuation or death, whichever occurs first
The study includes a screening period a treatment period, a termination treatment visit ≤30 days following the last dose of the study drug, and a follow-up period. Day 1 is defined as the first day in which patients receive atezolizumab. The study is expected to enroll 36 patients.

Enrolled patients will receive a fixed dose of atezolizumab 1200 mg administered intravenously the first day of each cycle. A treatment cycle will last 21 days (± 3 days). Treatment with atezolizumab will continue until investigator-assessed loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, investigator or participant's decision to withdraw from therapy, or death (whichever occurs first).

Treatment with atezolizumab may continue while patients experience clinical benefit based on the investigator's assessment (absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributable to disease progression, at the discretion of the investigator after evaluating radiographic data, biopsy results \[if available\], and clinical status), or until unacceptable toxicity or death.

During treatment, patients treated with atezolizumab, who demonstrate evidence of clinical benefit may continue treatment with atezolizumab after meeting disease progression criteria, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The following need to be met, as specified by the protocol.

All patients must undergo tumor assessments at baseline and every 9 weeks (± 7 days) following cycle 1, day 1, regardless of treatment delays, until radiographic disease progression, as per RECIST v1.1 modified for mesothelioma, or loss of clinical benefit in patients treated with atezolizumab, who continue treatment beyond disease progression, as per RECIST v1.1, withdrawal of consent, death or study termination by principal investigator, whichever occurs first.

The study will end if all enrolled patients die, withdraw their consent, become lost to follow-up, or have been monitored during 12 months from the enrollment of the last patient, whichever occurs first.
