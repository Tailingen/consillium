The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the outcome of two treatment approaches (immediate surgery or close follow-up) in patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mPTc) .

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the outcome of two treatment approaches (immediate surgery or close follow-up) in patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mPTc) .

A further objective is to identify events associated with high risk of local recurrence and distant metastases.

Patients will be randomized to surgery or active surveillance. Patients who refuse the randomization process will be followed according to the treatment choice according to clinical practice.
