Safety and Tolerability of Recombinant Humanized Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Toripalimab for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a mono-center, open-label, phase 1 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma or urological cancers who have failed in routine systemic treatment. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and cohort expansion to investigate tolerability and efficacy.

This is a mono-center, open-label, phase 1 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumor (melanoma or urological cancers) who have failed in previous routine systemic treatment. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and cohort expansion. In the first part, nine patients are injected with different dosage of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody (1mg/kg or 3mg/kg or 10mg/mg, three patients in one group ) once and observed carefully in the following 4 weeks. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs, then they are injected every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. This part is to confirm DLT, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). In the second part, 6-12 patients are enrolled in each dosage group and injected with the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. This part is to further analyze safety and efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody.
