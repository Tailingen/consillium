68Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI04 PET/CT in Patients With Various Types of Cancer
As a novel radiotracer targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP), 68Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI04 is a novel agent incorporating a hypoxia sensitive nitroimidazole(NI)-moiety and a FAP-targeting. In this study, we observed the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI04 PET/CT in patients with different types of cancer, and compared its imaging results with those of 68Ga-FAPI or 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an integral part of the tumor microenvironment, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), as a specific marker of CAFs, is overexpressed in more than 90% of epithelial malignant tumors' CAFs, with limited expression in normal tissues, making it an appropriate target for various tumors. Currently, several tracers targeting FAP for diagnostic purposes have been developed, such as 68Ga-FAPI-04, 68Ga-FAPI-02, showing high efficacy in tumor staging and restaging. As a novel radiotracer targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP), 68Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI04 is a novel agent incorporating a hypoxia sensitive nitroimidazole(NI)-moiety and a FAP-targeting. In this study, we observed the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI04 PET/CT in patients with different types of cancer, and compared its imaging results with those of 68Ga-FAPI or 18F-FDG PET/CT.
