Investigation of the Value of ctDNA in Diagnosis, Treatment, and Surveillance of Surgically Resectable Colorectal Cancer
In this study, we aim to investigate the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis in the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of patients with surgically resectable colorectal cancer, by performing serial analysis of ctDNA, next-generation sequencing of surgical specimens, and observation of patients undergoing radical resection of the tumor with or without adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy.

A prospective, observational study to determine the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for predicting the therapeutic effects of the combined modality treatment for colorectal cancer and the patients' long-term prognosis.

Research objects: patients with surgically resectable colorectal cancer. After giving fully informed consent, the prospective participants will undergo the classical combined modality treatment according to NCCN guidelines. Serial analysis of ctDNA will be performed at specific time points including pre-treatment, (post-NCRT for NCRT patients), postoperative week 1, post-ACT, postoperative year 1, 2, and 3. The next-generation sequencing of surgical specimens will be performed as well. Participants will be observed and examined during the entire course of treatment and the follow-up period. The 3 year disease free survival (3y-DFS) will be the primary end-point.
