Research for Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma With Autologous Heat Shock Protein gp96
RATIONALE: heat shock protein gp96-peptide complex made from a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This trial is studying the safety and effectiveness of autologous gp96 treatment of glioblastoma and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed supratentoria glioma.
