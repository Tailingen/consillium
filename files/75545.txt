Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Leuprolide
Number of Participants With Eligard Related Adverse Events (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug or had undergone study procedures that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE was considered to be serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it resulted in any of the following outcomes: resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization, other medically important events. Drug-related AEs are AEs where causal relationships were at least a reasonable possibility as determined by the investigator., From first dose of study drug up to 18 months
Percentage of Participants With Testosterone Levels Less Than (<) 20, 20-50 and Greater Than (>) 50 Nanogram Per Deciliter (ng/dL) at Month 12, Testosterone level was summarized based on the percentage of participants with \< 20 ng/dL, 20 to 50 ng/dL and \> 50 ng/dL., Month 12|Percentage of Participants With Testosterone Levels < 20, 20-50 and > 50 ng/dL at Month 18, Testosterone level was summarized based on the percentage of participants with \< 20 ng/dL, 20 to 50 ng/dL and \> 50 ng/dL., Month 18|Time to PSA Progression, Time to PSA progression was defined as (date of ≥25 percentage (%) increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL absolute increase) - (date of first administration of ELIGARD 22.5 mg)/30, where PSA progression was defiined as 25% or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL, and confirmed by a second value at least 3 weeks later. Participants with more than 1 qualifying PSA progression were counted only once, and the earlier progression was accounted for time to progression analysis., From first dose of study drug up to PSA progression (18 months)|Percentage of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to (≥) 30% PSA Percent Reduction From Baseline at Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, PSA percent reduction (%) = (\[PSA tested- baseline PSA\]/baseline PSA)\*100%. PSA level was summarized based on time to PSA progression and PSA percent reduction by ≥ 30% with respect to the level at baseline. Participants with more than 1 qualifying PSA progression were counted only once, and the earlier progression was accounted for time to progression analysis. PSA progression was defined as 25% or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL), and confirmed by a second value at least 3 weeks later., Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18|Percentage of Participants With ≥50% PSA Percent Reduction From Baseline at Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, PSA percent reduction (%) = (\[PSA tested- baseline PSA\]/baseline PSA)\*100%. PSA level was summarized based on time to PSA progression and PSA percent reduction by ≥ 50% with respect to the level at baseline. Participants with more than 1 qualifying PSA progression were counted only once, and the earlier progression was accounted for time to progression analysis. PSA progression was defined as 25% or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL, and confirmed by a second value at least 3 weeks later., Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18|Percentage of Participants With ≥90% PSA Percent Reduction From Baseline at Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, PSA percent reduction (%) = (\[PSA tested- baseline PSA\]/baseline PSA)\*100%. PSA level was summarized based on time to PSA progression and PSA percent reduction by ≥ 90%, with respect to the level at baseline. Participants with more than 1 qualifying PSA progression were counted only once, and the earlier progression was accounted for time to progression analysis. PSA progression was defined as 25% or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL, and confirmed by a second value at least 3 weeks later., Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Health State Utility Index Score (Japan) at Months 6, 12 and 18, EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents and consists of 2 pages comprising the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension of the EQ-5D-5L has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) and the participant was asked to indicate his health state by ticking the box with the most appropriate statement. Index scores were generated using Japan value sets. Scores ranged from -0.111 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health state., Baseline, months 6, 12 and 18|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Health Status Utility Index Score (UK) at Months 6, 12 and 18, EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents and consists of 2 pages comprising the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension of the EQ-5D-5L has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) and the participant was asked to indicate his health state by ticking the box with the most appropriate statement. Index scores were generated using UK value sets. Scores ranged from -0.594 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health state., Baseline, months 6, 12 and 18|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Health Status Utility Index Score (US) at Months 6, 12 and 18, EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents and consists of 2 pages comprising the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension of the EQ-5D-5L has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) and the participants was asked to indicate his health state by ticking the box with the most appropriate statement. Index scores were generated using US value sets. Scores ranged from -0.109 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health state., Baseline, months 6, 12 and 18|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D02-EQ-VAS Score at Months 6, 12 and 18, The EQ5D02-EQ-VAS is a vertical VAS with values between 0 (worst imaginable health) and 100 (best imaginable health), on which participants provide a global assessment of their health. Higher score indicate better health state., Baseline, months 6, 12 and 18|Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-PR25 Score at Months 6, 12 and 18, EORTC QLQ-PR25 is a prostate cancer module for the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). EORTC QLQ-PR25 is designed for self-completion by respondents and assesses urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, treatment-related symptoms and sexual activity and functioning. The rule of scoring for EORTC QLQ-PR25 follows instruction of EORTC QLQ-PR25 Scoring Manual 2.0. It consist of 25 questions distributed on 6 domains: urinary symptoms (8 items), incontinence aid (1 item), bowel symptoms (4 items), hormonal treatment-related symptoms (HTRS) (6 items), sexual activity (2 items), and sexual functioning (4 items). Questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). All raw domain scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual)., Baseline, months 6, 12 and 18
