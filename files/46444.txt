Examining the Risk of Skin Cancer in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Using Fingolimod: a Population-Based Study
The goal of this retrospective observational study is to investigate the long-term safety of Fingolimod in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), specifically focusing on the risk of developing skin cancer. The main question it aims to answer is:

• Does the use of Fingolimod increase the incidence of skin cancer in individuals with MS compared to those using other disease-modifying therapies? Participants who are new users of Fingolimod or other active comparators as part of their regular medical care for MS will be included in this study. Researchers will use advanced causal inference techniques to analyze healthcare data and compare the incidence of skin cancer between these groups.

Number of participants who developed skin cancer, In this outcome measure, participants who developed skin cancer after receiving the respective DMT treatments are reported. ICD 9/10 codes were used for the diagnosis of skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers). Skin cancers were treated as a composite outcome of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma, as well as disaggregated by skin cancer subtypes., From Index drug dispensation to the first of the following events, whichever occurred first: development of skin cancer; lost to follow-up; death; administrative end of follow-up; initiation of a comparator drug, assessed up to 180 months.|Time to development of skin cancer, Time to development of skin cancer is defined as the time from the index date (drug initiation) to the development of skin cancer. ICD 9/10 codes were used for the diagnosis of skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers). Skin cancers were treated as a composite outcome of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma, as well as disaggregated by skin cancer subtypes., From Index drug dispensation to the first of the following events, whichever occurred first: development of skin cancer; lost to follow-up; death; administrative end of follow-up; initiation of a comparator drug, assessed up to 180 months.
