Using High Resolution Function Imaging To Detect Melanoma and Dysplastic Nevi
A novel infrared imaging tool to aid in the clinical detection of atypical pigmented lesions and melanoma is developed. Goals include evaluation of the utility of high-resolution infrared scanning of cutaneous lesions in the diagnosis of pigmented lesions and the identification of high-risk lesions and melanomas.
Melanoma
Ability to Detect of the melanoma lesions, Using activated cooling methods we are measuring skin surface temperature recovery of specific lesions and comparing them to biopsy results of the lesions in question., up to 2 years
Measurement of thermal signatures of benign cutaneous lesions, up to 2 years
This study uses a specific skin protocol to cool the skin and then measures the cutaneous thermal recovery to uniquely identify lesions that may be cancerous. Using computer models, the thermal signature is used to determine the size and shape of the lesions in question. In particular, this study seeks to add quantification analysis of high resolution thermal images of melanoma lesions to provide accurate early diagnostic capability with specific detail regarding size, shape and depth of the lesions. This information will be compared to biopsy results and surgical resection results.
