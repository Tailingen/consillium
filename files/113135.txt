Real-world Study of Taletrectinib for Advanced ROS1+ NSCLC With Brain Metastases
This is a multicenter, non-interventional, observational real-world study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Taletrectinib in ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases. Patients deemed eligible for Taletrectinib by their physicians were enrolled after providing informed consent. Taletrectinib will be administered according to clinical practice and data on treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and safety will be collected during routine evaluations.
