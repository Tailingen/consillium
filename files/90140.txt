A Phase II Study of Anti-EGFR Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC) Combine With CDK4/6 Inhibitors Posterior Line in the Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic CDKN2A Gene Variant Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
A Single-arm, Phase II Study of MRG003 combined with Dalpicicilip posterior line in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic CDKN2A gene variant head and neck squamous cell carcinoman (HNSCC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRG003 combined with the Dalpicicilip posterior line in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic CDKN2A gene variant HNSCC.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: MRG003 combined with Dalpicicilip
ORR, Objective response rate, approximately 9-10 weeks after start of study treatment|Safety and Tolerability, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, approximately 9-10 weeks after start of study treatment
OS, overall survival, 2 years|PFS, Progression Free Survival, 1-2years|DOR, Duration of response, 1-2years|DCR, Disease control rates, 2 years
In this study, patients meeting the inclusion criteria were given MRG003 (D1, IVGTT, Q3W) in combination with Darcilil (D1-21, PO, Q4W) after completing the relevant pre-treatment examination until progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. Objective response rate and safety will be the primary outcome measures. Adverse events will also be recorded.
