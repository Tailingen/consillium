An Efficacy and Safety Study of Intravenous Palonosetron Administered as an Infusion and as a Bolus for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting
PALO-15-17 is a clinical study assessing efficacy and safety of a single dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 30-minute IV infusion compared to palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 30-second IV bolus (Aloxi, an antiemetic drug), both given with oral dexamethasone. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that infused IV palonosetron 0.25 mg is as effective as (non-inferior to) injected palonosetron IV 0.25 mg to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in the 0-24 hours after administration of a single cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy
