Aromatherapy for Chemotherapy-induced Symptoms
The rationale behind the proposed study is to determine the initial effectiveness of aromatherapy in relief of commonly reported symptoms in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy Symptoms
DRUG: Ginger|DRUG: Lavender|DRUG: Orange|DRUG: Jojoba
Mean change in severity in symptoms, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks
change in mean peak severity for nausea across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|change in mean peak severity for vomiting across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|change in mean peak severity for anxiety/distress across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|change in mean peak severity for pain across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|change in mean peak severity for fatigue across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|change in mean peak severity for sleep difficulties across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|change in mean peak severity for lack of appetite across all three cycles, Subjects will complete a self-report Symptom Inventory Diary during each Study Cycle starting at Day 0 and continuing to Day 6. Subjects will rate the severity of seven symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety/distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) using a 0-10 numeric rating scale, with 10 indicating a higher severity, in daily diary format., up to 11 weeks|the number of participants who found the aromatherapy acceptable, The following questions will be asked of the subjects to obtain qualitative feedback to further evaluate acceptability of the aromatherapy inhalers: 1) What two things did you like about your aromatherapy inhaler?; 2) What two things did subjects dislike about the aromatherapy inhaler?; 3) Was the aromatherapy inhaler easy to use?; 4) Did subjects feel that the aromatherapy inhaler reduced symptoms from chemotherapy? Please circle the symptoms that seemed to be helped the most.; 5) Would the subject use this aromatherapy inhaler again in the future?; 6) Would the subject recommend this aromatherapy inhaler to others?; 7) What word or statement would the subject use to describe their experience during this clinical trial?; and 8) What intervention arm do subjects think they were in? All of these data will help determine if the aromatherapy inhalers and scents are acceptable and feasible to use for in cancer subjects during chemotherapy., up to 11 weeks
The proposed study is an exploratory trial to evaluate the use of aromatherapy for symptom management in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The investigators will accrue 120 adult cancer subjects undergoing chemotherapy in a initial efficacy study to determine the effectiveness of three different aromatherapies (ginger, lavender, or orange) on chemotherapy-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety, sleep difficulties, fatigue, and lack of appetite) compared to placebo (i.e., jojoba). All subjects will be randomized to one of the four arms for symptom management during three different chemotherapy cycles. The investigators will examine the incidence and severity of the seven symptoms at each chemotherapy cycle. The preliminary data from this study will elucidate the relationships between certain aromatherapies and specific symptom relief, which can be further evaluated in a larger confirmatory study of subjects undergoing chemotherapy or other types of cancer treatment. This study will provide clinical evidence regarding the incorporation of aromatherapy into cancer patient care.
