Efficacy and Safety of LY01005 in Patients With Prostate Cancer Compared to ZOLADEX®
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled phase Ⅲ trial to compare efficacy and safety of Goserelin Acetate Sustained-Release Microspheres for Injection (LY01005) and ZOLADEX® in patients with prostate cancer.

This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled phase Ⅲ trial using non-inferior design. A total of 290 patients with prostate cancer who were suitable for endocrine therapy were enrolled into the screening period from D-21 to D-10 before administration. Eligible subjects were treated with bicalutamide tablets (Casodex®, 50 mg/day) from D-10 (± 3d) before administration and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive LY01005 3.6 mg or ZOLADEX® 3.6 mg after completion of pretreatment. All subjects were administered once every 28 days for three doses until intolerable toxicity, disease progression requiring other anti-tumor treatments, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death or the end of the whole study. Blood samples were collected at the specified time points of the screening period, before/behind each dose to detect serum testosterone, LH, FSH and PSA. Safety evaluation (including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, 12 ECG, adverse events, etc.) was conducted as required in the protocol.
