Study for Safety and Efficacy of Olverembatinib Combined With APG-2575 in Children With Relapsed/Refractory Ph + ALL
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study, which is designed to explore the safety, efficacy and PK of olverembatinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) marketed in China, in combination with APG-2575 in treating R/R Ph+ALL children, and to preliminarily establish the recommended dose of olverembatinib and APG-2575 for children based on the above results.
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute, Childhood|Leukemia, Lymphoblastic, Acute, Philadelphia-Positive|Relapsed Leukemia|Refractory Leukemia
DRUG: Olverembatinib, APG-2575, Dexamethasone
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT evaluation is defined as adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that occur within 6 weeks after investigational drug administration, are unrelated to external causes such as progressive disease, concomitant disease, and concomitant medications, including hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (grade according to NCI CTCAE 5.0)., 42 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined by Complete Remission (CR)+ CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) + Partial Remission (PR).Response will be evaluated every period till complete treatment and three months after last dose., 132 days|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed on all participants of each dose group on the first day of olverembatinib monotherapy in period 1, and on the first and last days of olverembatinib in combination with APG-2575 in period 2 ., 42 days|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be assessed on all participantsof each dose group on the first day of olverembatinib monotherapy in period 1, and on the first and last days of olverembatinib in combination with APG-2575 in period 2 ., 42 days|R2PD of Olverembatinib and APG-2575, To confirm the recommended doses of olverembatinib and APG-2575 in children with Ph+ ALL, 42 days
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate, To observe the proportion of subjects with MRD negative status in bone marrow., 132 days
Eligible patients will receive a 6-week core treatment after screening, including a 2-week olverembatinib monotherapy and a 4-week combination therapy with olverembatinib, APG-2575 and dexamethasone, and based on the remission of leukemia after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment, these patients will either continue olverembatinib alone/in combination with APG-2575 and dexamethasone as maintenance therapy or switch to other anti-tumor therapy.

Toxicities of this study will be graded according to NCI CTCAT (Version 5.0). The investigator will interrupt, reduce or discontinue the dose of the investigational drug according to the correlation and grade of toxicities. The study drug can be resumed when the drug related toxicities resolve to grade 1 or below.
