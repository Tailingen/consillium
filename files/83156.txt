Mapping 3D Bladder
This is a single centre, single arm feasibility study assessing the feasibility of using computer vision methods to recreate the 3D bladder shape and to then map the cystoscopy images onto this bladder shape. If feasible, this 3D reconstructed shape would be spatially registered to radiological images (CT, MR) that are then used during radiation treatment planning. This analysis would not be used for making any clinical treatment decisions on the patient.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy
Video recording of Cystoscopy, To determine the feasibility of using bladder endoscopic video images to reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of the bladder based on computer visions methods that employ feature extraction and triangulation and to map the endoscopy images onto the recreated 3D surface., At study completion, up to 2 years|Contouring of 3D bladder rendering, To determine the feasibility of contouring the mucosal disease on the 3D bladder rendering., At study completion, up to 2 years|Registering bladder shape, To determine the feasibility of registering the bladder shape to a CT/MR scan of the patient using deformable shape methods., At study completion, up to 2 years
