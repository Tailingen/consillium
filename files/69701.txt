Recurrent Lymphoma|Refractory Lymphoma|Solid Tumours|Central Nervous System
DRUG: Vinblastine|DRUG: Temsirolimus
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of vinblastine and temsirolimus (administered as a weekly intravenous dose) in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumours including central nervous system (CNS) tumours and lymphoma and to describe the associated toxicities in children, 4 years
Vinblastine is already approved in the treatment of some types of cancer in children and temsirolimus is already used to treat some adult cancers in Canada. Temsirolimus has been shown to slow the growth of tumours in animals but it is not known if it can also slow tumour growth in children. Laboratory studies suggest that giving both vinblastine and temsirolimus may offer better results than giving vinblastine alone.
