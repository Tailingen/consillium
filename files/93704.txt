Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of ICP-723 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
During this study, dose escalation will be conducted in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have experienced treatment failure after clinical standard of care treatments or who currently have no effective treatment available to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ICP-723
