Trial of Neoadjuvant Enoblituzumab vs SOC in Men With High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer
This study evaluates the efficacy, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant enoblituzumab given before radical prostatectomy. Patients will be randomized to enoblituzumab for a total of 12 weeks beginning 84 days before radical prostatectomy or standard of care arms.

Gleason grade groups are defined as grade group 1 (Gleason score ≤ 6), grade group 2 (Gleason score 3+4=7), grade group 3 (Gleason score 4+3=7), grade group 4 (Gleason score 8), and grade group 5 (Gleason scores 9-10).The lower the grade group, the better the outcome., Baseline and Day 84|Pathological complete responses (pCR), Number of participants who achieve pCR, defined as absence of tumor identification on standard histological analysis of resected prostate specimens., Day 84
Quality of life assessment, Will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) - Prostate (Appendix F), FACT - Cognitive, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue. Fatigue instruments at baseline and 6 months, and descriptive statistics will be used to characterize quality of life over time in each arm. Each item is answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale, where a value of 0 indicates the statement is not applicable, and a value of 5 indicates the statement is applicable to the respondent. Subgroup analysis will be performed among patients who receive adjuvant radiation therapy and patients who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy in each arm. Mixed effect models will be constructed as an exploratory analysis to estimate the time profile of quality of life assessments in the two arms and to evaluate treatment-by-time interactions., 6 months from randomization|Quantify B7-H3 IHC expression, Number of participants with B7-H3 IHC expression in pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor tissue and correlation with tumor cell apoptosis and time to recurrence., 5 years post-prostatectomy|Quantify checkpoint IHC expression, Number of participants with checkpoint IHC expression (eg, PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3, and TIM3) in individual patient's pre and post treatment tumor tissue, and among all patient tumor tissue treated with enoblituzumab versus standard of care., Day 84|FC Receptor Genotyping, Number of participants with CD16A, CD32A, and CD32B on Fc receptor., Day 84|cfDNA, ctDNA, and tumor vesicle associated DNA/RNA prevalence, Number of participants with cfDNA, ctDNA, and tumor vesicle associated DNA/RNA biomarker., Day 84|IHC Analyses of CD137, CD16 and/or CD107A, CD137, CD107A, and CD16 expression in prostate tumor specimens will be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the prostatectomy surgical specimens (post-treatment).

This is a multi-center, randomized, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant enoblituzumab given prior to radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. Patients will be recruited from the outpatient Urology clinics and Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer ("Precision Medicine") Clinics at four participating institutions including: Harvard/Dana-Farber Cancer Centers, Northwestern Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center. Eligible patients will undergo a pre-treatment prostate biopsy and conventional imaging (CT and bone scan) as well as PSMA-PET and optional prostate MRI as per institutional preferences. Patients who have N0 M0 disease by conventional imaging (N1 by PSMA allowed with up to 3 LNs each ≤1 cm) will be trial eligible as long as concurrent hormonal or radiation therapy is not given. Patients will then be randomized to enoblituzumab for a total of 12 weeks beginning 84 days prior to radical prostatectomy or SOC arms. Fourteen days after the last treatment, prostate glands will be harvested at radical prostatectomy, and prostate tissue will be examined for pathologic response and secondary pharmacodynamic/immunologic endpoints as described herein. Pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment biomarkers of response and resistance will be collected including: plasma, PBMC. Repeat PSMA scan will be obtained prior to radical prostatectomy. Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30 and 90 days after surgery. Patients will then be followed by the patient's urologists/oncologists according to standard institutional practices but will require PSA evaluations every 3 (±1) months during year 1 and every 6 (±2) months during years 2-3.
