Multi-center, Open-label, Phase 1b Study in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
Primary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of isatuximab administered subcutaneously (SC) versus intravenously (IV)
* To assess the safety and tolerability (including local injection site tolerability) of isatuximab using the (investigational) isatuximab injector device
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC and IV isatuximab

Secondary Objectives:

* To estimate absolute bioavailability of SC and IV isatuximab
* To measure receptor occupancy (RO) after isatuximab SC versus IV administration
* To assess efficacy of isatuximab after SC and IV administration
* To assess patient expectations prior to and patient experience and satisfaction after SC administration
* To evaluate potential immunogenicity of SC or IV isatuximab

DRUG: isatuximab SAR650984 IV|DRUG: pomalidomide|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: isatuximab SAR650984 SC|DEVICE: Investigational injector device
Assessment of adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with adverse events, Baseline to 30 days after last study treatment administration (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment: Ceoi, Concentration observed at the end of infusion (Ceoi), Baseline to end of treatment (EOT) after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: Cmax, Maximum concentration observed after the first infusion (Cmax), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: tmax, Time to reach Cmax (tmax), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: Clast, Last concentration observed above the lower limit of quantification after the first infusion (Clast), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: tlast, Time of Clast (tlast), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: Ctrough, Concentration observed just before treatment administration during repeated dosing (Ctrough), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: AUClast, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve calculated using the trapezoidal method from time zero to time of the last concentration observed above the lower limit of quantification (ie, Clast) (AUClast), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|PK assessment: AUC0 T, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve calculated over the dosing interval T (168h or 336h) (AUC0 T), Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)
Estimation of absolute bioavailability of isatuximab, Absolute bioavailability of isatuximab SC, expressed as a percentage, estimated from AUC0-168h obtained after intravenous (IV) and extravascular (EV) administration, Day 8|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) using the IMWG response criteria, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Duration of response (DOR), Time from the date of the first response to the date of first progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever happens first, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Time to response (TTR), Time from the date of first study treatment to the first response, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Time to progression (TTP), Time from date of first study treatment to date of first documentation of progressive disease, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of first study treatment to date of death from any cause, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Proportion of patients with sCR, CR, VGPR, PR or minimal response (MR) according to IMWG criteria, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Progression free survival (PFS), Time from date of first study treatment to date of first documentation of progressive disease or death, From day -21 to day 60 after last study treatment (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Comparison of patient expectations and satisfaction: Patient Expectations and Satisfaction Questionnaires, Comparison of patient expectations and satisfaction will be assessed using Patient Expectations and Satisfaction Questionnaires before and after subcutaneous (SC) administration, where a score of 1 = not satisfied and a score of 5 = extremely satisfied, Cycles 1 and 2 (28 days per Cycle), and 30 days after last isatuximab administration (up to approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration)|Immunogenicity: Anti drug antibody levels, Incidence of patients with anti drug antibodies against isatuximab, Baseline to EOT after isatuximab SC and to Cycle 10 after IV (28 days per Cycle)|Biomarker: Change in CD38 receptor occupancy, Change in CD38 receptor occupancy from baseline, At screening and at Day 1 of Cycle 2 (28 days per Cycle) (predose); to be stopped once the isatuximab SC dose has been selected.
Total study duration is variable depending on treatment and follow-up periods, including 21 days of screening, and treatment period until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction or other reason for discontinuation. End of treatment will be 30 days after last administration of investigational medicinal product, or before further anti-myeloma therapy, whichever comes first; approximately 14 months after first study treatment administration.
