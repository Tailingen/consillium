A Phase 3 Comparative Study of TAP-144-SR(6M) in Postoperative and Hormone Therapy-naïve Patients With Premenopausal Breast Cancer
Hormone dynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of TAP-144-SR(6M) will be evaluated against TAP-144-SR(3M) in postoperative and hormone therapy-naïve patients with premenopausal breast cancer
Premenopausal Breast Cancer
DRUG: TAP-144-SR(6M)|DRUG: TAP-144-SR(3M)
Percentage of Participants With Suppressive Effect of Serum Estradiol (E2) to Menopausal Level (=<30 pg/mL) From Week 4 Through Week 48, Comparison of both the treatment groups was done by assessing the suppressive effect on serum E2 concentration maintained at menopausal level (=\<30pg/mL). Suppression rate was calculated as proportion of participants maintained at menopausal level., Week 4 up to Week 48
Concentration of Serum E2, The measure indicates serum E2 concentration at baseline and post-baseline time points., Baseline, Hour (hr) 1, 3, 6 on Day 1, Day 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 176, 183, 197, 225, 253, 281, 309, 337, 421, 505, 589 and 673|Concentration of Serum Luteinizing Hormone (LH), This measure indicates serum LH concentration at baseline and post-baseline time points. It was measured in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL)., Baseline, Hour 1, 3, 6 on Day 1, Day 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 176, 183, 197, 225, 253, 281, 309, 337, 421, 505, 589 and 673|Concentration of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), This measure indicates serum FSH concentration at baseline and post-baseline time points., Baseline, Hour 1, 3, 6 on Day 1, Day 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 176, 183, 197, 225, 253, 281, 309, 337, 421, 505, 589 and 673|Disease Free Survival (DFS) Rate at Week 96, DFS is defined as time from randomization to earliest day of onset the events, recurrence \[including recurrence in the ipsilateral breast\], secondary cancer \[including breast cancer in the contralateral breast\] and death. DFS at Week 96 was defined as the percentage, calculated with Kaplan-Meier method, of participants did not experience any events at Week 96 since the randomization., Week 96|Distant Disease Free Survival (DDFS) Rate at Week 96, DDFS is defined as time from randomization to earliest day of onset the events, distant recurrence, secondary cancer \[including breast cancer in the contralateral breast\] and death. DDFS at week 96 was defined as the percentage calculated with Kaplan-Meier method, of participants did not experience any events at week 96 since the randomization., Week 96|Serum Unchanged TAP-144 Level, This measure indicates the unchanged TAP-144 level in serum., Baseline, Hour 1, 3, 6 on Day 1, Day 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 176, 183, 197, 225, 253, 281, 309 and 337|QT Interval Measured by 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), 12-lead electrocardiography measurement was performed in supine position after 5 minutes at rest. Each measurement was recorded continuously for 10 seconds at the recording speed of 25 millimeter/second (mm/second)., Baseline, Hour 1, 3, 6 on Day 1, Day 29, 85, 169 and 337
Hormone dynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of TAP-144-SR(6M) will be evaluated against TAP-144-SR(3M) in postoperative and hormone therapy-naïve patients with premenopausal breast cancer
