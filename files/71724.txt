A Phase I Study, Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of PRJ1-3024 in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, 3+3 dose escalation study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of PRJ1-3024 in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: PRJ1-3024
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events during the DLT monitoring period, Safety listings and pharmacokinetic listings will be used for evaluation, Day 1 to Day 21
Incidence of adverse events (AEs), Characterized by type, seriousness, relationship to study treatment, timing, and severity., 24 months|Pharmacokinetic parameter： Accumulation ratio, to estimate the accumulation of PRJ1-3024 from time 0 to the time of last quantifiable concentration after multiple administration, 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), estimated by the proportion of subjects having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) with use of RECIST v1.1 criteria., 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), defined as time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of relapse or death from any cause., 24 months|Pharmacokinetic parameter：AUC（0-last）, Area under the concentration-time curve AUC from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, 24 months|Pharmacokinetic parameter：Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), assessed as time from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, 24 months
The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of PRJ1-3024 and will determine the maximum tolerated dose in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

PRJ1-3024 will be evaluated as an oral therapeutic that tests the anti-tumor activity of PRJ1-3024 in patients with solid tumors and has not yet been tested in humans.

This study will find the safe and tolerable recommended dose in subjects with advanced solid tumors as a open-label, 3+3 dose escalation study.
