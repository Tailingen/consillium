QUILT-3.057: NANT Neoadjuvant Triple- Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Vaccine
This is a randomized open-label phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety (as assessed by pCR) of the NANT Neoadjuvant TNBC Vaccine regimen (experimental arm) compared to the SoC dose-dense regimen of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (control arm).

Treatment will be administered in 2 phases, a neoadjuvant phase and a postoperative phase. The neoadjuvant phase will be 18 weeks for patients enrolled in the experimental arm and 16 weeks for those enrolled in the control arm.

Following the neoadjuvant phase, all subjects will undergo determination of their current response status and appropriate breast surgery and node dissection after which assessment for pCR will be conducted following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Pathologists interpreting surgical specimens for pCR assessment will be blinded to the treatment arm.

All subjects, regardless of whether or not they have achieved a pCR, will then enter the postoperative phase where they will receive adjuvant treatment. A small portion of the corresponding neoadjuvant therapy, either nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel, will be administered as adjuvant treatment postoperatively. Adjuvant treatment will continue in the postoperative phase until the subject experiences unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
