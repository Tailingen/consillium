AZA Combined with R-GemOx for Elderly DLBCL Patients
This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZA（azacytidine）combined with the R-GemOx (rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) regimen as first-line treatment in elderly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients.

The purpose of this phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZA in combination with R-GemOx for untreated elderly DLBCL patients.

The induction phase consisted of 8 cycles of AZA in combination with R-GemOx for a total of 8 treatment cycles. The efficacy was evaluated every 4 cycles, and if the efficacy was evaluated as complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), the original chemotherapy regimen was continued for 4 courses. If efficacy was assessed as stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), the study was withdrawn.After 8 cycles of induction therapy, if the response is assessed as CR or PR, patients may end treatment or receive rituximab maintenance therapy.

The primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR).Secondary efficacy measures included CR and PR,SD, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
