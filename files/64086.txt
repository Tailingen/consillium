A Monocentric Study to Investigate a New Low Dose Oral Gut Cleansing Solution
A first study at one centre, with a new oral gut cleansing solution, NRL994, in patients who were going to have a colonoscopy. The study was to find out how well the new "Low Dose Bowel Prep" (LDBP) worked, and whether it was safe to use.

Time Frame:, Day -1 and Day 0 prior to colonoscopy
A pilot monocentric, open phase I study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a new oral gut cleansing solution NRL994 in patients submitted to colonoscopy.

The study was carried out as an open, uncontrolled investigation in a group of 36 in-patients scheduled for colonoscopy. Patients were enrolled one or two days prior to the endoscopic procedure. Gut cleansing started in the evening prior to the intervention when the first dose of LDBP was taken; bowel preparation was continued in the morning of the day of colonoscopy when the second dose was taken. A patient's participation in the study ended after completion of the endoscopic procedure.

A dose of NRL994 was diluted in 1000 mL of water and consisted of 100 g PEG 3350, 7.5 g sodium sulphate, 4.7 g ascorbic acid, 5.9 g sodium ascorbate, 46 mmol sodium chloride, and 12.46 mmol potassium chloride. The product was flavoured with lemon flavour (2.015 g), anhydrous citric acid (1.565 g), and potassium acesulfame (0.35 g).

Each dose of one litre had to be swallowed within one hour, followed by 500 mL of additional clear fluid.
