Biomarker Study of Immune-mediated Mechanism of Action of Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab in HER2+ Breast Cancer Patients
Phase II, Open Label, Randomized, Biomarker Study of Immune-mediated Mechanism of Action of Neoadjuvant Subcutaneous (SC) Trastuzumab in Patients with Operable or Locally Advanced /Inflammatory HER2-positive Breast Cancer (ImmunHER)
Cancer, Breast
BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab IV|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab SC|BIOLOGICAL: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Docetaxel
Tumor Infiltrating lymphocites (TIL) rate on residual disease after either IV trastuzumab or SC trastuzumab (see related paragraph), stromal lymphocytes will be scored quantitatively on H\&E stained whole-tumor slides as a continuous variable expressed as stromal percentage area within the tumor boundaries. For tumors with heterogeneous TILs, median values will be calculated from multiple counts from different tumor areas. Intra-epithelial TILs will also be recorded as well as tertiary lymphoid structures. Tumor regression will be scored based on recommended criteria., 6 months after last patient in

Women with histologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer with locally advanced, inflammatory,or early stage tumor (either greater than 2 cm in diameter or node positive) with no evidence of metastatic disease.
