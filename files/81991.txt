Post-Ibrutinib Colitis and Intestinal Microbiota
Identify gut microbiome biomarkers associated with colitis in patients treated with targeted therapy in hematology
Gastrointestinal Microbiome
difference in microbiome biomarkers between patients developing colitis after exposure to targeted therapy and those not developing colitis, With the different species and metabolites between the 2 groups of patients (patients developing diarrhea after exposure to Ibrutinib and those not developing diarrhea), we will create a risk score for occurrence of diarrhea during treatment with Ibrutinib, on the previously developed model (Montassier et al, 2016, Genome medicine), At the end of the study, after 2 years.
Identify biomarkers of the gut microbiota associated with the occurrence of severe diarrhea (grade 3 and 4 CTCAE, version 4.0) in patients treated with Ibrutinib for malignant hemopathy B., At the end of the study, after 2 years.|Identify biomarkers of gut microbiota associated with the occurrence of diarrhea by subgroup: patients treated with Ibrutinib alone, patients treated with Ibrutinib in combination with another molecule, At the end of the study, after 2 years.|Creation of a predictive score of the occurrence of diarrhea in patients treated with Ibrutinib for malignant hemopathy B, including the biomarkers of the intestinal microbiome and the clinical characteristics of the patient, At the end of the study, after 2 years.
