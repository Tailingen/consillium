Development and Testing of a Patient-facing Educational Tool About Liver Cancer Prevention
To develop and test liver cancer prevention educational material.
Liver Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Testing|BEHAVIORAL: Usability Testing
Cognitive Testing, Participant comprehension will be measured qualitatively through cognitive testing. In cognitive testing interviews, participants are asked to "think aloud" as they review and react to new information. Participants will be presented with the storyboard (mock-up) versions of the content and asked to describe in their own words what the information means to them. Cognitive interviews may include questions about content such as length, clarity of the language, and helpfulness of the educational material. A trained research team member will ask probing questions throughout interviews as needed. Based on patient feedback, modifications will be made iteratively to the content to ensure the content is understood and interpreted as intended. There is no post-survey for cognitive testing., Up to 1.5 hours|Usability Testing, Usability will be measured qualitatively using a Usability Interview Guide. Usability will also be measured using the System Usability Scale. Acceptability will be measured with the Ottawa Acceptability Measures. Knowledge will be measured pre- and post- session using knowledge questions developed by the investigators and refined during cognitive testing., Up to 1.5 hours
Primary Objectives:

* To ensure the text for the site is understood by participants, participant comprehension will be measured qualitatively through cognitive testing. Adjustments will be made to the content, messages, and layout iteratively until interviewer notes show no large discrepancies between participant understanding and the meaning of the text.
* To ensure the site is easy to use, usability will be measured qualitatively through usability testing. Adjustments will be made to the functionality of the patient-facing portions of the web-based tool iteratively until interviewer notes indicate that participants are able to input their risk factors and download the personal summary on their own.

Secondary Objectives:

* To describe whether the site is acceptable to users, acceptability will be measured (as part of usability testing) with the Ottawa Acceptability Measures.
* To describe participants' knowledge of liver cancer risk factors, knowledge will be measured (as part of usability testing) with Knowledge Questions developed for this study.
