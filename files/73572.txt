Traditional Three Incisions vs Minimally Invasive Thoracol-laparoscopic Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer
This study is a multi-center, randomized, and open-label trial to compare the safety and feasibility of traditional three incisions and minimally invasive thoracol-laparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: MIE|PROCEDURE: OE
The incidence of respiratory complications, Respiratory complications including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, atelectasis needs suctioning of bronchoscopy, lung infection needs medication, adult respiratory distress syndrome., 1 months
Short-term Effects of Traditional Three Incisions Surgery vs Minimally Invasive Thoracol-laparoscopic Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer, To observe differences of short-term effects(bleeding volume during operation,operation time, hospital mortality, 2 years DFS) between two groups., 2 years|The incidence of postoperative complications except respiratory complications, Surgical Complications except respiratory complications(such as infection, esophageal fistula, etc.) will be measured by the Clavien-Dindo Classification, 1 months|lung function, lung function will be measured by VC,FVC,FEV1,DLCO, before operation, 1, 3 months after surgery|Pain Scores after surgery, Pain Scores will be measured by Brief pain inventory(BPI), before operation, 1, 3 days and 1, 3, 6 months after surgery|Health-related quality of life scores（HRQoL）, HRQoL will be measured by EORTC QLO-C30, QLQ-OES18, before operation, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18, 21, 24 months after surgery
blood biomarker analysis, The presence of inflammatory factors and stress response indicators (ATCH, C- reactive protein, interleukin-6, etc.)of esophageal tissue specimens and blood samples will be explored, 1 months
This study is a multi-center, randomized, and open-label trial to compare the safety and feasibility of traditional three incisions and minimally invasive thoracol-laparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
