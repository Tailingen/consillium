A Study of BH-30236 in Relapsed/ Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Study BH-30236-01 is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1/1b, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study in participants with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (R/R AML) or higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).

Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy of BH-30236 administered orally. Approximately 50 participants may be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study.

Phase 1b (Dose Expansion) will follow Phase 1 to further understand the relationships among dose, exposure, toxicity, tolerability, and clinical activity. Up to 24 participants may be enrolled in Phase 1b of the study.

The dose expansion part (Phase 1b) will be followed to understand the relationships among dose, exposure, toxicity, tolerability and clinical activity. Up to 24 participants may be enrolled in Phase 1b of the study.

This is a Phase 1/1b, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary anti-leukemic activity of the CLK inhibitor, BH-30236, in adult subjects with R/R AML or HR-MDS.

The study consists of two parts: Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Phase 1b Dose Expansion.

Phase 1 Dose Escalation is anticipated to enroll approximately 50 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary anti-leukemic activity of BH-30236, as well as determine the MTD and/or the preliminary recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDEs).

Phase 1 will follow an accelerated 3 + 3 dose escalation, where participants will receive ascending doses of BH-30236 to determine the recommended RDEs.

Phase 1b Dose Expansion will enroll approximately 24 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-leukemic activity of BH-30236 at selected RDEs determined in Phase 1 Dose Escalation.
