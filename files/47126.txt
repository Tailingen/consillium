Study to Evaluate the Cardiac Safety of TAS-102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cardiac safety of TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors (Excluding Breast Cancer)
DRUG: TAS-102|DRUG: Placebo
QTc interval, Predose (Day -2) to post-dose changes and absolute values in QTc interval after placebo (Day -1, Cycle 1), after a single dose of TAS-102 (Day 1, Cycle 1), and after multiple doses (Day 12, Cycle 1), Days -2, -1, 1, and 12 of Cycle 1
Quantitative and Qualitative ECG parameters, Predose (Day -2) to postdose changes and absolute values in quantitative Holter ECG parameters (heart rate, RR, PR and QRS intervals) after placebo (Day -1, Cycle 1), after a single dose of TAS-102 (Day 1, Cycle 1), and after multiple doses (Day 12, Cycle 1). In addition, qualitative assessments of Holter ECG recordings will be performed., Days -2, -1, 1, and 12 of Cycle 1|Relationship between TAS-102 pharmacokinetics and its effect on cardiac repolarization, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Days 1 and 12 of Cycle 1. The relationship between plasma concentrations of TAS-102 and the change from baseline in QTc adjusted by placebo will be quantified using a linear mixed effect model approach., Days 1 and 12 of Cycle 1|Safety monitoring including adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, Standard safety monitoring and grading using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used., Through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment|Tumor assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Every 8 weeks through Cycle 6 (ie, through 24 weeks). Thereafter, assessments will be performed at least every 12 weeks according to site standard of care, until at least one of the treatment discontinuation criteria is met.
This is a Phase 1, nonrandomized study to evaluate the cardiac safety of TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study is conducted in 2 phases: the cardiac safety evaluation phase to investigate cardiac repolarization and the cardiac safety profile (Cycle 1) and the extension phase to assess the safety profile and antitumor activity (subsequent cycles).
