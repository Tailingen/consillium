Randomized, Multicenter, Phase III Trial to Assess Conformal Post-operative Radiotherapy vs. Surveillance After Complete Resection of Stage II/III Thymoma
The primary objective of the study : to compare the Recurrence-Free survival (RFS) between arms. RFS is defined as time from randomisation to the first recurrence (either local-regional or distant) or death of any cause.
