Study of Gut Microbiome and Colorectal Tumors
Gut microbiota were assessed in 540 colonoscopy-screened adults by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Investigators compared gut microbiota diversity, overall composition, and normalized taxon abundance among these groups.

Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease arising from at least two precursors-the conventional adenoma (CA) and the serrated polyp. A relationship between the human gut microbiota and colorectal cancer has been shown; however, its relationship to the different early precursors of colorectal cancer is understudied. This study tested, for the first time, the relationship of the gut microbiota to specific colorectal polyp types.
