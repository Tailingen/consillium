Zoledronic Acid-loaded Bone Cement as a Local Adjuvant Therapy for Giant Cell Bone Tumor After Intralesional Curettage
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether zoledronic acid-loaded bone cement (4mg ZOL+ gentamicin PMMA ) as adjuvant method can decrease local recurrence in patients with giant cell bone tumor following intralesional curettage surgery. The hypothesis is that patients with local administration of zoledronic acid to the bone cement has lower relapse rate compared those with traditional bone cement(gentamicin PMMA ).
Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
PROCEDURE: 4mg ZOL loaded gentamicin PMMA|PROCEDURE: gentamicin PMMA
time to first local recurrence, Time to first local recurrence will be reported during postoperative 18-month follow up period, All patients will be followed for this endpoint until 18 months postoperatively
MSTS score, The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system is a disease-specific instrument to determine the physical and mental health for patients underwent limb-salvage surgery after tumor resection and is a validated and well-accepted functional scoring system used in orthopaedic oncology research, Doctors will be responsible in filling this questionnaire 3 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months postoperatively during patients' follow up|TESS score, The Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) is a physical disability measure developed specifically for patients undergoing surgery for extremity tumours and has been shown to have superior measurement properties compared with other commonly used sc, Patients will be asked to fill this survey 3 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months postoperatively|postoperative complication, Including wound healing problem, mechanical failure, infection and any tumor progression issues, Patients will be asked to report any complication 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months postoperatively during follow up|Potential ZOL-related complications, Patients will be followed for atypical bone fractures and avascular necrosis (AVN) of jaw, one of the most severe complication of ZOL, Patients will be followed to report any complication 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months postoperatively.
The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of zoledronic acid (4mg ZOL-loaded gentamicin PMMA bone cement) as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the local recurrence rate of giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone. The investigators will also evaluate whether patients with zoledronic acid as a surgical adjuvant improves secondary outcomes, including function (MSTS and TESS), surgery related complications (henderson's failure mode) and ZOL-related complications.
