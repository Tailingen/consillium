Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for T4 dMMR Colon Cancer
Due to dMMR colon cancer patients respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy, but immunotherapy can significantly improve the pCR in this group of patients, this study intends to explore whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy can improve the R0 resection rate with preservation of adjacent organs in T4 colon cancer patients with dMMR.
