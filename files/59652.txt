VEGF Signaling Promotes Cell Growth and Metastasis in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma in a VEGF Receptor Mediated Pathway
The investigators study the VEGF signaling in ICC cell linesÔºèhuman tissues and its mechanism in HCC growth, proliferation and apoptosis.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: surgical treatment
the variation of the quantity of VEGF signal pathway genes in normal liver tissue,peri tumor,tumor and metastasis., the sections would be collected as previously described.Western blot,immunohistochemistry,PCR would be conducted to find out the variation between the normal liver tissue and tumor,tumor and meta(if have)., the day when conducting surgery (day 1)
Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF and its receptors in ICC cell lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed that the elevation of VEGF promotes the growth. Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in ICC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating ICC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in ICC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.
