Universal CAR-T Cells (REVO-UWD-00B) for Refractory and Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
This study is a single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical trial. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of administering universal BCMA CAR-T cells to subjects with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma. Eligible participants will undergo FC preconditioning after signing an informed consent form, followed by a one-time injection of universal UWD-00B cells to assess its safety and efficacy. Subjects will be hospitalized for a period, and after discharge, they will undergo periodic efficacy assessments and long-term survival follow-up for at least five years.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a measurable efficacy (complete or partial response) following UWD-00B CAR-T therapy., Measured at 3 and 6 months after treatment|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time during and after treatment that the patient lives without disease progression., From the start of treatment up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), The duration from the start of treatment to the time of death from any cause., From the start of treatment up to maximum follow-up period of five years|Duration of Response (DOR), The time from initial response (CR or PR) to disease progression or relapse or any cause of death., From the administration of UWD-00B CAR-T cells to a maximum follow-up period of five years
Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disease with high mortality rates. Patients with relapsed and refractory cases, especially those resistant to conventional therapies (immunomodulators, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies), typically have limited survival. CAR-T cell therapy is a cutting-edge approach in which T cells are genetically modified to target cancer cells. UWD-00B is designed to target BCMA, a protein highly expressed on myeloma cells but minimally present in other body tissues, making it an ideal target. Previous BCMA CAR-T therapies have shown promise, but production limitations make universal, off-the-shelf products like UWD-00B critical for broader patient accessibility.

Primary Objective is to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of UWD-00B in patients with r/r MM. The secondary Objectives is to investigate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics, including the persistence and effectiveness of UWD-00B in targeting BCMA-positive cells. This study will enroll approximately 30 patients with relapsed or refractory MM, aged 18-75. Following preconditioning chemotherapy to enhance CAR-T cell efficacy, patients will receive a single infusion of UWD-00B. The study spans multiple phases, including screening, infusion, and a two-year follow-up to assess both short- and long-term safety and efficacy.

This study hopes to provide data supporting UWD-00B as an effective, accessible treatment for r/r MM, potentially paving the way for similar universal CAR-T therapies in other cancers.
