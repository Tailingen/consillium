Efficacy and Tolerability of Toremifene or Tamoxifen Therapy in Premenopausal Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Patients
In premenopausal women, endocrine adjuvant therapy for breast cancer primarily consists of tamoxifen alone or with ovarian suppressive strategies. Toremifene is a chlorinated derivative of tamoxifen, but with a superior risk-benefit profile. In this trial, we sought to compare the efficacy and tolerability of toremifene and tamoxifen therapy in premenopausal patients with operable,estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer patients.
