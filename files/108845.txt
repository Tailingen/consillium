Liquid Biopsy Using Methylation Sequencing for Lung Cancer
This study aims to investigate the utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation sequencing in the diagnosis of primary lung cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Circulating Tumor DNA Methylation Sequencing
Diagnostic sensitivity of ctDNA methylation sequencing, Using pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer as gold standard, diagnostic sensitivity of ctDNA methylation will be compared with that of tumor markers., 2 year|Diagnostic specificity of ctDNA methylation sequencing, Using pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer as gold standard, diagnostic specificity of ctDNA methylation will be compared with that of tumor markers., 2 year
Diagnostic accuracy of ctDNA methylation sequencing, Using pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer as gold standard, diagnostic accuracy of ctDNA methylation will be compared with that of tumor markers., 2 year|Positive predictive value of ctDNA methylation sequencing, Using pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer as gold standard, positive predictive value of ctDNA methylation will be compared with that of tumor markers., 2 year|Negative predictive value of ctDNA methylation sequencing, Using pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer as gold standard, negative predictive value of ctDNA methylation will be compared with that of tumor markers., 2 year
Plasma sample of patients with and without lung cancer will be collected and analyzed using methylation-sensitive enzyme sequencing method. Diagnostic performance of ctDNA methylation sequencing will be compared with that of tumor markers (CEA, Cyfra 21-1, and NSE) combined.
