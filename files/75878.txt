PROM Project Urology
All patients undergoing urological surgery or treatment should receive standardized questionnaires on quality of life, satisfaction, pain and physical recovery. Indication-specific, individual pathways are set up, for example, for patients with localized prostate cancer, benign prostate enlargement, bladder dysfunction or erectile dysfunction. In combination with the clinical data, the PROM data should help to improve the quality of the results and, if necessary, adapt treatment pathways to patient needs.

OTHER: Observation of patients undergoing sugery
Change in functional treatment outcome in patients with prostate cancer, assessed by EPIC-26: (Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment EPIC-26 score: max 100 points; greater values indicate improved functional outcomes, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in health-related quality of life (PROMIS-10: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. PROMIS-10 max 50 points; greater values indicate healthier status, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in pain: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. BPI: max. 11 points; greater values indicate worse outcome, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in erectile function (IIEF: International Index of Erectile Function), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. IEF: 0-25 points; greater values indicate better ercetile function, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in bladder function/micturition (IPSS: International Prostate Symptom Score), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. IPSS: score 0-35; greater values indicates increased symptom severity, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in bladder function/micturition (OAB-SF: Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, short form), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. OAB-SF: score 0 - 16; score with greater values indicates increased symptom severity, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in bladder function/micturition (ICIQ-UI: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. ICIQ-UI: score 0-21; greater values indicate worse urinary incontinence, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Change in pelvic pain (NHS-CPSI: Chronic prostatits symptom index), Electronically recorded Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) are captured for each patient depending on the condition and surgery/treatment. NHS-CSI: 0-43 points; greater values indicate worse outcomes, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years
patient characteristics: age, Clinical parameters are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|patient characteristics:comorbidities, Clinical parameters are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|patient characteristics: medication (name, type, dose, interval), Clinical parameters are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|patient characteristics: disease-specific data (tumor histology, oncologic status), Clinical parameters are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, Data collection/follow-up: day - 1 before surgery, 2 to 10 days host surgery, after 3, 6, 12 months, annually 2 to 10 years|Perioperative data: duration of sugery (minutes), Perioperative data are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, during surgery, surgery time depending on the disease (30 minutes to 4 hours)|Perioperative data: blood loss (ml), Perioperative data are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, during surgery, surgery time depending on the disease (30 minutes to 4 hours)|Perioperative data: transfusion (ml, Perioperative data are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, during surgery, surgery time depending on the disease (30 minutes to 4 hours)|Perioperative data: length of hospital stay (days), Perioperative data are captured for each patient undergoing sugery, depending on the disease and following surgery (1 to 10 days)
