A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase â…¢ trial; including 3 stages: screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period.

* Screening period: 6 weeks prior to treatment
* Treatment period:
* Induction period: APL-1202 is administered for 12 consecutive weeks
* Maintenance period: after 12-week drug free period, APL-1202 is administered for another12 consecutive weeks as maintenance treatment
* Follow up period: APL-1202 is administered at every 3-month interval if no events occurred in the treatment period and until the occurrence of events or the end of the entire clinical trial Intravesical Epirubicin hydrochloride will be administered once weekly for consecutive 6-8 weeks in the induction period, followed by once monthly in the maintenance period until end of 12 months
