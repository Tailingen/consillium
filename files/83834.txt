This is a prospective, randomized, two stage study. The target population is adult females ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years of age with breast cancer with a National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer score of distress score ≥ 4. The study will be conducted at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (AHWFBCCC). The hypothesis is that the social connectivity via the Mighty Pro Application, as well as the educational components available in the application, will decrease patients' cancer-related distress. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the Mighty Pro Application and measure its efficacy at reducing distress among young women with breast cancer.
