a Clinical Trial of Efficacy and Safety of the Holistic Treatment of Young High-risk Multiple Myeloma Patients
The clinical trial was conducted in a cohort of young, high-risk myeloma patients who were designed to receive a combination of high-dose chemotherapy with allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The objective was to assess the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),and overall response rate (ORR) of the overall treatment.
Multiple Myeloma|Plasma Cell Leukemia|Extramedullary Plasmacytoma|Loss of Chromosome 17p|t(14;16)|t(4;14)|T(14;20)|1Q21 Amplification|Complex Karyotype
PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|PROCEDURE: Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation x 1 or x 2|DRUG: Melphalan Given IV|DRUG: Fludarabine Injection|DRUG: PI and dexamethasone as maintenance therapy|DRUG: PI+IMids+Dexamethasone as Consolidated Chemotherapy
progression free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the data of registration to either progressive disease or death, whichever comes first., 1 Year post-autograft
overall response(ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve PR to better rate, according to the IMWG criteria, 1 Year post-autograft|overall survival(OS), OS is defined as the duration from the data of registration to death.If the subject is alive, the data will be censored as being alive; the vital status is unknown as last known., 1 Year post-autograft|Number of Patients With Grade II-IV Acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease and/or Chronic Extensive Graft-versus-Host-Disease, aGVHD The diagnosis of aGVHD is identified through various stages and grading of the disease related to Skin (Rash), Gut (Diarrhea, Nausea/vomiting and/or anorexia) and the liver (Bilirubin) assessed by severity and grading scale outlined in the section Grafts vs Hosts by Sullivan (1999).

GVHD Grades Grade I: 1-2 Skin Rash; No gut or liver involvement Grade II: Stage 1-3 Skin rash; Stage 1 gut and/or stage 1 liver involvement Grade III: Stage 2-4 gut involvement and/or stage 2-4 liver involvement with or without rash Grade IV: Pattern and severity of GVHD similar to grade 3 with extreme constitutional symptoms or death cGVHD The diagnosis of cGVHD requires at least one manifestation that is distinctive for chronic GVHD as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, infection and others causes must be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD., 1 year post-allograft|Non-relapse Mortality (NRM), Number of patients with non-relapse mortalities, 1 year post-allograft|Number of Patients Who Had Infections, Number of patients who had infections, 1 Year post-autograft
50 cases of HR-NDMM patients were divided into two groups nonrandomizedly. TE group received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after induction therapy. Allo-sct for the young patients with suitable donors, Asct for the others. TNE group received consolidation therapy after induction therapy. All patients received PI-based maintenance therapy.
