A Study of AZD0486 Plus Rituximab in Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma Patients
This is a global, randomised, Phase III, multicentre, open-label study evaluating the efficacy, safety and the degree of added benefit of the AZD0486 plus rituximab combination compared to Investigator's choice of 3 standard immunochemotherapy regimen, conducted in participants with untreated FL.
Untreated Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: AZD0486|DRUG: R-CHOP|DRUG: R-CVP|DRUG: BR
SRI Primary: Incidence, nature and severity of AEs and SAEs. Incidence and nature of study drug discontinuations, dose reductions, and dose delays due to AEs, Frequency, severity, and relationship to study drug of AEs and SAEs; dose modifications; changes in physical examination and safety procedures., Up to 10 years|SRI Primary: Determination of the recommended Phase III dose (RP3D), The RP3D will be the dose of AZD0486 selected for the Phase 3 part based on safety data compiled during the safety run-in part, Up to 1 year|Phase 3 Primary: To demonstrate the superiority of AZD0486 plus rituximab compared to Investigator's choice of SoC chemoimmunotherapy, PFS, based on Lugano 2014 Response Criteria, as assessed by BICR., Up to 10 years

The study consists of 2 sequential parts.

1. Safety Run-in - this part will compare dose levels of AZD0486 in combination with rituximab in order to establish the RP3D.
2. Phase III - The Phase III part will assess the superiority of AZD0486 at RP3D in combination with rituximab, compared to Investigator's choice between 3 standard chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Phase 3 consists of 3 arms

   1. Arm A: treatment with AZD0486 plus rituximab Schedule A
   2. Arm B: treatment with AZD0486 plus rituximab Schedule B
   3. Arm C (Comparator arm): one of the following standard regimens per Investigator's choice: R-CVP + rituximab maintenance, R-CHOP + rituximab maintenance and B-R
