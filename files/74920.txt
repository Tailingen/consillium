Study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin, Venetoclax, and Dexamethasone for Relapsed B-cell ALL
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the combination of drugs Inotuzumab Ozogamicin, Venetoclax, and Dexamethasone (IoVeX) are safe to treat relapsed B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) in pediatric and adult patients. It will also learn if these drugs are well tolerated. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Is the drug combination of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin, Venetoclax, and Dexamethasone (IoVeX) safe when given to patients?

What medical problems do patients taking IoVeX experience?

Participants will:

Receive this combination of drugs for 1 cycle which is 28 days at various timepoints. If participants tolerate cycle 1 they will be eligible to continue to cycle 2 which is also 28 days.

Have checkups and tests at the beginning of the study and throughout the course of each cycle.
