Study on AUNIP as a Novel Tumor Marker for Cervical Cancer
To detect the expression of AUNIP in cervical cancer serum, and to clarify its diagnostic and prognostic value.
Cervical Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Detection of serum AUNIP expression
AUNIP expression in serum, Serum AUNIP expression is detected by ELISA kit. The results will be recorded seperately., through study completion, an average of 3 year
Blood of all study participants of cervical cancer patients are collected to detect the expression of AUNIP, analyze the statistical correlation between the expression of cervical cancer AUNIP and clinicopathological parameters of patients, and preliminarily understand the expression of AUNIP in cervical cancer tumor tissues and its clinical diagnostic and progniostic value.
