Lung Cancer|Surgery|Anesthesia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Dobutamine stress CMR|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cardiac biomarker sample
1) Feasibility of dobutamine stress CMR to measure RVCreserve following lung resection., Reliability and variability will be assessed through dual reporting of the CMR images, testing intra-/inter-observer intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV). Study design will allow comparison to our previous resting studies published exercise literature and between pre- and post-operative imaging., Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative
1) Acceptability of the dobutamine stress CMR protocol to patients, by questionnaire, Assessed by patient satisfaction questionnaires rate compared to our previous CMR studies that were performed without dobutamine stress testing., Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|1) Acceptability of the dobutamine stress CMR protocol to patients, by completion, Assessed by patient recruitment/withdrawal rate compared to our previous CMR studies that were performed without dobutamine stress testing., Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|2) Incidence of complications related to dobutamine stress CMR, We will assess for the onset of any of the following during the scan

1. New onset atrial fibrillation
2. Ventricular tachycardia
3. Angina, chest pain, shortness of breath and/or ischaemic ECG changes, Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|3) Change in RVCreserve change following lung resection, Comparison of the change in RVEF on stress pre- and post-operatively, Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|4) Change in PVreserve change following lung resection, Comparison of change in wave reflection on stress pre- and post-operatively, Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|5) Association between the changes in RVCreserve and markers of cardiac inflammation, BNP, Comparison of change in RVCreserve and the change in BNP, Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|5) Association between the changes in RVCreserve and markers of cardiac inflammation, hsTnT, Comparison of change in RVCreserve and the change in hsTnT., Pre-operative and 2 months post-operative|1) Post-operative change in BNP, Post-operative change in BNP in oesophagectomy compared to lung resection and gastrectomy., Peri-operative blood samples, pre-op, immediately post-op, post-op days 1 and 2, 4-8 weeks post-op
We hypothesise that following lung resection,

1. the subtle decrease in RV function and increase in afterload we have demonstrated at rest is associated with a marked impairment of RV function on exercise, termed impaired RV contractile reserve (RVCreserve),
2. impaired RVCreserve is associated with impaired functional capacity .

In this study we aim to assess the feasibility of dobutamine stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scanning to assess RVCreserve pre- and post-operatively in patients undergoing lung resection.

Additionally, we hypothesise that one lung ventilation (with and without lung resection) is associated with biomarker evidence of RV injury.We will perform peri-operative cardiac biomarkers to differentiate between the contribution of major surgery (gastrectomy, lung resection and oesophagectomy), one lung ventilation (lung resection and oesophagectomy) and lung resection on RV injury.
