Correlation Between Myocardial Injury and Intestinal Flora Changes Associated With Oncology Drug Therapy
The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between early myocardial injury caused by tumor drug therapy and intestinal microbial structure changes by echocardiographic two-dimensional speckle tracking technique and intestinal microflora structure detection.
Cancer Therapy-related Cardiovascular Toxicity
DRUG: Antitumor drugs
At least a 10% decrease in the global longitudinal strain, The primary endpoint is at least a 10% decrease in the global longitudinal strain, determined using cardiac 2D STE and compared with baseline., 6 months
This is a monocentric prospective cohort study in which 50 patients treated for malignant tumors will be included. All participants will be followed for 6 months after the initiation of oncology drug therapy. Echocardiography and 2D speckle tracking will be performed and stool and blood samples will be tested before treatment initiation and at 3 and 6 months after initiation.
