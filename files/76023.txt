Imetelstat Given Intravenously Alone and With Standard 13-Cis-Retinoic Acid in Children With Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of imetelstat when given alone for patients with neuroblastoma and also when given in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Imetelstat
Effectiveness of Imetelstat in pediatric dose, Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised international criteria (1.1) proposed by the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) committee in patients with relapsed and/or refractory neuroblastoma, to confirm the feasibility of administering imetelstat given at the recommended pediatric dose as determined in the Children's Oncology Group Study ADVL1112 (a phase I study of imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumours and lymphoma), alone and in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid., 24 month
Impact of imetelstat on hematopoietic stem cells and neuroblastoma tumour cells., Bone marrow aspirates, biopsies and blood samples for CC assay: at baseline, end of cycles 1 and 2 then end of every other cycle will be assessed in patients with relapsed and/or refractory neuroblastoma to assess the impact of imetelstat on hematopoietic stem cells and neuroblastoma tumour initiating cells., 24 months|Changes in plasma C-circles, In patients with relapsed and/or refractory neuroblastoma to evaluate:

* The correlation of tumour and plasma C-circles.
* The role of plasma C-circles as a tumour biomarker for alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT).
* Changes in plasma C-circles induced by treatment with imetelstat., 24 months
This research is being done because imetelstat has been shown to slow the growth of tumours in animals and may also be doing so in adults, but we are not sure if it can also slow tumour growth in children and offer better results than standard treatment. Laboratory studies suggest imetelstat may increase the activity of 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is used to treat neuroblastoma, although this is not yet proven in patients.
