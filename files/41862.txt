A Study of Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab Versus Nivolumab Alone in Participants With Advanced Kidney Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab compared to nivolumab monotherapy in participants with previously untreated kidney cancer that has spread.
