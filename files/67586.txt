VETC is an Effective Marker for Postoperative Adjuvant Immunotherapy
Vessels that encapsulate tumor clusters (VETC) is an invasive metastatic factor in HCC independent of the epithelial mesenchyme transition (EMT), and VETC-positive patients have a higher rate of postoperative recurrence. However, it is not clear how the surgical prognosis of VETC-positive patients can be improved.
HCC|Recurrence
DRUG: PD-1 monoclonal antibody and lenvatinib
Disease -free survival, Disease-free survival was defined as defined as the time from enrollment to diagnosis of recurrence or death from any cause., From date of include in this research until the date of first documented recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Previous studies have identified VETC as a new metastatic pattern independent of EMT that may be associated with immunosuppression as well as poor prognosis. Multiple retrospective studies find higher rates of postoperative recurrence, distant metastasis in VETC-positive patients. How to improve surgical prognosis in VETC-positive patients needs to be explored. There is no consensus on postoperative adjuvant therapy for HCC. In recent years, adjuvant immunotherapy (sintilimab) and adjuvant immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy (T+A) have been shown to be effective in improving the surgical prognosis. Therefore, the investigators retrospectively collected three surgical resection cohorts, the surgical resection alone group, the postoperative adjuvant PD-1 monotherapy group, and the postoperative adjuvant PD-1 monotherapy combined with Lenvatinib group, to compare these postoperative adjuvant therapies in a subgroup of VETC patients.
