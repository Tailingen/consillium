Study of MK-1248 With and Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-1248-001)
In this study, participants with advanced solid tumors were assigned to receive escalating doses of either MK-1248 alone or MK-1248 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). This study used the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (or maximum administered dose) for MK-1248 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: MK-1248|BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab
Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 (21 days), if possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment, was considered a DLT: 1. Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity 2. Grade 4 hematological toxicity lasting \>7 days, except thrombocytopenia a. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration b. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia is a DLT if associated with bleeding 3. Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, with the exceptions 4. Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematological laboratory abnormality, if medical intervention was required, or abnormality led to hospitalization, or abnormality persisted for \>1 week 5. Febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4 6. Any drug-related AE which caused participant to discontinue study treatment during Cycle 1 7. Grade 5 toxicity 8. Any treatment-related toxicity which caused a \>2-week delay in initiation of Cycle 2., Cycle 1 (Up to 21 days)
Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-1248 in Serum, Cmax is the maximum (peak) concentration of MK-1248 observed in blood serum. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 Cmax. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (\~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (\~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 \& 15. Each cycle was 21 days. (Up to \~3 months), At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of MK-1248 in Serum, Ctrough is the lowest concentration of MK-1248 in blood serum just before the next dose. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 Ctrough, except for during Cycle 1. No blood samples were collected for the analysis of Ctrough in Cycle 1. No samples were collected for the MK-1248 0.6 mg group in Cycles 3 or 4, for the MK-1248 10 mg group in Cycles 1-4, or for the MK-1248 60 mg + Pembrolizumab group in Cycle 4. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (\~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (\~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 \& 15. Each cycle was 21 days. (Up to \~3 months), At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)|Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of MK-1248 in Serum, AUC0-infinity is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. It is a measure of the amount of MK-1248 in blood serum from pre-dose to infinite time. Blood samples were obtained at designated timepoints for the analysis of MK-1248 AUC0-inf. No blood samples were collected for the MK-1248 0.6 mg group in Cycle 4, for the MK-1248 10 mg group in Cycle or for the MK-1248 60 mg + Pembrolizumab group in Cycle 4. Timepoints: Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose, post MK-1248 infusion end (\~0.5 hours), 2 hours post MK-1248 infusion start (\~2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 5, 8 \& 15. Each cycle was 21 days. (Up to \~3 months), At designated timepoints (Up to ~3 months)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Glucocorticoid-induced Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-related Protein (GITR) Receptor Target Engagement, GITR protein is internalized upon binding by MK-1248. To evaluate GITR target engagement, a GITR receptor availability assay was developed to assess the availability of surface GITR following administration of MK-1248. GITR is detected on CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD95+ T-cell sub-populations using flow cytometry and compared to pre-dose baseline. GITR target engagement is calculated as 100% - (%) GITR receptor availability. The Cmax of percent GITR target engagement on CD4+CD25+ T-cells is presented. Timepoints: Arm 1: Screening; Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose MK-1248, At end of MK-1248 infusion (0.5 hours), 2 hours after start of MK-1248 infusion (2 hours); Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 8 \& 15. Arm 2: Screening; Cycles 1-4 Day 1: Predose pembrolizumab, At end of MK-1248 infusion (0.5 hours), 2 hours after start of MK-1248 infusion (2 hours): Cycles 1-4 Days 2, 3, 8 \& Day 15: Cycles 5-6: Predose. Each cycle was 21 days., At designated timepoints (Up to ~4.5 months)|Trough (Minimum) Concentration (Ctrough) of Glucocorticoid-induced Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-related Protein (GITR) Receptor Target Engagement, GITR protein is internalized upon binding by MK-1248. To evaluate GITR target engagement, a GITR receptor availability assay was developed to assess the availability of surface GITR following administration of MK-1248. GITR is detected on CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD95+ T-cell sub-populations using flow cytometry and compared to pre-dose baseline. GITR target engagement is calculated as 100% - (%) GITR receptor availability. The Ctrough of percent GITR target engagement on CD4+CD25+ T-cells is presented.
