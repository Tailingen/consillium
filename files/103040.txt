Estrogen for Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Estradiol treatment for advanced breast cancer that is hormone receptor negative and Her2/neu negative. The study will also use tumor tissue from your original diagnosis or from a biopsy you may have had for your cancer to look at hormone receptors in the lab. The tissue left over from your previous surgery or a previous biopsy will be used for research tests to check whether a different estrogen receptor (estrogen receptor beta) is seen in the tumor and if that makes estrogen work better.
