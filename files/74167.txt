Clinical Study of ARD103 CAR-T Therapy for Patients With R/R AML or MDS
This is a phase I/2, interventional, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of ARD103 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, in Relapse|Acute Myeloid Leukemia Refractory|MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome)
BIOLOGICAL: ARD103|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], The records of AEs and severity following the first infusion of ARD103., 28 days post ARD103 infusion|To determine the RP2D of ARD103, RP2D of ARD103 following a 3+3 dose escalation schema (Phase 1), 28 days post ARD103 infusion|To evaluate overall response rate (ORR), The ORR will be evaluated by European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria, Up to 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from ARD103 infusion to the date of death from any cause., First infusion date of ARD103 up to 15 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the infusion of ARD103 infusion to the first recorded response of disease progression, relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months|Time to best response, Time to best response is defined as the time from the infusion of ARD103 to the BOR., First infusion date of ARD103 up to 24 months
The investigational product (IP) for this study is ARD103, a C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T). CLL-1 is highly expressed on both myeloid blasts and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) but is absent on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting CLL-1 as an excellent therapeutic target for AML and hence other potential myeloid malignancies.
