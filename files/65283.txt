This is an open-label, four-arm lead-in safety and efficacy study in which adavosertib will be combined in four separate treatment arms as follows: adavosertib plus gemcitabine (Arm A); adavosertib plus weekly paclitaxel (Arm B); adavosertib plus carboplatin (Arm C); and adavosertib plus PLD (Arm D). A subset of patients will be evaluated for the safety assessment of each treatment arm.

The adavosertib plus paclitaxel arm (Arm B) will enrol approximately 30 additional patients at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that suggests clinical activity.

In addition, the adavosertib plus carboplatin arm (Arm C) will enrol approximately 23 patients overall at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that suggests clinical activity.

To further optimise the dosing schedule of adavosertib in Arm C, a safety expansion arm (referred to as Arm C2) of approximately 12 additional patients will be enrolled at selected sites to explore emerging pre-clinical and clinical data that suggest that prolonged adavosertib exposure may increase the clinical activity.
