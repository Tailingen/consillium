Artificial Intelligence in EUS for Diagnosing Pancreatic Solid Lesions
We aim to develop an EUS-AI model which can facilitate clinical diagnosis by analyzing EUS pictures and clinical parameters of patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: EUS-AI model
The model's ability to differentiate pancreatic cancer from other pancreatic solid lesion, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the model., After the training process of the EUS-AI model is completed
The model's ability to specify the pancreatic solid lesions such as pancreatic cancer, CP, AIP and NET, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the model., After the training process of the EUS-AI model is completed
EUS is considered to be a more sensitive modality than CT in detecting pancreatic solid lesions due to its high spatial resolution. However, the diagnostic performance is largely dependent on the experience and the technical abilities of the practitioners. Therefore, we aim to develop an objective EUS diagnostic model based on the convolutional neural network, an artificial intelligence technique. In addition, clinical parameters such as risk factors, tumor biomarkers and radiology findings are also added to this artificial intelligence model in order to mimic the actual clinical diagnosis procedures and to increase the performance of this model.
