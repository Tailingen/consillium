This Phase II non-randomized study is to determine the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant toripalimab plus chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

All patients were planned to receive 2 cycle of toripalimab plus paclitaxel/nedaplatin as neoadjuvant therapy. Then they all receive radical dose of chest radiation and concurrent chemotherapy of capecitabine (PO 1000 mg/m2, bid, d1-d14, q3w).
