Music and Symptom Relief in Radiotherapy Patient
This randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the effects of music therapy administered during radiotherapy sessions on pain, stress, and anxiety levels in cancer patients. The intervention involves playing Musicure, a therapeutic music track, for 30 minutes via speakers during radiotherapy. The study includes two groups: an intervention group receiving music therapy and a control group receiving standard care without music.

Participants' pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), while anxiety and stress levels were measured using the Face Anxıety Subscale ( FAS).

A total of 120 adult cancer patients undergoing outpatient radiotherapy at Tınaztepe Unıversty were included. The study was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Öğr. Üyesi \[Duygu AKBAŞ UYSAL (Principal Investigator) and co-researchers Prof.Dr Fsun ŞENUZUN AYKAR, Prof.Dr Zümra ARICAK ALICIKUŞ The research complies with ethical standards and has received approval from \[insert name of ethics committee\].

This study investigates a low-cost, non-pharmacological intervention that has the potential to improve symptom management and quality of life in cancer patients.

Pain Level, Changes in pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) immediately before and after a single radiotherapy session. The VAS score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain)., Baseline (before radiotherapy on Day 1) and immediately after the radiotherapy session on Day 1.
anxiety level, Changes in anxiety levels were assessed using the Facial Anxiety Scale (FAS), a visual scale ranging from 0 (no anxiety) to 5 (severe anxiety), immediately before and after a single radiotherapy session., Baseline (before radiotherapy on Day 1) and immediately after the radiotherapy session on Day 1.
