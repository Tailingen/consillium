Multimodal MR Imaging in Patients With Glioblastoma Treated With Dendritic Cell Therapy
Malignant gliomas are aggressive tumours with poor prognosis despite the current multimodal treatment. Hence, there is a clear need for new, effective therapies, among which immune therapy has emerged as a promising treatment option.

When interpreting follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, the radiologist is often confronted with images that are difficult to interpret with the conventional anatomical imaging techniques. The difference between tumour relapse and therapy-mediated changes is not always distinctive.

In this project, the investigators attempt to characterize the inflammatory response with parameters from advanced MRI techniques like MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion imaging and MR-diffusion imaging. These techniques allow characterization of cellular properties like metabolism and tissue structure respectively. Doing so, the investigators will monitor disease evolution in order to timely detect treatment failure, thereby allowing appropriate switch in patient management.
