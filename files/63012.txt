Pilot Study of the Effect of Trastuzumab and GM-CSF on Children with Recurrent Ependymoma
This study plans to detect the presence of trastuzumab by mass spectroscopy in relapsed posterior fossa ependymoma (PFEPN) tumor specimen pre-treated with a single dose of intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab, as well as to evaluate toxicity of intrathecal trastuzumab in combination with subcutaneous (subQ) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in children with relapsed PFEPN
Posterior Fossa Ependymoma (PFEPN)
DRUG: Trastuzumab after SubQ GM-CSF|DRUG: Trastuzumab in combination with SubQ GM-CSF
Stratum 1: Detection of trastuzumab in tumor following IT administration, The presence of trastuzumab will be measured as a binary (yes/no) outcome., 2 weeks|Stratum 2: Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for IT trastuzumab in combination with fixed doses of subQ GM-CSF, The estimated MTD would be the highest dose at which 0/3 or 1/6 subjects experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)., 1 month
