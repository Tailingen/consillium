OBJECTIVES:

* Obtain quality of life and psychosocial data from older patients who are undergoing treatment for cancer and from their family caregivers.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot, cross-sectional study.

Patients undergo a 45-minute interview in person or by phone to provide demographic data and to complete quality of life questionnaires, including Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), Spiritual tool, Quality and Satisfaction with Treatment (QUEST), and Profile of Mood State (POMS), at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. Caregivers undergo a 20- to 30-minute interview in person or by phone to provide demographic data and complete quality of life questionnaires, including the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA), Quest, and POMS, at baseline and at 3 and 12 months.
