Adjuvant Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy to Prevent Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases (ProphyPIPAC)
The objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) for the prevention of peritoneal metastases after curative-intent surgery for high-risk colorectal cancer.
Peritoneal Metastases From Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC)
Feasibility of adjuvant pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC), The adjuvant PIPAC performed in an early setting after primary surgery will be considered feasible if:

* the laparoscopic procedure can be completed in 9 patients;
* the postoperative stay will be three days or shorter in ≥6 patients;
* the post-operative adjuvant s-CT will begin within 12 weeks of primary surgery in ≥ 9 patients., 12 weeks|Safety of adjuvant pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC), The adjuvant PIPAC will be considered a well tolerated procedure if:

* a maximum of one serious treatment-related complication will occur;
* a maximum of one laparotomy conversion will occur;
* a maximum of one hospital readmission will occur within 30 days., 30 days
Overall survival, Overall survival will be measured from the date of primary surgery to the date of death for any cause or, for patients still alive at the date of the last available follow-up., 60 months|Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival will be measured from the date of primary surgery to the date of peritoneal metastasis diagnosis, systemic metastases or death., 60 months|Peritoneal disease-free survival, Peritoneal disease-free survival will be measured from the date of primary surgery to the date of peritoneal metastasis diagnosis,, 60 months
This single-arm, single-center, open-label trial enrolls patients after curative-intent surgery for colon adenocarcinoma (proximal to peritoneal reflection), intestinal or mucinous histological type, associated with the following clinical-pathological risk factors for the development of peritoneal metastases: a) stage pT4a, N0-2b, M0 of the Tumor Node Metastasis classification; b) stage pT4b, N0-2b, M0; and c) primary perforated tumor (any T, any N, M0). Eligible patients who will give informed consent undergo laparoscopic pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) 4 to 8 weeks after primary surgery, followed by adjuvant systemic chemotherapy according to according to current guidelines. After the procedure, patients will be followed-up to assess occurrence of adverse events,survival, peritoneal and systemic disease relapse, and quality of life.
