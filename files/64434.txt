Feasibility Study of a Novel Single Use Robotic Colonoscopy System
This is a single centre, non-randomized, tandem colonoscopy trial of the NISInspire-C System, followed immediately by a conventional colonoscope (CC). Each trial subject will undergo colonoscopy using the NISInspire-C system, followed immediately by CC. The purpose of this study is to obtain observational data on the safety profile, feasibility and usability of the NISInspire-C System in performing diagnostic colonoscopy in human subjects. The level of procedural pain experienced by subjects will also be explored.
