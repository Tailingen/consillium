Translational Study for BRAFV600 Serum and Plasma Determination in Patients With BRAFV600 Metastatic Melanoma
This is a multi-centric translational study with biological samples collection. The aim of this study is to validate a method to detect BRAFV600 in blood samples.

Samples: Blood from patients with BRAFV600 metastatic melanoma collected following standard medical practice.

The treatment is not the aim of the study. Patients can be treated either with specific or no-specific drug.
