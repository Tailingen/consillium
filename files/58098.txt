This is a multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of BA3071. Phase 2 is open and currently recruiting patients with:

1. Melanoma - 1L
2. nonsquamous or recurrent NSCLC (Type IIB, IIIA, IV) with single or any combination of the following mutations: KRAS mutation STK11 mutation KEAP1 mutation PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) \<1%
