Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Chemotherapy in Advanced Esophageal Cancer
This is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 + paclitaxel + cisplatin vs placebo+paclitaxel +cisplatin as 1L therapy for advanced esophageal cancer patients in China. SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.
Advanced Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: cisplatin
PFS assessed by IRC, based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), approximately 22 months|OS, OS is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. Measured by the method of Kaplan and Meier., approximately 22 months
PFS assessed by investigators, based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), approximately 22 months|6 and 9 month OS rate, OS is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. Measured by the method of Kaplan and Meier., approximately 6 and 9 months|ORR, based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), approximately 22 months|DCR, based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), approximately 22 months|DoR, based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), approximately 22 months|AE, adverse events, approximately 22 months
Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs), To evaluate the incidence of ADAs against SHR-1210, approximately 22 months
In this study, eligible subjects will be randomized into study arm or control arm. Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be at most 6 cycles which would be decided by the investigators. Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) and overall survival (OS) will be the primary outcomes.
