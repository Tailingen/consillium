Intestinal Microbiota Impact for Prognosis and Treatment Outcomes in Early Luminal Breast Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer Patients
The gut microbiota (GM) can influence as effectiveness of immunotherapy as prognosis factor in cancer patients. The goal of the study to identify GM pattern is associated with poor and favourable treatment outcomes in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer patients for further treatment strategy proper planning.
