Disease Overview
The myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) are clonal myeloid disorders that have both dysplastic and proliferative features but are not properly classified as either myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD).[
1
-
3
]  This category includes three major myeloid disorders: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML).  Myeloid disease that shows features of both MDS and CMPD but does not meet the criteria for any of the three major MDS/MPN entities is designated as myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC). The World Health Organization created the MDS/MPN category to provide a less restrictive view of myeloid disorders, which  in some instances clearly overlap.[
1
-
3
]
Incidence and Mortality
The etiology of MDS/MPN is not known.  The incidence of MDS/MPN varies widely, ranging from approximately 3 per 100,000 individuals  older than 60 years annually for CMML to as few as 0.13 per 100,000 children from birth to 14 years annually for JMML.[
4
] Reliable data concerning the incidence of aCML, a recently defined entity, are not available.  The incidence of MDS/MPN-UC is unknown.
Histopathology
The pathophysiology of MDS/MPN involves abnormalities in the regulation of myeloid pathways for cellular proliferation, maturation, and survival.  Clinical symptoms result from the following complications:[
5
]
Cytopenia(s).
Dysplastic cells that function abnormally.
Leukemic infiltration of various organ systems, especially the spleen and liver.
General constitutional symptoms, such as fever and malaise.
Patients with MDS/MPN do not have a Philadelphia chromosome or a 
BCR
::
ABL1
 gene fusion.  
An international consortium has proposed uniform response criteria to be used in clinical trials because of the spectrum of presentations ranging from the myelodysplastic to the myeloproliferative.[

Disease Overview    
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN).[
1
] The WHO recognizes a dysplastic subtype and a proliferative subtype, with prognostic groups differentiated by the circulating white blood cell (WBC) count or the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow (higher percentage with worse prognosis).[
2
]
CMML is a clonal disorder of a bone marrow stem cell.  Monocytosis is a major defining feature.  CMML exhibits heterogenous clinical, hematological, and morphological features, varying from predominantly myelodysplastic to predominantly myeloproliferative. Evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) portends a particularly poor prognosis.[
3
]
CMML is characterized pathologically by:[
4
,
5
]
Persistent monocytosis is greater than 1 × 10
9
/L in the peripheral blood.
No Philadelphia chromosome or 
BCR
::
ABL1
 gene fusion.
No 
PDGFRA
 and 
PDGFRB
  rearrangement.
Fewer than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow (including monoblasts/promonocytes).
Dysplasia involving one or more myeloid lineages or, if myelodysplasia is absent or minimal, either an acquired clonal cytogenetic bone marrow abnormality or at least 3 months of persistent peripheral blood monocytosis, if all other causes are ruled out.
Clinical features of CMML include:[
4
,
5
]
Fever, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss. For more information, see 
Fatigue
, 
Hot Flashes and Night Sweats
, and 
Nutrition in Cancer Care
.
Infection.
Bleeding caused by  thrombocytopenia.
Hepatomegaly (in some patients).
Splenomegaly (in some patients). 
In patients with a WBC count that is within reference range or slightly decreased, clinical features may be identical to MDS.
In patients with elevated WBC count, features are more like chronic myeloproliferative disorders, including more frequent splenomegaly and hepatomegaly.
The median age at diagnosis of CMML is 65 to 75 years with a male predominance of 1.5 to 3.1.[
4
,
5
]  Because CMML is grouped with chronic myeloid leukemia in some epidemiologic surveys and with MDS in others, no reliable incidence data are available for CMML.[
6
]  Although the specific etiology of CMML is unknown, exposure to occupational and environmental carcinogens, ionizing radiation, and cytotoxic agents has been associated in some cases.[
6
]
Morphologically, the disease is characterized by a persistent peripheral blood monocytosis (always >1 × 10
9
/L) that may exceed 80 × 10
9
/L with monocytes typically accounting for more than 10% of the WBCs.[
4
,
5
]  Monocytes, though typically mature with an unremarkable morphology, can exhibit abnormal granulation, unusual nuclear lobation, or finely dispersed nuclear chromatin.[
7
]  Fewer than 20% blasts are seen in the blood or bone marrow.  Neutrophilia occurs in nearly 50% of patients with neutrophil precursors (e.g., promyelocytes and  myelocytes) accounting for more than 10% of the WBCs.[
8
]  Mild normocytic anemia is common.  Moderate thrombocytopenia is often present.  Bone marrow findings include:[
4
,
5
,
9
,
10
] 
Hypercellularity (75% of cases).
Blast count less than 20%.
Granulocytic proliferation (with dysgranulopoiesis).
Monocytic proliferation, dyserythropoiesis (e.g., megaloblastic changes, abnormal nuclear contours, ringed sideroblasts, etc.).
Micromegakaryocytes and/or megakaryocytes with abnormally lobated nuclei (as many as 80% of the cases).
Fibrosis (30% of the cases).
Hepatosplenomegaly may be present.[
4
,
5
]  Autoimmune phenomena, including pyoderma gangrenosum, vasculitis, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia have been observed in CMML.[
11
]  Care should be taken to identify cases of CMML with eosinophilia, a subtype of CMML, because of  its association with severe tissue damage secondary to eosinophil degranulation.  In CMML with eosinophilia, all criteria for CMML are present, and the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood is more than 1.5 × 10
9
/L.[
6
]  
Recurrent somatic pathogenic variants have been identified in most patients with CMML, resulting in altered signaling molecules (especially 
NRAS
, 
KRAS
, 
JAK2
, and 
SETBP1
), epigenetic regulators (especially 
TET2
 and 
ASXL1
), splicing factors (especially 
SRSF2
), and transcription factors (especially 
RUNX1
).[
12
-
15
] A CMML-specific prognostic scoring system can distinguish four risk groups based on the following factors:[
16
]
Red blood cell transfusion dependency.
WBC count at least 13 × 10
9
/L.
Bone marrow blasts at least 5%.
Genetic risk group based on cytogenetics (trisomy 8, ≥3 abnormalities on karyotype, or chromosome 7 abnormalities are high risk), and pathogenic variants in 
ASXL1
, 
NRAS
, 
RUNX1
, or 
SETBP1
.
The best prognostic group has a median survival of more than 10 years with no leukemic evolution in the first decade of follow-up. The worst prognostic group has a  median survival of 20 months with a 50% evolution to AML by 2 years.[
16
]
  Prognostic factors associated with shorter survival include:[
17
,
18
]         
Low hemoglobin level.
Low platelet count; high WBC, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts.
Presence of circulating immature myeloid cells.
High percentage of marrow blasts.
Low percentage of marrow erythroid cells.
Abnormal molecular genetic data.
High levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2-microglobulin.
Progression to acute leukemia occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of cases.[
17
,
18
]
CPSS-Mol is a CMML-specific prognostic scoring system that incorporates molecular genetic data, especially pathogenic variants in 
RUNX1
, 
NRAS
, 
SETBP1
, and 
ASXL1
. This system distinguishes low-risk disease with median survivals longer than 10 years from high-risk disease with median survivals of 2 to 4 years.[
16
]
Treatment Overview
CMML is a diagnosis typically made after age 70 years. The clinical course of CMML ranges from indolent or smoldering disease to an aggressive disease progression culminating in severe cytopenias or evolution to acute leukemia. Assessment of the risk factors and the pace of disease over time may help to distinguish patients who require therapy from those who would be best managed with a watchful waiting approach. Asymptomatic patients at low risk of progression may be best served by forgoing therapy.[
19
,
20
]
Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)
Patients with high-risk disease who are young enough and fit enough may undergo allogeneic SCT. This represents the only potential cure for CMML. Hypomethylating agents like azacitidine and decitabine are usually given prior to allogeneic SCT for cytoreduction or to ameliorate cytopenias.[
21
,
22
] Retrospective reports that included small numbers of patients with CMML (range, 12–80) who underwent allogeneic SCT reported recurrence rates of  20% to 40% and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of approximately 20% to 30%.[
23
-
28
][
Level of evidence C3
]
A retrospective review of 1,114 patients with CMML diagnosed between 2000 and 2014 included 384 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT.[
29
] With a median follow-up of 51 to 78 months (in two data sets), allogeneic SCT in patients with low-risk CMML was detrimental, with a 5-year OS rates of 20% for patients who underwent allogeneic SCT and 42% for patients who did not undergo allogeneic SCT (
P
 < .001).[
29
][
Level of evidence C1
] For patients with high-risk CMML, there was no statistically significant difference in 5-year OS rates among patients treated with or without allogeneic SCT (27% vs. 15%, respectively; 
P
 = .13).
Hypomethylating agents
Two randomized prospective clinical trials compared the hypomethylating agent, azacitidine, with best supportive  care in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The trials involved large numbers of patients with MDS but also included small numbers of patients (fewer than 25) with CMML.[
30
,
31
] The overall response rates exceeded 60% for all patients who received azacitidine, but the data did not allow an assessment specifically for patients with CMML.[
30
,
31
][
Level of evidence C3
] Several phase II trials reported response rates of 30% to 60% for patients with CMML who received hypomethylating agents.[
32
-
36
] Azacitidine and decitabine may reverse cytopenias, cytoreduce elevated WBC counts, reduce splenic size, and improve clinical symptoms (like decreased appetite or itching).
Hydroxyurea
Hydroxyurea has been given for other diseases with chronic myeloproliferation, such as thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis. These applications suggest the use of hydroxyurea for CMML with leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or splenomegaly.[
37
] In a randomized prospective clinical trial of 105 patients with CMML, hydroxyurea (up to 4 g/day) was compared with etoposide.[
38
] With a median follow-up of 11 months, the median OS was 20 months in patients who received hydroxyurea and 9 months in patients who received etoposide (
P
 < .0001).[
38
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Hypomethylating agent versus hydroxyurea
In a prospective randomized trial, 170 patients with newly diagnosed advanced CMML received intravenous decitabine or hydroxyurea (1–4 g/day). With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, there was no statistically significant difference in event-free survival (12.1 months for patients who received decitabine and 10.3 months for patients who received hydroxyurea; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59–1.16; 
P
 = .27). There was also no statistically significant difference in median OS (16.3 months for patients who received decitabine and 21.9 months for patients who received hydroxyurea; 
P
 = .67).[
39
][
Level of evidence A1
] Although decitabine reduced CMML progression or transformation to AML by 38% compared with hydroxyurea, this was offset by a 55% increase in deaths that were not caused by progression (the deaths were usually related to infection). There are no data to suggest that systematic antibiotic prophylaxis would have helped the patients who received decitabine.
Other regimens
In a phase II trial, 13 hypomethylating agent–naive patients with high-risk CMML were treated with azacitidine or decitabine plus venetoclax. With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall response rate was 85% (11 of 13 patients), including two with complete response and a median duration of response of 17.9 months.[
40
,
41
][
Level of evidence C3
] Six of these patients underwent subsequent allogeneic SCT.
 A retrospective study included 21 patients with high-risk CMML who received cladribine plus low-dose cytarabine alternating with azacitidine or decitabine. The patients had an objective response rate of 33% (50% in patients with hypomethylating agent–naive CMML and 23% in patients with hypomethylating agent–failure CMML).[
41
][
Level of evidence C3
] 
A phase I/II study of 23 patients with mostly high-risk MDS and greater than 5% marrow blast cells involved 10 patients with CMML. All patients received azacitidine plus venetoclax. With a median follow-up of 13.2 months, the overall response rate was 87% (95% CI, 66%–97%).[

Disease Overview
Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is a leukemic disorder that exhibits both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features at the time of diagnosis.  
Atypical CML is characterized pathologically by:[
1
]
Peripheral blood leukocytosis with increased numbers of mature and immature neutrophils.
Prominent dysgranulopoiesis.
No Philadelphia chromosome or 
BCR
::
ABL1
 gene fusion.
Neutrophil precursors (e.g.,  promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes) accounting for more than 10% of white blood cells.
Minimal absolute basophilia with basophils accounting for less than 2% of white blood cells.
Absolute monocytosis with monocytes typically account for less than 10% of white blood cells.
Hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic proliferation and granulocytic dysplasia.
Fewer than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow.
Thrombocytopenia.

Clinical features of aCML include:[
1
-
4
]
Anemia. For more information on anemia, see 
Fatigue
.
Thrombocytopenia.
Splenomegaly (in 75% of cases).
Although cytogenetic abnormalities are found in as many as 80% of the patients with aCML, none is specific.[

Dysgranulopoiesis
Megakaryocytic dysplasia.
Erythroid precursors accounting for more than 30% of marrow cells with dyserythropoiesis present (in some cases).
The median survival times for aCML are reported to be less than 20 months, and thrombocytopenia and marked anemia are poor prognostic factors.[

Treatment Overview

The optimal treatment of aCML is uncertain because of  the rare incidence of this chronic leukemic disorder. Treatment with hydroxyurea may lead to short-lived partial remissions of 2 to 4 months in duration.[

] Atypical CML appears to  respond poorly to treatment with interferon alfa.[

Disease Overview
Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC) (also known as mixed myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome, unclassifiable and overlap syndrome, unclassifiable) shows features of both myeloproliferative disease and myelodysplastic disease but does not meet the criteria for any of the other MDS/MPN entities.[
1
]
Diagnostic criteria for MDS/MPN-UC can be either:[
1
]
	The combination of four sets of criteria (a–d):
Clinical, laboratory, and morphological features of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (e.g., refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, and refractory anemia with excess of blasts) with fewer than 20% blasts in the blood and bone marrow.  For more information on anemia, see 
Fatigue
.
Prominent myeloproliferative features, e.g. platelet count greater than 600 × 10
9
/L associated with megakaryocytic proliferation, or white blood cell count greater than 13.0 × 10
9
/L with or without splenomegaly. 
No  history of an underlying chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD), MDS, or recent cytotoxic or growth factor therapy that could cause the myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative features.
No Philadelphia chromosome or 
BCR
::
ABL1
 gene fusion, del(5q), t(3;3)(q21;q26), or inv(3)(q21q26).
	Mixed myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic features that cannot be assigned to any other category of MDS, CMPD, or MDS/MPN.
Clinical characteristics of MDS/MPN-UC include:
Features of both MDS and CMPD.
Hepatomegaly.
Splenomegaly.
The incidence and etiology of MDS/MPN-UC are unknown.
Laboratory features typically include anemia and dimorphic erythrocytes on the peripheral blood smear.[
1
]  Thrombocytosis (platelet count >600 × 10
9
/L) or leukocytosis (white blood cell count >13 × 10
9
/L) are present.  Neutrophils may exhibit dysplastic features, and giant or hypogranular platelets may be present.  Blasts make up less than  20% of the white blood cells and of the nucleated cells of the bone marrow.  The bone marrow is hypercellular and may exhibit proliferation in any or all of the myeloid lineages. Dysplastic features are present in at least one cell line.[
1
]
No cytogenetic or molecular findings are available that are specific for MDS/MPN-UC.  In one small series, six of nine patients (those with ringed sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis [RARS-T]) had 
JAK2
 V617F variants, which caused constitutive activation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase. This 
JAK2
 pathogenic variant is also commonly observed in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis.[
2
] Because of  its rare occurrence, the prognosis and predictive factors are unknown.[
1
] 
Treatment Overview

Adult patients with MDS/MPN associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements are candidates for imatinib mesylate at standard dosages.[
3
] Because of its rare occurrence, the literature only minimally addresses other treatment options for MDS/MPN-UC.  Supportive care involves treating cytopenias and infection as necessary.
