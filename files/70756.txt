Incidence and nature of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) (dose escalation phase of Part A and B), A DLT is defined as a clinically significant AE (classified according to the NCI CTCAE version 5) or significant laboratory abnormality that occur during the DLT assessment periods, during dose escalation and dose expansion, and is considered by the Investigator to be related to GI-102., Study Day 1, assessed up to DLT period (3 weeks after treatment)|Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs) (dose escalation phase of Part A and B), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. All AE events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Study Day 1, assessed up to approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) (dose optimization phase of Part A, dose expansion phase of Part B, Part C and D), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with investigator-assessed objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels (as applicable to non-target lesions)., Study Day 1, assessed up to approximately 24 months

This is a phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor effect of GI-102 as a single agent and in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs, pembrolizumab or trastuzumab deruxtecan(T-DXd) over a range of advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. This study is adaptive in nature.

The study is composed of four parts:

* Part A: Dose escalation and optimization phase of GI-102 intravenous (IV) monotherapy

  * Part A dose escalation phase
  * Part A dose optimization phase: Dose optimization cohorts in patients with 2L+, CPI-refractory metastatic melanoma
* Part B: Dose escalation and expansion phase of GI-102 subcutaneous (SC) monotherapy
* Part C: Indication specific cohorts of GI-102 IV in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs or trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)
* Part D: Indication specific cohorts of GI-102 IV in combination with pembrolizumab

GI-102 is a novel bi-specific Fc fusion protein containing the CD80 ectodomain as an N-terminal moiety and an interleukin (IL)-2 variant as a C-terminal moiety configurated via a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) Fc. GI-102 has unique characteristics by having bispecificity to CD80 and IL2Rβγ. The CD80 portion is responsible for targeting tumor/immune cells while blocking CTLA-4 expressed on the Treg cells. The IL-2v of GI-102 is designed to abolish IL-2Rα affinity and therefore minimize the effect on Treg while it has very outstanding effect on NK and CD8 T cell proliferation and activity through IL-2Rbr affinity.
