Dose-Esc/Exp RMC4630 & Cobi in Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors & RMC4630& Osi in EGFR+ Locally Adv/Meta NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) proﬁles of RMC-4630 and cobimetinib in adult participants with relapsed/refractory solid tumors with specific genomic aberrations and to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) proﬁles of RMC-4630 and osimertinib in adult participants with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

DRUG: RMC-4630|DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Drug: Osimertinib
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)., An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical / an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product(s) was also an AE. All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of intervention until the safety visit or EOT visit, whichever is later. The number of safety-evaluable participants who experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE was reported per protocol., AEs were collected from the start of intervention through 30 days post last day of study drug taken. Participants were monitored/assessed for adverse events for a maximum of 17 months which includes a maximum duration of 16 months on treatment.|Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Any toxicities occurring during the DLT observation period (cycle 1) that were considered R/T study treatment, including GR4 AEs; GR3 febrile neutropenia or hemorrhage; GR3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; GR ≥2 pneumonitis; GR3 hypertension or rash which does not improve or remains uncontrolled for \>5 or more days despite maximal supportive care; GR3 non hematologic AEs that remain uncontrolled for \>72 hours despite maximal supportive care; Concurrent elevation of AST or ALT \>3 × ULN \& total bilirubin \>2 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) \>1.5 in the absence of cholestasis and other causes; Grade 3 QTcF prolongation based on a triplicate ECG; Ejection fraction \<50% with an absolute decrease of \>10% from baseline; Retinal vein occlusion any grade; 50% or less dose intensity of RMC4630 and/or cobimetnib or osimertinib due to study drug related toxicity. Refer to protocol for further details., Cycle 1: Study Day 1 - Study Day 28 (28 days)

ORR and the corresponding 95% two-sided confidence interval were derived., Response assessment occurs from the start of intervention until the date of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.
This open-label, phase 1b/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RMC-4630 in combination with cobimetinib in participants with relapsed/refractory solid tumors; and of RMC-4630 in combination with osimertinib in adult participants with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
