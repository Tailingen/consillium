NeoTAILOR: ABiomarker-directed Approach to Guide Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With Stage II/III ER-positive, HER2-negative Breast Cancer
This study aims to utilize a novel biomarker-driven approach to guide neoadjuvant treatment selection. It is the hypothesis that this will improve clinical response for postmenopausal women with clinical stage II/III ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and identify those who may not require neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a primary focus on outcomes in Black patients.

Objective response rate (ORR) by breast MRI in the combined low-risk plus high-risk endocrine-sensitive groups (pooled endocrine therapy-responders), * ORR is defined as patients achieving clinical complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1.
* Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Residual lesions thought to be non-malignant should be further investigated before CR can be accepted.
* Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of measures of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)

* Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Residual lesions thought to be non-malignant should be further investigated before CR can be accepted.
* Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of measures of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Objective response rate (ORR) by breast MRI in the high-risk endocrine-resistant group (high risk patients with week 4 Ki67 > 10% post anastrozole), * ORR is defined as patients achieving clinical complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to modified RECIST v1.1.
* Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Residual lesions thought to be non-malignant should be further investigated before CR can be accepted.
* Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of measures of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)
Risk category is defined as follows:

* Low risk:

  * Baseline Ki67 ≤ 10% (OR)
  * Luminal A molecular intrinsic subtype by PAM50
* High risk:

  * Non-Luminal A molecular intrinsic subtype by PAM50 (OR)
  * In cases of non-diagnostic PAM50 molecular intrinsic subtype, patients will enroll in the high-risk group and undergo Week 4 tumor biopsy.
