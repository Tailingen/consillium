Evaluation of a Cancer Lysate Vaccine and Montanide (Registered Trademark) ISA-51 VG With or Without the IL-15 Super-Agonist N-803 as Adjuvant Therapy for PD-L1 Negative Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Background:

Surgery is the primary treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is diagnosed in its earlier stages. But the tumors often return. Radiation and chemotherapy can improve survival in some people who have had surgery for NSCLC, but these treatments also cause serious side effects. A new approach, called immunotherapy, may be a better way to stop NSCLC tumors from coming back.

Objective:

To test a new treatment (H1299 lung cancer cell vaccine combined with the drug N-803) in people who received surgery for NSCLC.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 years or older with no sign of disease after surgery for NSCLC.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. They will have tests of their heart and lung function. They will have imaging scans.

Study treatment will be given in 28-day cycles. Participants will visit the clinic on the first day of each cycle. They will receive 2 treatments at each visit:

The study vaccine is given as 2-4 small shots under the skin of the thigh or arm.

N-803 is given as a shot under the skin of the abdomen.

Treatment will continue for 6 cycles. Blood tests and imaging scans will be repeated throughout the study.

Participants will have a blood test 1 month after receiving the 6th vaccine. Some participants may then resume taking N-803; they may also receive 2 more vaccinations at 3 and 6 months after their previous treatment.

Follow-up visits will continue for up to 5 years.

Phase II Component: To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to purified CT-X and autosomal CT antigens in NSCLC participants following vaccinations with H1299 cancer cell lysate and Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant in combination with N-803, Analyses which investigate immunologic responses to a panel of CT antigens in vaccinated participants. Serologic response will be defined as new antibody reactivity to a CT antigen, increased titer of an existing antibody, or IgM-to-IgG class switch following vaccination. Cell Mediated response will be evaluated using Elispot or comparable assays.CT X antigen reactivity assessed by peripheral blood assays one month following the first six vaccinations, and every 6 months during retreatment., 1 month following first 6 vaccinations, and every 6 months during retreatment|Phase I Component: To determine the safety of H1299 lung cancer cell lysate vaccines administered with Montanide (Registered Trademark) ISA-51 VG adjuvant and N-803, Assessment of safety and tolerability of the lysate vaccine regimen (DL1 and/or DL-1) with N-803 as determined by the frequency and severity of adverse events: AEs assessed by laboratory evaluations (before each cycle, every 2 weeks between vaccines 1 \&amp; 2, at each treatment evaluation, and at the safety visit) and queries (before each cycle, at each treatment evaluation and at safety visit) from the start of study intervention through 30 days after the last dose of vaccine. Unsolicited AEs are assessed throughout the study including beyond safety visit., before each cycle, every 2 weeks between vaccines 1 &amp; 2 (AE only), at each treatment evaluation, and at the safety visit
To determine disease-free survival (DFS) in lung cancer participants receiving adjuvant H1299 lung cancer cell lysate vaccines administered with Montanide (Registered Trademark) ISA-51 VG and N-803, Overall Survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) determined from the on-study date until date of death, disease recurrence, loss of immune response, or last follow-up as appropriate using the Kaplan-Meier method. DFS by scans every 12 weeks while on treatment or continued treatment, and during follow up every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for another 2 years or through disease progression ending at time of final DFS evaluation for each participant at 5 years post enrollment., every 12 weeks while on treatment, during follow up for every 3 months for 3 years then every 6 months for 2 years or disease progression, final DFS evaluation visit
Background:

* Cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA), particularly those encoded by genes on the X chromosome (CT-X antigens) have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy.
* Recent studies suggest that CT-X antigens which are up regulated by epigenetic mechanisms may be preferentially expressed in pluripotent stem/tumor initiating cells that mediate treatment resistance and metastasis of human cancers.
* Whereas pulmonary malignancies express a variety of CT-X antigens, immune responses to these proteins are uncommon in lung cancer patients due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, epigenetic repression of genes regulating antigen processing/presentation, and local as well as systemic immunosuppression in these individuals.
* Conceivably, vaccination of lung cancer patients with tumor cells expressing high levels of CT-X antigens in combination with regimens that inhibit immunosuppressive functions of T regulatory cells and enhance activity of natural killer (NK) cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens.

Primary Objectives:

* Phase I Component: To determine the safety of H1299 lung cancer cell lysate vaccines administered with Montanide (Registered Trademark) ISA-51 VG adjuvant and N-803.
* Phase II Component: To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to purified CT-X and autosomal CT antigens in NSCLC participants following vaccinations with H1299 cancer cell lysate and Montanide (Registered Trademark) ISA-51 VG adjuvant in combination with N-803.

Eligibility:

* Participants with pathologically confirmed Stage IB-IIIA (T2a-T4/N0, T1-T3N1, T1-T2/N2) NSCLC per 8th edition TNM Staging System non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have no clinical evidence of active disease (NED) following standard therapy completed within the past 12 weeks.
* Participants must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0-2.
* Participants must have adequate bone marrow, kidney, liver, lung, and cardiac function.
* Participants receiving systemic immunosuppressive medications will be excluded.
* Participants with HIV will be excluded.

Design:

* Following recovery from surgery, and adjuvant therapy if indicated, eligible participants will be vaccinated via deep subcutaneous (SQ) injection with H1299 cell lysate and Montanide (Registered Trademark) ISA-51 VG (Trademark) adjuvant with or without subcutaneous N-803 monthly until six vaccinations have been given.
* Imaging studies will be performed at baseline, one month following the 3rd and 6th vaccinations, and at post-treatment follow-up (every 3 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for another 2 years, for 5 years total follow-up).
* Leukapheresis will be performed at baseline and at treatment evaluation one month following completion of the six vaccinations.
* Systemic toxicities and immunologic responses to therapy will be recorded.
* Pre- and post-vaccination serologic and cell mediated responses to a panel of CT-X antigens will be assessed before and one month following completion of the six vaccinations.
* Individuals deemed to have responded to vaccine treatment and exhibit no evidence of disease recurrence or secondary malignancy will be eligible for 2 additional vaccinations at 3 months after receiving the sixth vaccine and 6 months after receiving the 6th vaccine with N-803.
* Numbers and percentages of immune subsets, soluble factors, and cytokines in peripheral blood will be assessed before and after the six vaccinations.
* Immunologic responses to autologous tumor cells (if available) as well as pooled lung cancer stem cell vs. normal lung-induced pluripotent stem cell (Lu-iPSC) lysates will be evaluated in an exploratory manner.
* Up to 28 participants may receive study intervention on this protocol.
