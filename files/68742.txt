BT062 in Combination With Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to test safety and anti-tumor activity of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone to define the best doses for treating patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: BT062 , intravenous administration
Determination of optimal dose of BT062 (Phase I part), The Phase I part will follow a standard dose escalation design with at least 3 patients per dose level to define optimal dose of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. Optimal dose will be defined by dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during Cycle 1 (28 days)., 6 months|Evaluation of response (Phase IIa part), Response to treatment with optimal dose of BT062 (defined in Phase I part) in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone will be evaluated at baseline and at start of each Cycle (every 28 days). Response evaluation will be primarily based on assessment of M-protein and serum free light chains. If clinically required bone marrow analysis, plasmacytoma evaluation, and skeletal survey will be performed., 18 months
Qualitative toxicities of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone, Safety will be assessed at each visit by incidence of adverse events and by clinically significant changes in the patients physical examination, vital signs, and clinically laboratory results, 24 months|Pharmacokinetics of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone, Pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed from plasma by measuring intact BT062 and free maytansinoid (DM4), 24 months|Assessment of Time To Event end points, Based on the response evaluation, the following Time To Event end points will be evaluated: Time To Progression, Progression Free Survival, Time To Next Treatment, Duration Of Response, Overall survival., 24 months|Quantitative toxicities of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone, Safety will be assessed at each visit by incidence of adverse events and by clinically significant changes in the patients physical examination, vital signs, and clinically laboratory results, 24 months
BT062 is an antibody-drug conjugate designed to bind and destroy Myeloma cells. The study drug is being given in multiple doses with standard Multiple Myeloma treatments, lenalidomide and dexamethasone, to test how well the treatments are tolerated and work together. This study is a dose escalation study with the purpose to find out the highest dose of BT062 that a subject can tolerate in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
