Before colonoscopy, gastroenterology specialists stratified eligible patients according to 1) colorectal cancer screening, 2) positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results or gastrointestinal symptoms, and 3) follow-up colonoscopy after colorectal polyp treatment. Patients were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either colonoscopy with enhanced white light imaging (E-WLI group) or high-definition conventional white light imaging (WLI group) during both insertion and withdrawal phases. Randomization was based on random number lists generated by the coordinating center for each participating site. Endoscopists performing the procedures were not involved in generating the randomization sequence. All procedures were performed by experienced endoscopists at participating centers (\>2000 colonoscopy screenings). All procedures utilized endoscopes with "Xiaohua Tanying" technology that incorporated E-WLI functionality. Bowel preparation was assessed and graded by the performing endoscopist using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Endoscopy specialists and healthcare facility staff followed standard procedures for patient management and monitoring, including anesthesia. Cecal intubation was verified by the endoscopist through photographic documentation identifying the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. Insertion and withdrawal times were measured through video recording analysis, excluding time spent on therapeutic interventions and washing. Endoscopists were required to maintain a minimum withdrawal inspection time of 6 minutes (with at least 2 minutes each for right colon, transverse colon, and left colon). Regardless of group assignment (E-WLI or WLI), when polyps were detected during the procedure, they were observed using both WLI and E-WLI (2 modes), with images captured in each mode. The location, size, and morphology (Paris classification) of all polyps were documented. All polyps were removed (or biopsied if unresectable), and pathological results were obtained. For hyperplastic polyps in the rectum, if more than 3 diminutive polyps were present, only the first 3 detected polyps required management.
