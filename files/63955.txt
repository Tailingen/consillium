A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Treatment Combinations in Patients With Melanoma (Morpheus-Melanoma)
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of treatment combinations in cancer immunotherapy (CIT)-naive participants with resectable Stage III melanoma (Cohort 1) and in participants with Stage IV melanoma (Cohort 2). The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, and modify the participant population.
