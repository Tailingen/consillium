Effect of Surgeon Volume on Outcome of Pancreaticoduodenectomy
The independent impact of surgeon volume on outcome of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in a high-volume Institution was assessed. A significant reduction of pancreatic fistula rate was found in the high-volume surgeon group in comparison with low-volume surgeon group. However, no difference between groups was found in mortality, major complications, and hospital stay.
Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreatic Surgery
PROCEDURE: Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Postoperative mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy within 30 days of discharge, 30 days after discharge
Postoperative morbidity rate measuring the following complications: pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula, delayed gastric emptying, infectious complications, bleeding, cardiovascular complications, respiratory complications., 30 days post-discharge|Postoperative hospital stay. Measuring the length of hospital stay., At day of discharge
Objectives: To define the independent impact of surgeon volume on outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a single high-volume institution.

Summary Background Data: The impact of surgeon volume on PD outcome is still controversial. So far, data available are from retrospective multi-institutional reviews, considering in-hospital mortality as the only outcome variable.

Methods: Prospectively collected data on 610 patients who underwent PD from August 2001 to August 2009 were analyzed. Cut-off value to categorize high and low-volume surgeons (HVS and LVS, respectively) was 18 PD/year. Primary endpoint was operative mortality (death within 30-day post-discharge). Secondary endpoints were morbidity, pancreatic fistula (PF) and length of stay. Demographic, clinical, and surgical variables were recorded.
