Evaluation of the Thyroid Volume After Radiofrequency Ablation of Thyroid Nodules and Recurrent Thyroid
Thyroid nodules are among the common alterations of the thyroid. Depending on the detection method the prevalence is between 20% and 50%, whereas the incidence increases with improvement of ultrasonic technology. The CelonPro Surge bipolar coagulation electrode operated with the compatible power control unit and compatible tube pump is indicated for ablation and coagulation of soft tissue, including thermal inactivation and/or volume reduction of locally defined tissue areas, such as tumors and metastases.

The primary objective of the study is to assess the influence of radiofrequency ablation due to thyroid volume after 24 hours, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
Thyroid Nodule
DEVICE: Celon Pro Surge
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate reduction of thyroid volume following radiofrequency ablation of thyroid tissue, The primary endpoint is the reduction of thyroid volume at 12-Month follow-up visit. A responder to the radiofrequency treatment is defined as a subject with any reduction of the thyroid volume., 1 year
