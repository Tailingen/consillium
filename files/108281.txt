PROPHYLAXIS OF GVH IN ELDERLY PATIENTS RECEIVING HAPLOIDENTICAL ALLOGENIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRASNPLANTATION USE OF A LOW DOSE ANTI-LYMPHOCYTIC SERUM
The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of GVH prophylaxis reinforced by low-dose Thymoglobulin administered at the end of aplasia after haploidentical allogeneic transplantation.

Patients will receive a single infusion of Thymoglobulin at a dose of 1 mg/kg between 48h and 72h after emergence from aplasia, and will be followed for 12 months.
