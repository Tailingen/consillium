A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Feasibility of Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Prophylaxis With Decitabine Combined With Filgrastim for Children and Young Adults With AML, MDS and Related Myeloid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to examine if it is feasible to administer decitabine and filgrastim after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) in children and young adults with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and related myeloid disorders, and if the treatment is effective in preventing relapse after HCT.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Decitabine (a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor)
* Filgrastim (a recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Myeloid Malignancies|MDS|Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome|Myeloid Neoplasm|Aml
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Filgrastim
Feasibility Failure Rate (FFR), Feasibility failure relates to decitabine exposure in the setting of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) maintenance and in combination with filgrastim; FFR is defined as the proportion of participants that do not initiate at least 5 of 6 planned cycles and/or receive fewer than 22/30 overall planned decitabine doses during maintenance phase., Treatment duration up to 6 cycles (28 days/cycle) or 168 days
24-Month Probability Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from HCT until evidence of relapse of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia, or death from any cause. Participants without an event are censored at the date of last follow-up., Up to 24 months|24-Month Probability Overall Survival (OS), OS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from HCT to death or censored at date of last follow-up, Up to 24 months|Treatment Tolerability Rate (TTR), Tolerability is based on select adverse events (AE) deemed probably of definitely related to decitabine; TTR is the proportion of participants with grade 4 non-hematologic (NH) AEs except infection and febrile neutropenia, grade 3 NH AEs causing a delay in treatment by \>14 days, and hematologic AEs including ANC\<500 cells/uL or platelet count\<10,000 cells for \>1 week despite supportive care as well as day 28 ANC and platelet target levels or graft failure., Up to the end of cycle 6 (28 days/cycle), or 168 days + 36 days post-treatment
This is a single arm, pilot study to determine if sequential cycles of maintenance therapy with decitabine and filgrastim post allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are feasible and effective in preventing relapse after HCT in pediatric and young adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and treatment related myeloid malignancies (tAML/MDS) with either idiopathic disease or underlying germline disorders, including a subset that may be at higher risk for toxicity from treatment.

Decitabine in combination with filgrastim after stem cell transplant has been shown to be effective in a large study that included mainly adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits and blood tests. Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates will be performed as standard of care.

Participants will receive study treatment for 6 months if tolerated and will be followed for 24 months after stem cell transplant.

It is expected about 37 people will take part in this research study.
