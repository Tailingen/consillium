Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide
To assess the efficacy, To compare the percentage of response in term of complete response, partial response, minimal and stable disease in the 2 arms o treatment, from 8 to 12 months|To assess the toxicity, To evaluate the toxicity in the 2 arms of treatment utilized the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 3.0, From 1 to 12 months
To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS) in the 2 arms of treatment, OS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment after diagnosis of multiple myeloma to the date of last follow up examination or the date of death from any cause, From 1 to 60 months|To evaluate the Duration of Remission (DR) in the 2 arms of treatment, DR was defined from the date of Complete Remission, Partial Remission, Minimal response after the completion of MPT or MP cycles to the date of disease progression or the date of last follow up examination, From 8 to 60 months
