Pivotal Influence of Obesity on Body Composition and Ovarian Doppler in Different Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Phenotypes
The study aimed to explore the impact of obesity on both body composition and ovarian Doppler parameters across various phenotypes of females diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, the investigation seeked to establish correlations between these parameters and their prevalence concerning the clinical criteria of PCOS.

Phenotypes of PCOS, The patients were categorized into four distinct phenotypes: Type I, characterized by oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism (O+H); Type II, exhibiting polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism (P+H); Type III, featuring oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and polycystic ovaries (O+P); and Type IV, presenting with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, polycystic ovaries, and hyperandrogenism (O+P+H)., 4 months|Body mass index (BMI), The height and weight were determined for each female in the three groups to calculate her BMI = (weight in kg)/(height in m2), 4 months|Waist hip ratio (WHR), The waist and hip circumferences were taken for each female in the three groups for calculating waist and hip ratio (WHR) by dividing waist circumference (WC) on the hip circumference (HC)., 4 months|Total and regional fat mass, They were measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry., 4 months|Total and regional lean mass, They were measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry., 4 months|Ovarian volume, The ovarian volume was computed utilizing the ellipsoid formula, which involves multiplying the dimensions of length, width, and height by a constant factor of 0.523., 4 months|Peak systolic velocity (PSV), It was recorded for each female in the three groups by Color Doppler ultrasound., 4 months|End diastolic velocity (EDV), It was recorded for each female in the three groups by Color Doppler ultrasound., 4 months|Resistive index (RI), The Resistance Index (RI) was determined by dividing the difference between Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) and End Diastolic Velocity (EDV) by PSV. A lower value of RI is indicative of increased blood flow, 4 months|Pulsatility index (PI), The Pulsatility Index (PI) was calculated by dividing the difference between Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) and End Diastolic Velocity (EDV) by the mean maximum flow velocity. A reduced PI value is indicative of heightened blood flow., 4 months
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and multifactorial condition characterized by endocrinological, reproductive, metabolic, and biochemical abnormalities, affecting 12% to 21% of reproductive-aged females. It has emerged as a significant global public health concern. However, variations in diagnostic criteria and patient selection have led to considerable discrepancies in the absolute prevalence of PCOS and its temporal trends. Previous studies have examined ovarian volume and blood flow indices in both obese and non-obese females with PCOS, albeit employing different criteria for obesity classification. Notably, none have compared these parameters across normal weight, overweight, and obese PCOS females. Therefore, the current study aims to explore the impact of obesity on body composition and ovarian Doppler parameters within distinct PCOS phenotypes. An additional objective is to assess correlations between anthropometric, body composition, and ovarian Doppler parameters and the prevalence of PCOS symptoms.
