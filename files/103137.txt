AMG 386 Drug-Drug Interaction Study With Paclitaxel
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when given alone and in combination with AMG 386 to determine whether AMG 386 alters the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AMG 386|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel PK parameters, Paclitaxel PK parameters with and without the co-administration of AMG 386., 9 weeks
AMG 386 PK parameters, AMG 386 PK steady state PK parameters with and without paclitaxel co-administration, 9 weeks|Safety, Subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events: Assessments include physical examinations, vitals, clinical laboratories, and electrocardiograms (ECG) â€¢ Results of safety laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and ECG measurments, Average of 6 months|Safety, Incidence of anti-AMG 386 antibody formation, Average of 6 months
Eligible subjects enrolled in the study will begin receiving paclitaxel on a three weeks on / one week off schedule at study day 1 and weekly AMG 386 beginning at study day 8. The pharmacokinetic portion of the study occurs during the first two study cycles with intensive PK collections on study weeks 1, 6 and 8. Once the pharmacokinetic assessment period is completed, continued combination therapy with AMG 386 and paclitaxel or single-agent AMG 386 will be administered at the investigator's discretion until progression, unacceptable toxicity develops, or study withdrawal.
