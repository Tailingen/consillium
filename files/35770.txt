Study of Default Options in Advance Directives
Default options represent the events or conditions that are set into place if no alternatives are actively chosen. The setting of default options has well-established effects on a broad range of human decisions, but its influence on patients' preferences for end-of-life care is only beginning to be understood.

This is a 3-armed randomized clinical trial in Veterans at high risk for critical illness, assessing the impact of Advance Directive (AD) forms framed with different default options. The central goals are to assess how default options in ADs influence the end-of-life care choices made by patients at risk for critical care, and these patients' hospital and ICU utilization.

The investigators hypothesize that setting defaults in real ADs will increase the proportion of Veterans selecting comfort-oriented plans of care, decrease selections of life-extending therapies such as mechanical ventilation and dialysis, and reduce the proportion of time during follow-up that Veterans spend in the hospital and/or ICU, without affecting patient satisfaction with end-of-life care planning.
COPD|Severe or Very Severe Airflow Obstruction and/or Receiving or Eligible to Receive Long-term Oxygen Therapy|Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis|Other Interstitial Lung Disease Without Curative Therapy|Congestive Heart Failure|NYHA Class IV or NYHA Class III Plus 1 Hospitalization in the Past Year|Malignancy|Any Stage 3B or 4 Solid Tumor
OTHER: Comfort Default AD forms|OTHER: Life Extension Default AD forms|OTHER: Standard Default AD forms
Evaluate how the setting of defaults influences the proportion of Veterans selecting comfort-oriented plans of care in real ADs, The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in each of the 3 groups who select a general plan of care that prioritizes comfort over life extension., 18 months
Assess the influence of default options in ADs on Veterans' selections of specific life-extending therapies, The proportions of patients electing to receive each of the 5 specific life-extending interventions, 18 months|Determine whether setting defaults in ADs influences the proportion of time during follow-up that Veterans spend in the hospital or ICU, The proportion of time during a 6-18 month follow-up (median 1 year) that patients spend in the hospital or ICU for each AD group, 18 months
To document feasibility of a study of Advance Directives in the Veteran population, To document our ability to recruit and retain patients with advanced diseases, we will measure the proportions of patients approached for consent who enroll (consent rate), the proportion of such patients who complete their AD (completion rate), and the proportion who subsequently complete their advance care satisfaction interview (retention rate)., 18 months
