A Trial to Investigate the Efficacy of Bendamustine in Patients With Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Refractory to Rituximab.
To compare the efficacy of bendamustine against treatment of physician's choice on progression-free survival in subjects with indolent B-cell NHL.
Indolent B-cell NHL
DRUG: Bendamustine IV|OTHER: Treatment of Physicians Choice
Progression-free survival, Screening of 14 days, prior to ramdomisation. 8 cycles of 21 days, then follow up every 3 months after end of last cycle until disease progression, then every 6 months., 8 cycles of 21 days, then follow up every 3 months
Overall Response Rate, Complete remission (CR)/partial remission (PR), Duration of response (DR), Overall survival (OS), Safety and tolerability, Change in health related quality of life (HRQL) measures, 8 cycles of 21 days, then follow up every 3 months until progressive disease, then every 6 months for overall survival
To test whether bendamustine will improve progression-free survival in subjects with indolent B-cell NHL that did not respond (stable disease or progressive disease) to rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen during or within 6 months of the last rituximab treatment compared to treatment of physican's choice.
