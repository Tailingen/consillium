Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: AK104
ORR, objective response rate, 24 months|DCR, disease control rate, 24 months|DoR, duration of overall response, 24 months|TTR, time to resolve, 24 months|AE, adverse event, 24 months
PFS, progression-free survival, 24 months|OS, overall survival, 24 months
AK104 10mg/kg plus TC regimen(paclitaxel liposome 135mg/m2, carboplatin AUC=5), once every 3 weeks (Q3W), induction treatment for 2 cycles; Subsequently, AK104 10 mg/kg plus TC regimen(paclitaxel liposome 135mg/m2, carboplatin AUC=5) is combined with radiotherapy(50Gy/25F) for 2 cycles. Assess disease efficiency( objective response rate; disease control rate; duration of overall response; time to resolve) and safety( adverse event).
