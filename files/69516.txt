CT-322 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme and Combination Therapy With Irinotecan
RATIONALE: CT-322 may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving CT-322 together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase 2 trial is studying the side effects, tolerability, and efficacy of CT-322 when given alone and in combination with irinotecan to patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors|Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: CT-322|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
Safety and tolerability of CT-322 when administered alone or in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (Part 1), 15 Â± 5 days post the last dose of study drug|Progression-free survival at 6 months (Part 2), Measured upon initiation of cycles 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and end of study
To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of CT-322 (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, T-HALF) derived from plasma concentration vs time for CT-322 given alone and in combination with irinotecan, Part 1: cycle 1, days 1-3, day 5 or 6, days 8, 15, and 22; cycles 2-4, 6, 9, and 12, day 1; EOS and follow up visits. Part 2: cycle 1, days 1, 8, 15, and 22; cycles 2-4, 6, 9, and 12, day 1; EOS and follow up visits.|To assess the presence of anti CT-322 antibodies, Part 1: cycle 1, days 1 and 15; cycles 2-4, 6, 9, and 12, day 1; EOS and follow up visits. Part 2: cycle 1, days 1 and 15; cycles 2-4, 6, 9, and 12, day 1; EOS and follow up visits.|To assess the biological activity of CT-322 as measured by plasma biological markers and neuroimaging, Part 1: cycle 1, days 1, 2, 8, 15 and 22; cycles 2-4, 6, 9, and 12, day 1; EOS visit. Part 2: cycle 1, days 1, 8, 15 and 22; cycles 2-4, 6, 9, and 12 EOS visit.
