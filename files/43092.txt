Compassionate Use Study of NHWD-870 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas Carrying NUT Rearrangement
The NHWD-870 Phase I clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with advanced tumors. The objectives of this retrospective study were to preliminarily evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of NHWD-870 HCl in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas and to preliminarily evaluate biomarkers associated with the efficacy of NHWD-870 HCl in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas, to provide a basis for identifying the enriched population for the late-stage trial.
