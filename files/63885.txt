Effect of Cabazitaxel on the QTc Interval in Cancer Patients
Primary Objective:

* To assess the potential effect on QTcF interval (QTc Fridericia) of cabazitaxel in cancer patients

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the effects of cabazitaxel on heart rate (HR), QT, QTcB (Bazett's correction), and QTcN (population specific correction) intervals
* To assess the clinical safety of cabazitaxel
* To assess cabazitaxel plasma concentrations at Cycle 1 at early timepoints (during infusion and up to 5h post end of infusion)
Neoplasms, Malignant
DRUG: Cabazitaxel (XRP6258)

The main period of the study consists of a maximum of 21-day screening phase, then first 2 treatment cycles with cabazitaxel. End of main period will be Cycle 3 or 30 days after last dose if patient discontinues study after 1 or 2 treatment cycles. The duration for a patient for the main period of the study will be about 9 to 10 weeks (screening, 2 cycles).

After Cycle 2, patients will have the option to continue to receive cabazitaxel and should be followed for safety reporting until 30 days after the last dose of cabazitaxel.
