Nivolumab and Ipilimumab +/- UV1 Vaccination as Second Line Treatment in Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma
The objective of the study is to induce a meaningful progression-free survival benefit in patients with Malign Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy, by treating with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without UV1 vaccine.

Evaluation of efficacy of ipilimumab and nivolumab With or without UV1 vaccine in patients With inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma progressing after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy., Progression-free survival (PFS) per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) assessed by radiologic assessments, Monitoring for change in imaging evalated tumor lesions indicating progression throughout the trial until 5 years of follow-up has past.
Response evaluation, Comparison of response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (Modified RECIST), in patients who receive nivolumab and ipilimumab with patients who receive nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with UV1., Throughout the trial. Radiological assessments every 6th week during the first year, every 12th week for the next 5 years.|Evaluation of patient reported outcomes (PRO), To evaluate changes from baseline in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients who receive nivolumab and ipilimumab compared to patients who receive nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with UV1., every other week for the first 12 weeks, every 6th week thereafter|Evaluation of Adverse Events and discontinuation rate of patients, To determine the safety and tolerability of patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab With or without UV1 vaccination by monitoring AEs and study drug discontinuation due to AEs.

tolerability in patients who receive nivolumab and ipilimumab compared to patients who receive nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with UV1, measured by adverse events (AE) and study drug discontinuations due to AEs., Continuously, and until 90 days after discontinuation of study treatment.
Assessment of repertoire of TCR specificities induced by UV1 vaccination, Generating TCR repertoire data and comparing differences pre- and post treatment between the two treatment arms, blood samples collected at screening, week 6, week 12 and week 18/19.|Investigate whether there is a correlation between baseline tumor mutational burden (TMB) and response to therapy, Characterization of TMB pre- and post-treatment by DNA analyses of tumor and normal tissue to identify tumor-specific somatic mutations, and comparing results to clinical outcome data., In tissue collected at screening, week 5/6, and study completion, at most 2 years.|investigate whether there is a difference in the immune cell infiltrate in the tumor pre- and post treatment With UV1 and check point inhibition., By characterizing qualitative and quantitative differences in markers of immune activation within tumor samples pre and post therapy by immunohistochemistry., In tissue collected at screening, week 5/6, and study completion, at most 2 years.|Investigate whether UV1 vaccination induces hTERT-specific T cells in the blood of patients treated., By detection of vaccine-specific T cells in PBMC harvested from patients by T cell proliferation assays, blood samples collected at pre-defined evaluation points throughout study completion, at most 2 years.|Investigate whether DTH response correlates With detection of a vaccine-specific T cell response in blood, The trial will compare DTH measurements With vaccine-specific T-cell response in blood., blood samples collected atat pre-defined evaluation points throughout study completion, at most 2 years.|Investigate whether there is a correlation between the microenvironment in feces and treatment response., Stool samples will be collected and data on microbial gut composition for each patient will be correlated With treatment outcome., blood samples collected at at pre-defined evaluation points throughout study completion, at most 2 years.
Several studies have investigated the use of checkpoint inhibition in Malign Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). Most of them are small studies investigating the efficacy of single-agent immunotherapy in few patients. Given that the combination of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy with CTLA-4 has been shown in other cancers to enhance treatment effect, combined checkpoint inhibitor treatment has also been investigated in patients with MPM. Although these results are encouraging, the response rates seen are moderate compared to what has been documented for the combination of checkpoint inhibitors in other cancer indications. An approach to further enhance the PFS and response rate in MPM may be to use a vaccine aiming to activate an immune response directed against tumor-related antigens, and to combine the vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors. The proposed study will evaluate the use of the therapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab after progression on standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

The objective of the study is to induce a meaningful progression-free survival benefit in patients with MPM after progression on first line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy, by treating with nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without UV1.

The primary end-point (PFS) is expected to be analyzed in 2023.
