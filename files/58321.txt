Hormone Suppression and Radiation Therapy for 6 Months With/Without Docetaxel for High Risk Prostate Cancer
This randomized study is looking at the benefits of using docetaxel (chemotherapy) added to one of the standard treatments (radiation and hormones) for men with high-risk prostate cancer.

10-Year Restricted Mean Survival Time for Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of random assignment to death from any cause, censored at the date of last follow-up in surviving patients. The 10-Year Restricted Mean Survival Time was calculated as the area under the Kaplan Meier plot for OS, from randomization to 10-years follow-up, Following the end of RT patients were seen for follow up every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter, 10 years.
10-year Biochemical Recurrence (PSA Failure), Time to biochemical recurrence was defined as the time from date of random assignment to the earliest of PSA failure or initiation of salvage therapy, or censored at the date of last disease assessment for those without PSA failure. PSA failure was defined according to the 2006 RTOG-ASTRO Phoenix definition (i.e., A PSA rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir).

10-year biochemical recurrence rate was estimated from a competing risk model where non-prostate cancer death was counted as competing risk., PSA was measured following the end of RT, then every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter, 10 years|10-year Prostate Cancer Mortality, Measured from the date of random assignment to date of death from prostate cancer, or censored at the date of last follow-up in surviving patients. Patients who died due to other reasons were counted as competing risk in a competing risk model., Following the end of RT patients were seen for follow up every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter, 10 years.|Number of Participants With Acute Adverse Events, Adverse acute events were reported via the clinical database only for toxicities considered reportable via the SAE mechanism (those of grade 2 and grade 3 events that are unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely related/associated with treatment; or all grade 4 and grade 5 events). Common Toxicity Criteria Volume 3.0 (CTCAE) is used for this study., During study treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study, up to 7.2 months from randomization|Number of Participants With Late Adverse Events, Any Grade and Attribution, Late adverse events will be focused on GU/GI including Urinary/Fecal Incontinence, Hematuria, Diarrhea, Rectal Bleeding and other., Every 6 months post radiation therapy for 5 years (+/-90 days), then annually, up to 13.9 years from randomization
Radiation therapy plus six months of hormone therapy is one standard way of treating men with high-risk prostate cancer. In this study, we want to see whether or not adding the chemotherapy drug docetaxel (Taxotere)will make this treatment more effective. Docetaxel has shown a benefit in median survival when given to men who have become resistant to hormonal therapy and in men who have metastatic prostate cancer (spread to other areas of the body).
