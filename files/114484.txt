ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) Protocol Implementation in Piedmont Region for Colorectal Cancer Surgery
The study assesses the impact on quality of care of implementing the ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol for colorectal cancer surgery in the network of public hospitals in the Regione Piemonte (North-West Italy). Every hospital is a cluster entering the study treating patients according to its current clinical practice. On the basis of a randomized order, each hospital switches from current clinical practice to the adoption of the ERAS protocol.
Colorectal Cancer|Quality Improvement|Perioperative Care|Recovery of Function
PROCEDURE: ERAS protocol
Length of stay, Mean length of stay calculated as difference between date of discharge and date of admission of the hospitalization for surgery, excluding length of stay \>94th percentile of the expected distribution (expected 22 days)., 22 days after admission
Length of stay >22 days, Rate of patients with a length of stay \>22 days, 30 days after admission|Recovery after surgery, Score of quality of recovery at 24 hours after surgery, assessed with the questionnaire Quality of Recovery (QoR-15), a 15-items instrument, with responses recorded on a 11-point Likert-type scale form 0 (worst scenario) to 10 (best scenario) and an overall score ranging from 0 (poor recovey) to 150 (excellent recovery).

A visual analogue scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 10 (worst imaginable health state) is also supplied as summary evaluation., 24 hours after surgery|Complications, Rate of surgical and medical complication after surgery For surgical complications: Comprehensive Complication Index, 30 days after discharge|Transfer to intensive care unit, Rate of transfers to intensive care unit after surgery, 30 days after surgery|Emergency visits after discharge, Rate of emergency visit in the first month after discharge, 30 days after discharge|Hospital admissions after discharge, Rate of new admissions in the first month after discharge, 30 days after discharge|Reintervention, Rate of reintervention in the first month after surgery, excluding planned interventions, 30 days after surgery|Patients' satisfaction, Score of patients' satisfaction measured 2 weeks after discharge, assessed with the questionnaire Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ8) supplied by telephone. SSQ8 is a 8-items instrument, with responses recorded on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (worst scenario) to 4 (best scenario) and an overall score ranging from 0 (very unsatisfied) to 32 (very satisfied)., 15 days after discharge|Healthcare costs, Mean healthcare costs from pre admission visit to 30 days after discharge, 30 days after discharge
ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol is a multimodal perioperative care pathways designed to achieve early recovery after surgical procedures by maintaining preoperative organ function and reducing the profound stress response following surgery. Even if efficacy and safety of ERAS protocol in colorectal surgery is well-established in the literature, its implementation is limited to few selected centres in Piemonte. The aim of the study is to extend the implementation of the ERAS protocol to whole regional network of hospitals. Specific objectives are to estimate its impact on different dimensions of quality of care, including length of stay, complications and patient satisfaction, and to identify possible barriers or facilitating factors.
