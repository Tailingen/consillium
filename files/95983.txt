Prognostic value, Prediction of survival and recurrence according to the occurrence of CTCs., 2 year.
CTCs har extracted by way of a new method at baseline, during surgery, and postoperatively. The occurence of such CTCs will be investigated for prognostic evaluation. Patients will be follow-up by Clinical routine. Disease recurrence and overall survival will be the endpoint used.
