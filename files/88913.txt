Feasibility Study on Expandion of MILs From NSCLC and SCLC Patients and Infusion With Pembrolizumab
Marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs™) are a novel method of adoptive cell therapy that provide an activated, polyclonal population of autologous tumor-specific T cells derived from the bone marrow. MILs™ in this study will be used to treat small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has become resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is generally treated with surgery or chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy, depending on staging. The problem with current available treatments is that SCLC almost always becomes resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs™) are a novel method of adoptive cell therapy that provide an activated, polyclonal population of autologous tumor-specific T cells derived from bone marrow. Prior to treatment of MILs™ patients will receive non-myeloablative lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to increase the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) will be collected from the patient to manufacture the MILs™. Upon progression and after the bone marrow is collected, a subject may receive bridging treatment of pembrolizumab until the MILs™ are received, after which treatment of the MILs™ and pembrolizumab will begin.
