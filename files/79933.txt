Incidence of Histologically-confirmed Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) for Participants of All Ages in Denmark, All Nordic countries participating in this study have national cervical cancer screening programs and registry systems that routinely collect information on cervical cytology, histology, and/or definitive therapy results.

Time perspective: The study will be conducted using data collected both retrospectively/concurrently from registries and prospectively by questionnaire survey.

Baseline survey data were collected during a prior study from 2004-2005.

Safety Monitoring: An expert panel on teratology consisting of one teratologist from each of the participating countries will review all available medical records related to any congenital anomalies to search for any emerging patterns that may be indicative of an association between GARDASIL™ exposure in the mother and the subsequent congenital anomalies in the babies.
