Uproleselan (GMI-1271) for GI Toxicity Prophylaxis During Melphalan-Conditioned Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (Auto-HCT) for Multiple Myeloma (MM)
The investigators hypothesize that prophylactic E-selectin inhibition via administration of uproleselan during melphalan conditioning will reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in multiple myeloma (MM) patients undergoing auto-transplant, as assessed via diarrhea severity scoring per CTCAE v5.0, while potentially increasing chemosensitivity of malignant MM cells to high-dose melphalan.
