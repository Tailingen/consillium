cfDNA Methylation Assay for Clinical Evaluation of Patients With Stage IA Lung Cancer After Ablation Operation
The objective is to screen and monitor the efficacy of cfDNA methylation in patients with stage I lung cancer after ablation, to compare the similarities and differences of cfDNA methylation between surgical treatment and ablation in patients with stage I lung cancer, and to look for new indicators to assess the efficacy of ablation therapy and to monitor lung cancer recurrence.
