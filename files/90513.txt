Establishment of Scoring Model for Early and Differential Diagnosis of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a radiological nomogram including radiological characteristics, clinical risk factors, and medical history. And we aim to establish a noninvasive method for the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and to construct a differential diagnosis model for ICC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with higher sensitivity and accuracy.

In recent years, the incidence and mortality of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have been increasing worldwide. Due to the different treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ICC, accurate differential diagnosis is critical for subsequent treatment of patients. However, because of their similar CT image enhancement patterns, they are easily misdiagnosed by clinicians, leading to an incorrect treatment. Based on the above research background, our objective is to establish a noninvasive method for the diagnosis of ICC and and to construct a differential diagnosis model for ICC and HCC with higher sensitivity and accuracy.
