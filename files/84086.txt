Study of Autologous T-cells in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is a study in which pancreatic cancer patients receive a immunotherapy with CART-meso cells administered at 3 days after one dose of cyclophosphamide. CART-meso cells are patients' own T cells lentivirally transduced to express anti-mesothelin scFv fused to TCRζ and 4-1BB costimulatory domains.The lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide may prolong the persistence of CART cells.

This study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy with CART-meso cells in dose escalation design. The trial will begin in Cohort 1 and progress to Cohorts 2, depending upon dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment .

Subjects will be enrolled serially, but infusions will be staggered to allow assessment of DLTs for determination of cohort progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.

Cohort 1 subjects will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^7 /m\^2 lentiviral transduced CART-meso cells after conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

Cohort 2 subjects will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^8 /m\^2 lentiviral transduced CART-meso cells cells after conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

Dose limiting toxicity is defined as any adverse reactions at level 3 or above that may be associated with CART-meso within 4 weeks after infusion.
