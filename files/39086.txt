Assessment of Sleep Quality in Patients Treated for Cancer Between 15 and 24 Years of Age
Medical professionals now take into account the specificities of the care and support of Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs). Cancer aftermaths in patients diagnosed during the AYA period are also known: the consequences of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments on a growing organism, the difficulty of some follow-ups, the longevity, and the delayed occurrence of certain complications.

In the general population, sleep disorders affect 40% of adolescents. About 30% of pediatric cancer survivors experience fatigue they attribute to their cancer, even years after the end of their treatment. The sleep quality of patients treated for cancer when they were AYAs, and the eventual care of sleeping disorders, are poorly studied. The investigators suppose that the oncologic treatment during this particular life stage, when sleeping disorders are already present and multifactorial, could have long-term impacts on sleep. The investigators offer to evaluate, through a questionnaire filled out by patients treated for cancer in the AYA period, the frequency of moderate to severe insomnia.
