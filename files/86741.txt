Hippocampal Sparing Whole Brain Radiotherapy vs Conventional Whole Brain Radiotherapy in Patients With Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether sparing the hippocampi during whole brain radiotherapy following neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with brain metastases from a systemic tumour helps preserve brain function.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: Hippocampal sparing whole brain radiotherapy|RADIATION: Conventional whole brain radiotherapy
Total recall assessed using Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVTLR) at 4 months, A decline in total recall will be assessed as being clinically significant if there is at least a 5 point decrease in total recall score at 4 months, compared to baseline \[Jacobson 1991, Brandt 1998\], 4 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT
Neurocognitive function, NCF, using a 30-60 min test battery (Memory - HVLT-R, Wechsler Memory Scale (logical memory subtest), Rey figure test, Wechsler digit span; Attention - Test of Everyday Attention (map search subtest), Trail Making Test (Parts A and B); Language - Graded Naming Test); this may be revised in the light of forthcoming recommendations on NCF assessment in brain metastases trials by the RANO (Revised Assessment in Neuro-oncology) working party, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT|Quality of life, Quality of life will be assessed using EORTC QLQ C30 and BN20 and EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaires, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT|Length of time functionally independent, The duration of functional independence will be assessed as the time for which the Karnofsky Performance Status â‰¥ 70, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT|Local control of surgery/SRS treated metastases, local and distant intracranial control (treated and new metastases), and disease control within the hippocampal regions, Incidence of metastases within the perihippocampal region, local control, and intracranial control will be assessed on the basis of MRI imaging, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT|Overall survival, Date of death will be determined from the medical records, or from the GP, followed up until 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT|Steroid and antiepileptic medication requirements, Steroid and antiepileptic medication use will be recorded in patient diaries and assessed at clinic visits, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT|Acute and late side effects of radiotherapy, Acute and late side effects of radiotherapy will be assessed using NCI CTCAE scale v4.03, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of WBRT or HS-WBRT
