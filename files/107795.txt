B-Cell Reconstitution After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment for a variety of hematological malignancies. However, patients who have received this treatment have a persistent deficit in humoral immunity up to one year post-transplant. To date, the design of new therapeutic strategies to improve immune recovery in allo-HSCT patients is still hampered by the fact that post-transplant regenerative hematopoiesis has never been studied, and more generally by our currently limited knowledge on the development and function of human B lymphocytes. The main objective of our study is to study early B-cell progenitor reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
