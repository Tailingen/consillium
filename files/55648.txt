Phase II Trial of Capecitabine With Fulvestrant for Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of continuous daily capecitabine with fulvestrant on a loading dose schedule will delay disease progression in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: fulvestrant
Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression is defined as the time from treatment start until objective tumor progression. Progression is defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.0 guidelines as a measurable increase in the smallest diameter of any target lesion, progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The median time to progression is the parameter used to describe TTP., TTP was measured from day 1 of treatment until time of progression (assessed every 8 weeks), up to 29 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Disease progression was determined through radiology imaging measurements and by clinical or symptomatic progression during or after treatment. Progression is defined per RECIST v1.0 guidelines as a measurable increase in the smallest diameter of any target lesion, progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., PFS was measured from day 1 of treatment until time of progression (assessed every 8 weeks) or death, whichever came first, up to 32.5 months.
Best Overall Response, Best overall response is defined as the best response across all time points. Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements performed after every two treatment cycles and at the end of treatment or time of progression. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions., Response to treatment was assessed after every 8 weeks of treatment|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements performed after every two treatment cycles and at the end of treatment or time of progression. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions., Response to treatment was assessed after every 8 weeks of treatment|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing stable disease (SD) of at least 24 weeks plus complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements performed after every two treatment cycles and at the end of treatment or time of progression. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where CR is the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter(LD) of target lesions; SD is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of longest diameter of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%., Response to treatment was assessed after every 8 weeks of treatment|Patients Experiencing Severe Symptom Burden (Physical Symptoms), The subject rates each question about physical symptoms on a scale of 0 through 10, where 0 is not bad and 10 is as bad as possible. Severe symptoms are indicated by a response \> or = to 7 on an item., The questionnaire was administered on day 1 of every cycle (approximately every 4 weeks) during study treatment.|Patients Experiencing Severe Symptom Burden (Psychiatric Symptoms), The subject rates each question about psychiatric symptoms on a scale of 0 through 10, where 0 is not bad and 10 is as bad as possible. Severe symptoms are indicated by a response \> or = to 7 on an item., The questionnaire was administered on day 1 of every cycle (approximately every 4 weeks) during study treatment.|Patients Experiencing Severe Symptom Burden (Physical Functioning), The subject rates each question about physical functioning on a scale of 0 through 10, where 0 is not bad and 10 is as bad as possible. Severe symptoms are indicated by a response \> or = to 7 on an item., The questionnaire was administered on day 1 of every cycle (approximately every 4 weeks) during study treatment.
