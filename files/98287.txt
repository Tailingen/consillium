Combination of External Beam Radiotherapy With 153Sm-EDTMP to Treat High Risk Osteosarcoma
The primary goal of this study will be to examine tumor response after radiation treatment via a combination of Samarium-153 EDTMP and external beam radiotherapy.
Metastatic Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Sm-EDTMP|OTHER: Autologous Stem Cell Infusion|RADIATION: External Beam Radiotherapy
Percentage of Treated Participants With 6-month Progression Free Survival, Percentage of patients with high-risk osteogenic sarcoma, treated with high-dose Samarium-153 EDTMP and external beam radiotherapy, without progression at 6 months., 6 months post-intervention
Short and Long-term Side Effects of Combined Infusional Samarium-153 EDTMP and External Beam Radiotherapy as Assessed by Number of Participants With Toxicity, Number of patients experiencing any Grade 3-4 toxicity, as defined by CTCAE v4.0 and RTOG Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria, during the trial intervention and follow-up., Up to 48 months
Samarium tracer infusion of 1 mCi/kg administered. SPECT images wil be used to determine the distribution of dose delivered to the tumor. This information will be used to determine target doses of external beam radiotherapy. The treatment infusion of Samarium, 30 mCi/kg, will be administered and dosimetry will confirm total dose delivered, and information will be used to finalize doses of external beam radiotherapy. Approximately 14 days after treatment infusion, autologous stem cells infusion is administered. Radiotherapy will be delivered according to the judgement of the treating radiation oncologist.
