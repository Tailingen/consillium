A Study Evaluating Platinum-Pemetrexed-Atezolizumab (+/-Bevacizumab) for Patients With Stage IIIB/IV Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With EGFR Mutations, ALK Rearrangement or ROS1 Fusion Progressing After Targeted Therapies
The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combination of Platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin), Pemetrexed, Atezolizumab+/- Bevacizumab if eligible, in stage IIIB/IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients with progression-enhancing mutations following targeted therapies.
NSCLC Stage IIIB|NSCLC Stage IV|EGFR Gene Mutation|ALK Gene Rearrangement Positive|ROS1 Gene Mutation
DRUG: Carboplatin + Pemetrexed + Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin + Pemetrexed + Atezolizumab
Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, After the end of 4 cycles (15 weeks)
The progression-free survival (PFS), 1 year|The overall survival, 1 year|The duration of response, 1 year
In patients with an EGFR mutation, several phase III studies comparing EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with chemotherapy have shown a benefit of TKI over chemotherapy, with no demonstrated benefit on overall survival. After a first line of treatment with a TKI, most patients progress and are eligible according to the mechanism of progression to a TKI of 3rd generation in case of T790M resistance or chemotherapy. In patients with ALK translocation, crizotinib has been shown to be beneficial in first line compared to a platinum doublet.Despite these major advances, most patients are progressing after targeted treatments and chemotherapy and are facing the problem of anti-PD1 / PDL1 treatment.
