Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Patients With Untreated Stage IV or Recurrent Squamous Cell Lung Cancers
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancers. The investigators would like to determine the percentage of patients with squamous cell lung cancers who experience shrinkage of their tumors following treatment with this regimen. This combination of drugs is not a standard therapy for patients with squamous cell lung cancers. However, each of these drugs, when given alone or with other chemotherapies, is FDA-approved for the treatment of this disease.
Lung Cancer|Untreated Stage IV or Recurrent Squamous Cell Lung Cancers
DRUG: albumin-bound paclitaxel|DRUG: gemcitabine
Overall Response Rate, defined as the percentage of patients with complete or partial responses based on RECIST 1.1, at any time prior to disease progression, out of all evaluable patients. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 1 year
Participants Evaluated for Toxicity, AE's will be collected, tabulated according to CTCAE version 4.0 and summarized using descriptive statistics., 1 year
