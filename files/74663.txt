A Study of the Hsp90 Inhibitor AUY922 Plus Capecitabine for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The investigators propose this Phase I trial of the combination of AUY922 and capecitabine to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced solid tumors. This combination treatment has potential applicability in tumor types where capecitabine or fluorouracil is a treatment option, including colorectal and breast cancer.
Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumor Malignancy
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Hsp90 Inhibitor AUY 922
Dose Determination, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AUY922 plus capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors., 18 months
Drug Related Toxicities, To evaluate the drug related toxicities associated with different doses of the drugs used in this regimen., 18 months|Preliminary Efficacy Assessment: Response Rate (RR), Response Rate (RR) is defined as the total number of patients with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as defined in RECIST v2. CR is defined as the dissappearance of all target lesions, disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD., 18 months
