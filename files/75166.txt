A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3804 in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This is a study to evaluate the tolerance, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), phase II recommended dose (RP2D), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single and multiple oral doses of TQB3804 in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Malignant Tumors
DRUG: TQB3804
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Subjects appear the following toxic reaction relate to the drug after treatment within 28 days ：III °or above of non-hematological toxicity, IV° hematological toxicity , neutropenia associated with fever., Baseline up to 28 days
