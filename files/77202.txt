There are numerous barriers and favourable conditions that affect the acceptability of a screening test for cancer. Such factors have been investigated in the context of some of the current screening programs. Through this survey the investigators want to increase researcher awareness of these factors with the hope that this information will aid policy makers and guide future research.

There has been widening public interest in general health-surveillance in addition to disease detection. Breath testing has the potential to be a one-for-all non-invasive test to detect health domains. Through this survey, the investigators wish to understand public opinions about breath testing for health.

This survey consists of questions aiming to gather views on non-invasive testing for health and disease.
