Activity of Chronic Inflammation in PCOS
Chronic inflammation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may be the result of dysregulation of cytokine production (due to insulin resistance, excess visceral fat and hyperandrogenemia), i.e., overproduction of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. TNF, IL-1, IL-6) in relation to anti-inflammatory ones (IL-10). This condition may be an important link between obesity and insulin resistance, which is crucial in the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome. However, it is not known whether it results from the tendency to accumulate adipose tissue or is a feature of the syndrome itself. There is no data indicating the relationship between chronic inflammation and the severity of metabolic disorders and the value of ovarian reserve in women with various PCOS phenotypes.

The study population will be characterized in terms of demographic (age, BMI), gynaecological (cycle length, menstrual pain, abnormal uterine bleeding) and obstetrics (pregnancies, childbirth, miscarriages) data. PCOS syndrome (and its phenotypes: A, B, C, D) will be recognized by the Rotterdam criteria. During hospitalization, blood samples will be collected for scheduled analyses (20 ml of blood in total).
