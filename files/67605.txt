IMGN632 as Monotherapy or With Venetoclax and/or Azacitidine for Participants With CD123-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the safety and tolerability of IMGN632 and assess the antileukemia activity of IMGN632 when administered in combination with azacitidine and/or venetoclax in participants with relapsed and frontline CD123-positive AML.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: IMGN632|DRUG: Venetoclax
Safety and Tolerability, Evaluate the safety and tolerability and identify an RP2D of IMGN632 when administered in combination with azacitidine, with venetoclax, and with azacitidine and venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CD123-positive AML through review of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and abnormal laboratory values that result in a failure to meet the criteria for re-treatment., approximately 3 years|Preliminary antileukemia activity, Assess preliminary antileukemia activity of IMGN632 when administered as a monotherapy in MRD+ Fit and MRD + Unfit AML patient populations, and in combination with azacitidine, with venetoclax, and with azacitidine and venetoclax in patients with relapsed or untreated AML as assessed by complete response, complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, morphologic leukemia-free state, partial response, and duration of remission., approximately 20 months|Minimal Residual Disease Levels, Assess Minimal Residual Disease Levels using central flow cytometry-based testing., approximately 18 months
Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) (Dose Expansion Phase), Up to approximately 12 months|Study Drug Concentration (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Up to approximately 12 months|Anti-drug Antibody Concentration (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Up to approximately 12 months|Minimal Residual Disease Levels (Dose Escalation), Up to approximately 7 months
This study explores multiple IMGN632 doses in combination and monotherapy Regimens, including (A - closed to enrollment)) azacitidine, (B-closed to enrollment) venetoclax, (C) azacitidine+venetoclax, and (D- closed to enrollment) monotherapy in MRD+ AML. For combination Regimens A-C, a Phase 1b Dose Escalation Cohort will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN632 in that specific combination Regimen, followed by a Phase 2 Dose Expansion Cohort for each combination Regimen to characterize the safety profile further and assess the antileukemia activity of the different combination Regimens.
