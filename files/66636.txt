Deep Learning Image Reconstruction for Abdominal CT of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Compared With 3-TESLA MRI
New algorithms for processing CT acquisitions, based on artificial intelligence, have been reported to improve acquisition quality. Thats' why it's possible to imagine that new scan post-processing algorithms enable better detection and characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma lesions than with standard reconstructions. DLIR reconstructions could even match with MRI detection.

The aim of the study is to compare the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions according to the LI-RADS classification in CT with DLIR artificial intelligence reconstruction, compared with ASIR-V reconstruction and the gold standard of MRI.
