Treatment of Hyperprolactinemia With the Non-ergoline Dopamine Agonist Ropinirole
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the non-ergoline dopamine agonist ropinirole for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia in patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas.
Hyperprolactinemia|Prolactinoma
DRUG: Ropinirole
Percentage of Subjects That Achieved PRL Normalization as Defined by a Serum Prolactin Level Less Than 25ng/mL at Any Time Point During the Study Treatment Period., Serum prolactin concentrations (PRL levels) were measured in patients at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks after starting therapy and then once monthly thereafter for 24 weeks. Serum prolactin was measured in duplicate by two-site chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay using the Immulite 1000 Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). The reference range for serum prolactin is 1.9-25 ng/ml for adult females., 6-12 months
Number of Subjects With Stable or Decreased Tumor Size, Number of subjects with stable or decreased tumor size from baseline assessment to assessment after 6 months of treatment. Radiologic assessment of tumor size before and after treatment will be made by MRI., 6 months
Treatment of prolactin secreting pituitary tumors with traditional ergot dopamine agonist drugs can be limited by medication side effects, pharmacologic resistance, and by concerns regarding the potential risk of cardiac valve disease. The overall goal of this project is therefore to evaluate, for the first time, the efficacy and tolerability of the selective D2/D3 receptor non-ergot dopamine agonist ropinirole for the treatment of prolactinomas. This proposal will establish the pharmacologic profile of this medication when used to treat hyperprolactinemia in patients with prolactinomas and will determine the impact of long-term ropinirole administration on critical clinical parameters including serum prolactin levels, gonadal function, and tumor regression, in order to establish ropinirole's utility as a new, clinically efficacious, safer and more tolerable therapeutic option for the treatment of prolactinomas that may prove particularly useful in patients with underlying cardiac valve disease and in those with resistance or intolerance to ergot dopamine agonists.
