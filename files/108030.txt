Drug-Eluting Bead, Irinotecan Therapy for Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma w/Concomitant Gemcitabine and Cisplatin or Carboplatin
The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of trans-arterial chemoembolization (LC or ONCOZENE BEAD) plus infusional chemotherapy is safe and more effective than just receiving the infusional chemotherapy alone.
Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DEVICE: LC or ONCOZENE Bead with Gem-Cis or Gem-Carbo|DRUG: Gem-Cis or Gem-Carbo
Tumor Response (Overall Response = Complete Response + Partial Response + Progressive Disease + Stable Disease), Tumor response will be determined using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Response will be classified as: Complete Response - disappearance of all lesions; Partial Response - at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter or 30% reduction in arterial enhancement; Progressive Disease - at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest longest diameter recorded since start of treatment or appearance of one or more new lesions greater than 1cm in size; Stable Disease - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since start of treatment., Assessed at 2, 4 and 6 months. 6 months reported.
Overall Survival, Long-term follow-up will occur every 3-4 months for up to one year after discontinuation of active study treatment. Subjects who have completed the long-term follow-up period will be monitored every 3 - 6 months until evidence of progression of disease. Once there is progression of disease subjects will be followed for overall survival by telephone or standard physician follow-ups as per standard of care until death., 4.5 Years
