Atezolizumab Immunotherapy With or Without Tiragolumab for Patients With Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
This is a phase II trial of neoadjuvant and adjuvant atezolizumab with or without tiragolumab in conjunction with chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC.
NSCLC
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab
To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab with or without tiragolumab., The primary objective is to determine the relative efficacy of atezolizumab with or without tiragolumab based on progression-free survival (PFS) and select a promising treatment out of the two experimental regiments for further investigation in a future phase III trial compared with standard of care treatment. Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation., 2 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., 2 years|overall response (ORR), The proportion of patients by arm that achieve partial or complete response., 2 years|Safety of the two regimens, The frequency of grade 3+ adverse events will by reported by arm., 1 year
This randomized phase II design provides a fairly rapid way to determine which of two potential neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimens holds the most promise for evaluation in a subsequent phase III trial against standard of care adjuvant immunotherapy. The AFT-16 trial of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in this setting provided proof of concept for safety of the neoadjuvant approach and for outcomes that compare favorably with standard of care therapy. The field of lung cancer immunotherapy is evolving rapidly and since the start of AFT-16 not only has adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab become standard of care, but combination immunotherapy with tiragolumab and atezolizumab for NSCLC has received breakthrough therapy designation. Safety of combination immunotherapy and radiation has been established in several trials, but the safety and efficacy of dual immunotherapy is not yet known. In a group of patients who can be but often are not cured with current therapies, establishment of a strategy that could increase cure rate is urgent. This randomized phase II trial can be advocated to determine the best of the two arms for further study with slightly inflated type I error rate
