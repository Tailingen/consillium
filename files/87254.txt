MK-2206+Endocrine Therapy in Patients With Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
This is a phase Ib trial that evaluates the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 given in combination with exemestane +/- goserelin in pre- and post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: MSK-2206|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Goserelin
Tolerability of MK-2206 given in combination with exemestane +/- goserelin, as measured by maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., The MTD will be defined as the highest dose tested in which a dose-limiting toxicity is experienced by 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6 patients among the dose levels., at 4 weeks
Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety of MK-2206 when combined with exemestane +/- goserelin, Number of participants with worst-grade toxicity at each of five grades following NCI Common Toxicity Criteria: 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, disabling, 5 = death, At 4 weeks|Characterize the effect of MK-2206 in combination with exemestane +/- goserelin based on PI3K, AKT, and PTEN mutations, as measured by immunohistochemistry and the SNaPshot assay., Using tumor blocks from previous surgeries or fresh biopsies of accessible metastatic sites, After collection of tumor tissue
The phase II portion of this trial will be listed under a separate NCT number.
