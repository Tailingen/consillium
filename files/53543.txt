Study of BGB-10188 as Monotherapy, and in Combination With Zanubrutinib, and Tislelizumab
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose for expansion (RDFE), safety and tolerability of BGB-10188 as monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) mature B-cell malignancies; in combination with zanubrutinib in participants with R/R follicular lymphoma (FL), R/R mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); and in combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
