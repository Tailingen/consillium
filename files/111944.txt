A Study Comparing Pegylated rhG-CSF and rhG-CSF as Support to Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
Neutropenia is one of the most frequent adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the main factor to limit the dosage and the continuation of chemotherapy. A newly pegylated rhG-CSF was independently developed by JIANGSU HENGRUI Medicine Co., Ltd, China. Phase 1a, 1b and phase 2 trials have shown that pegylated rhG-CSF has decreased renal clearance, increased plasma half-life, and prolonged efficacy in compare with rhG-CSF. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of pegylated rhG-CSF in preventing neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.
