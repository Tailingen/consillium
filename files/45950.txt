Cyclophosphamide as Graft-versus-host Prophylaxis After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma
The present study is a multicenter, prospective phase II-study to evaluate the chronic GvHD and progression-free survival at 2 years after after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with multiple myeloma.

The present study is a multicenter, prospective Phase II-study to evaluate the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease at 2-years, the 2-year risk of non-relapse mortality, the 2-year progressive-free, and overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma who received a toxicity-reduced conditioning regimen combined of thiotepa and busulfan followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from matched or mismatched, related/unrelated and haploidentical donor, and cyclophosphamide as post-transplant GvHD prophylaxis in comparision to a historical group.

In this study will further determine toxicity and safety of cyclophosphamide as GvHD prophylaxis.
