Dose Escalation Study of MLN0128 in Participants With Advanced Malignancies
This is a Phase I, open label, Dose Escalation study of oral administration of single agent MLN0128 in participants with Advanced Malignancies followed by an Expansion Phase in participants with renal cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer or urothelial cancer who have measurable disease.
Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: MLN0128
Dose Escalation Phase: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose level of MLN0128 at which no more than 1 out of 6 evaluable participants experienced a DLT during the first cycle (28 days) of therapy., Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Dose Escalation Phase: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were defined as MLN0128-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred within the Cycle 1 (first 28 days of treatment) as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE): Any ≥Grade 3 or non-hematologic toxicity except for Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting and diarrhea, Grade 3 hyperglycemia lasting ≤ 14 days, Grade 3 rash lasting ≤ 3 days; Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \>7 days in the absence of growth factor support; Grade 4 neutropenia of any duration associated with fever ≥38.5 degree celsius and/or systemic infection; Any other Grade 4 hematologic toxicity; Inability to administer at least 75% of planned doses of MLN0128 within Cycle 1 due to drug-related toxicity and any clinically significant occurrence that the investigators and sponsor agreed would place participants at an undue safety risk., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Number of Participants Experiencing One or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs Resulting in Discontinuation of MLN0128 and Fatal AEs Within 30 Days of Last Dose of Study Drug, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant., First dose of study drug through 30 days after the administration of the last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 244 weeks)|Dose Expansion: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined of at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and for non-target lesions. Data was categorized as per type of cancer., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to approximately 240 weeks)|Dose Expansion Phase: Duration of Objective Response, Duration of objective response is defined as the number of months from the start date of CR or PR (whichever occurred first) based on RECIST Criteria version 1.1 to the first date of objectively documented progressive disease (PD) for participants who achieved CR or PR. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to approximately 240 weeks)|Dose Expansion: Duration of Stable Disease (SD), Duration of SD was evaluated for participants with best response of SD and is defined as number of months from date of first dose to date of PD. As per RECIST 1.1, SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PR was defined of at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and for non-target lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is smallest on study)., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to approximately 240 weeks)

A negative percentage change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline, Cycle 1 Week 2
The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0128. MLN0128 is being tested to treat people who have Advanced Malignancies.

The study enrolled approximately 198 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the following dose regimens in the Dose Escalation Phase to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD):

* MLN0128 QD
* MLN0128 QW
* MLN0128 QDx3dQW
* MLN0128 QDx5dQW

MLN0128 capsule, orally, once daily (QD) or Once weekly (QW) in the Dose Escalation Phase until MTD was established.

Once MTD was determined, participants were then enrolled in the Dose Expansion Phase to receive:

* MLN0128 5 mg QD
* MLN0128 30 mg QW
* MLN0128 40 mg QW

This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 244 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone OR plus a final visit after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
