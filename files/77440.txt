Talimogene Laherparepvec With Pembrolizumab for Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (MASTERKEY232 / KEYNOTE-137)
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, as assessed by incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab in adults with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Talimogene Laherparepvec|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants With a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The following toxicities (graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0) were considered DLTs if judged by the investigator to be related to either study drug:

* grade 4 non-hematologic (non-laboratory) toxicity
* ≥ grade 3 pneumonitis
* grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity for \> 3 days with optimal supportive care
* grade 3 fatigue was not classified as DLT, regardless of duration
* any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if:

  * medical intervention was required,
  * the abnormality led to hospitalization, or
  * the abnormality persisted at ≥ grade 3 for \> 1 week unless deemed not clinically important by investigator and sponsor
* grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia
* thrombocytopenia \< 25 x 10⁹/L associated with bleeding event requiring intervention
* serious herpetic event: herpetic encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, or disseminated herpetic infection
* grade 5 toxicity
* other intolerable toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of either study drug., First 6 weeks after the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab in combination
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response or partial response assessed by the investigator using immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). Response was based on the size of tumors assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Complete response (iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented was required. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial response (iPR): Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 30% relative to baseline. Confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation required.

Analyses are presented below for both the unconfirmed and confirmed results., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate (iCRR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response assessed by the investigator using immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). Response was based on the size of tumors assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Complete response (iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented was required. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Analyses are presented below for both the unconfirmed and confirmed results., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Best Overall Confirmed Response, Best overall visit response of iCR, iPR, stable disease (iSD), progressive disease (iPD) or unevaluable (iUE) based on investigator assessment using irRECIST.

iCR: Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new). Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

iPR: Decrease in tumor size ≥ 30% relative to baseline. iPD: Increase in tumor size ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir or qualitative worsening of non-target lesions or a new lesion.

iSD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for iCR or iPR nor sufficient increase to qualify for iPD.

iUE: Any baseline lesion which was not assessed or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine the status of that particular tumor.

Not Done: Radiographic imaging was not performed to evaluate the response. iCR, iPR, and iPD required confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Duration of Confirmed Response, Duration of response (iDOR) per irRECIST was defined as the time from the date of an initial response of iCR or iPR that was subsequently confirmed to the earlier of a participant overall response of iPD or death. Participants who did not end their response at the time of analysis were censored at their last evaluable tumor assessment., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate (iDCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of iCR or iPR or iSD assessed by the investigator using irRECIST.

Complete response (iCR): Disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented was required. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial response (iPR): Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 30% relative to baseline. Confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation required.

Stable disease (iSD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for iCR or iPR nor sufficient increase to qualify for iPD.

Analyses are presented below for both the unconfirmed and confirmed results., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (iPFS) per irRECIST was defined as the interval from first dose to the earlier of a participant overall response of iPD or death from any cause; otherwise, iPFS was censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment. The initial date of an iPD that was consecutively confirmed was used., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from first dose to the event of death from any cause; otherwise, OS was censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive., Up to the primary analysis data cutoff date of 02 November 2017; median (minimum, maximum) time on follow-up was 14.36 (1.4, 67.0) weeks.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The severity of adverse events was assessed by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and based on the following scale:

Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, Grade 5 = death.

A serious adverse event is an AE that met at least 1 of the following serious criteria:

* fatal
* life threatening
* required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
* resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
* congenital anomaly/birth defect
* other medically important serious event., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after last dose; the median (range) duration of treatment was 5.6 (0.1 to 75.3) weeks for talimogene laherparepvec and 6.1 (0.1, 105.3) weeks for pembrolizumab.
This is a phase 1b/3, multicenter, clinical trial conducted in 2 parts (phase 1b and phase 3). In phase 1b talimogene laherparepvec is to be administered in combination with pembrolizumab to adults with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is to be evaluated based on the first 18 DLT-evaluable participants. An expansion cohort of up to an additional 22 treated patients could be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and to estimate the efficacy of the combination of talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab and to support a decision to initiate the phase 3 part of the study. The phase 3 part of the study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, as assessed by overall survival, of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec with pembrolizumab versus placebo with pembrolizumab in adults with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, however, a decision was made not to proceed to the phase 3 part of the study.
