Effect of Helicobacter Pylori Eradication After Subtotal Gastrectomy on Survival Rate of Gastric Cancer Patients: Retrospective Study
In this study, we will observe the long-term survival rate, overall mortality rate, gastric cancer specific mortality rate, and the incidence rate of metachronous cancer in patients who received subtotal gastrectomy, with or without Helicobacter pylori eradication.
Gastric Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Helicobacter pylori eradication (combination therapy)
Overall survival, From date of initial curative surgery for gastric cancer, until the date of death from any cause, up to 60 months
Gastric cancer-specific (disease-free) survival, Survival period without cancer recurrence or newly developed stomach cancer diagnosis, From date of initial curative surgery for gastric cancer, until the date of diagnosis of gastric cancer recurrence or the date of death, whichever comes first, up to 60 months|Metachronous cancer (remnant stomach cancer), The number of patients who were diagnosed with new carcinoma on the remnant stomach, over follow-up period of up to 60 months, in eradication group and non-eradication group, Up to 60 months
In this study, we will observe the long-term survival rate, overall mortality rate, gastric cancer specific mortality rate, and the incidence rate of metachronous cancer in patients who received subtotal gastrectomy, with or without Helicobacter pylori eradication. In addition, we will analyze the correlation between the incidence and survival rate of this type of stomach cancer by comparing smoking, gastric cancer direct family history, disease stage (TNM staging), the histologic type of stomach cancer (intestinal, diffuse, mixed), and the surgical method (Billoth I, Billoth II) as well as the infection and eradication status of H. pylori.
