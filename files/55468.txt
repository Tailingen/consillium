Case Collection Study for Collecting Images for the Development and Validation of Computer Aided Detection Software
The study objective is to assess the performance of the MammoDetector Pro to correctly mark biopsy-proven breast cancers imaged on the Siemens Mammomat Novation FFDM system compared to conventional film-screen mammography.

DEVICE: Screening
The study will assess the performance of the MammoDetector™ Pro to correctly mark biopsy-proven breast cancers imaged on the Siemens Mammomat NovationDR FFDM system compared to conventional film-screen mammography (FSM)., 1 yr
The study design is a controlled study. The study is designed to demonstrate that the performance of the MammoDetector™ Pro on biopsy-proven malignant cases obtained with the Siemens Mammomat NovationDR FFDM system is not inferior to its performance on biopsy-proven malignant cases obtained with conventional film-screen mammography (FSM). The overall sensitivity of the MammoDetector™ Pro with both imaging modalities will be compared. Furthermore, the study is designed to demonstrate that the false marks noted by the MammoDetector™ Pro on routine screening "Normal" cases obtained with the FFDM system is not inferior those marked by the software on routine screening "Normal" cases obtained with conventional film-screen mammography (FSM).
