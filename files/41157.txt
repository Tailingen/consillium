The questionnaire is used to evaluate psychological distress in non-psychiatric settings. In general medical outpatients the optimal cut-off point for the screening for psychiatric morbidity seems to be 12, for screening depressive symptomatology seems to be 5 score and 8 (range 7-10) for screening anxiety symptomatology. In Spanish population the HADS demonstrated a good internal consistency and optimal psychometric properties., Data collection for two years|To determinate c√°ncer worry of patients studied of the different hereditary cancer syndromes attended at Cancer Genetic Counseling Unit, Cancer Worry Scale. (CWS), consists of the six-item scale measures concerns about developing cancer, and the impact of these concerns on performing daily tasks among patients at risk for hereditary cancer. The questionnaire are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from "never" to "almost always", with a total value ranging from 6 (minimal worry) to 24 (maximum worry).

Nowadays several familial cancer syndromes that confer a high lifetime risk of cancer can be identified with genetic testing. The psychological impact of genetic testing and the rates of psychological distress in patients undergoing genetic testing vary between 6 to 65% depending on socio-demographic or clinical characteristics.

The effect of baseline distress on post-testing assessments tended to decrease or show little change over time, it may be important to target patients with high baseline distress for additional counseling or intervention both pre-testing and over time.The most robust predictor of future distress is baseline distress, additional factors were associated with cancer risk perception considering family history of cancer, patient's affected or unaffected with cancer, etc...
