Effect Inverse Ratio Ventilation on Arterial Oxygenation and Respiratory Mechanics During lapaLAR
Changes of inspiration: expiration ration from 1:2 to 1:1 could improve the arterial oxygenation and respiratory mechanics
Colorectal Neoplasms
OTHER: inverse IE
arterial oxygenation (PaO2), sampling for arterial blood from arterial cannular will be analyzed 10 min after anesthetic induction, 20 min after pneumoperitoneum, 40 min after pneumoperitoneum and operation end., baseline PaO2- 2 hour after pneumoperitoneum
cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure would calculate as mean arterial pressure-central venous pressure from immediately before pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position, every 5 min up to 20 after I:E ratio 1:1., immediately before pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position, every 5 min up to 20 after I:E ratio 1:1
Inverse ratio ventilation already known as effective to improve the oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in the ARDS patients. Recently, there were report of decrease in airway pressure and improve in respiratory compliance during inverse ration ventilation undergoing one lung ventilation. We hypothesized that changes of inspiration and expiration ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 could improve the arterial oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in the patients who undergoing laparoscopic low anterior resection. However, prolonged inspiratory time might compromise cerebral perfusion pressure due to an elevation in central venous pressure and concomitant reductions in mean arterial pressure.
