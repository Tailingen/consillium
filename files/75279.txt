Using Multi-virus Cytotoxic T-cells Following T-Cell Depleted Allogeneic HPCT for Prophylaxis Against EBV, ADV, and CMV
This protocol is a phase I study. Patients may be eligible for an infusion of Multi-virus Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) if they received a T-cell depleted (TCD) transplant from a related family member or an unrelated donor. Recipients of these types of transplants are severely immune compromised during the early post-transplant period and are more susceptible to certain viruses. The investigators hypothesize that the adoptive transfer of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) against certain viruses: Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus (Ad, CMV, and EBV) will be safe with regard to producing graft versus host disease (GVHD) or other infusion related toxicities.
Epstein-Barr Virus Infections|Adenovirus|Cytomegalovirus Infections
BIOLOGICAL: Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes
To assess toxicity by SAEs scored according to the adaptive CTCAE version 5, Phase/safety/toxicity, 1 year
Evidence of immunity against specific viral pathogens- Ad, CMV and EBV in recipients of Multi-Virus CTLs, Immunity will be recorded., 1 year|The incidence of Ad, EBV, and CMV systemic infections during the first 180 days post-transplant, Number of infections will be quantified., 1 year
Within this clinical trial, the investigators will test the hypotheses that the administration of CTLs for prophylaxis against Ad, CMV and EBV in recipients of TCD-HPCT will be safe and well tolerated. Graded doses of Multi-Virus CTL will be administered to recipients of genotypically haploidentical or mismatched unrelated TCD grafts.
