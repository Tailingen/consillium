Study of ISM5939 in Patients With Advanced and/or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/b, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, optimization and expansion study of ISM5939 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of ISM5939 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The study will be conducted in 3 parts sequentially: Part 1 dose escalation ISM5939 monotherapy, Part 2 dose optimization to determine RP2D of ISM5939 monotherapy, and Part 3 dose expansion in 3 cohorts after initial safety run-in of ISM5939 combination therapy.

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurrence, DLT is defined as any of the adverse event which meets DLT criteria if assessed at least possibly related to study treatment and not clearly related to progressive disease or other extraneous cause and occurring during the DLT period., Day 1 up to Day 28 for Part 1 and Day 1 up to Day 21 for Part 3 safety run-in dose escalation period|Adverse events (AEs), Incidence and severity of AEs will be evaluated based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 \[NCI CTCAE v5.0\])., Approximately 36 months|Recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or RP2Ds in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be determined based on the available data of safety and tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary activity from all dosed patients., Approximately 36 months
Maximum concentration (Cmax), Blood samples for Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis will be assessed after dose of ISM5939., Approximately 36 months|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Blood samples for Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis will be assessed after dose of ISM5939., Approximately 36 months|Terminal half-life (t1/2), Blood samples for Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis will be assessed after dose of ISM5939., Approximately 36 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response or Partial Response., Approximately 36 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first tumor assessment when the Complete Response/Partial Response is met to the date of disease progression or death, which occurs first., Approximately 36 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response or Partial Response or Stable Disease (persisted for at least 6 weeks)., Approximately 36 months|Best overall response (BOR), BOR is defined as the best response from the initial oral dose of ISM5939 until disease progression, initiation of another anti-tumor treatment, or early withdrawal (whichever occurs first). Confirmation of CR and PR is required., Approximately 36 months
