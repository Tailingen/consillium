Nintedanib and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nintedanib when given together with capecitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also block the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nintedanib with capecitabine may be a better treatment for colorectal cancer.

To Examine the DLT, The recommended Phase II dose is of the Nintedanib and Capecitabine combination is defined as the dose level that causes dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in â‰¤ 1 out of 6 patients at highest dose level below the maximally administered dose.

Capecitabine is fixed dose at 2000 mg/m2; while Nintedanib is evaluated at 150mg (dose level 1) and 200 mg (dose level 2)., At least 21 days.|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate, Defined as the Proportion of Patients Who Survive Without Disease Progression Via the RECIST Version 1.1 (Phase II), Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) or the appearance of new lesions.

Will be summarized using standard Kaplan-Meier methods., At 18 weeks
Median PFS (Phase II), Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) or the appearance of new lesions. Estimates of median PFS will be obtained with corresponding 90% confidence intervals., Up to 2 years|Median OS (Phase II), Overall survival is defined as time from date of subject enrollment to the date of death due to any cause. Estimates of median OS will be obtained with corresponding 90% confidence intervals., From the date of enrollment to the time of death, assessed up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate, Overall Response is defined as Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions and any lymph nodes must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; or Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; or Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response, nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease., After every 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy.|Aggregate Rates of Adverse Events Measured by CTCAE Version 4.0 (Phase II), Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Graded According to the CTEP NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0)., Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-limiting toxicities of nintedanib when administered with capecitabine within the study population and, establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). (Phase I)
* II. To assess progression free survival at 18 weeks. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* I. To assess median progression free survival. (Phase II)
* II. To assess median overall survival from the date of enrollment to the time of death will be documented. (Phase II)
* III. To assess the objective response rate as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. (Phase II)
* IV. To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). (Phase II)

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

* I. Measurement of circulating angiogenic cytokines (CAFs): vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR) 1/2, placental growth factor (PlGF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), leptin, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha (a), IL-8, IL-6, fibroblast growth factor basic (FGFb), osteopontin and pentraxin-3. (Phase II)
* II. Measurement of drug levels and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nintedanib followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (every 12 hours) on days 1-14 and nintedanib PO BID (every 12 hours) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 28 days until resolution or satisfactory stabilization of persistent drug-related toxicity, and then every 6 months thereafter.
