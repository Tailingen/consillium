Neoadjuvant Study of Abemaciclib, Durvalumab, and an Aromatase Inhibitor Early Stage Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination of immunotherapy and anticancer drugs presurgery in patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Female|Locally Advanced Breast Cancer|Hormone Receptor Positive Malignant Neoplasm of Breast
DRUG: Abemaciclib, durvalumab and aromatase inhibitor
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The primary endpoints will be safety and tolerability of the study intervention, Through study completion, up to 24 weeks
Pathologic response at surgery, Pathologic response at surgery by Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score, At the time of definitive surgery|Pathologic response at surgery, Pathologic response at surgery by change in Ki-67% from pre and surgical biopsies, At the time of definitive surgery
Change in the number of T cells, Change in subtype of T cell infiltrates and spatial relationship of T cells to tumor cells (number of T cells withing the tumor), At the time of definitive surgery|Change in the number of T regs cells, Change in number of T regs per tumor spatial unit, At the time of definitive surgery|Change in the number of macrophages, Change in number of myeloid derived immunosuppressive cells (M1 vs M2 macrophages) per tumor spatial unit, At the time of definitive surgery|Changes in immune markers in the tumor specimens and/or peripheral blood, Change in gene expression immune signatures (RNA quantification), At the time of definitive surgery
The primary hypothesis is that a Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with a Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor will be well tolerated in early stage, hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). The secondary hypothesis and biomarker based endpoint is that patients with HR positive locally advanced breast cancer with low to intermediate stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) will demonstrate an increase in stromal TILs following NET when combined with abemaciclib and durvalumab for 4 cycles (16 weeks).
