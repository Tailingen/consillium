Clinical Study of Neoantigen Vaccine Combined With Targeted Drugs in the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Neoantigen vaccine is a new field of research in tumor immunotherapy, and some studies have been conducted with success on Melanoma and glioblastoma. Nearly 80% of lung cancers are diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV) and EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer will be resistant after targeted drug treatment. Neoantigen vaccine is a new treatment method for lung cancer, especially for patients with drug resistance.
