A Study of 5 Years of Adjuvant Osimertinib in Completely Resected Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation (EGFRm) Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC)
To assess the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in participants with EGFRm positive stage II-IIIB NSCLC, following complete tumour resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy.
Stage II-IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Osimertinib 80 mg/40 mg
Estimate the Efficacy of Osimertinib as Measured by Disease Free Survival (DFS) [Common EGFRm Cohort]., Defined as time from date of first dose until disease recurrence, or death due to any cause in the absence of recurrence., From date of first dose until date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), up to approximately 5 years. Assessed at 5 years.
Disease Free Survival Rate at 3, 4 and 5 Years (Uncommon EGFRm Cohort), Defined as the proportion of participants alive and disease free at 3, 4, and 5 years., From date of first dose until date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), up to approximately 5 years. Assessed at 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years.|DFS Rate at 3 and 4 Years (Common EGFRm Cohort), Defined as the proportion of participants alive and disease free at 3, and 4 years., From date of first dose until date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), up to approximately 5 years. Assessed at 3 years, and 4 years.|Overall Survival (OS) [Common EGFRm Cohort], Defined as time from date of first dose until the date of death due to any cause., From date of first dose until the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 5 years. Assessed at 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years.|Safety and tolerability in overall population (Common EGFRm Cohort and Uncommon EGFRm Cohort), Adverse Events (AEs) graded by CTCAE version 5.0., From date of first dose up to approximately 5 years|Recurrence events in overall population (Common EGFRm Cohort and Uncommon EGFRm Cohort), Local/regional, or distant recurrence events assessed., From date of first dose up to approximately 5 years
This is a phase 2 open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in participants with stage II-IIIB NSCLC with sensitising EGFR mutations. The study is designed to evaluate 5 years of adjuvant osimertinib therapy.
