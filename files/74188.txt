This study is a Phase 2 with safety lead-in study to assess the safety and efficacy of DPX-Survivac, low dose cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab combination therapy in subjects with selected advanced and recurrent solid tumours. Two ovarian cancer arms will be recruited and randomized in this study, one with and one without cyclophosphamide. All other cohorts will be single arm, receiving treatment with the triple combination.

Up to 20 subjects, from any cohort, will be enrolled to assess the safety of study treatments before the study moves to the expansion phase. Once the safety lead-in is completed, the five cohorts will be expanded to recruit additional subjects following a Simon two stage design. Enrollment in the ovarian cancer cohort will be randomized 1:1 into two arms.
