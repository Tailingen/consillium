Trial of Superiority of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer
The previous reported phase I study allows us to prospectively define the optimal total dose in different metastatic locations (88). However, several questions are still unanswered such as the adequate timing of the stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in oligometastatic disease. Indeed, there are two different oligometastatic states: "de novo", i.e. occurring at first metastatic presentation without any previous systemic therapy; and "secondary", defined as residual disease after systemic treatment.

The investigators wish to prospectively study the role of metastases SBRT with curative intent in de novo oligometastatic disease.

This clinical trial would be the first randomized study studying SBRT at onset of the metastatic disease. If this trial shows a PFS improvement, it will definitively change the standard of treatment and it will highlight SBRT as a key treatment of metastatic disease. It will confirm the oligometastasis hypothesis as well as the Simon Norton hypothesis (92).
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy|RADIATION: Systemic treatment
Progression Free Survival (PFS), events: local recurrence, distant progression of the target metastases, any new metastasis, death of any cause The definition of progression is based on RECIST1.1 criteria. Progression is assessed locally, in any metastasis present at the time of randomization or in any newly diagnosed metastasis., evaluated with a minimal follow-up of 3 years in all patients
Cumulative rate of local failure, assessed with RECIST1.1 criteria, evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 3 years in all patients.|Overall survival, evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 3 years in all patients
