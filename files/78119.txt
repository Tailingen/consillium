Angiogenic and EGFR Blockade With Curative Chemoradiation for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
Radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent chemotherapy represents the state of the art in curative intent treatment for locally advanced squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. Tumor hypoxia and high levels of angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) are associated with treatment failure. Preclinical models reveal that radiotherapy itself may induce tumor secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Curability may consequently be reduced by multiple mechanisms. Over-expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also occurs commonly and increases the risk of treatment failure. The addition of EGFR blockade to RT alone increases the chance of a cure. Concurrent VEGF and EGFR blockade could be synergistic with one another and improve the effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiation for advanced head and neck cancer.

This study will add angiogenic and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade into an established program of curative intent concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancer. The safety and effectiveness of delivering the drugs bevacizumab and Tarceva in conjunction with twice daily irradiation and concurrent cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy will be determined.
Head and Neck Cancer|Pharynx Cancer
RADIATION: Chemoradiotherapy|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Erlotinib
Tumor Resolution, Complete response (resolution) of tumor on clinical exam., Within 30 days of completing RT
Local Regional Control, 1 yr following chemoradiation|Failure Free Survival, 3 yrs
Pre Radiation Period:

* Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days -14 and 0, or
* Tarceva (100 mg) daily from -14-0, or
* Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days -14 and 0; Tarceva (100 mg) daily from -14-0

Chemoradiation Period:

* Radiotherapy may be delivered via conventional 2-D, conformal 3-D, or intensity modulated (IMRT) technique as is clinically indicated. Radiotherapy and CDDP doses will be delivered uniformly to all treatment cohorts:

  * RT: 1.25 Gy BID M-F with a 6 hour interfraction interval
  * Treatment break during week 4. Total dose 70 Gy/7 weeks
  * CDDP: 33 mg/m2 M-W on weeks 1 and 5 of RT with standard DUMC hydration and anti-emetic regimens
* Bevacizumab (10mg/kg): Monday of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 of RT
* Tarceva (100 mg): Daily for weeks 1-7 of treatment, except for days receiving CDDP

Safety Assessments:

* Baseline and then weekly assessments of blood pressure and urine protein : creatinine ratios during lead in and chemoRT phases of treatment
* Baseline carotid Doppler ultrasound evaluation
* Carotid Doppler ultrasound evaluation 1 month post-chemoRT

Efficacy Assessments:

* MR Imaging/Spectroscopy to be done at baseline, end of lead-in phase, end of week 1 of chemoRT, and end of chemoRT
* Angiogenic and EGFR related cytokines. Specifically, blood samples will be obtained to assay levels of VEGF, b-FGF, IL-8, D-dimer, EGF, TGF. These samples will be obtained on the same dates as the MR studies with an additional set of samples obtained at the midpoint of the lead in phase of treatment (day -7).

Clinical Assessments:

* All patients will undergo a minimum of once weekly interval history and physical examination including fiberoptic pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy when indicated in the Department of Radiation Oncology to monitor for side effects and response to treatment as per standard routine for the care of patients with head and neck cancer.
* Patient compliance with Tarceva administration monitored via diary MRI/MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) DE-MRI
