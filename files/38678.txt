Different Patterns of Target Delineation in SBRT for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of two target delineation methods in SBRT for LAPC, so as to determine whether the target delineation method based on recurrence pattern can obtain better survival benefits.
