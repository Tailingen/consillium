Mutational Oncology in Clinical Practice
The study of biological profiling is of fundamental importance in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, particularly oncological ones, and for this reason, the integration of molecular characterization into clinical practice becomes essential. NGS allows a high number of samples to be sequenced simultaneously, generating a great deal of genomic information in a short time and at reasonable cost. This information is of fundamental importance for the study of oncogenic drivers and gene alterations that may have a prognostic and/or predictive role in response to new molecularly targeted drugs.

Policlinico A. Gemelli has begun a process of internal reorganization of the research infrastructure following its recognition in 2018 as an Institute of Hospitalization and Treatment with Scientific Character (IRCCS) for its commitment to the disciplines of "Personalized Medicine" and "Innovative Biotechnology." In particular, with regard to genomics, will be equipped with a state-of-the-art technological asset that includes a fully automated process for sample preparation and the highest gene sequencing power available today. This condition makes it possible to perform extensive genomic profiling for large numbers of patients at low cost and in reasonable time.
