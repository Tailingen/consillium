This is a single-center, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and immune response of MASCT-I with Apatinib and/or Camrelizumab in the treatment of patients with advanced bone and soft-tissue sarcoma. 60 patients with advanced bone and soft-tissue sarcoma will be recruited.

This study include two parts. In part A, patients were randomized into two groups: one group received MASCT-I A+Camrelizumab+Apatinib, and the other group received MASCT-I B +Camrelizumab+Apatinib, the administration schedules for MASCT-I is different between two groups. A total of 20 patients were planned to be recruited in part A. In part B, patients will be treated with MASCT-I (based on the administration schedule selected from part A) in combination with Apatinib. 40 patients were planned to be recruited in part B.

MASCT-I A and MASCT-I B were administered mainly at different frequencies.
