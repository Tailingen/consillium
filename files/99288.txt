BCMA-CD19 cCAR in Multiple Myeloma and Plasmacytoid Lymphoma
This is a phase I, interventional, single arm, open label, treatment study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BCMA-CD19 cCAR in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and plasmacytoid lymphoma.

BCMA-CD19 cCAR is a compound Chimeric Antigen Receptor (cCAR) immunotherapy with two distinct functional CAR molecules expressing on a T-cell, directed against the surface proteins BCMA and CD19. BCMA-CD19 cCAR is also aimed to treat multiple myeloma, a challenging disease due to the heterogeneity of myeloma cells, which renders single-antigen targeting CAR T-cell therapy ineffective. BCMA-CD19 cCAR is proposed to target both bulky myeloma cells expressing BCMA, and myeloma stem cells expressing CD19 to effectively eradicate the disease.

BCMA-CD19 cCAR is also aimed to treat heterogeneous plasmacytoid lymphoma bearing two types of lymphoma cells, regular lymphoma cells expressing CD19 and plasmacytoid lymphoma cells expressing BCMA. The use of two different targets intends to increase coverage and eradicate cancerous cells before resistance develops in surviving cancer cells that have undergone selective pressures or antigen escape.
