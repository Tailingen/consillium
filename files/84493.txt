Artificial Intelligence-based Voice Assessment of Children and Adults Respiratory Conditions
Acute and Chronic respiratory conditions represent a leading cause of death and morbidity in children and adults worldwide. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis and asthmatic exacerbations is based on clinical, and mostly subjective, clinical parameters with moderately accurate prognostic role. Patients undergoing neck radiotherapy need invasive assessments of larynx. A simple biomarker like Voice may facilitate the management of these conditions. Recent studies showed that VOICE may be used as a good and easy biomarker to diagnose and monitor several respiratory and non-respiratory conditions. A prospective study aimed to collected VOICE and other clinical data in adults and children with common acute and chronic respiratory conditions at high impact on healthcare systems will be performed. VOICE-omic data will be linked with clinical findings generating data integration, using artificial intelligence technology to develop a Decision Support Systems to provide the basis for non-invasive personalised early recognition, diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of patients with these conditions.

Acoustic parameters of voice signal in children, Fundamental frequency (F0), measured in Hertz, is defined as the number of times a sound wave produced by the vocal cords repeats during a given time period, it is also the number of cycles of opening/closure of the glottis., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in children, Jitter (%) is the variation from cycle of opening/closure of the glottis to cycle., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in children, Shimmer (%) relates to the amplitude variation of the sound wave., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in children, NHR (decibel) that is an assessment of the ratio between periodic components and non periodic component comprising a segment of voiced speech., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in adults affected by acute or chronic upper aerodigestive diseases, Fundamental frequency (F0), measured in Hertz, is defined as the number of times a sound wave produced by the vocal cords repeats during a given time period, it is also the number of cycles of opening/closure of the glottis., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in adults affected by acute or chronic upper aerodigestive diseases, Jitter (%) is the variation from cycle of opening/closure of the glottis to cycle; Shimmer (%) relates to the amplitude variation of the sound wave., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in adults affected by acute or chronic upper aerodigestive diseases, Shimmer (%) relates to the amplitude variation of the sound wave., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Acoustic parameters of voice signal in adults affected by acute or chronic upper aerodigestive diseases, NHR (decibel) that is an assessment of the ratio between periodic components and non periodic component comprising a segment of voiced speech., enrollment; 24 and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Pediatric Dyspnea Scale, The child is asked to answer the question "How much difficulty are you having breathing?" by choosing the column that best corresponds to his or her perceived symptoms (range from 0 not trouble at all to 7 very much trouble), enrollment; 24 hours and 48 hours post-therapy; 24 months|Voice Handicap Index score in adults affected by acute or chronic upper aerodigestive diseases, The Voice Handicap Index is self-assessment instrument useful for quantifying the biopsychosocial impact of a voice disorder.
