Docetaxel +/- Suramin in 2nd Line Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The overall purpose of the study is to determine whether or not the inclusion of suramin to standard treatment with docetaxel improves progression-free survival for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the second and third line settings.
Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Suramin|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression-free Survival in Months, Compare progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with advanced NSCLC treated with docetaxel with or without suramin after failure of first-line chemotherapy. PFS is defined as the duration of time from the time of randomization to time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 1 year
Response Rate Per RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Response rate per RECIST 1.1, as follows:

Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis Partial response (PR): At least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters Progressive disease (PD): SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is smallest). The SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2mm to 3mm, for example, does not qualify).

Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR not sufficient increase to qualify for PD, Up to 1 year|Overall Survival, Compare overall survival of participants in both treatment arms., Up to 50 months|Number of Participants With Toxicity/Adverse Events From Treatment, The investigators will compare the toxicity profiles of the two arms of therapy to determine if the docetaxel + suramin has a more favorable toxicity profile than docetaxel alone. This count includes only adverse events considered definitely, probably, or possibly due to treatment., Up to 2 years|Evaluation of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes for DNA Damage-induced Checkpoint Control., The investigators hypothesize that suramin in combination with docetaxel improves response rates and survival by increasing the cancer cell population in the M phase of the cell cycle. The G2-M checkpoint control score, defined as (%M-phase arrested cells after cisplatin+suramin)/(%M-phase arrested cells after cisplatin), is an indicator of the effect of suramin on cell accumulation in the M-phase. G2-M checkpoint control was evaluated as a predictor of PFS and OS in participant receiving suramin by linear correlation., Baseline
The overall purpose of the study is to determine whether or not the inclusion of suramin to standard treatment with docetaxel improves progression-free survival for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the second and third line settings.

Secondary objectives include:

* To compare response rate of patients in both treatment arms
* To compare overall survival of patients in both treatment arms
* To compare toxicity in both treatment arms
* To determine whether the survival benefit from suramin is associated with reduced M-phase entry in peripheral blood lymphocytes
