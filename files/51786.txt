A Study of Afatinib in Patients With Advanced Cancer With Changes in the HER Gene
This is a phase 2 study (the second phase in testing a new drug) to see how useful an investigational drug called afatinib is in patients with advanced cancer with changes in the HER gene.

Afatinib is a drug that is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of advanced lung cancer with changes in the HER gene. Afatinib works by attaching to and blocking a protein called HER from working. HER is an important protein that contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
