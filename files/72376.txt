A Clinical Study of CD19 Targeted CAR-T for Patients With CD19+ Lymphoma and Leukemia
Immunotherapy offers an extremely precise approach with the potential to eliminate cancer cells specifically. The newly designed CD19 targeted ICAR19 T cells can specifically kill CD19+ tumor cells. ICAR19 CART used the second generation of CART designation. In this study, the participants will receive several doses of autologous ICAR19 T cells and the investigators will determine the safety and therapeutic effects of these cells.
B Cell Leukemia|B Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: ICAR19 CAR-T cells
Measure the safety of ICAR19 CAR-T cells, To assess the adverse events of ICAR19 T cells infusion in patients with CD19+ malignancies, 2 years
Measure the anti-tumor effect of ICAR19 CAR-T cells, Assess for the therapeutic effects of ICAR 19 CAR-T cells in CD19-expressing leukemia and lymphoma, 3 years|Survival time of ICAR19 T cells in vivo., To measure the survival time of ICAR19 CAR-T cells in vivo, extra blood will be drawn from patients receive ICAR19 T cells infusion in the follow-up time, 5 years
