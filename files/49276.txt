Study of Chemotherapy and PD-1 Inhibitor Combination With Anti-angiogenesis to Treat Elderly Lung Cancer
This single-center, open-label, phaseâ… study is to evaluate the efficacy of Tislelizumab in combination with Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell lung cancer in Elderly Patients
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Objective response rate, ORR was calculated by the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR)., approximately 2 years
Overall survival, Time from the first use of the study drug to the death of the subject, approximately 3 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first according to RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 years|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the first recording of evidence of CR or PR until disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, approximately 2 years|Health-related quality of life, Measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) as presented in participants-reported outcomes.Scale construct including to assess Global health status/QoL with range from minimum scores 1 as worse outcome and maximum scores 7 as higher values represent a better; Physical functioning, Role functioning, Emotional functioning, Cognitive functioning, Social functioning, Fatigue, Nausea and vomiting, Pain Dyspnoea, Insomnia, Appetite loss, Constipation, Diarrhoea and Financial difficulties with range from maximum scores 4 as worse outcome and from minimum scores 1 as higher values represent a better., approximately 2 years|Safety and tolerance, Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, approximately 2 years
