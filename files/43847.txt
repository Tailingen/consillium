Evaluate REC-4881 in Patients With FAP
This is a multicenter, two-part trial in participants with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
DRUG: REC-4881|DRUG: Placebo
Characterize plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of REC-4881, Maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration (Cmax), time to reach maximum (peak) plasma concentration (Tmax), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), Assessed at multiple timepoints from Day 1 through 43 days in Part 1|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and treatment discontinuation and dose modification due to toxicity, 16 weeks (Part 2)|Evaluate totality of data to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Determination of the RP2D, 27 months (Part 2)|Percent change from baseline in polyp burden, Effect of REC-4881 on duodenal adenomas and rectal/pouch adenomas, 9 weeks (Part 2)
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and treatment discontinuation and dose modification due to toxicity, 43 days (Part 1)|Characterize plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of REC-4881, Maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration (Cmax), time to reach maximum (peak) plasma concentration (Tmax), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), Assessed at multiple timepoints from Day 1 through Week 3 (Part 2)|Assess the effect of REC-4881 on polyp number, histological grade and disease score, Change from baseline in polyp number, polyp number \>5 mm, highest histological grade, spigelman stage classification for duodenal polyps, and inSiGHT stage for rectal/pouch polyps, 12 weeks (Part 2)
This is a Phase 1b/2, trial to evaluate efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of REC-4881 in participants with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). This two-part study will treat participants with phenotypic classical FAP with disease involvement of the duodenum or the residual colon/rectum/pouch as the primary disease site.

Part 1 of the study enrolled seven participants with FAP who are post-colectomy/proctocolectomy. Participants were randomized to Placebo or REC-4881.

Part 2 of the study will treat participants with escalating dose levels of REC-4881 during the Dose Finding. Participants in Cohort Expansion will be treated with a dose(s) to determine the RP2D.
