Relacorilant in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced, Platinum-Resistant, High-Grade Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian-Tube Cancer
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival (OS) (evaluated independently, as dual primary endpoints) in patients treated with intermittent regimen of Relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel compared with patients treated with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy.
Ovarian Neoplasm|Fallopian Tube Neoplasms|Peritoneal Neoplasms
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2|DRUG: Relacorilant 150 mg once daily (QD)|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2
Progression-free Survival as Assessed by BICR, Time from randomization until the time of first documented progressive disease (PD) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient|Overall survival, Time from randomization to death by any cause, Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient
PFS as Assessed by the Investigator, Time from randomization until the time of first documented progressive disease (PD) by RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient|Objective Response as Assessed by BICR, Proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline who attain CR or PR by RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient|Best Overall Response as Assessed by BICR, Proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline who attain CR or PR as best response by RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient|Duration of Response as Assessed by BICR, Time from when response (CR or PR per RECIST v1.1) is first documented to first objectively documented PD or death (whichever occurs first), Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient|Clinical benefit rate as assessed by BICR, Proportion of patients who attain CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1., 24 weeks|Cancer Antigen (CA)-125 Response, Cancer antigen (CA)-125 response will be assessed per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria defined as ≥50% reduction in CA-125 from a pre-treatment sample and maintained for ≥28 days in patients with a pretreatment sample that is at least twice the upper limit of the reference range within 2 weeks before starting the treatment. In addition, patients who have a CA-125 response and whose CA-125 level falls to within the reference range will be classified as CA-125 complete responders., Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient|Combined Response According to RECIST v1.1 and GCIG Criteria, Combined response will be assessed for PD per RECIST v1.1 and for CA-125 response per GCIG criteria, Up to 24 months from enrollment of the last patient
As there are no currently approved therapies or effective standard of care for heavily pretreated patients with ovarian cancer who have exhausted single-agent chemotherapy and/or bevacizumab, the combination of intermittently administered relacorilant and nab-paclitaxel may demonstrate a substantial improvement without increased toxicity compared with nab-paclitaxel.

Patients will receive study treatment until confirmed progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. All patients will be followed for the collection of study endpoints, inclusive of disease progression and survival.
