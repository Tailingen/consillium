The Impact of a Patient Decision Aid on Treatment Choices for Patients With an Unexpected Malignant Colorectal Polyp
Management of unexpected malignant colorectal polyps removed endoscopically can be challenging due to the risk of residual tumor and lymphatic spread. International studies have shown that in patients choosing surgical management instead of watchful waiting, 54-82% of bowel resections are without evidence of residual tumor or lymphatic spread. As surgical management entails risks of complications and watchful waiting management entails risks of residual disease or recurrence, a clinical dilemma arises when choosing a management strategy.

Shared decision making (SDM) is a concept that can be used in preference sensitive decision making to facilitate patient involvement, empowerment, and active participation in the decision making process.

This is a clinical multicenter, non-randomized, interventional phase II study involving Danish surgical departments planned to commence in the first quarter of 2024. The aim of the study is to examine whether shared decision making and using a patient decision aid (PtDA) in consultations affects patients' choice of management compared with historical data. The secondary aim is to investigate Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) and Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) using questionnaire feedback directly from the patients.
