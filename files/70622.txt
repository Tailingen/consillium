A Study to Evaluate Safety and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of Debio 0123 as Monotherapy in Adult Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study has two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. The purpose of this study in Part 1, Dose Escalation Part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Debio 0123 as monotherapy with repeated dosing in adults with advanced solid tumors that recurred or progressed after prior therapy and/or for whom no standard therapy of proven benefit is available.

The purpose in Part 2, Expansion Part of this study, is to characterize the safety and tolerability of Debio 0123 in each study arm and overall when administered as monotherapy at the MTD/RP2D determined during the Dose Escalation Part 1 and to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Debio 0123 when administered as monotherapy to participants in each study arm.
