Verubulin, Radiation Therapy, and Temozolomide to Treat Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
This, international, multi-center, Phase 2 study of verubulin will be conducted in patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is an open-label dose finding study that will determine the safety and tolerability of verubulin in combination with standard treatment. Part B is a randomized open-label study that will investigate progression-free survival and overall survival of patients receiving verubulin, at the dose determined in Part A, in combination with standard treatment versus standard treatment alone.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Verubulin|DRUG: Temozolomide & Radiation Therapy
Part A: Safety, Assess the number and percentage of subjects with adverse events, abnormal laboratory parameters, and ECG changes as measures of safety and tolerability., 14 weeks|Part B: 9 Mo Progression-free survival, 9 Month
Part A: Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Measure the amount of verubulin in the body at specific time points when given with standard of care Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide, 18 weeks|Part B: 6 Mo Progression Free Survival, Assess 6-month progression-free survival and compare median progression-free survival time for Radiation Therapy plus Temozolomide (TMZ)plus verubulin to standard of care (Radiation Therapy plus TMZ alone), 6 month|Overall Survival, Assess overall survival and compare median overall survival time for Radiation Therapy plus Temozolomide (TMZ)plus verubulin to standard of care (Radiation Therapy plus TMZ alone), 18 months|Part B: 12 Mo Progression Free Survival, Assess 12-month progression-free survival and compare median progression-free survival time for Radiation Therapy plus Temozolomide (TMZ)plus verubulin to standard of care (Radiation Therapy plus TMZ alone), 12 months
