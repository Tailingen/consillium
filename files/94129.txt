Peptide-specific Vaccination in HLA-A*02 Positive Patients With Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy
The study evaluates the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in HLA-A\*02 positive patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy treated with a prostate-specific peptide vaccine in combination with different immune-adjuvants.

Tolerability, Tolerability, as measured by number of Participants with Adverse Events, Days 0-420|Treatment response, Treatment response, from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression as measured by PSA-value, Months 0-60
Patients with a biochemical recurrence after initial therapy can be included.
