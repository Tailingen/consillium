INTRODUCTION: The EUS has proven useful in the study and evaluation of the adrenal gland (AG) by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), in both the left and right glands.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diagnostic performance, safety, impact on clinical management, predictors of malignancy and cyto-pathological correlation of the EUS-FNA with AG.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: National multicenter retrospective study. Mailing-SEED partners. Participation: 17 Spanish centers. Inclusion period: April / 2003 to April / 2016 Inclusion criteria: All AG (Left / Right) punctured by EUS. Variables reviewed: Demographic characteristics, clinical, extension studies, USE and pathological data. Comparison between variables; and estimation of multivariate logistic model for cytology, mortality and therapeutic change.
