An Extension Protocol for Subjects Who Were Previously Enrolled in Other Tivantinib (ARQ 197) Protocols
This is an extension study that will allow participants to continue to receive study therapy when the original studies into which they were enrolled have reached their designated end-dates. This extension study is designed to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivantinib (ARQ 197) monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s) when given to participants who tolerated previous treatment well and may benefit from the continuing treatment.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Tivantinib|DRUG: Anti-Cancer Combination Therapy
Extent of Exposure to ARQ 197 in Participants Benefiting From Prior ARQ 197 Therapy, The duration of ARQ 197 exposure in this study was calculated as \[(date of last dose of study drug - date of first dose of study drug) + 1\]. Results refer to duration of ARQ 197 treatment in the present study only (i.e., does not include treatment received during participation in "feeder" studies)., Up to 3,021 days (up to 14-Jan-2019)
Number of Participants With â‰¥1 Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to 3021 days|Number of Participants Discontinuing Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to 3,021 days
This open label extension protocol enrolls participants who were treated in previous phase 1 (NCT01149720, NCT01517399, NCT01699061, NCT00612703, NCT00827177, and NCT00874042) and phase 2 (NCT00777309, NCT00557609, NCT00988741, NCT01395758 , and NCT01055067) tivantinib studies that have reached their designated end-dates. Participants enrolled in this extension protocol will provide further safety and tolerability information about tivantinib monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s) at the same dose(s), and same schedule(s) in which they were originally enrolled.
