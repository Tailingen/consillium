Lomustine With and Without Reirradiation for First Progression of Glioblastoma: a Randomized Phase III Study
Despite comprehensive multimodal treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma, almost all patients suffer from tumour relapse. Currently, no standard of care exists to treat these tumour relapses. Treatment options include repeated surgery (if feasible), systemic therapy (bevacizumab, lomustine, temozolomide re-challenge), reirradiation and best supportive care. Currently, the superiority of combined chemoradiation versus chemotherapy alone remains unproven. Given that lomustine is the standard chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in Europe and the unclear efficacy of reirradiation, we want to explore whether combining lomustine and reirradiation may be a better treatment than lomustine alone. The results of the prospective randomized trial proposed here should demonstrate a significant improvement in overall survival when lomustine is combined with reirradiation in patients with recurrent glioblastoma compared to lomustine alone without adversely affecting quality of survival. The trial will be stopped based on overall survival in a preplanned futility and efficacy interim analysis.
First Progression of Glioblastoma
DRUG: Lomustine|RADIATION: Reirradiation
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the number of days from date of enrolment to the date of death due to any cause, From the date of enrolment up to the date of death, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Events are progressions based on Response Assessment in Neuro Oncology (RANO) criteria as determined by the local investigator ., From the date of enrolment up to the date of first objective progression or the date of death whichever occur first, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL), HRQoL will be assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) version 3., From the date of enrolment until disease progression, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled|Toxicity profile of lomustine plus reirradiation, Safety according to the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0 for toxicity and Serious Adverse Event reporting., From the date of enrolment until end of study treatment 30 (± 7 days) after last dose, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled|Neurocognitive functioning of lomustine pus reirradiation, Neurocognitive functioning assessed by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), From the date of enrolment until end of study treatment 30 (± 7 days) after last dose, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled|To transform self-reported quality of life data from the QLQ-C30 into health utility values, ready to be used in subsequent health economic analyses., A deterioration event is defined as ≥\>10-point worsening from baseline in the GHQ without further improvement (i.e., no subsequent ≥\>10 point improvement) or death due to any cause., From the date of enrolment until disease progression, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled|Objective response (ORR), From the date of enrolment up to the date of first objective progression or the date of death whichever occur first, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled|Complete response (CRR), From the date of enrolment up to the date of first objective progression or the date of death whichever occur first, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled
To assess health-related quality of life over time based on the results of 3 different scales (QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20 and the item list (IL46))., Changes in HRQoL from baseline in the GHQ/QoL, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, physical, role and social functioning scale scores assessed over time will be evaluated descriptively. Descriptive summaries such as median, range (minimum, maximum), IQR, mean and standard deviation will be provided for all the other scales from the QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20 and the item list (IL46).

For functional and global HRQoL scales, higher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100 scale. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents more severe symptoms., From the date of enrolment until disease progression, assessed up to 40 months after first patient is enrolled
