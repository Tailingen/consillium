Dose Escalation Study of NKP-1339 to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximal tolerated dose of NKP-1339, a ruthenium containing compound administered intravenously on a weekly schedule, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The responses to treatment in this population will be evaluated. In addition, the PD and PK properties of the compound will be explored.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: NKP-1339
Number of participants with related adverse events, The incidence and severity of related adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be used to assess the safety and tolerability of NKP-1339., 8 weeks
Composite of pharmacokinetics, Plasma and urine samples will be analyzed to determine Cmax, Tmax, AUC, terminal elimination rate, elimination half-life, clearance,and volume of distribution., 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours|To report any responses to NKP-1339 in subjects with advanced tumors, Tumor assessments every 2 cycles if patients continue treatment beyond 2 Cycles. Treatment is allowed beyond 2 cycles in patients who achieved at least stable disease, at the discretion of investigator and consent of the patient., >8 weeks|To explore pharmacodynamic endpoints which may be of use in the further development of NKP-1339, Transferrin, transferrin receptor and GRP-78 in plasma., 8 weeks
NKP-1339 is a novel GRP78 targeted ruthenium based anti-cancer compound which is intravenously administered. GRP78 is a key regulator of misfolded protein processing, which is unregulated in cancer cells. In nonclinical anti-tumor studies, NKP-1339 showed activity against many tumor types, including those resistant to platinum and other standard anti-cancer agents. This Phase I trial evaluates the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NKP-1339.
