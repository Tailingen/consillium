A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of Orally Administered SM08502 Combined With Hormonal Therapy or Chemotherapy in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, dose expansion study in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of SM08502 administered orally (PO), once daily (QD), following a 5 days on 2 days off treatment schedule in combination with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Alternative dosing schedules may be explored in Part 1 if necessary. The recommended Part 2 dose and schedule for each combination will then be further evaluated in the Part 2 expansion.

Dosing will occur in 21- or 28-day cycles (depending on the combination partner) and treatment with SM08502 will continue within each subject unless treatment is discontinued due to toxicity, disease progression, initiation of a new anti-neoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, the Sponsor terminates the study, or the subject no longer meets retreatment criteria.
