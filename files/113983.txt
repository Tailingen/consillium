Assessing Jet Administration of pBI-11 for the Treatment of Patients With HPV16/18+
This is a randomized phase II study. The primary goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of three monthly pBI-11 DNA administrations in each thigh of patients with persistent human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and/or human papillomavirus (HPV18+).
HPV Infection
DRUG: pBI-11
Safety of Vaccination, To determine the safety of repeat administration of pBI-11 DNA vaccine in patients with persistent HPV16/18+ \<CIN2. Safety will be determined by tabulating adverse events including vaccine site reactions., 12 months|Feasibility of Vaccination, To determine the feasibility of repeat administration of pBI-11 DNA vaccine in patients with persistent HPV16/18+ \<CIN2. Feasibility will be estimated as the percentage of participants receiving all three injections of vaccines., 12 months|Effect of Vaccination, To assess the effect of pBI-11 vaccination on the clearance of HPV16/18 in cytologic specimens at month 6, 6 months
Impact of Vaccination on Progression to HPV 16/18, To assess the impact of vaccination upon progression to HPV16/18 messenger RNA (mRNA)+ CIN2+ by month 12, 12 months|Levels of HPV16/18, To evaluate the levels and phenotype of circulation HPV16/18 E6/E7-specific T cells in peripheral blood pre- and post-vaccination by each regimen, Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months|Changes in Cytopathology, To evaluate changes in cytopathology of specimens taken pre- and post-vaccination by each regimen, Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months
This is a randomized phase II study. The primary goal of this study is two-fold; one is to determine the safety and tolerability of three monthly pBI-11 DNA administrations in each thigh of patients with persistent HPV16 and/or HPV18+ \< cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2), wherein either 0.1 mL (0.3 mg) of the plasmid DNA is administered intradermally (I.D.) into each thigh (for a total of 0.6 mg DNA at each visit) using a Pharmajet Tropis device, or 0.5 mL (1.5 mg) of the plasmid DNA is administered intramuscularly (I.M.) into each thigh (for a total of 3 mg DNA at each visit) using a Pharmajet Stratis device; and the other is to evaluate the effect of vaccine on (HPV16/18) viral DNA clearance. Secondary goals are to seek preliminary evidence of prevention of disease progression and assess induction of an HPV16/18-specific immune response to select the appropriate regimen for a subsequent phase III clinical trial. Persistence is defined as positivity on two sequential tests. A total of 72 participants will be enrolled in 4 arms of the study in a 2:1:2:1 ratio (24 patients randomized to the intervention and 12 patient randomized to placebo via Tropis device, and 24 patients randomized to the intervention and 12 patient randomized to placebo via Stratis device).
