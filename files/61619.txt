To Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Autologous CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T Cells in Relapsed/Refractory B- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL)
A Phase II Open-Label Single-arm Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of locally manufactured autologous CD19-directed CAR T-cells in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory B- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) or patients not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)
Relapsed/Refractory B- Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: CAR-T cells
Overall response rate (ORR), The ORR is the sum of patients achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) at day 30, then 3 monthly up to 24 months after receiving CAR T-cells determined by the investigator following Lugano criteria in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

Response assessment will be determined using a PET CT scan, or other relevant imaging studies and compared to the baseline (pre-CAR-T infusion) study., From day 30, then 3 monthly until 24 months after infusion of CAR-T cells
overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of CAR-T cell infusion to the date of death from any cause. Patients who are still alive will be censored at the date of last contact., OS at day 30, 6 months and one year, and 2 years following CAR-T cells infusion|Incidence of adverse events, Cumulative incidence of CAR-T cell treatment-related adverse events (AEs) graded by ASCT consensus grading criteria for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) and by common terminology criteria adverse events (CTCAE) versions 5.0 for other AEs in p\[articular hematotoxicity and infection., From the time of infusion up to 24 months after infusion of CAR-T cells
A Phase II Open-Label Single-arm Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of locally manufactured autologous CD19-directed CAR T-cells in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory B- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) or patients not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)
