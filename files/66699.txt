Thyroid cancer is a most common solid organ cancer in South Korea, according to 2014 statistics from Korea Central Cancer Registry.

The most important treatment of thyroid cancer is a surgery. Principle of thyroid cancer surgery is cancer-involved thyroid gland resection and central/lateral compartment of neck node dissection.

Part of surgical complications associated with neck lymph node dissection are seroma and chyle leakage. Incidence of seroma and chyle leakage have been reported as 4-5% and 1-7% in previous studies. Currently, there's no effective agents to prevent these complications.

"Polyglycolic Acid Mesh Sheet (NeoveilTM)" is a tissue strengthening repair agent which is prevent air or fluid leakage. It's effects were proven in various surgical field - prevent air leakage in lung surgery, reduce pancreatic fistula in pancreas surgery and so on. However, there's no result in thyroid cancer surgery.

This study will investigate the usability of NeoveilTM in thyroid cancer surgery and have the effect of preventing seroma and chyle leakage.
