Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients With Mediastinal Lymph Node Metastases
The main objective of this trial is to compare feasibility and efficacy of sequential neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 44Gy concomitant boost to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Secondary objectives are to assess the value of position emission tomography (PET）in predicting pathological response and event-free survival（EFS）in stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Further to compare the amount of serum DNA in patients with stage IIIa NSCLC before, during and after chemotherapy, before and after radiotherapy (in arm A) and during follow-up in patients randomized into the trial and to correlate the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variation with tumor response, remission duration and overall survival.
