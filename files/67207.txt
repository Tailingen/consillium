Study of RAS(ON) Inhibitor Combinations in Patients With Advanced RAS-mutated NSCLC
The purpose of this platform study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of novel RAS(ON) inhibitors combined with Standard(s) of Care (SOC) or with each other.

The first three subprotocols include the following:

Subprotocol A: RMC-6291 +/- RMC-6236 + SOC Subprotocol B: RMC-6236 + SOC Subprotocol C: RMC-9805 +/- RMC-6236 + SOC
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, NSCLC|KRAS, NRAS, HRAS-mutated NSCLC|KRAS G12C-mutated Solid Tumors, Lung Cancer|Lung Cancer Stage IV, Advanced Solid Tumor, Cancer|RAS G12D-mutated NSCLC
DRUG: RMC-6291|DRUG: RMC-6236|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: RMC-9805
Adverse events, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and serious AEs and clinically significant changes in laboratory values, ECGs and vital signs, Up to 5 years|Dose limiting toxicities, Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, 21 days
Drug concentrations over time, Up to 21 weeks|Cmax, Maximum observed blood concentration of each drug as applicable per subprotocol, Up to 21 weeks|Tmax, Time to reach maximum blood concentration of each drug as applicable per subprotocol, Up to 21 weeks|AUC, Area under the concentration-time curve of each drug as applicable per subprotocol, Up to 21 weeks|ORR, Objective Response Rate per RECIST v1.1, Up to 5 years|DOR, Duration of Response per RECIST v1.1, Up to 5 years
The platform study design allows combinations of RAS(ON) inhibitors with other anticancer agents to be evaluated in patients with RAS-mutated solid tumors with a focus on NSCLC.

This is an open-label platform Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of novel RAS(ON) inhibitors combined with Standard of Care (SOC), and to define the Recommended Phase 2 Dose and Schedule (RP2DS). Enrollment of patients with KRAS or RAS mutations will be specified in each subprotocol.

Subprotocol A is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of RMC-6291, with or without RMC-6236, in combination with pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy, in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced solid tumors.

Subprotocol B is an open-label, multicenter, Phase1b/2 study of RMC-6236 in combination with pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy, in patients with RAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

Subprotocol C is an open-label, multicenter, Phase1b/2 study of RMC-9805 with or without RMC-6236, in combination with other anticancer agents, in patients with RAS G12D-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

Each subprotocol consists of two parts: Part 1 - Dose Exploration and Part 2 - Dose Expansion.
