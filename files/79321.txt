Sorafenib and Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded to Chemotherapy
RATIONALE: Sorafenib and erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib together with erlotinib works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the response rate of sorafenib tosylate in combination with erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer refractory to 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens.

Secondary

* To assess the response duration in patients treated with this regimen.
* To assess the disease control rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* To assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.
* To analyze biomarkers, including evaluation of EGFR expression, mutational analysis of EGFR and K-ras, and immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR downstream pathway (phospho-EGFR, phospho-AKT, phospho-Erk, phospho-STAT3).

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tissue samples are analyzed at the nucleic acid level for EGFR mutation (exon 18-21) and K-ras mutation (exon 2), DNA mutations via PCR, presence of EGFR protein by IHC, and downstream effectors of EGFR activation by IHC.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
