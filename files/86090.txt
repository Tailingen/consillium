Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiotherapy With Temozolomide in Elderly Glioblastoma
In newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients aged 70 years or older who are suitable for concurrent temozolomide, the optimal dose of radiation therapy is controversial . The purpose of this study is to compare conventional radiotherapy of 60 Gy (6 weeks) versus hypofractionated radiotherapy of 40 Gy (3 weeks) in terms of overall survival as the primary endpoint along with progression-free survival, toxicity, quality of life, and prognostic biomarkers.
Glioblastoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy|RADIATION: Conventional radiotherapy|DRUG: Temozolomide
Overall survival, from randomization, follow-up until 2 years
progression-free survival, from randomization, follow-up until 2 years|treatment-related toxicity, any treatment-related toxicity, follow-up until 2 years|patient-reported quality of life, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0): range, 0-100 (a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL; a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brain Neoplasm (EORTC QLQ-BN20): range, 20-80; lower score means better outcome, follow-up until 2 years
