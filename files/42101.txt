An Exercise Intervention for Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy
This main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of an exercise intervention to counteract adverse side effects related to Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients. Specifically, a supervised and home-based exercise program will be used to assess its impact on clinical and behavioral variables related to ADT in prostate cancer patients.
Prostate Cancer|Physical Activity|Side-effects
BEHAVIORAL: Supervised and Home Based Exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Stretching Control Group
Bone Mineral Density, BMD will be measured by a DXA scan, 8-weeks
Physical Fitness, . The Bruce treadmill protocol will be used to examine VO2max using a ParvoMedics TrueOne 2400 metabolic cart, 8-weeks|Muscle strength, Grip strength will be measured in a standardized way (three times in each arm) using a Jamar Dynamometer, 8-weeks|Step Count, The Fit Bit reliably measures daily steps taken, distance walked, calories burned, and overall activity level., 8-weeks|Quality of Life (HRQOL), The 10-item PROMIS® Global Health Scale will be used to assess key HRQOL domains including pain, fatigue, mental health, physical health, social health, and overall health, 8-weeks|Hip/Waist Circumference, Anthropometric measures, 8-weeks|Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI will be measured according to height and weight, 8-weeks|Glucose/Lipid levels, A fasting finger stick sample of blood (35 μl) will be assessed for immediate analysis of lipid panel (i.e., total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and fasting glucose, 8-weeks
This study will assess the feasibility of an exercise intervention to counteract adverse side effects related to ADT in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Specifically, we will use an exercise intervention and assess its impact on bone mass density, Body Mass Index (BMI), hip/waist circumference levels, biomarkers (i.e., glucose, lipids), step count, grip strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®). In this 8-week two-arm randomized clinical trial, 40 PCa patients receiving ADT will be randomly assigned to an exercise (n=20) or a stretching control group (n=20) with a follow-up at 8-weeks.
