This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of JNJ-68284528. The study will include two phases. In Phase1b the study will enroll adults with multiple myeloma with interval assessments for potential dose escalation or de-escalation in subsequent participants. The dose selected at the completion of phase 1b will be used in Phase 2. Following consent, enrolled participants will undergo an apheresis procedure to collect cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (JNJ-68284528). Following manufacture of the drug product, participants will undergo lymphodepletion prior to infusion of JNJ-68284528. Participants will be followed for at least 2 years after study drug infusion, with long-term 15 year follow-up on a separate study. The study will evaluate safety, biomarkers, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluations and efficacy.
