SOMESThesia and ALIMentation
Cancer patients are at high risk for undernutrition. A study with head and neck cancer patients showed that 50% suffered from undernutrition (Prevost et al., 2014). Sensory alterations may also involve sensory changes from the physiological structures of the mouth or neural pathways and hedonic changes, i.e., although food may taste the same as usual, that taste is no longer judged as pleasant. These changes lead to an aversion to food and a decrease in the pleasure of eating (Bernhardson et al., 2009).

Despite the large number of published studies on taste and smell alterations in diverse cancer populations, few have examined other dimensions of oral sensory alterations. Studies focusing on somesthesia have mostly been conducted in the area of oral physiology or stomatology in relation to oral pain and rehabilitation (Howes, Wongsriruksa, Laughlin, Witchel, \& Miodownik, 2014).

Regarding food perception, somesthesia provides information about both texture, temperature, and trigeminal sensations. These sensations are detected by mechanical, thermal, nociceptive receptors present throughout the oral epithelium (Simons \& Carstens, 2008). In addition to taste and smell, food perception is influenced by oral somatosensation and studies have demonstrated an interrelated relationship between these oral sensations (Spence, Piqueras-Fiszman 2016). Therefore, ther might have a correlation between oral somatosensation and food preferences, subsequently influencing eating behavior and food consumption. A standard method, using a so-called Von Frey Hair monofilament, to assess tactile sensation was developed by Etter et al. (Etter, N. M et al.,. J. Vis. Exp. 2020) but has so far been only minimally used in Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) cancer (Bearelly, Wang, \& Cheung, 2017; Bodin, Jäghagen, \& Isberg, 2004; Elfring, Boliek, Seikaly, Harris, \& Rieger, 2012).

The aim of the study is to determine the variability and role of somatosensory perception (texture, pungency transmitted through the trigeminal system, and temperature) on food preferences in cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: Sensorial tests|BEHAVIORAL: food preferences questionnaires
Oral tactile sensitivity score, The primary endpoint of the study is to measure oral tactile sensitivity using the Von Frey Hair monofilament pressure test in head and neck cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.
thermic sensitivity score, Measurement on a visual analog scale (gLMS) of sensitivity to heat and cold using dental mirrors. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.|trigeminal sensitivity score, Visual analog scale (gLMS) measurement of trigeminal sensitivity using prepared solutions. This will be assessed at inclusion for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after inclusion for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after inclusion.|texture sensitivity score, Measurement of texture sensitivity (firmness, consistency, and roughness) on a visual analog scale (gLMS) from food samples. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.|salivary function, Saliva function measurement with a BUFFER Saliva-check kit. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.|food preference score, Measurement of food preference based on food pictures on a visual analog scale and according to the participant's ethnicity, family and social status. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.|sensory perception, dietary habits and oral health, Measured by self-reported questionnaires of subjective sensory perception, dietary habits, and oral health and according to the participant's ethnicity, family and social status. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.|correlation sensory perception and food preferences, Correlation analysis between sensory perception and food preferences for each participant. This will be assessed at recruitment for healthy volunteers and between 1 to 3 months after recruitment for head and neck cancer patients., Up to 3 months after recruitment.
