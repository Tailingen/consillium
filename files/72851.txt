Hepatocellular Carcinoma Liver Organoids
The goal of this interventional study is to create hepatocellular carcinoma organoids from liver bioptic samples of individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* the feasibility of hepatocellular carcinoma organoids integrated with host gut microbiota and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
* the molecular pattern of the organoid tumor microenvironment
* the in vitro therapeutic response of hepatocellular carcinoma organoids
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Liver biopsy
Success rate of hepatocellular carcinoma organoids integrated with host gut microbiota and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Number of successfully created organoids from all hepatocellular carcinoma samples, within 12 months
Analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma organoid transcriptome distribution within a reference set from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Comparison between organoids transcriptome and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, within 12 months|Evaluation of the concordance of somatic genetic mutations between the organoid and the original tumor, DNA organoids and original tumor sample sequencing and comparison between the somatic genetic mutations found in both models, within 12 months|Correlation between gut microbiota community profiling and growth rate of hepatocellular carcinoma organoids, Definition of microbiota composition via DNA and RNA sequencing and correlation between specific bacteria abundance and successful organoids growth, within 12 months|Treatment response evaluation in vitro, Evaluation of organoids' tumor cells survival after 5 days of chemotherapy treatment.

Treatment will include different concentrations of sorafenib, lenvatinib, atezolizumab, bevacizumab, tremelimumab, durvalumab, regorafenib, cabozantinib. Tumor cells vitality will be assessed trough Cell TitelGlo3D Cell Viability Assay., Day 5
