Sclerotherapy of Internal Spermatic Veins in Patients With Varicocele and Localized Prostate Cancer
Patients with varicocele in whon early prostate cancer will be found will undergo venographic embolization of both spermatic veins. The study hypothesis is that this procedure will induce a gradual regression of the prostate volume that may decrease prostate cancer cells. Close follow-up will ensure that necessary therapy will be provided if needed according to clinical criteria. Results in terms of prostate size PSA level and tumor size will be recorded.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: venographic occlusion of spermatic veins
Safety performance of the procedure. The change in tumor size and prostate cancer cells as evaluated by trans-rectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy, one year
The change in size of the prostate as evaluated by ultrasound Change in PSA value. Reduction of above 20% in nocturia, one year
