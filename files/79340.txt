Endocrine Therapy + OSI-906 With or Without Erlotinib for Hormone-Sensitive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Erlotinib attacks a part of cancer cells that helps them live and grow. Studies done in human beings show that this drug can make a difference in the way anti-estrogens work in hormone-sensitive breast cancers. OSI-906 attacks a different part of the cancer cell that helps them live and grow. Studies done in the laboratory show that OSI-906 can make a difference in the way anti-estrogens work in hormone-sensitive breast cancers.
Hormone-sensitive Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: OSI-906|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Goserelin
Anti-tumor Activity of OSI-906, Time to progression measured in months from study entry to date of disease progression, From study entry to 6 months
Safety Profile Based on Number of Patients With Each Worst-grade Toxicity, According to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events with 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life threatening/disabling, and 5 = death., Every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks|Number of Participants With Tumor Response Per RECIST, Per RECIST criteria v. 1.1: measurable lesions: complete response (CR) disappearance of target lesions, partial response (PR) \> 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) \> 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions, stable disease (SD) neither sufficient decrease nor increase of the sum of smallest sum of the LD of target lesions, Every 12 weeks to tumor progression|Correlative Studies, Biomarkers associated with response to OSI-906 + Erlotinib + Letrozole + Goserelin, < or = to 2 weeks before initiation of Phase II study treatment period
The safety run component of this trial is to determine the safety profile of the OSI-906, erlotinib and anti-endocrine treatment combination. The phase II component evaluates the antitumor activity of the combination OSI-906, erlotinib and endocrine therapy.
