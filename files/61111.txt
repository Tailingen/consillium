A Pilot Study of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) to Enhance Visualization of Pituitary Adenomas
5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) was approved by the FDA as an intraoperative optical imaging agent in patients with suspected high-grade gliomas (HGGs) in 2017. The investigators plan to administer 5-ALA to patients with pituitary tumors to demonstrate whether it can be used as an intraoperative optical imaging agent for this pathology. Overall, this pilot study will afford the overall opportunity to improve surgical management and advancement of the science of neurological and neuroendocrine disease.
Pituitary Adenoma
DRUG: 5-aminolevulinic acid
Number of patients with intraoperative observed fluorescence of pituitary tumor, Under blue light exposure of tumor, the investigators will document whether red fluorescence is seen (+ fluorescence) or not seen (- fluorescence). These will be categorized as a binary finding. If fluorescence is seen, the surgeon will biopsy this area to confirm that fluorescent tissue is consistent with pituitary adenoma by histopathology., through study completion, an average of 3 months
Differences in presence of fluorescence based on hormone receptor staining of the pituitary adenoma, If possible, the investigators will report differences in presence and degree of fluorescence between different types of pituitary adenomas based on their hormone receptor staining status by immunohistochemistry., through study completion, an average of 3 months
