First In Human (FIH) Study of REGN5459 in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM)
In the phase 1 portion of the study, the primary objectives are to assess the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to determine a recommended phase 2 dose regimen (RP2DR) of REGN5459 as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have exhausted all therapeutic options that are expected to provide meaningful clinical benefit.

In the phase 2 portion of the study, the primary objective is to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by objective response rate (ORR).

In the phase 1 and phase 2 portion, the secondary objectives of the study are:

* To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status, and overall survival (OS)
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of REGN5459
* To characterize the immunogenicity of REGN5459
* To evaluate the effects of REGN5459 on patient-reported quality of life (QoL), symptoms, functioning and general health status

In the phase 1 portion of the study only, the secondary objective of the study is to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by ORR.

In the phase 2 portion of the study only, the secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN5459.

The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) , symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much.", Up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose|Patient-reported QOL per EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Multiple Myeloma module 20 (EORTC QLQ-MY20), Phase 1 and phase 2

The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a self-administered instrument to assess QoL in persons with MM. This 20-item questionnaire measures the following domains: symptom scales, including disease symptoms (6 items) and symptoms related to side effects of treatment (10 items); function scale and future perspective (3 items); and body image (1 item). A high score represents a high level of symptoms or problems., Up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose|Patient-reported QOL per EuroQoL-5 Dimension-3 Level Scale (EQ-5D-3L), Phase 1 and phase 2

The EQ-5D-3L is a self-administered generic standardized health status measure, consisting of an EQ-5D descriptive system and an EQ visual analog scale. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system assesses 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a 3-level scale: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The EQ visual analog scale component is a vertical visual analog scale used by patients to rate their health., Up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose|Change in patient-reported global health status/QOL per EORTC QLQ-C30, Phase 1 and phase 2

The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) , symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much.", Baseline up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose|Time to definitive deterioration in patient-reported global health status/QOL per EORTC QLQ-C30, Phase 1 and phase 2
