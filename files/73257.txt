Individual Dietary Counseling Based on Taste-tests in Patients With Hematological Cancer in Cytostatic Therapy
The purpose of the study is to investigate whether a simple taste-test will increase the intake of energy as part of the individual dietary counseling.
Hematological Malignancy
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Taste-test|OTHER: Standard care
Consumption of energy as a percentage of estimated need, difference - before and after intervention, 6 weeks
Fat-free-mass and fat-mass in percent (bioimpedance measurement), difference - before and after intervention, 6 weeks|Satisfaction (measured with EROTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0), difference - before and after intervention. Higher scores means worse outcome. Lower scores means better outcomes., 6 weeks|Hand-grip-strength (measured with a dynamometer), difference - before and after intervention, 6 weeks|Body weight, difference - before and after intervention, 6 weeks|Protein intake, difference - before and after intervention, 6 weeks|Burning/pain in the mouth (measured on a scale), difference - before and after intervention measured with Likert scale (1 to 5). Higher scores means a worse outcome. Lower scores means better outcomes., 6 weeks
The investigators will investigate the tastes (umami, bitter, salty, sweet and sour) that the patients prefers in order to increase the energy intake and reduce the risk of weight loss and loss of fat-free mass for patients with hematological cancer.

The study will be conducted as a single blinded randomized controlled trial. 40 patients will be recruited, and will be divided into two groups; the intervention group and the control group. The patients will not know which group they belong to.
