Multicenter Trial of Abiraterone Acetate With or Without Cabazitaxel in Treatment of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see what effects (good and bad) treatment with abiraterone acetate (an oral hormonal agent) and prednisone (a steroid) with and without cabazitaxel (a chemotherapy) have on the cancer and to find out more about whether specific laboratory tests on tumor are useful in predicting how the patient will respond to treatment.
