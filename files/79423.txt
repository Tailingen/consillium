Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer the in laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

GENETIC: DNA methylation analysis|GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: microarray analysis|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Identification of differential patterns of promoter hypermethylation and gene expression in pairwise comparisons with other cohorts and normal controls
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine whether the pattern of global and TSG-specific promoter CpG island hypermethylation and gene silencing that we have shown characterizes MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) infant bilineage ALL is also characteristic of other subsets of MLL-r leukemia.

OUTLINE: Previously collected cryopreserved cells from diagnosis are analyzed for promoter methylation via HELP arrays, gene expression arrays, and RT-qPCR.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 samples (8 from each of 4 biologically defined cohorts) will be analyzed.
