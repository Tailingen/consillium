A Phase I Dose-finding Trial of Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel Combined With Cisplatin
Primary objective of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel combined with a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) delivered as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with ovarian cancer.

In this single-center Phase I trial, Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (TITE-BOIN) was used. The starting dose for paclitaxel was 175 mg/m2, with escalation in 25 mg/m2 increments until the MTD was determined or the maximum dose level of 225 mg/m2 was reached. The target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate was 25%, and the total sample size was 30 patients.
