TOGETHER: Track Outcomes and Guidance, Technology for Health and Effective Resources
The goal of this project is to iteratively develop and test a TOGETHER pilot mobile app product in preparation for commercialization. TOGETHER is a mobile application on a smart software system that informal caregivers can use to develop and implement home-based care for cancer patients/survivors.

The Technical Objectives are to:

1. Establish the project team and obtain stakeholder feedback on what to include in the product.
2. Evaluate IT customization requirements and HIPAA compliance security, and privacy protocols.
3. Develop a prototype to show NCI and then a pilot version for beta and usability testing among stakeholders.
4. Enhance interoperability and test integration into health system(s) - if feasible.
5. Develop user support documentation for stakeholders.
