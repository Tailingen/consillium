Neoadjuvant Tirellizumab Combined With Chemotherapy for Early Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma(HNC-SYSU-004)
Surgery is usually the first choice for early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, there is currently a lack of consensus on whether patients with clinically negative cervical lymph nodes (N0) should undergo elective neck dissection (END) at the same time. About 20-30% of cT1-2N0M0 oral cancer patients have occult lymph node metastasis, and existing examination methods cannot accurately predict occult cervical lymph node metastasis. Therefore, most clinical retrospective and prospective studies recommend END for cN0 patients. Previous studies have found that no cancer cells were found in the cervical lymph nodes of 70% of patients after END. This unselective END can cause patients with accessory nerve dysfunction, neck scars, etc., and prolong hospitalization and surgery time. Exploring the treatment model for patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. This study intends to conduct a study on the neoadjuvant treatment of tislelizumab, carboplatin, and albumin-bound paclitaxel. After neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with early-stage oral cancer (T1-2N0M0), the primary tumor is treated with standard surgical treatment. Comparison with A single-center exploratory clinical study of traditional oral cancer radical resection + selective neck lymphadenectomy was conducted to explore its effectiveness through the difference in 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).

This research plan covers 40 patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma. They will be randomly divided into tislelizumab, chemotherapy combined with surgery (experimental group) and traditional surgery (control group) in a 1:1 ratio. The patients' tumors will be collected. Tissues, adjacent cancer tissues, whole blood samples, saliva samples, and matrix samples were used to observe the changes in imaging and pathology compared with treatment. At the same time, the clinical information of the patients was collected, such as quality of life indicators such as judgment function, pathological grading, staging, treatment, Spine, serology, imaging, etc., mainly to evaluate the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) between the experimental group and Weather Forecast, and the 3-year overall survival (OS) and patient quality of life between the experimental group and Weather Forecast.

Disease-free survival, DFS(by months) is defined as the time from treatment until the date of the first relapse (local/regional recurrence or distant metastasis) or death (from any cause) whichever comes firsts and regardless of whether the patient withdraws from treatment or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to disease DFS is defined as the time from treatment until the date of the first relapse (local/regional recurrence or distant metastasis) or death (from any cause) whichever comes firsts and regardless of whether the patient withdraws from treatment or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to disease relapse., 2 years|Quality of life assessed by EORTC QLQ-H&N35., The quality of life assessed by EORTC QLQ-H\&N35(the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module-35), 2 years
Overall survival(OS), Overall survival(OS) is the time from day 1 of study treatment(the time randomized) until death from any cause., 5 years|Major pathologic response, Pathologic response rate to neoadjuvant treatment in resected tumor and lymph nodes. The rate of major pathologic response, defined as \<10% residual viable tumor cells in the resection specimen will be compared to historic data with neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 6 weeks|Objective response rate, ORR, Objective tumor response, including CR and PR, was assessed using RECIST version 1.1., 6 weeks
