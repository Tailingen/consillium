A Dose Escalation Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) After Induction Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out the maximum dose of SBRT that can be safely given after chemotherapy for treatment of pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed surgically.

RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SBRT, Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are defined by â‰¥ Grade 3 treatment-related GI toxicity within 3 months of SBRT. These include: (1) Bowel (includes bowel perforation, obstruction, or hemorrhage) and (2) Stomach (bleeding ulcer, perforation). We will employ a standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3., after at least 3 months of induction chemortherapy
