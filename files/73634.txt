A Phase I Study of Weekly Gemcitabine in Combination With Infusional Fluorodeoxyuridine and Oral Calcium Leucovorin in Adult Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical toxicities associated with administering sequential dFdC as a one hour infusion followed by a continuous infusion of FUdR over 24 hours with low dose oral LV weekly for three weeks out of four.
Neoplasms
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: fluorodeoxyuridine|DRUG: leucovorin
The MTD and biochemically active dose of FUDR as a 24-hour and gemcitabine as a 2-hour infusion will be determined first (Part A); if the biochemically active FUDR dose is less than the MTD, new patients will be entered to determine the maximum tolerated duration of FUDR infusion (Part B).
