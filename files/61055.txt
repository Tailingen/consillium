Safety and Efficacy of Avelumab in Small Intestinal Adenocarcinoma
This is a single-agent, open label, one-arm phase 2 pilot study of avelumab in patients with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the small intestine.
Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Avelumab
Overall Response Rate as Measured Using RECIST 1.1, Response rate is the proportion of patients with overall complete (CR) or partial response(PR) among patients with valuable response outcome. Overall response will consider both target and non-target lesions, as well as new lesions.

Target lesions by CT/MRI: CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. PR: \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, In addition, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or appearance of new lesions. Non-target lesions: CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of applicable tumor marker level above the normal limits. PD: progression of existing non-target lesions., Measured every 8 weeks through study completion, an average of 1 year|Number of Patients With Each Worst-Grade Toxicity, To describe the safety profile of avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma, On-study date to 30 days following final dose of study drug, or until the event is resolved, stabilized, or determined to be irreversible by the participating investigator if beyond 30 days.
Overall Survival, On study date until death from any cause, Every 3 months after completing treatment up to 5 years|Progression Free Survival, On-study date until disease progression or death. Progression is \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions or non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions., On-study date to lesser of date of progression or date of death from any cause measured up to 3 years after treatment|Duration of Response, Time from tumor response date to disease progression or death for any reason., Date of first partial or complete response as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria to date of recurrence or disease progression up to 3 years
Primary Objectives

* To describe any antitumor activity of avelumab monotherapy, as measured by the response rate in patients with advanced or metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.
* To describe the safety profile of avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

Secondary Objectives

* To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response of avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced small intestinal adenocarcinoma.
* To evaluate the association of tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, MSI status, lymphocytic infiltration, and somatic mutation burden with response.
