A Study for Optimization of 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch Based Indocyanine Green Near-infrared Fluorescence Navigated Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer Patients
A study for dosage-image optimization of 6% hydroxyethyl starch diluted indocyanine green for near-infrared fluorescence navigated sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer patient.
Breast Cancer|Sentinel Lymph Node
PROCEDURE: Near infrared fluorescence navigated sentinel lymph node mapping
Signal-to-background ratio (SBR), Evaluates the SBR of the near-infrared fluorescence between the retrieved sentinel lymph nodes and the background., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Penetration depth, Evaluates the depth of the deepest visualized subcutaneous lymphatics in the breast, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Sentinel lymph nodes pathology, The positivity and number of retrieved sentinel lymph nodes at definitive pathology report., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Time to total visualization of breast subcutaneous lymphatics, The time from injection of indocyanine green to total visualization of breast subcutaneous lymphatics, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Pre-clinical experiment has shown using 6% hydroxyethyl starch (VoluvenÂ®) as a solvent, compared with pure water, can improve brightness of indocyanine green particles at the same concentration. Similar findings have been addressed using human serum albumin as a solvent for indocyanine green in previous studies, but there was no report using 6% hydroxyethyl starch as a solvent till now. This study aims for clinical translation and optimization of 6% hydroxyethyl starch diluted indocyanine green in breast cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.
