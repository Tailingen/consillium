Study Comparing Pembrolizumab With Dual MAPK Pathway Inhibition Plus Pembrolizumab in Melanoma Patients
This is a Phase 2 trial consisting of 24 patients receiving the combination of dabrafenib + trametinib + pembrolizumab in 3 different dosing schemes and 8 patients receiving pembrolizumab standard monotherapy. All patients start with pembrolizumab standard therapy for 6 weeks and will then be randomized to continue pembrolizumab monotherapy or to receive additional intermitted/short-term dabrafenib + trametinib.

Stratification will be baseline LDH level and baseline PD-L1 expression.

Safety of different schemes of continuous/intermittent dabrafenib+trametinib during treatment with pembrolizumab as compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy as measured by SUSARs., Safety as measured by SUSARs during treatment week 0 till week 18., 18 weeks from baseline|Feasibility of different schemes of continuous/intermittent dabrafenib+trametinib during treatment with pembrolizumab as compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy as measured by adherence to the timelines in the study protocol., Feasibility as measured by adherence to the timelines in the study protocol (week 0 till week 18)., 18 weeks from baseline.|The immune-activating capacity of different schemes of continuous/intermittent dabrafenib+trametinib during treatment with pembrolizumab as compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy, Readout will be the alterations in magnitude or breadth of the self-antigen specific T cell responses in the time interval pre-treatment to week 18 intrapatient, and interpatient, pembrolizumab only (cohort 1) versus pembrolizumab plus intermittent dabrafenib/ trametinib (cohorts 2-4). To this purpose, we will analyze melanoma antigen-specific T cells responses by HLA-A2-restricted MHC-tetramer staining., 18 weeks from baseline.

To describe time to progression beginning from week 12 (cohorts 2-4)., As the short addition of dabrafenib+trametinib will induce for short time tumor regressions we will analyze cohorts 2-4 with a second baseline, namely the end of the targeted therapy at week 12, for progression free survival using to RECIST 1.1, Randomisation until week 12.|Changes of immune parameters within the tumor., In addition to the primary readout (broadening of the melanoma-specific T cell response in peripheral blood), we will analyze the effect of the different therapy schemes on tumor immune cell infiltration (IHC for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, FoxP3, PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, CD11b, HLA)., 18 weeks from baseline.
