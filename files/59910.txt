Clinical Study of SM3321 With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of SM3321 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: SM3321
Maximum tolerated dose, The highest dose when the proportion of subjects with DLT events during the DLT observation period was less than 1/3 or 2/6 of, DLT observation period: 28 days after the first dose [i.e., 1 Cycle ]|Phase II recommended dose（RP2D), RP2D will be determined based on safety, tolerability, PK, and PD study results, and may be at MTD/MAD or lower dose levels.

The RP2D cohort will include at least six evaluable subjects to further clarify safety and tolerability.

Adverse events in subjects that meet the definition of DLT outside the DLT observation period will not be used as a basis for dose escalation, but will be used as a reference for subsequent dose design and for evaluating the overall safety of future recommended doses, DLT observation period: 28 days after the first dose [i.e., 1 Cycle ]|Safety evaluation-1, Incidence and severity of DLT, adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and immune-related adverse events (irAE)(evaluated per \[National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events，NCI-CTCAE\] v5.0), Screen Period(Day-28~Day-1),Cycle 1 (Day1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 15,22, 23, 24, 25,27） (Cycle 2~Cycle N) Day 1±3 Days, within 7 days after stop dosing, 30±5 days after last dosing, 90±5 days after last dosing (1 Cycle=28 Days)|Safety evaluation-2, Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests, including blood routine examination, coagulation function, blood biochemistry, urine analysis, viral serology, Screen Period(Day-28~Day-1),Cycle 1 (Day1, 8, 15,22） (Cycle 2~Cycle N) Day 1±3 Days, within 7 days after stop dosing, 30±5 days after last dosing, 90±5 days after last dosing (1 Cycle=28 Days)|Safety evaluation-3, vital signs, including respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure, On the day of dosing, within 1 hour before dosing, every 15±5 minutes during dosing, at the end of dosing (within 5 minutes), and every 30±5 minutes after dosing. within 4 hours after the end of the first dosing|Safety evaluation-4, physical examination, examination of the entire human system/organ (skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, limbs, abdomen, back, musculoskeletal, nervous system and mental state), Screen Period(Day-28~Day-1),Cycle 1 (Day1, 8, 15,22） (Cycle 2~Cycle N) Day 1±3 Days, within 7 days after stop dosing, 30±5 days after last dosing, 90±5 days after last dosing (1 Cycle=28 Days)|Safety evaluation-5, electrocardiogram (ECG), Within 1 hour before dosing, 30 minutes after ending dosing, and 30 minutes after starting dosing 4 hours|Safety evaluation-6, echocardiography (ECHO), Scans or examinations are performed during the screening period and when clinically indicated|Safety evaluation-7, physical status (PS) in the Eastern United States Oncology Consortium (ECOG), Screen Period(Day-28~Day-1), (Cycle 2~Cycle N) Day 1±3 Days, within 7 days after stop dosing (1 Cycle=28 Days)
The goal of this clinical trial is to test patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SM3321 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
* To determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) , Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)of SM3321 in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. .
* To evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of SM3321 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors after single and multiple administration.
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of single and multiple administration of SM3321 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
* To evaluate the initial antitumor activity of SM3321 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
* To further evaluate serum biomarkers and explore the potential relationship between these markers and the antitumor activity and safety of SM3321.
* To explore the relationship between dose and/or PK exposure and effects(including anti-tumor activity and safety).
