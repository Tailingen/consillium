A Study of Elotuzumab in Combination With Pomalidomide and Low Dose Dexamethasone and Elotuzumab in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Relapsed or Refractory to Prior Treatment With Lenalidomide.
Study of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone (EPd Cohort) and elotuzumab in combination with nivolumab (EN Cohort) to assess the safety and efficacy of these combination therapies for treatment of relapsed or refractory MM patients.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Elotuzumab|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Nivolumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Progression is determined per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform criteria.

Participants who die without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death.

Participants who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable assessment. Participants who did not have any on study efficacy assessments and did not die were censored on the first dosing date.

Participants who switched to subsequent therapy prior to documented progression were censored on the date of the last evaluable assessment prior to the initiation of the new therapy., From first dose to study completion date (up to approximately 50 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percent of participants with best overall response of partial response (PR) or better. Response is determined per IMWG uniform criteria., From first dose to study completion date (up to approximately 50 months)
