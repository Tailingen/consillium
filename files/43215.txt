Sarcopenia in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated with Curative Hadrontherapy
The study focuses on the impact of sarcopenia on acute and late toxicities in head and neck tumor affected patients treated with particle therapy.

OTHER: questionnaires QLQ-FA12, Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form, Nutritional Risk Screening, diet questionnaire of frequency, ,body mass index measurement|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: blood biomarkers
skeletal muscle strength mass (SMM), measurement of sarcopenia to evaluate the development of the affection, before starting hadrontherapy treatment
To evaluate in HNC patients treated with particle therapy the impact of SP (measured by low skeletal muscle mass at the C3 vertebral body) on toxicity profile assessed according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE (version 5.0), defined as:

* Acute toxicity: within 3 months from the beginning of particle RT
* Late toxicity: more than 6 months after the end of particle RT. To investigate possible association between SP and nutritional
