Multihance at 3 Tesla (3T) in Brain Tumors
Compare the efficacy of MultiHance and Magnevist
Brain Tumor
DRUG: Multihance|DRUG: Arm 2 - Magnevist
Global Diagnostic Preference Between the Two Exams, Assessed by 3 blinded Readers for each of the 41 patients who had both MultiHance and Magnevist post dose MRI exam to assess whether the image with MultiHance was preferred, both contrast agents were equal, or the image with Magnevist was preferred. Each patient's image was reviewed by 3 readers., Postdose Images for MultiHance Exam and for Magnevist Exam Compared
