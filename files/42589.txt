A Retrospective Real World Analysis Of Sutent In Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma In Community And Academic Centers To Assess The Impact Of Dose Variation On Duration Of Response And Overall Survival
This is a retrospective, non-interventional study which looks at the cohort of Renal Cell Carcinoma patients in a real life clinical setting and analyses into factors why these patients have been surviving for as long as 3-5 years unlike Clinical study where the survival is around 2 years.

The factors which will be analysed include patient characteristics, dosage and adverse event management and tries to correlate these factors with survival.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
OTHER: Sutent: Observational Study
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) From Initiation of Sutent Therapy, PFS was defined as the time from initiation of Sutent (sunitinib malate) to first documentation of tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Time to treatment failure was used as a surrogate for PFS as PFS could not be determined due to retrospective nature of this study., From initiation of treatment up to 72 months
Objective Response Rate - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response From Initiation of Sutent Therapy, Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per clinical and radiological documentation in clinical notes. CR was defined as complete resolution of all visible disease, whereas PR was defined as partial reduction in size of visible disease., From initiation of treatment up to 72 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was the duration from diagnosis of disease to death. Overall survival was compared for those who had received best supportive care to those who received Sutent as first-line therapy., From diagnosis until death (up to 72 months)|Time to Treatment Failure From Initiation of Sutent Therapy, Time to treatment failure was defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of Progressive Disease (PD), symptomatic deterioration, death due to any cause, or discontinuation of treatment due to AE, refusal or other reason. PD was defined as an increase in visible disease., From initiation of treatment up to 72 months|Correlation of Dosage and Number of Participants With CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), SD (Stable Disease) and PD (Progressive Disease) From Initiation of Sutent Therapy, Number of participants with CR, PR, SD and PD responses assessed as per clinical and radiological documentation in clinical notes for different Sutent doses were reported. CR was defined as complete resolution of all visible disease, PR was defined as partial reduction in size of visible disease, SD was defined as no change in size of visible disease, and PD was defined as an increase in visible disease. Here "other" refers to Sutent 12.5 mg., From initiation of treatment up to 72 months|Correlation of Duration and Number of Participants With CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), SD (Stable Disease) and PD (Progressive Disease) From Initiation of Sutent Therapy, Number of participants with CR, PR, SD and PD responses assessed as per clinical and radiological documentation in clinical notes for different durations of treatment with Sutent were reported. CR was defined as complete resolution of all visible disease, PR was defined as partial reduction in size of visible disease, SD was defined as no change in size of visible disease, and PD was defined as an increase in visible disease., From initiation of treatment up to 72 months
A single cohort of 200 patients who are diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma prior to 1st Jan 2012, and are seen by the medical oncologist at the centers involved with BIOGRID and its affiliated registries. Patients will be identified from the first date of their consultation with the medical oncologist and captured in the electronic database.
