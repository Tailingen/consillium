A Phase 1 Study of BPI-28592 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-labe Phase I study of BPI-28592 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors
Metastasis, Neoplasm
DRUG: BPI-28592
Characterize the safety and tolerability of BPI-28592 in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies, Number of subjects with treatment related adverse events, about 20 months|determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and preliminarily to develop a suitable dosing regimen, Number of subjects with dose limiting toxicity, about 20 months
Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BPI-28592, Blood plasma concentration, about 20 months|To determine overall response rate (ORR),calculated as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) to BPI-28592, Evaluate clinical activity/efficacy of BPI-28592, about 20 months|To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in subjects with CR or PR as best response, Evaluate clinical activity/efficacy of BPI-28592, about 20 months|to evaluate the disease control rate (DCR), Evaluate clinical activity/efficacy of BPI-28592, about 20 months|To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) following initiation of BPI-28592, Evaluate clinical activity/efficacy of BPI-28592, about 20 months|To evaluate overall (OS) following initiation of BPI-28592, Evaluate clinical activity/efficacy of BPI-28592, about 20 months
