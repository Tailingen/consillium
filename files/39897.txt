Mental Training for CFS Following EBV Infection in Adolescents
The general aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored mental training program in adolescents developing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) after an acute Epstein Barr-virus (EBV) infection. Endpoints include physical activity (primary endpoint), symptoms (fatigue, pain, insomnia), cognitive function (executive functions) and markers of disease mechanisms (autonomic, endocrine, and immune responses).

EBV-infection is a well-known trigger of CFS. A closely related research project (Chronic fatigue following acute Epstein-Barr virus infection in Adolescents; ClinicalTrials ID:NCT02335437) is a combined prospective and cross-sectional study of 200 adolescents suffering from acute EBV infection. The primary aim of that study is to identify factors that predispose to CFS 6 months after the acute infection. Thus, that project will provide a sample of thoroughly characterized CFS patients, all having the same precipitation factor (EBV-infection).

The present project is an intervention trial in the subgroup of patients that actually did develop CFS 6 months after the acute EBV infection. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either a mental training program (10 sessions) combining elements from cognitive behavioral therapy and music therapy, or routine follow-up from the general practitioner. By its nature, treatment group allocation cannot be blinded; however, both patients and therapists will be blinded for end-point evaluation. An extensive investigational program will be carried out at three time points: Prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 1 year after the intervention. The program includes: Clinical examination; Pain threshold assessment; Cardiovascular assessment; Cognitive assessment; Sampling of biological material (blood and urine); Questionnaire; Brain fMRI; Qualitative interview; Monitoring of physical activity (accelerometer)
