Nashville Early Diagnosis Lung Cancer Project
This screening study will address the lack of molecular strategies for the early detection of lung cancer and integrate those with epidemiological and imaging strategies.

The hypothesis is that the repeated measure of biomarkers of risk obtained from the molecular analysis of biological specimens including those from bronchoscopy (bronchial brushings and biopsies) may contribute to the refinement of high-risk populations and allow an earlier clinical diagnosis.

The goal of the investigators study is to provide screening for lung cancer in a high-risk population. In this prospective cohort it will be tested whether repeated measure of biomarkers of risk allows early detection of lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Sputum sample|PROCEDURE: Pulmonary function tests|RADIATION: Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest|OTHER: Buccal epithelium collection|PROCEDURE: Nasal brushings|PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopy|PROCEDURE: Bronchoalveolar lavage|PROCEDURE: Blood sample collection|PROCEDURE: Urine sample|PROCEDURE: Questionnaire-data collection
To compare candidate biomarkers over time among participants who did and did not develop lung cancer, Blood, sputum, urine, nasal washings, buccal epithelium, endobronchial tissue, and bronchioalveolar washings are examined for biomarkers present in patients who develop lung cancer compared with those patients who do not develop lung cancer. Baseline and yearly screening results will be compared in the two groups., at baseline and yearly to year 5
To identify and validate new biomarkers that are associated with lung cancer risk factors and premalignant lesions., Blood, sputum, urine, nasal washings, buccal epithelium, endobronchial tissue, and bronchioalveolar washings are examined for presently unknown biomarkers that occur in patients with lung cancer and in patients who do not have lung cancer but who may be at further increased risk of lung cancer., at baseline and yearly to year 5|To assess changes in prevalence and grade of pre-invasive lesions in this cohort., Endobronchial tissue will be examined under a microscope for presence of changes in the cells that are abnormal but which are not invasive cancer., baseline, at years 2 and 5 (abnormal tissue will re-examined every 6 months)|To describe patients eligible for future chemoprevention clinical trials., Inclusion criteria for those patients who, based on their biomarker profile, are at increased risk of invasive lung cancer and who may benefit from clinical trials that will study chemoprevention strategies for lung cancer., at year 5
It is proposed to test the hypotheses in a screening study of high risk individuals (characterized by an established prediction rule). The expected prevalence of lung cancer in this high risk group is estimated to be 2% per year. All individuals benefit from clinic visit, low-dose Chest CT, spirometry and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at baseline, Chest CT, follow-up doctor visit, and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at least at year 2 and 5.
