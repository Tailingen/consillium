Oral Supplementation of Glutamine on Gastric Cancer Patients After Gastrectomy
Glutamine has the potentials of immunomodulation and adjustment of protein metabolism. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of glutamine on sarcopenia in gastric adenocarcinoma patients undergoing gastrectomy. The secondary endpoints, including the physical activity, weight loss, and nutritional profiles, will be evaluated among these patients.

This will be a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. At least 80 evaluable patients who are scheduled for gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma cancer will be randomly assigned to the control or treatment group. Each group will have at least 40 patients. The CT scan will be evaluated before surgery and on postoperative day (POD) 90. Moreover, the patient will wear the smart watch to record daily walking steps. Laboratory data will be check before gastrectomy and on POD 90.
