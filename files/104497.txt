Cancer-Associated Muscle Atrophy and Weakness: An Investigation of Etiology
This study is designed to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to muscle wasting and metabolic abnormalities in skeletal muscle of cancer patients.
Metastatic Cancer|Cachexia; Cancer
Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, Muscle oxidative capacity will be measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Approximately within a month of recruitment|Skeletal muscle protein synthesis, Muscle protein synthesis will be measured in the postabsorptive state from the rate of incorporation of isotopically labeled amino acids given intravenously., Approximately within a month of recruitment
