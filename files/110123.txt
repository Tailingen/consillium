A Single Arm Study of Brain Metastasis in Patients With HER2-positive Breast Cancer
The aim of this study was to evaluate the progression time and efficacy of brain tumors in patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer treated with Pyrrolidine and Capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy.
TTP
DRUG: PYRROTINI|RADIATION: Brain radiation therapy
Time of intracranial tumor progression, Objective to evaluate the intracranial tumor progression time of piratinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy for HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Progression-free survival, Objective to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of pirotinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Objective remission rate, objective response rate (ORR) of pirotinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of treatment effect, Duration of treatment effect (DCR) of pirotinib and capecitabine It refers to the time between the first assessment of CR or PR and the first assessment of PD (Progressive Disease) or death from any causecombined with brain radiotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis., throughout studythrough study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease control rate, Objective to evaluate the disease control rate of pirotinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis, throughout studythrough study completion, an average of 1 year|Clinical Benefit Rate, Objective to evaluate the clinical benefit rate of pirotinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis, throughout studythrough study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall survival, Objective to evaluate the overall survival of piratinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with brain metastasis, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Graded healing assessment, Objective to evaluate the effect of pyrrolotinib and capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer with brain metastasisï¼ŒThe score of graded healing assessment was 0-4. The higher the score, the better the result, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Brain metastases are very common in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The vast majority of patients with metastatic brain tumors are in advanced stages of the disease. If not treated in time, the natural course of the disease is extremely short. At present, the main treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer is radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs. On the basis of previous clinical studies, the aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of combined brachytherapy with Pyrrotidine and Capecitabine in patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer, in order to provide a new, safer and more effective treatment for patients with brain metastases from breast cancer.
