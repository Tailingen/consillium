Real Time Molecular Characterization of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
The trial will enroll 194 previously untreated DLBCL patients over 20 months, with the objective to send to the local investigator an extensive molecular tumor characterization by D38 in at least 80% of enrolled patients.

The feasibility and efficiency will be demonstrated by deploying and operating a nation-wide network of dedicated multidisciplinary platforms.
