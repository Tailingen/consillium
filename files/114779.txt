Clinical Study of CAIX-targeted CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is an experimental study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR T cells targeting CAIX in the treatment of advanced renal cancer.
Immunotherapy
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T cell immunotherapy
Safety evaluation:Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the incidence and severity of possible adverse events within one month after targeted CAIX CAR-T infusion, including cytokine release syndrome and on-target toxicity., First 1 month after CAR-T cells infusion|Effectiveness evaluation, In order to observe the efficacy of CAR-T cells after infusion, total remission rate (ORR), complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), disease stability (SD) or progression (PD) will be used for evaluation., 3 months after CAR-T cells infusion
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months after CAR-T cells infusion|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) time, 24 months after CAR-T cells infusion
We designed a clinical study and divided the trial into two phases.

Phase 1 (climbing test) : 12 patients were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=3). 12 patients were treated with cyclophosphamide at the dose of 60mg/kg/d 8-7 days before CAR-T cell infusion, and fludalabine at the dose of 25mg/m\^2/d 6-2 days before CAR-T cell infusion. 5 mg anti-human CAIX monoclonal antibody (G250) was injected into the hepatic artery of each patient by an interventional catheter on the day before CAR-T cells infusion. On Day 0, CAR T cells were injected into patients in group 1, 2, 3 or 4 at the dose of 1x10\^7/ person, 1\*10\^8/ person, 1\*10\^9/ person or 1\*10\^10/ person, respectively. The infusion time is about 15-30min. On day 0-14, IL-2 (75000IU/kg) was injected subcutaneously once a day. From day 15-28, IL-2 (75000IU/kg) was subcutaneously injected into the patients three times a week. The purpose of this study is to assess subjects' MTD (maximum tolerated dose) against CAR T cells.

Phase 2: After determining the appropriate therapeutic dose for patients with renal cell carcinoma, 8 patients received the same pre-treatment of chemotherapy and G250 antibody. Then, the appropriate therapeutic dose of CAR T cells according to the results of phase 1 was infused on Day 0. On day 0-14,IL-2 (75000IU/kg) was given subcutaneously once a day. On day 15-28, IL-2 (75000IU/kg) was given subcutaneously three times a week.

Peripheral blood was collected every 4 weeks to evaluate proliferation and survival of CAR-T cells. After 6 months of close follow-up, subjects will undergo a medical history evaluation, physical examination, and blood tests quarterly for 2 years. After this assessment, subjects will be enrolled in an annual telephone follow-up and questionnaire study for up to five years to evaluate treatment for long-term health problems, such as recurrence of malignant tumors.
