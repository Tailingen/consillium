Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Real-Life Database
Establish the largest possible real-life cohort collecting long-term follow-up of a maximum number of CML patients in order to carry out observational studies: epidemiological, identification of subgroups according to their response to treatment, evaluation of new molecules in real life, therapeutic discontinuations, impact of the evolution of recommendations, etc.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)

Observational study collecting real-life clinico-biological data from patients with CML. Data are collected prospectively and retrospectively, from diagnosis and throughout the long-term follow-up of CML (follow up continues after treatment stopped).
