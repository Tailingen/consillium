Development of an Artificial Intelligence Model for the Identification and Prevention of Smoking-related Diseases.
The study is an interventional pilot study. The study is designed to be monocentric and it presents additional procedues.
Lung Cancer Screening Program|Artificial Intelligence (AI)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Computed tomography (CT) scan low dose|PROCEDURE: Blood sampling|PROCEDURE: Tissue sampling (lung)|OTHER: Spirometry|OTHER: Questionnaires|OTHER: Smoking cessation program|OTHER: Carbon monoxide measurment|OTHER: Cardiovascular primary prevention
Creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm, To train and validate a reliable and unbiased Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that detects the presence of nodules and differentiates between malignant or benign tumor types.

AUC (Area Under the Curve) values, expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD), comparing the ability in detecting the presence of nodules and differentiating the malignancy or benignity of a radiologist versus an AI algorithm, both trained on the same patient group., from enrollment to 48 months
Multimodal program, Develop a multimodal program to enhance the prevention and the early detection of multiple smoking-related diseases Presence and absence of lung nodules \> 4 mm with computed tomography (CT) scan, from enrollment to 48 months
Interventional pilot study, single-center with additional procedures, such as completion of EORTC-QLQ-LC29, EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaires, motivational test, Fagestrom test, anamnestic questionnaire, spirometry, measurement of carbon monoxide, Low-dose spiral computed tomography without contrast medium, peripheral venous blood sampling for a volume of 20 ml.

The study has the main objective of traininig and validate a reliable and unbiased Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that detects the presence of nodules and differentiates between malignant or benign tumor types.

The study considers patients with suspected diagnosis or with a dignosis of lung cancer, smokers and former smokers over 50 years of age at high risk of lung cancer and subjects enrolled in previous screening cohorts at this Institute.
