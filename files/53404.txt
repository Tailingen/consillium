Toripalimab Combine With Rituximab for Treatment of Relapsed Refractory CD20 Positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Exploring the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab with Rituximab for treatment of relapsed refractory CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma|Rituximab|Toripalimab
DRUG: Toripalimab combine with Rituximab
Objective Response Rate(ORR), From the beginning of treatment, adopt Lugano 2014 evaluation standard, imaging examinations are performed every 2 cycles to assess changes in disease until progression or death, up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival(PFS), From the date into this study to disease progression or death, up to 24 months
To assessment of the safety events, Number of subjects experiencing different-grade toxicity, up to 24 months|Assessment of the correlation between tumor cell PD-L1 expression intensity and efficacy, Subjects will be according to the Lugano 2014 criteria assessed with computed tomograph(CT) at screening,after completion of treantment therapy and during the post-treatment follow-up period.Baseline biopsies for immunologic analyses will be obtained from patients. Secondary histologic outcome include percent PD-L1 positive tumor cells by immunohistochemistry., up to 24 months
Analysis of the correlation between the ammount of T cells and NK cells around tumor cells, Baseline and post-treatment biopsies for immunologic analyses will be obtained from patients.Histologic outcomes include percent and density PD-L1 positive tumor cells, percent and density CD56 postive NK cells, percent and density CD3 positive T cells by immunohistochemistry., up to 24 months|Change in immune microenviroment at the time of initial diagnosis and relapse, Immune mincroenviroment to be assessed by analyzing changes in the immune infiltrate in biopsy specimens obtained at initial diagnosis and relapse. Histologic outcome include percent and density PD-L1 positive tumor cells and CD3,CD4,CD8,CD56,CD58,PD-1,Î²2-MG,CIITA,HLA-DR/DP/DQ positive cells., up to 24 months
Toripalimab is a recombinant, humanized programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and prevents binding of PD-1 with programmed death ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2). Rituximab is an antibody to CD20 molecules. One of the mechanisms of killing tumor cells is through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). These two drugs may have a synergistic effect on anti-tumor. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Toripalimab with Rituximab is effective and safe for treatment of relapsed refractory CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is an exploratory small sample, phase II, single-center clinical trial, which is going to enroll 20 participants.
