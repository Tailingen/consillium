Prospective Randomized Study of Accelerated Radiation Therapy (PRART)
Patients with Stage 0 ductal carcinoma in situ (Tis (DCIS), Stage T1-T2, lymph node negative(N0) breast cancers will be randomized to receive whole breast radiotherapy with a concomitant boost to the tumor bed over 15 fractions (Arm 1, standard) versus 10 fractions (Arm 2, experimental).
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation therapy - 3 weeks|RADIATION: Radiation therapy - 2 weeks
Proportions of patients with adverse cosmetic outcomes, rate of grade 3 or higher changes in breast cosmesis on the 10 fraction arm compared to the rate on the 15 fraction arm will be measured., up to 2 years
Number of participants who demonstrate local control at 5 year follow up, assess and compare local control at 5 years between the two arms., 5 years
