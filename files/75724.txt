A Study to Learn About Dacomitnib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Which Has Spread to the Brain.
The purpose of this study is to learn about dacomitinib for the possible treatment of lung cancer which has spread to other parts of the body.

This study is seeking participants who:

* have lung cancer that has reached at least the brain.
* have a type of gene called epidermoid growth factor receptor. A gene is a part of your DNA that has instructions for making things your body needs to work.
* have not received any treatment before.

All participants in this study will receive dacomitnib 1 time a day. Dacomitinib is a tablet that is taken by mouth at home. They can continue to take dacomitnib until their cancer is no longer responding. The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicine. This will help to see if the study medicine is safe and effective.
