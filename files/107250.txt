ADOPT-PRESTAGE: Study Evaluating the Impact of the Program PRESTAGE
As the proportion of oral anticancer treatments is continuously increasing, adherence appears as a major issue for patients' outcomes. Poor adherence affects particularly geriatric patients due among others to polypharmacy or cognitive impairment. Thus, the need for educational programs in this population has been regularly emphasized.

PRESTAGE educational program was built after an external and internal analysis of educational needs in elderly patients treated with oral cancer treatments. It implicates a multidisciplinary educational team (nurses, physicians, pharmacists, psychologists, physiologists, social workers...). Six educational workshops were designed with the following endpoints: disease and treatment understanding, treatment management, nutrition and psychological as well as physical well being.

ADOPT-PRESTAGE is a clinical, prospective, interventional, open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of PRESTAGE program. It is, to the investigators' knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the acceptability and impact (adherence, clinical benefit) of an educational program in an elderly cancer population. The primary endpoint of this trial will be to evaluate adherence using an indirect objective adherence measure: the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Secondary endpoints include quality of life and evaluation of changes in patients' behaviors.
