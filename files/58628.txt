Propranolol Hydrochloride in Combination With Sintilimab and Platinum-based Chemotherapy for Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a prospective single-center Phase I clinical study in patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1 driver oncogene negative, and advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety preliminarily in a small-size of propranolol hydrochloride in combination with sintilimab and platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line therapy. Propranolol hydrochloride is a beta- adrenergic blocking agent which is associated with augment of immune cell responses. Propranolol hydrochloride may improve the responses of immune checkpoint inhibitors in treating patients with advanced NSCLC.
