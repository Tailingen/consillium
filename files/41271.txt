Monocyte Antigen Carrier Cells for Newly Diagnosed GBM
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-201-GBM (pp65CMV antigen monocytes) that will be administered to patients newly diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called glioblastoma (GBM) that has an unmethylated MGMT (O\[6\]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) (MGMT) gene promoter.
Glioblastoma|Glioma, Malignant
BIOLOGICAL: MT-201-GBM monocyte vaccine
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MT-201-GBM, Dose for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate of 0.25., 1 month after first infusion|pp65 T-cell Immune Response After 2 Weeks Post Infusion Three Compared to Baseline, Mean (or median) change from baseline within each dose level for IFN gamma, granzyme-B, and fluorospot, 2 weeks after third infusion
Percentage of patients with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during DLT observation period within each dose level, To assess safety and tolerability of MT-201-GMB, the percentage of patients with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the DLT observation period within each dose level will be estimated., 1 month after first infusion|Median Overall Survival (OS), Survival from start of MT-201-GBM, 2 years|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to first recurrence after start of MT-201-GBM, 2 years|pp65 T-cell Immune Response After Each Infusion Compared to Baseline, Mean (or median) change from baseline to peak levels within each dose level for IFN gamma and ELISpot, 2 weeks after third infusion
The investigational vaccine (MT-201-GBM) in this study is made from a type of immune cell called monocytes, which have been engineered to express a cytomegalovirus (CMV) protein.

The monocyte vaccines are made from the patient's own cells, which are collected through a procedure called leukapheresis. During leukapheresis, the patient's blood is collected into a machine that removes white blood cells and then returns the remainder of the blood back to the individual. The leukapheresis procedure is not typically associated with any discomfort or pain. The white blood cells collected from leukapheresis are used to generate the patient's monocyte vaccine. After leukapheresis, patients receive standard radiation therapy combined with temozolomide for about 6 weeks, followed by one cycle of temozolomide for 21 days. About 2 days later, patients will receive the first monocyte vaccine, followed by 2 more monocyte vaccines every 4 weeks.
