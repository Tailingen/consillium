Preoperative S-1/OHP With Radiation Therapy for Low-lying Rectal Carcinoma in Neo-adjuvant Setting
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of S-1 and oxaliplatin combined with radiation by Phase I/II study.

The purpose of this study is as follows,

* In phase I, to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
* In phase II, to evaluate the antitumor effect (pCR rate) and the safety .
Rectal Carcinoma
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|RADIATION: Radiation
Phase I: Determine the Recommended dose (RD), Based on the incidence of dose-limited toxicities(DLT), the RD is determined from 4 test levels, 10 weeks|Phase II: pathological complete response rate, Pathological complete response(pCR) rate is calculated by numbers of pCR cases (grade 3) devided the number of subjected cases., 12-16 week
R0 resection rate, 12-16 weeks|down staging rate, 12-16 weeks|local reccurence rate, 3 years|desease free survuval, 3 years|safety, 16-20 weeks
