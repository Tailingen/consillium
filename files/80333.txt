Body Mass Index (BMI), Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was defined as the body mass (kg) divided by the square of the body height (m)., Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.
Numeric rating scale (NRS), NRS refers to the number 0-10 to indicate the degree of pain, 0 is painless and 10 is the most painful., Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.|Hemoglobin, Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.|Albumin, Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.|Quality of life score, Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.|Dizziness, Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.|Nausea/vomiting, Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.|Somnolence, Participants will be followed for the duration of radiotherapy, an expected average of 7 weeks.
The present study is a prospective, randomizing, case-controlled, multi-center clinical trial. 174 firstly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who need radical radiation therapy will be randomly divided into either early intervention or common intervention group. oxycodone control release tablets will be used to control the pain caused by radiation oral mucositis when the pain level is mild or moderate, respectively. The primary outcome measurement is nutrition status. Quality of life (QOL), the clinical outcomes, and the adverse effects are also to be observed.
