AGEN1423 and Botensilimab w/ or w/o Chemo in PDAC
The goal of this research study is to asses the safety and efficacy of the combination of AGEN1423 and Botensilimab with or without chemotherapies, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, for the treatment of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) which has progressed after at least one previous line of cancer therapy.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* AGEN1423
* Botensilimab

Participants will receive study treatment for about 2 years and will be followed for 1 year after.
Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: AGEN1423|DRUG: Botensilimab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate, The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECISTv1.1 criteria, using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set, Every 8 weeks until EOT, for up to 2 years.
Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate (DCR) defined as the sum of stable disease, partial and complete responses according to RECISTv1.1 criteria., Every 8 weeks from first day of treatment until EOT for both cohorts up to 2 years.|Median Duration of Overall Response (DOR), Duration of Overall Response (DOR), estimated using the Kaplan Meier method, is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) per RECISTv1.1, until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Patients without progressive disease are censored at the date of last disease assessment., Up to approximately 2 years|Median Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from study entry to death or censored at date last known alive., Up to 2 Years|Median Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration between randomization and documented disease progression (PD) or death, or is censored at time of last dsease assessment., Every 8 weeks from first day of treatment until EOT for both cohorts up to 4 Years|Grade 3-5 Treatment-related Toxicity Rate, All grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on CTCAEv5 that are not resolved in accordance with treatment guidelines were counted. Rate is the proportion of treated participants experiencing at least one of these adverse events as defined during the time of observation., For Cohort 1 AE evaluated on Cycle 1 days 1 and 8, and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle (each cycle is 14 days). For Cohort 2 AE evaluated on Cycle 1 days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle (each cycle is 28 days).
The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

* Participants will receive study treatment for about 2 years and will be followed for 1 year. If the combination is considered to be safe and tolerable, and objective response is achieved in at least 2 patients, the study will proceed to Cohort 2.
* This research study involves immunotherapy. The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:
* AGEN1423
* Botensilimab

It is expected that about 24 people will take part in this part of this research

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AGEN1423 as a treatment for any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Botensilimab as a treatment for any disease.
