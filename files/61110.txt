PRORADIUM: Prospective Multi-centre Study of Prognostic Factors in mCRPC Patients Treated With Radium-223.
PRORADIUM is a prospective multicentre observational study in metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), designed to explore prognostic biomarkers in patients undergoing treatment with radium-223.
Advanced Prostate Cancer|Castration Resistant|Radium 223
DRUG: Radium 223 55mBq/Kg every 4 weeks intravenously
To validate the prognostic value for overall survival of serum bone metabolism markers descibed by Primo N Lara et al (JNCI 2014) in mCRPC patients treated with Radium-223, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
To analyze the prognostic value for biochemical and/or radiological progression-free survival of serum bone metabolism markers described by Primo N Lara et al in mCRPC patients treated with Radium-223, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To assess the prognostic value of alkaline phosphatase before- and after 3 cycles of treatment in these patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To analyze the prognostic value of "Bone Scan Index" in mCRPC patients treated with Radium-223, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To assess the prognostic value for overall survival of androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (AR-V7) and/or AR amplification in mCRPC patients treated with Radium-223, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To validate the prognostic value of the gene-expression signature from peripheral blood described by Olmos et al (Lancet Oncol 2012) on overall survival of mCRPC patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To correlate the presence of somatic and/or germinal mutations with the outcomes of these patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|Exploratory aims include: Validate the prognostic value of classical nomograms designed to assess the outcomes of mCRPC patients and analyze the prognostic value of the gene-expression signature described by Olmos et al on progression-free survival., Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
This study is a prospective biomarker study of patients with mCRPC undergoing treatment with radium-223 as standard of care treatment. The participants will undergo serial pre- and post-therapy blood collection for biomarker analysis as part of the primary objective of the study.
