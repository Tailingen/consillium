PVE/PVL Combined With DEB-TACE in the Treatment of Patients With Large and Unresectable Liver Cancer
This is a multicenter, randomized, positive parallel controlled clinical study to evaluate the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of PVL/PVE combined with DEB-TACE in the treatment of unresectable patients with large or large tumors in the right lobe of the liver.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: DEB-TACE|PROCEDURE: PVL/PVE+DEB-TACE
the rate of tumor resection after treatment, Until one month after the last treatment.|FLR, the ratio of FLR proliferation after treatment, Until one month after the last treatment.
Overall survival (OS), The overall survival time refers to the time from the first interventional therapy to the patient's death or the last follow-up, whichever appears early., After operation, up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Disease progression-free survival time refers to the imaging evaluation of the patient after the first interventional therapy, the tumor does not continue to grow, new, distant metastasis; there is no increase in alpha-fetoprotein, 1, 3 year
Most guidelines recommend transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as the standard of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma（HCC）which is limited to the right half of the liver, single large or multiple, with / without tumor thrombus of the right branch of the portal vein.While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of TACE for patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma. Portal vein embolization(PVE)/portal vein ligation(PVL) is the main means to increase the future liver remnant (FLR), which can reduce the complications after hepatectomy. TACE on the basis of PVE/PVL can not only increase FLR, but also can effectively control the progression of tumor by sequential TACE. This study intends to conduct a multicenter, randomized, positive parallel-controlled clinical study to objectively and scientifically evaluate the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of ligation of the right portal vein combined with Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization(DEB-TACE) technique in the treatment of patients with large or large tumors of the right lobe who cannot be resected in I-stage.
