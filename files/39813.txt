The Use of Metformin in Early Breast Cancer Patients Pre-Surgery
The study will test metformin in patients with early breast cancer. Blood and tissue will be collected before and after the use of metformin.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Metformin Pre-Surgery
To determine the in situ effects of metformin in women with operable stage I or II breast cancer, To determine the in situ effects of metformin on

* proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (TUNEL), fosforilate AKT
* CD1a CD83, CD68, F40/80, arginase iNOS and T cells -CD4(+),CD45RA(+), CD 45RO, CD4, CD8 and FOXP3(+)., 60 days after the surgery
To analyse gastrointestinal toxicity, * To analyse gastrointestinal toxicity grade (examples: nausea, stomach pain, vomiting)
* Number of Participants with Adverse Events, One week , 2 weeks and 20 days after Metformim beginning|To analyse the blood tests one day before the biopsy and one day before the surgery, -To collect and analyze pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood specimens for serum glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and insulin levels, as well as circulating IGF-1 and estradiol, 5 days after blood collection
Patients will take metformin twice a day for 3 weeks before surgery. The hypothesis is that metformin will reduce cell proliferation rates (Ki67) and increase apoptoses (TUNEL)in tumor tissue.

The study will collect and analyze pre- and post-treatment blood specimens for:

* Serum glucose
* Insulin levels
* Estradiol
* HOMA test
* Glycosylated haemoglobin
