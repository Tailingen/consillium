Perception of the Doctor/Patient Relationship, Disease and Treatment Among Physicians and Their Patients Treated With Systemic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma "PERCEPTION1"
atients with cancer face difficult choices that require balancing competing priorities such as survival, functional capacity and symptom relief. Most patients with advanced cancer (\>80%) expect their sensitive discussions with physicians about prognosis and treatment choices, in order to be involved in the decision making process. Nevertheless, this kind of discussion is frequently lacking. Consequently, patients often have a biased view of their own prognosis such as an underestimation of disease severity, or unrealistic expectations for cure.

Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be treated with systemic therapies which may prolong survival, but are not curative. Patients with advanced HCC often report expectations for survival and treatment-related side-effects that differ from their treating physician. Accordingly, communication on prognostic and treatment choices is essential to obtain an accurate understanding of the disease that allows patients to make informed decisions. To the best of our knowledge, a thorough evaluation of the physician-patient communication quality has never been performed in advanced HCC patients.

The aim of our study, is to assess the perception of the expected prognosis, the treatment side-effects; by the patient and by his investigator during the first consultation before the initiation
