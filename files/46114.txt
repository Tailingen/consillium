A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Lenalidomide as Maintenance Therapy After Completion of First-line Combination Chemotherapy in Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).
A study to evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide as maintenance therapy after completion of first-line combination chemotherapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who are not candidates for transplantation and have achieved partial response (PR) or complete response (CR).

This study was prematurely terminated by the sponsor in light of new unpublished data that rendered the current design of the study no longer clinically relevant. A study design with the control arm of no active treatment was no longer appropriate. The termination of the trial was not based on any safety concerns in the study.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|OTHER: Placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Progression, as defined by the 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), is any new lesion or increase by 50% of previously involved sites from nadir.

Study terminated prematurely. Analysis not conducted., up to 7 years
Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.

Study terminated prematurely. Analysis not conducted., up to 7 years|Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the treatment period plus 30 days. A participant with multiple occurrences of an adverse event within a category is counted only once in that category. Adverse events were evaluated by the investigator.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs (NCI CTC) was used to grade AE severity. Severity grade 3= severe and undesirable AE. Severity grade 4= life-threatening or disabling AE., up to 9 months|Time to Progression, Time to progression was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of documented disease progression.

Study terminated prematurely. Analysis not conducted., up to 7 years|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure was defined as the time from randomization until the date at which a participant was removed from treatment due to progression, toxicity, refusal or death or received another Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) therapy, whichever occurs first., up to 2 years|Participants With a Tumor Response, Number of participants with a measurable tumor at time of randomization who achieve a response. Complete response (CR) is defined as the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and the disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. Partial response (PR) is defined as the regression of measurable disease and no appearance of new sites of disease. For full definitions, please refer to the 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007).
