Positron Emission Tomography Using Fluorothymidine F 18 in Finding Recurrent Disease in Patients With Gliomas
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography using fluorothymidine F 18, may be effective in finding recurrent disease in patients with gliomas.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well positron emission tomography using fluorothymidine F 18 works in finding recurrent disease in patients with gliomas.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
OTHER: fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine|PROCEDURE: positron emission tomography
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the safety of fluorothymidine F 18 for visual and dynamic brain tumor images in patients with glial neoplasms.
* Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug.

Secondary

* Compare, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug to fludeoxyglucose F 18 in differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis.
* Determine the optimal time to image post injection of this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized study.

Patients receive fluorothymidine F 18 IV over 1 minute and then undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the brain over 2 hours.

After completion of the PET scan, patients are followed for at least 1 month.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
