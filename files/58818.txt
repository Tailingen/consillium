A Study of QLF3108 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumor
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of QLF3108 and will make a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumor activity of QLF3108 in patients with advanced solid tumor.

The number, rates and severity of participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0, The number, rates and severity of participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0, Approximately 24 month|The number, rates and severity of participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0, The number, rates and severity of participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0, Approximately 24 month|Cmax of QLF3108, Pharmacokinetics of QLF3108 by assessment of maximum plasma QLF3108 concentration., Approximately 24 month|Tmax of QLF3108, Pharmacokinetics of QLF3108 by assessment of time to Cmax, Approximately 24 month|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of QLF3108, Pharmacokinetics of QLF3108 by assessment of area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero to infinity, Approximately 24 month|Tl/2 of QLF3108, Pharmacokinetics of QLF3108 by assessment of the terminal half-life, Approximately 24 month|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from baseline to first observed disease progression or death from any cause, Approximately 24 months|Overall survival time (OS), Overall survival (OS) is the time between the subject's first infusion QLF3108 injection and death from any cause., Approximately 24 months
This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and Pharmacokinetics (PK) expansion study of QLF3108 in subjects with advanced solid tumor, to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of QLF3108. The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability, assess pharmacokinetics parameters and immunogenicity, and assess the anti-tumor activity of QLF3108 in subjects with advanced solid tumor.
