SPECTAlung: Screening Patients With Thoracic Tumors for Efficient Clinical Trial Access
SPECTAlung is a program aiming at screening patients with thoracic tumors to identify the molecular characteristics of their disease. The thoracic tumors include lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, thymoma or thymic carcinoma at any stage. Once the molecular characteristics are identified, there might be the possibility to offer these patients access to targeted clinical trials.
Any Stage of Lung Cancer (Any Histotype)|Any Stage of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma|Any Stage of Any Thymic Malignancy
GENETIC: Tumour markers testing
