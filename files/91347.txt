This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, single arm phase II study in mCRPC participants aims to better characterize the safety and tolerability of AAA617 in participants with moderate and severe renal impairment compared with normal renal function. Since both severe and moderate renal impairment have very low incidence within mCRPC participant population compared to participants with normal renal function, the enrollment will occur in parallel for the 3 cohorts; participants will be stratified in one of the three cohorts (A:normal, B: moderate or C: severe) based on their eGFR at screening.

All participants will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at screening to confirm PSMA positivity.

Participants will receive a dose of 7.4 GBq (±10%) of AAA617 once every 6 weeks for a planned 6 cycles for cohorts A and B and for 3 cycles (and 3 additional cycles) for cohort C.

After treatment period, participants will be asked to join a long term follow up (LTFU) study to monitor their safety up to 10 years after the 1st dose of AAA617. In case of the LTFU study is not available at the time of end of treatment period (safety follow-up visit), participants will continue in Long Term Follow-up period in this study for up to one year until they can roll over into the separate LTFU study.

The primary outcome will be to determine the effect of radiation absorption in kidney and other organs at risk as well as the concentration in blood and radioactivity in urine in PSMA- positive mCRPC participants with moderate and severe renal impairment. In addition, the study will assess the relationship between drug concentrations and QTcF.

20 participants with 6 countries are expected to be included with at least 6 evaluable participantts per cohort.
