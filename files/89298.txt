Endostatin in Combination With Oxaliplatin and Radiotherapy in Esophageal Cancer Patients.
Endostatin inhibits the pro-angiogenic action of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in esophageal cancer.This study aims at assessing the efficacy and safety of endostatin combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with Oxaliplatin in esophageal cancer patients.
