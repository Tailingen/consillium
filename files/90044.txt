Safety and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Study of INNO-206 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1b open-label study evaluating the preliminary safety and maximum tolerated dose of a new formulation of INNO-206 administered at doses of 230 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2 and 450 mg/m2 (165, 260, 325 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalents, respectively) through intravenous infusion on Day 1 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles.
Malignant Solid Tumour
DRUG: INNO-206
Safety, Safety will be based on adverse events, tolerability, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG results, laboratory test results. MTD: If 2 of 5 subjects an any dose level experiences a grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, or a platelet count \<25,000/uL or a neutrophil count \<500/uL lasting \>7 days and/or associated with fever \>38.5C, 3 more subjects will be entered at that dose level. If 2 of 3 of the additional subjects experience any of the above adverse events, the dose level immediately below will be identified as the MTD., Up to 6 cycles (every 21 days)
Objective response rate, To evaluate the objective response reate (OR; RECIST 1.1 criteria). Changes in tumor measurements from baseline values that are confirmed by repeat assessments will be assigned a status of CR or PR. OR=CR+PR., Up to 6 cycles (every 21 days)
