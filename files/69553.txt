Efficacy of Rapamycin in the Treatment of Cervico-facial Lymphatic Malformations
To evaluate the efficacy of Rapamycin in extended cervicofacial lymphatic malformations in pediatric patients. Rapamycin is administered oral for a 6 month period.

The success rate is determined by volume reduction superior to 1/5e of the initial volume measured by MRI, impact on QOL and reduction of bleeding in case of mucosal involvement.
