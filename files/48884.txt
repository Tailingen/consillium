Intra-parotid Facial Nerve Tractography
The aim of the study is to evaluate concordance between the facial nerve's path in the parotid evaluated by radiologist in preoperatively and the facial nerve's path in the parotid evaluated by surgeon in peroperatively.
Parotid Tumor
RADIATION: MRI with Facial nerve tractography
Facial nerve's path, Relations between the facial nerve's (the facial nerve's trunk s and the facial nerve's dissections) and the parotid gland will be studied. The nerve will be

* in front of the mass or behind the mass
* below the mass or above the mass
* outside the mass or inside the mass, Day 0
Surgery is the main treatment for parotid tumol, benign or malignant pathologies. The procedure requires a trunk search and a facial nerve dissection along its intraparotid length. This intervention entails a risk of facial paralysis.

MRI tractography is a new imaging technique that can characterize nerve fibers and their path.

The interest would be to allow the surgeon to best prepare the parotidectomy by locating the tumor in relation to the trunk and all the branches of the facial nerve.
