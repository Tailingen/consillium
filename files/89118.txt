Study of TRIFLURIDINE/TIPIRACIL in Previously Treated Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a multi-centre, open-label, single arm phase 2 study to assess the efficacy of TRIFLURIDINE/TIPIRACIL, in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma as measured by median progression-free survival (PFS).

This study will enroll a total of 47 patients over a 12-month period, according to a two stage enrollment design. Nine patients will be enrolled during the first stage and the trial will be terminated if 4 or more out of the 9 have disease progression. If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 47 patients (38 in second stage) will be required.

Patients will be seen prior to enrolment (within 28 days of treatment), every 4 weeks while on treatment, at the end of treatment, and 30 days post-treatment. Patients will remain on long-term follow-up and will be seen every 12 weeks (+/- 14 days) until 1 year post-treatment when they will enter into the survival follow-up period and will be contacted every 12 weeks by phone until progression or toxicity.
Cholangiocarcinoma|Bile Duct Cancer
DRUG: Trifluridine/Tipiracil
Median progression-free survival (PFS), As measured on the basis of RECIST v1.1 criteria, From enrolment until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) up to 1 year
Safety and tolerability of FTD/TPI: CTCAE version 5.0, Assessed by using CTCAE version 5.0 and tolerability, Day 1 of each new treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days), and at the end of treatment visit (up to 1 year after enrolment)|Disease Control Rate (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease) of FTD/TPI, As measured on the basis of RECIST v1.1 criteria, From enrolment until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) up to 1 year|Duration of response of FTD/TPI, As measured on the basis of RECIST v1.1 criteria, From enrolment until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) up to 1 year|Median overall survival of patients with cholangiocarcinoma treated with FTD/TPI., As measured on the basis of RECIST v1.1 criteria, From enrolment until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) up to 1 year|Quality of life: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30, As measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ C30) Functioning, symptoms, and global health status scores will be calculated, graphed, and summarized at baseline and each follow-up visit. General linear mixed model will be conducted to detect significant changing over time for functioning, symptoms and global health status scores. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems, Baseline, and Day 1 of each new treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days), and at the end of treatment visit (up to 1 year after enrolment)
