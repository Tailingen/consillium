ctDNA Dynamic Monitoring and Its Role of Prognosis in Stage I NSCLS by NGS
CtDNA detection is a noninvasive detection method, and the second generation of high-throughput gene sequencing (NGS) is an important means of detecting ctDNA, which can detect trace ctDNA from smaller plasma samples. This project is to study the role of ctDNA dynamic monitoring of stage I NSCLC by NGS technique to verify the prognostic predictive effect of ctDNA .
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I
GENETIC: ctDNA detection
Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival was assessed from surgery to disease recurrence or death as a result of any cause, 2 years after the last patient enrolled
Overall survival, Overall survival was assessed from surgery to death as a result of any cause, 5 years after the last patient enrolled
CtDNA detection as a noninvasive detection method, can truly reflect the real tumor tissue gene mutation map and frequency, is the evaluation of therapeutic effect and the important monitoring indicators of clinical follow-up after treatment. The second generation of high-throughput gene sequencing (NGS) is an important means of detecting ctDNA, which can detect trace ctDNA from smaller plasma samples. The ctDNA dynamic monitoring of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was performed by the second generation gene sequencing (NGS) technique to verify the prognostic predictive effect of ctDNA in stage I NSCLC patients without radiotherapy and targeted therapy.
