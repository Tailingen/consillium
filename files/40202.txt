A Study of Two Associations of Rituximab and Chemotherapy, With a PET-driven Strategy, in Lymphoma
This Phase II study randomized R-ACVBP and R-CHOP as induction treatment in patients from 18 to 59 with DLBCL CD20+ lymphoma and 2 or 3 adverse prognostic factors of the age-adjusted IPI. The consolidation treatment is allocated according to the response to induction treatment assessed by PET after the 2nd and 4th induction cycles.

Complete response rate after 4 inductive cycles with R-ACVBP14 or R-CHOP14, in DLBCL CD 20 (+) patients, presenting with 2 or 3 adverse prognostic factors of the aa-IPI Test a Pet-driven strategy Complete response rate after the 4 inductive cycles, 4 inductive cycles with R-ACVBP14 or R-CHOP14
Response according to PET after 2 cycles, 4 cycles Induction toxicities Response duration Disease-, progression-, event-free and overall survival after autologous transplant Biological factors for prognosis Pharmacokinetic of rituximab, 2 cycles and 4 cycles Induction
1) Induction Arm A: 4 cycles of R-ACVBP, 2 weeks interval. After the 3rd cycle, if PET 2+ (fixing), collection of peripheral blood stem cell progenitors will be organized at the time of hematological recovery under support with G-CSF.

The consolidation treatment will depend on results of PET evaluation after cycle 2 (PET2) and cycle 4 (PET4).

* Consolidation 1A (in case of PET 2- PET 4 -):

  * High-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue; 2 cycles spaced out 14 days.
  * Rituximab-Ifosfamide-Etoposide : 4 cycles spaced out 14 days
  * Cytarabine sub-cutaneous, during 4 days; 2 cycles spaced out 14 days.
* Consolidation 2 A (in case of PET 2+ PET4 -):

  * 2 cycles high-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue
  * High dose with Z- BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous transplant.
* Salvage(in case of PET 4 +):

The patient will be treated with a salvage regimen, after a biopsy of the residual mass whenever possible.

2) Induction arm B: 4 cycles of R-CHOP, 2 weeks interval. After the 3rd cycle, if PET 2+ (fixing), collection of peripheral blood stem cell progenitors will be organized at the time of hematological recovery under support with G-CSF.

The consolidation treatment will depend on results of PET evaluation after cycle 2 (PET2) and cycle 4 (PET4).

* Consolidation 1B(in case of PET 2- PET 4 -):

  4 additional cycles of R-CHOP, 2-weeks interval
* Consolidation 2 B(in case of PET 2+ PET 4 -):

  * 2 cycles high-dose Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue
  * High dose with Z- BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous transplant
* Salvage(in case of PET 4 +):

The patient will be treated with a salvage regimen, after a biopsy of the residual mass whenever possible
