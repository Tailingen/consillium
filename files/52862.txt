Regorafenib Assessment in Refractory Advanced Colorectal Cancer(RegARd-C)
The general objectives are to evaluate activity and the safety of regorafenib in a population of patients bearing advanced, refractory colorectal cancers and to explore the different downstream molecular pathways to identify tumor response and resistance mechanisms.
Advanced Chemorefractory Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: regorafenib
Overall survival (OS), 2 years from first patient in
Occurence of Adverse events, Assessment of safety will follow the WHO guidelines and classified according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 and will be performed every 28 days until 28 days (safety follow up visit) after stopping therapy. Reasons for stopping therapy may include progression of disease or unbearable toxicities, or patient's decision., Every 28 days till 28 days after stopping therapy. An average of 2 months is expected.|Evaluation of tumour response, RECIST 1.1-based radiological assessment (CT or MRI) will be made every 2 cycles, starting at day 28 of the second cycle till demonstration of progressive disease. An average of 2 months is expected., Every 2 months till progression of the disease. An average of 2 months is expected.|Metabolic response assessed by FDG PET, FDGPET will be done twice during the study course : at baseline (at day 0, before treatment begin) and after 2 weeks., 2 FDGPET will be perfomed : at Baseline (day 0) and at D14|Molecular aberrations, Genetic, epigenetic and molecular aberrations will be investigated using gene expression profiling, RNA and exome sequencing, and methylation profiling on the tumor biopsies and repeated blood samples collected during the trial. The relationship between the molecular aberrations,the patient's outcome (PFS, OS) and with metabolic response after treatment with regorafenib will be studied., at day 0 (before treatment begins) and at D14, then repeated every 2 months until progression. An average of 2 months is expected.
The primary objective is to identify in a population of patients bearing advanced, refractory colorectal cancers, those who draw no benefit from treatment with regorafenib. There is no specific hypothesis underlying sample size and the study is therefore to be seen as exploratory.

Secondary objectives:

* To analyze PFS and response rate (RR) in relationship with the same covariates as for OS
* To assess regorafenib efficacy (OS, PFS, RR) and safety profile in this study population.
* To assess the Disease control rate (DCR = Complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\] + stable disease \[SD\])
* To compare the relative benefit (OS, PFS) of regorafenib according to history of treatment with bevacizumab.
