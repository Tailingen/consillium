Pre-Habilitation with Mindfulness and Exercise for Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy (PRIMER Trial)
The PRIMER (Pre-Habilitation With Mindfulness and Exercise for Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy) trial is a pilot designed to estimate the feasibility of integrating a home-based pre-operative exercise and mindfulness program (pre-habilitation program) for patients scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in an attempt to improve both physical and psychological conditioning pre-operatively.
Bladder Cancer|Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer|Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Pre-operative physical exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Pre-operative mindfulness meditation practice
Number of patient-reported days devoted to solitary psychological support, Patient-reported days devoted to self-directed solitary psychological support related to cancer treatment during a 30 day period pre-operatively in the pre-habilitation program group, 30 days|Number of patient-reported days devoted to exercise, Patient-reported minutes per day devoted to high-intensity exercise during a 30 day period pre-operatively in the pre-habilitation program group, 30 days
Post-operative complication rate, Percentage of patients with a Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications at 30-days post-operatively, 30 days post-operatively|Patient-reported health-related quality of life as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire., The EORTC QLQ BLM 30 consists of 30 questions developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. Several single-item symptom measures commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. The questionnaire was designed to be cancer-specific, multidimensional in structure, appropriate for self-administration, and applicable across a range of cultural settings. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score represents higher symptomatology in each respective domain., 4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively|Peak oxygen uptake as measured on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), Maximal oxygen uptake will be measured using a cycle ergometer-based cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)., 4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively|Dispositional mindfulness as assessed by the Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale (MAAS), The Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale (MAAS) is a 15-item scale designed to assess a core characteristic of mindfulness, namely, a receptive state of mind in which attention, informed by a sensitive awareness of what is occurring in the present, simply observes what is taking place. Total scores range from 0 to 6; higher scores indicate higher dispositional mindfulness., 4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively|Perceived stress as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS 10), the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS 10) is a 10-item survey that captures the respondent's stress level in the past month and uses a Likert scale to assess different domains of stress. Individual scores on the PSS 10 can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress., 4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively
