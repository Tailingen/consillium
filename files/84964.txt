FAPi Radioligand OpeN-Label, Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and DosImetry of [Lu-177]-PNT6555; A Dose Escalation Study for TReatment of Patients With Select Solid Tumors (FRONTIER)
This Phase 1 study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of \[Ga-68\]-PNT6555 and \[Lu-177\]-PNT6555 in subjects with select solid tumors that have FAP over-expression, in order to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose.
