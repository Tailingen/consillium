Telotristat With Lutathera in Neuroendocrine Tumors
This trial will test the hypothesis that Telotristat treatment increases the antitumor efficacy of Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate therapy in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Telotristat (Low-Dose)|DRUG: Telotristat (High-Dose)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival at 20 months., 20 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate using RECIST v1.1 at 6 and 12 months after therapy, 6 and 12 months|Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Median progression-free survival., 36 month|Urinary 5-HIAA, Levels of urinary 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) will be measured at baseline and 12 months., Baseline and 12 months|Quality of Life (QLQ-C30), The Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) was developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to assess quality of life in cancer patients.It includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Subjects respond on a four-point scale from "not at all" to "very much" for most items.Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden., 20 month|Quality of Life (QLQ-GI.NET21), The Quality of Life GI Neuroendocrine Tumor survey (QLQ-GINET21) contains a total of 21 items: four single-item assessments relating to muscle and/or bone pain (MBP), body image (BI), information (INF) and sexual functioning (SX), together with 17 items organised into five proposed scales: endocrine symptoms (ED; three items), GI symptoms (GI; five items), treatment-related symptoms (TR; three items), social functioning (SF) and disease-related worries (DRW; three items). The response format of the questionnaire is a four-point Likert scale. Responses are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale using EORTC guidelines, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms., 20 month
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a very heterogeneous group of tumors that develop predominantly in the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems. Clinical detection and diagnosis are more reliable at late stages when metastatic spread has occurred. Patients with advanced disease may suffer from complications of uncontrolled hormone secretion and usually succumb due to tumor progression.

This trial tests the hypothesis that inhibition of serotonin production with Telotristat will lead to cytostatic effects on neuroendocrine tumors and will complement the anti-tumor activity of Lutetium 177 Dotatate. The proposed combination may result in improved treatment efficacy as reflected by improved 20-month progression-free survival (PFS) as compared to historical control.
