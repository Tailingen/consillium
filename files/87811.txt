A Safety Study of SEA-TGT (SGN-TGT) in Advanced Cancer
This trial will look at a drug called SEA-TGT (also known as SGN-TGT) to find out whether it is safe for patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. It will study SEA-TGT to find out what its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It will also study whether SEA-TGT works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas.

The study will have four parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SEA-TGT should be given to patients. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-TGT is and if it works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas. Part C will study how well SEA-TGT with sasanlimab works to treat solid tumors. Part D will study how well SEA-TGT with brentuximab vedotin works to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).
