National Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) Observational Study NAPOLEON-Registry of the German AML Intergroup
The registry aims to document epidemiologic data, treatment and long-term outcome as well as quality of life of patients with APL. Additionally, a biobanking project for further translational studies is integrated.

Prospective population-based non-interventional and non-randomized multicenter registry.

* collection of epidemiological data for APL: age distribution, prognostic factors, distribution of subgroups, incidence
* documentation of efficacy and safety of the first line and salvage therapy in APL including
* documentation of minimal residual disease (MRD)
* correlation of clinical outcomes with chosen therapy
* collection and evaluation of quality of life
* validation of published prognostic factors / new potential prognostic factors
* acquisition of bone marrow, peripheral blood and buccal swab samples for biobanking and translational studies under the umbrella of the specific study-group biobanking concepts
