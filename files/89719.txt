Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of FOLFOX + CT-011 Versus FOLFOX Alone
This clinical trial will be performed in previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the study drug, CT-011, in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or mFOLFOX6) compared with treatment by FOLFOX alone.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: CT-011|DRUG: FOLFOX
The primary endpoint will be the median progression free survival in patients treated with CT-011 plus FOLFOX compared to that of patients treated with FOLFOX alone., 32 months

The proposed clinical trial will be a multi-center, randomized, open label, active control study in previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody, CT-011, administered at 3mg/kg in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or mFOLFOX6) compared with treatment by FOLFOX alone. Approximately 168 patients are planned to be enrolled to this study.
