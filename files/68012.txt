A Multi-National, Prospective, Observational Study in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of Ipilimumab and patterns of use in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the post-approval setting
Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma
Incidence and severity of adverse reactions in patients treated with Ipilimumab in the post-approval setting, Every 12 months up to 5 years|Incidence rate with person-year-exposure and frequency estimate of adverse events/serious adverse events, Every 12 months up to 5 years|Frequency at which immunosuppressive therapy was administered to patients to manage treatment-related adverse events associated with Ipilimumab, Every 12 months up to 5 years|Patterns of disease monitoring as observed in a real-world setting, To evaluate patterns of care, descriptive statistics will describe treatment, dosing, regimen, indication, treatment rationales, management of treatment-related adverse events, reasons for treatment termination, Every 12 months up to 5 years
Quality of life (QoL), impact on work productivity, and overall satisfaction among patients receiving any therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Every 12 months up to 5 years|Resource utilization associated with advanced melanoma treatment, Descriptive statistics will be reported for healthcare utilization (inpatient, outpatient, emergency department and other ancillary services) and imputed costs, Every 12 months up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS) in patients receiving Ipilimumab or other therapies for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Every 12 months up to 5 years
Time Perspective: this study does have a retrospective component involving a subset of patients
