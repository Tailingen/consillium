Three Dimension Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery for Gallbladder Carcinoma
Introduction: Surgery is the only potential curative approach for the highly lethal gallbladder carcinoma. The laparoscopic surgery has developed rapidly since invented. As a kind of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy including segmentg IVB and V is preferred by most of surgeons. There have been studies comparing intraoperative blood loss, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and costs of laparoscopic cholecystectomy over open surgery. However, randomized controlled trials are still lacking but clearly required to reveal whether the laparoscopic approach or the open surgery is the better option for treating gallbladder carcinoma. We hypothesize that incidence of postoperative complications is lower, and time to functional recovery is shorter after laparosopic compared with open approach, even in an enhanced recovery setting.

Methods/design: We designed this prospective, randomized, controlled trial with two treatment approaches, laparoscopic versus open surgery for gallbladder carcinoma. The trial hypothesis is that laparoscopic approach has advantages in postoperative recoveries and be equivalent in operation time, oncological results and long-term follow-up compared with open counterpart. The duration of the entire trial is four years including prearrangement, follow-up and analyses.

Discussion: Although several studies have discussed different surgical approaches for gallbladder carcinoma treatment, this trial will be a thorough RCT comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for gallbladder carcinoma.
