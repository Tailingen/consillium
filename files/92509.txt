A Study of TY-1091 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antineoplastic activity of TY-1091 administered orally in participants with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), RET-altered NSCLC and other RET-altered solid tumors.

The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Phase 1) and an expansion part (Phase 2). Part1 will enroll participants with advanced non-resectable NSCLC, advanced non-resectable thyroid cancer and other advanced solid tumors that have progressed following standard systemic therapy, have not adequately responded to standard systemic therapy, or the participants must be intolerant to or the Investigator has determined that treatment with standard therapy is not appropriate, or there must be no accepted standard therapy for their disease. A multicenter, open-label design is adopted for part2. According to the obtained data of safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, and preliminary efficacy of TY-1091, one or two doses will be selected to conduct a dose expansion trial, which includes 3 cohorts with 20-40 subjects in each cohort.
