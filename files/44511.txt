Real-time Targeted Fluorescence Endoscopy for Detection of the Primary Cancer Lesion in Patients With a Metastasis of Unknown Primary Tumor in the Head and Neck
In current diagnostic work-up of patients with a cancer of unknown primary (CUP), approximately 50% of the primary tumor lesions remains undetected. Identification of the primary tumor site results in minimizing the potential morbidity from treatment by reducing morbidity by omitting the need for a mucosectomy of the bilateral base of tongue and tonsils, reducing the radiation field and better oncologic outcome than those with unidentified primary tumor. Clearly, new endoscopic 'real-time' imaging techniques are needed to visualize mucosal changes associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and increase detection rate of the primary tumor. Targeted fluorescence endoscopy enables the visualization of targeted tumor-specific biomarkers by using fluorescence, thereby enhancing the contrast between normal mucosa and tumor tissue. This could improve the detection of the primary tumor in cases where the primary tumor is not detected with white light endoscopy.
