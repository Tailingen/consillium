Phase Ib/2, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study of DCR-MYC in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational anticancer drug DCR-MYC. DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC. MYC oncogene activation is important to the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. In this study the Sponsor proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell growth.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: DCR-MYC
Phase 1b: Number of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Part A: 3 patient cohorts with 50% dose increase between cohorts until study drug-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1, then expand to 6 patients and move to Part B.

Part B: 3 to 6 patient cohorts with 25% dose increase between cohorts until \> 1 study drug-related DLT, then stop escalation.

Expand MTD cohort to 12 patients; tumor biopsies to be performed in this Phase 1b MTD Biopsy Cohort (6 patients)., Cycle 1 (3 weeks), longer if DCR-MYC is continued; with 30 days follow-up after last dose|Phase 2: Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Up to 30 patients in the Phase 2 MTD Expansion Cohort (to be treated at the MTD identified in Phase 1b); further evaluation of safety and tolerability., Cycle 1 (3 weeks), longer if DCR-MYC is continued; with 30 days follow-up after last dose|Phase 2: Preliminary Antitumor Activity, Up to 30 patients in the Phase 2 MTD Expansion Cohort (to be treated at the MTD identified in Phase 1b); evaluation for evidence of objective response or disease stabilization., After Cycle 2 (6 weeks), then at 6 week intervals if DCR-MYC is continued

No noteworthy increases were observed across dose groups or time for GM-CSF, IFNα, IFNɣ, or IL-1β. Changes that were observed for the other cytokines were not dose-dependent since they occurred sporadically and primarily in Cohorts 3 (0.3 mg/kg) and 4 (0.45 mg/kg). Pre-dose, 4 hours post-dose, and 24 hour post-dose results for TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1RA, and MCP-1 are summarized here., Cycle 1; Week 1|DCR-MYC Biological Activities (Phase 1b Only), Tumor biopsies (2 total) to be performed in Phase 1b MTD expansion cohort only (6 patients).

In this second study in humans, DCR-MYC will be administered by 2 hour intravenous (IV) infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are either sorafenib-refractory, sorafenib-intolerant despite dose reduction and best supportive care, or for whom neither sorafenib nor other suitable therapy is available. During the Phase 1b portion of the study, the highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the preliminary antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated. During the Phase 2 portion of the study, up to 30 patients will be treated at the MTD identified in Phase 1b in order to further evaluate safety and tolerability, as well as assess the antitumor activity, of DCR-MYC.
