Donor Peripheral Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Metastatic Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: A peripheral stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant from a brother or sister may be an effective treatment for kidney cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well a donor peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic kidney cancer.
Kidney Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: anti-thymocyte globulin|BIOLOGICAL: graft-versus-tumor induction therapy|BIOLOGICAL: therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: mycophenolate mofetil|DRUG: tacrolimus|PROCEDURE: allogeneic bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
Response rate based on tumor measurements at 1 year
Toxicity as measured by NCI CTC at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after transplantation and monthly for 11 months|Overall and disease-free survival at day 100 and 1 year after transplantation
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of nonmyeloablative sibling allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

* Conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV on days -5 to -1. Patients receiving 5/6-mismatched cells also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5 to -3.
* Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC or bone marrow transplantation on day 0.
* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-30. Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily beginning on day -2 and continuing up to day 44-100 in the absence of GVHD.
* Donor lymphocyte infusion: Patients with partial or complete T-cell chimerism receive up to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of GVHD or progressive disease.

After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated periodically for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
