Adjuvant Study of Pyrotinib in HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, randomised, multicenter, no placebo-controlled, open label study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in women with residual invasive HER2-positive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 target therapy. The main purpose is to investigate whether pyrotinib can further reduce the risk of recurrence from previously diagnosed HER-2 positive breast cancer based on the 1-year trastuzumab standard adjuvant treatment with or without pertuzumab.
Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: pyrotinib
Invasive Disease-free Survival (iDFS), Invasive disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first invasive disease recurrence of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, local/regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence and death from any cause., From randomization until time of event up to 2 years.
Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first disease recurrence of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, local/regional invasive recurrence, non-breast primary invasive cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS),or distant recurrence and death from any cause, From randomization until time of event up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., From randomization until time of event up to 2 years
