A Phase II Study of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel, an Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Tcell Therapy, in Combination With Radiotherapy (RT) in Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma
To learn about the safety of a drug called axicabtagene ciloleucel given in combination with radiation therapy to patients with relapsed/refractory FL.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Diphenhydramine|DRUG: Acetaminophen
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

-The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of standard of care axicabtagene ciloleucel with bridging radiotherapy (RT) in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, as assessed by the incidence of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) within 30 days after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell infusion.

Secondary Objectives:

* Establish the rates of CRS and ICANS in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy and radiation
* Determine complete response rate (CR) at approximately 1 month post CAR T-cell ---therapy
* Determine the overall response rate (ORR)
* Determine the duration of response (DOR)
* Determine progression free survival (PFS)
* Determine overall survival (OS)

Exploratory Objectives:

-Assess the impact of tumor burden as measured by metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis on PET/CT on response following CAR T-cell infusion
