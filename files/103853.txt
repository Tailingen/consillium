Progression free-survival, The progression-free survival (PFS) is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From randomization to disease progression or death up to 5 years
Objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients with a best response during treatment being either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)., 5 years|Overall survival, The overall survival (OS) is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years|Incidence of Treatment Adverse Events, The tolerance and safety will be evaluated by toxicity (acute \[\<1 months after the end of the trial treatment\] and late \[≥1 month after the end of the trial treatment), assessed using the Common terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). CTCAE is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 5 years|Time to patient performance status deterioration >2, Time to performance status (PS) deterioration \>2 is defined as the time between patient randomisation and the first date when PS\>2.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS, a simple measure of functional status, determines ability of patient to tolerate therapies. It has scores ranging from 0 to 5 (0 = "fully active", 1 = "completely ambulatory", 2 = "\<50% in bed during the day", 3 = "\>50% in bed, but not bedbound", 4 = "bedbound", and 5 = "death")., From randomization to PS deterioration >2, up to 5 years|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., From baseline until disease progression, up to 1 year
