Empyema Following Pneumonectomy for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Empyema following pneumonectomy for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a known problem that occurs in about 2% of pneumonectomy patients.

Overall survival, overall 5-year survival after empyema following pneumonectomy, 5 years from surgery
incidence rate, incidence of empyema, accompanied with broncho-pleural fistula or not, divided in short term (less than 1 yr postoperatively) and long term (up to 5 years postoperatively) incidence., 1 and 5 years from surgery
fast track treatment outcome, over the last 7 years, a new approach - known as 'fast track treatment of Empyema following pneumonectomy (EFP)' is used. We will examine if there is a benificial aspect in this approach, regarding survival en hospital stay., 5 years from surgery
The development of an empyema following pneumonectomy is a devastating complication, especially if associated with an underlying fistula. Whilst the perioperative mortality of pneumonectomy overall is now less than 5%, this rises to around 25% when complicated by empyema, and about 50% when associated with fistula. In addition, there is the morbidity and social cost of long-term drainage, chronic sepsis and often multiple operations.
