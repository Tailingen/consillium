High Intensity Interval Training or Strength Training in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The aim is to investigate whether strength training or high intensity interval training is effective in improving insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular outcomes, body composition and reproductive outcomes in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Few studies have examined the effect of strength training alone on insulin sensitivity, reproductive outcomes and body composition in women with PCOS. Most previous studies on aerobic exercise in PCOS have applied moderate exercise intensity.
