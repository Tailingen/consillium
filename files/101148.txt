Transfusion in Lower Risk MDS Patients: Predictors of Adequacy of Transfusion and Quality of Life in Lower Risk MDS
Observational study to evaluate changes in quality of life (QoL) in patients diagnosed with low risk MDS who are red blood cell (abc) transfusion dependent.

Changes in QoL will be correlated with patient cardiorespiratory function. Cardiac biomarkers and plasma cytokines will also be evaluated.
Low Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Prediction of Quality of Life (QoL) improvement, assessed by an increase in 5 points or more in the QUALMs scale, To design a score that help to identify which patients benefit from red blood cell Transfusion in terms of QoL improvement, We expect to obtain results in one year from the beginning of the study
Changes in QoL before and after transfusion, QoL will be assessed with QUALMS instrument, The QUALMS is being supplied by Dr. Gregory Abel at Dana-Farber in the U.S., who led its development team. He will collaborate and assist in the interpretation of the HRQoL results., QoL will be asses the day of transfusion and seven days after
Troponin and NTproBNP as predictors for QoL improvement, To evaluate the utility of serum pretransfusional troponine and NTPROBNP as cardiac biomarkers to identify those patients whose QoL improves after the rbc transfusion, Troponin and NTproBNP will be analyzed the day of transfusion and seven days after|Cardiorespiratory function, To evaluate the utility of oxygen consumption measured by ergospirometry to evalaute cardiorespiratory function and as a predictor of QoL improvement after rbc transfusion, Ergospirometry will be performed at the inclusion in the study|Cytokines, To analyze changes in pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines before and after rbc transfusion, Cytokines will be analyzed before abc transfusion and seven days after it
At inclusion and before red blood cell (rbc) transfusion, patients cardiorespiratory function will be evaluated with an ergospirometer

Likewise, before and after rbc transfusion, patients will be asked to complete the QUALMS, a QoL instrument which will be supplied by Dr. Gregory Abel at Dana-Farber in the U.S., who led its development team.

Before and after rbc transfusion, hemoglobin, pretrasfusional hemoglobin, pre and post cardiac biomarkers troponin and NTproBNP will be collect.Pre and post serum and plasma will also be collected for cytokine analysis.
