Anesthesia and Cancer Study: Colon Cancer
This study investigates the influence of type of anesthesia on survival and recurrence rate in patients receiving colon cancer surgery. The participants will be allocated to either the TIVA group and the inhalation group.

The effect of anesthesia on cancer recurrence and survival is controversial. According to some retrospective studies and preclinical studies, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is suggested to be more favorable than inhalation anesthesia regarding cancer recurrence and survival after surgery. However, there is no randomized controlled study to determine this difference in colon cancer patients.
