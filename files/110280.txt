Impact of Robotic Surgery on Systemic Immune-inflammation Index
Robotic surgery has been gaining attention because of the physical and metabolic morbidity of the conventional open technique.The systemic immune-inflammation index(SII) has emerged as a recent and more reliable biomarker.In our single-center retrospective cohort study, the investigators investigate SII in robotic gastrectomy in order to show the advantageous effect on immune system which the investigators think as the first study in the literature.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: robotic surgery
Systemic inflammatory index, Systemic inflammatory index (SII= (platelet count x neutrophil count)/lymphocyte count) was predicted to be lower in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLT) have been the subject of investigation as potential biomarkers to show the immune response to the surgical procedure., One year
Patients who underwent robotic gastrectomy between January 2021 and September 2024 were included in the study. The primary outcome was to ascertain the beneficial effects of robotic surgery in gastric cancer patients in terms of immune response. The secondary outcome was to examine the reliability of SII as a serum biomarker in comparison to previous studies on the diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of gastric cancer.
