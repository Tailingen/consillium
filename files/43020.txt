Dasatinib Combined With Chemotherapy in Relapsed t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia With KIT D816 Mutation
In this multi-center, open-label, no control,prospective clinical trial, a total of 30 relapsed acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) translocation and KIT D816 mutation patients will be enrolled. Dasatinib 70 mg twice a day will be administrated for two weeks from day 1 of re-induction chemotherapy. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy of dasatinib with multi-agent chemotherapy in relapsed acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) translocation and KIT D816 mutation.
