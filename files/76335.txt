Assessment for Long-Term Cardiovascular Impairment Associated With Trastuzumab Cardiotoxicity in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Survivors
This is for participants with a history of HER2-positive breast cancer and were treated with chemotherapy that increases the risk of abnormal heart function. Strain (a marker of heart function) is a new method of monitoring heart function in cancer patients and is measured with an ultrasound. Exercise testing is another method that can be used to monitor for abnormal heart function in cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to see if strain and exercise testing can be used to detect for late signs of heart damage from chemotherapy.
