Study to Gather Information on the Safety and How Radium-223 Dichloride, an Alpha Particle-emitting Radioactive Agent, Works Under Routine Clinical Practice in Taiwan in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Which Has Spread to the Bone
In this observational study researchers want to gather more information about safety and survival in patients suffering from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which has spread to the bone and were treated with radium-223 in routine clinical practice in Taiwan. Radium-223 (Ra-223) is an alpha particle-emitting radioactive agent approved for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223)
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 7 months|Incidence of drug-related TEAEs, Up to 7 months|Descriptive analysis of long-term safety information during the extended follow-up period, This safety information may include e.g. hematological adverse events, bone fractures or osteoporosis., Up to 2 years
Overall survival, Up to 2 years|Time to the first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), Up to 2 years|Proportion of patients with total ALP (tALP) response, ALP - Alkaline Phosphatase tALP - Total Alkaline Phosphatase, Up to 2 years|Proportion of patients with PSA response, PSA - Prostate Specific Antigen, Up to 2 years|Change in pain status, Pain status is assessed through analgesic utility that is calculated by WHO analgesic scores (0 - none, 1 - non-opioid, 2 - opioid for mild to moderate pain, 3 - opioid for moderate to severe pain), Up to 2 years|Change in ECOG-PS, The Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score ranks the performance status from 0 (perfect health) to 5 (death)., Up to 2 years
The primary objective of the study is to describe the safety profile of radium-223 dichloride in patients having castration-resistent prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases and who are treated in routine clinical practice in Taiwan.

The secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of radium-223 dichloride in these patients.
