Research Study in Healthy Volunteers of Patients With Fanconi Anemia, Myeloproliferative Disorders, or Myeloma
RATIONALE: Analyzing tissue and blood samples from healthy volunteers or patients with Fanconi anemia, myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative disorders, or myeloma in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the causes of blood cancers.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to analyze in the laboratory blood and bone marrow cells from healthy volunteers or patients with Fanconi anemia, myeloproliferative disorders, or myeloma.

OBJECTIVES:

* Identify the specific molecular function of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementing gene products in hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients and normal volunteers.
* Identify functional defects in hematopoietic stromal cells, including macrophages, from patients with FA, and selected blood cancers as well as normal volunteers.

OUTLINE: Peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, skin fibroblasts, and marrow fibroblasts are collected for loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis related to the Fanconi anemia complementing gene.
