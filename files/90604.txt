Intraoperative Radiation Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This phase II study is designed to investigate the efficacy of intraoperative radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. The purpose of the study is to show the local recurrence rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and IORT is superior to that of surgical resection alone from the historical control. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled, and these patients will receive IORT of 10 Gy at 5 millimeter depth of the tumor bed, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: intraoperative radiotherapy, IORT
3-year local recurrence rate, A local recurrence is defined as reappearance of cancer in the ipsilateral preserved breast or chest wall.

The 3-year local recurrence rate is calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method., 3 year after intraoperative radiotherapy
post-operative complication, Evaluation of safety, including adverse events, was performed by the Principal Investigator and delegated participating investigators in the Department of Surgery and Radiation Oncology outpatient clinic.

Toxicity is evaluated within 3 months (acute) and thereafter (chronic) after surgery, and it is performed through a questionnaire and physical examination at every visit up to 1 year after surgery and recorded., 3 year after intraoperative radiotherapy|disease free survival, Disease-free survival is defined as the time from intraoperative radiotherapy to recurrence of tumor, death or last patient contact., 1 year and 2 year after intraoperative radiotherapy.|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from intraoperative radiotherapy to death or last patient contact., 1 year and 2 year after intraoperative radiotherapy.
