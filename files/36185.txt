A Phase I/II Clinical Trial of LBL-033 in the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Tumors
This trial is an open and multicenter phase I/II clinical study, which aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, immunogenicity, and effectiveness.
Advanced Malignant Tumors
DRUG: LBL-033 for Injection
Dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）, DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., At the end of Cycle 1（28 days after the first prespecified dose）|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the hightest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycles, At the end of Cycle 1（28 days after the first prespecified dose）
Cmax, Maximum serum concentration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Tmax, After taking a single dose, Time to reach maximum plasma concentration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Disease Control Rate(DCR）, Percentage of participants achieving CR and PR and stable disease (SD)., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Duration of Response(DOR）, The period from the participants first achieving CR or PR to disease progression., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), refers to the percentage of study subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response. This Secondary Outcome Measure was used for efficacy observations in Phase I study, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy.
This is an open, multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of LBL-033 in the treatment of patients with advanced malignant tumors，which aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, immunogenicity, and effectiveness.

The trial is divided into 2 parts: Phase 1 and Phase 2

Phase I study:

Dose-escalation and PK expansion.The PK expansion study will be judged on the basis of dose escalation data.

Phase II study:

Dose expansion included 4 cohorts that required patients with MUC16-positive malignancies.Blood samples will be collected from all subjects in this trial.

Phase I and Phase II studies are expected to recruit 113-468 patients
