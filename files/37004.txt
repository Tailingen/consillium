Study of Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy With Lenvatinib for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
In this Phase-II study, the investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cisplatin/Carboplatin|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Tumor shrinkage (response rate) (Physician Judgment by Medical Institution, Modified RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors] criteria), The overall response and the best overall response are the result of the diagnostic imaging evaluated based on Modified RECIST criteria, and the result of the diagnostic imaging does not include clinical progression. The diagnostic imaging for which the overall response is determined other than inevaluable (NE) are considered as the evaluable diagnostic imaging. The response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 2 years
Progression-Free survival (PFS) (Physician Judgment by Medical Institution, Modified RECIST criteria), Progression-Free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of treatment start to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD), as determined by the overall response of Modified RECIST criteria, or death from any cause, whichever is earlier., 2 years|Overall survival time (OS), Overall Survival time (OS) is defined as the time from the date of treatment start to the date of death from any cause. The Participant without documented death at the last date of confirmation of survival or who is lost to follow-up will be censored at last date of confirmation of survival., 2 years|Tumor shrinkage (disease control rate) (Physician Judgment by Medical Institution, Modified RECIST criteria), The response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)., 2 years|Duration of response (Physician Judgment by Medical Institution, Modified RECIST criteria), The duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of confirmed CR or PR to the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause (whichever is earlier), for participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR or PR., 2 years|Best overall response (Physician Judgment by Medical Institution, Modified RECIST criteria), The best overall response is the result of the diagnostic imaging evaluated based on Modified RECIST criteria, and the result of the diagnostic imaging does not include clinical progression. The diagnostic imaging for which the overall response is determined other than inevaluable (NE) are considered as the evaluable diagnostic imaging., 2 years|Incidence of adverse events, Safety, as defined by the rate of any adverse events as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v.5.0), 2 years
This is a single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Patients who meet the Inclusion Criteria, do not meet the Exclusion Criteria, and are judged by the investigator to be eligible for this clinical trial will be included. Subjects who meet all of the criteria listed in Criteria for Administration of Investigational Drugs may continue to receive the investigational drug. If a subject receiving investigational drugs meets any of the criteria listed in Discontinuation Criteria of Investigational Drugs, the subject will be evaluated at the end of the treatment phase (at the time of discontinuation) and moved to the post-observation phase.
