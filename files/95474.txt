Evaluating Ultrasound-Guided Needle Knife for Dupuytren's Contracture
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided needle knife dissection in treating Dupuytren's contracture. The procedure is designed to improve hund function and minimize complications associated with the conventional surgical methods.
Dupuytren Contracture
PROCEDURE: Ultrasound guided needle knife dissection
Improvement in hand Function, Functional Improvement:

- Evaluated using the QuickDASH score (0-100 scale)., 6 months|Improvement in hand mobility, Range of Motion (ROM):

- Measurment of joint mobility in degrees at MCP and PIP joints by goniometer., 6 months
Patient Satisfaction, Evaluation of patient-reported satisfaction using a standardized questionnaire., 6 months|Rate of procedure-related complications, Monitoring and documentation of procedure-related complications, including infection, nerve injury, and other adverse events., 6 months
Dupuytren's contracture is a disease mainly characterized by the progressive fibrosis of the palmar fascia with subsequent hand deformity and dysfunction. The current study seeks to explore, through this minimally invasive technique, ultrasound-guided needle knife dissection regarding ROM and patient satisfaction. The procedure will be carried out under ultrasound guidance to ensure safety and completeness with the accuracy of precise dissection. Primary outcome measures will concern hand mobility, and secondary measures will evaluate patient self-reported satisfaction and any complications for the 6-month follow-up period.
