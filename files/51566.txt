Using E-Nose Technology to Measure Response to Treatment in People With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The researchers are doing this study to test the ability of a new technology called breathprinting, or electronic nose (E-Nose), to measure how people respond to standard treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The researchers will study how E-Nose breathprints change over time as people receive standard treatment for MPM. They will also look at how changes in people's E-Nose breathprints compare to changes in their standard imaging scans and in biomarkers of MPM in their blood.
