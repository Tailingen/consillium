Prospective Observational Study of a Precision Medicine Approach in Patients With Advanced Cancer
Prospective observational study of a precision medicine approach in patients with advanced cancer. In this registrational study, patients with advanced cancer undergoing extensive molecular sequencing within the precision oncology program of Charité University Medicine, Berlin will be registered and followed to assess the efficacy of the program and assess the clinical relevance and frequency of molecular alterations, individualized therapies and novel molecular analysis tools.
