Oncological and Functional Result of AbdominoPerineal Extra Levator Resection for Distal Rectal Cancer
The aim of the project is to evaluate the oncological and functional outcome of the more extensive perineal dissection - i.e the extra levator resection - in abdominoperineal resections in patients with rectal cancer.

Hypothesis: Extra levator perineal resection reduces local recurrence three year postoperatively compared to traditional abdominoperineal resection and improves QoL 2-4 years postoperatively.

Low rectal cancer treated surgically by abdominoperineal resection (APR) has worse outcome than other rectal cancers operated with low anterior resection. In order to improve the outcome in the APR group a more extensive surgical procedure - the extra levator APR - has been suggested. This study aims to investigate both the oncological and the functional outcome of this method as compared to the traditional APR.

Method: All Swedish patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer 2007-2009 will be analysed regarding operative technique (traditional or extra levator resection). Data on all patients regarding pre op TNM classification, pathological report and local recurrence will be collected from the Swedish Rectal Cancer registry. A validated QoL form will be sent to each patient to further investigate the functional outcome, health economy and Quality of Life 2-4 years postoperatively.

Data will be analysed regarding 3 year recurrence rate (primary endpoint) as well as functional result and QoL (secondary endpoints) in the two different groups - i.e traditional and extra levator APR.
