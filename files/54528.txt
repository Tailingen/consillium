Strategies to Close the Gap From Cervical Cancer Diagnosis to Treatment in Botswana
Investigators will test the effectiveness of adaptive strategies on timely adoption of cervical cancer treatment in Botswana using a pragmatic trial design.
Cervical Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Clinic Outreach|BEHAVIORAL: Enhanced Outreach|BEHAVIORAL: Low-Touch Strategy|BEHAVIORAL: High-Touch Strategy
Adoption, Defined as the initiation of cervical cancer treatment within 90 days of randomization., Within 90 days of randomization
Fidelity, Defined as completion of evidence-based cancer treatment according to international guidelines and measured using medical record data., 12 months after randomization|Reach: First Appointment, Defined by the proportion of patients who complete an initial treatment visit divided by those randomized, 12 months after randomization|Reach: First Stage, Defined by the proportion of patients who complete an enhanced outreach phone call divided by those contacted., 12 months after randomization|Reach: Second Stage, Defined by the proportion of patients who complete a patient navigation phone call (high touch strategy) divided by those contacted., 12 months after randomization|Reach: Results, Defined by the proportion of patients with confirmation of results received divided by those randomized., 12 months after randomization
Clinical Outcomes: Treatment, Defined by the stage at diagnosis, type of cancer treatment the patient received (e.g., chemoradiation, surgery) measured using medical record data., 12 months after randomization|Clinical Outcomes: Survival, Defined as overall survival at one year after randomization measured using medical record data., 12 months after randomization
Investigators will test the effectiveness of adaptive strategies on timely adoption of cervical cancer treatment in Botswana using a hybrid (type III) and pragmatic Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. The adaptive strategies are designed to target patient- and system-level determinants identified in preliminary data, including delayed communication of results, individual and structural barriers to accessing treatment, and suboptimal care coordination between referring and cancer treatment clinics. The strategies draw upon key principles in behavioral economics and are supported by systematic evidence of the effectiveness of nudge strategies in preventive, HIV, and cancer care. The overarching rationale for the study is that enhancing coordination, communication, and navigation through centralized outreach and nudge strategies will increase timely treatment adoption and be scalable and sustainable in the long-term.
