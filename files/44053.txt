Phase 1 Clinical Study of GT-220F in Subjects With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
The goal of this clinical trial is to test GT-220F in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and learn about the best dose required for further study. Participants will be adults with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The main questions the study aims to answer are: 1) What medical problems do participants have when taking GT-220F? 2) What dose strength is best to use in further clinical trials? Participants will be asked to

* take GT-220F every day
* take medical tests every week
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: GT-220F capsule
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number and severity of dose limiting toxicity during Cycle 1 of GT-220F administration during dose escalation, at the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Maximum tolerated dose, determined by the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities during Cycle 1 of GT-220F administration, at the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Recommended Phase 2 Dose, Recommended Phase 2 dose, determined by evaluation of maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicities, and pharmacokinetics during Cycle 1 of GT-220F administration, at the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Adverse Events, Adverse events, characterized by type, frequency and relationship to the intervention (GT-220F) during administration of GT-220F and for 30 days after stopping administration of GT-220F, from date of randomization to date of progression, assessed up to 50 weeks
