Safety Study of a Melanoma Vaccine (GVAX) With or Without Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Surgically Resected Melanoma
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting lethally irradiated whole melanoma cell vaccine ("melanoma GVAX"), alone or in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide (CPM), for the adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resected stage IIB-IV melanoma. Secondarily, the investigators will assess in vitro correlates of anti-melanoma immunization by melanoma GVAX, including serological and cellular immune responses in patients treated with either the vaccine alone or the vaccine given with low dose CPM.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: melanoma GVAX|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Administering Melanoma GVAX With and Without Cyclophosphamide, To determine the side effects and tolerability of administering an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting lethally irradiated whole melanoma cell vaccine ("melanoma GVAX"), alone or in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide, for the adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resected stage IIB-IV melanoma., 2.5 years
In vitro correlates of anti-melanoma immunization, We will assess in vitro correlates of anti-melanoma immunization by melanoma GVAX, including serological and cellular immune responses in patients treated with either the vaccine alone or the vaccine given with low dose cyclophosphamide. These investigations are exploratory in nature and will not affect clinical care., 2.5 Years
