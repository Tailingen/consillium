Tolerance and Pharmacokinetic Study of Chlorogenic Acid to Advanced Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study:

Determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics characteristic, and dosage regimen of phase II/III of Chlorogenic acid for injection in the advanced Glioblastoma Patients ;
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Chlorogenic acid
Number of adverse events, Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0，grade ≥3 (DLT), Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Maximum Tolerated Dose, Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of chlorogenic acid, Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of chlorogenic acid, Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid
Improvement in cancer-related symptoms, Within 1 year after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|disease control rate(DCR), Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|objective response rate (ORR), Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|progress free survival(PFS), Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|overall survival (OS), Within the first 30 days after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Improvement in quality of life, Within 1 year after the first dose of chlorogenic acid
Changing in number of red blood cell, Within 1 year after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Changing in cytokines in peripheral blood, Within 1 year after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Changing in level of hemoglobin, Within 1 year after the first dose of chlorogenic acid|Changing in lymphocyte subsets, Within 1 year after the first dose of chlorogenic acid
1. Investigate the tolerance of Chlorogenic acid for injection in human body, determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Chlorogenic acid for injection in the advanced Glioblastoma Patients ;
2. Determine the human pharmacokinetics characteristic of Chlorogenic acid for injection;
3. Preliminary observation the effectiveness and effective dose;
4. Provide the basis for the dosage regimen of phase II/III.
