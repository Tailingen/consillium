Ribociclib vs. Palbociclib in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer Within the HER2-Enriched Intrinsic Subtype
HARMONIA is an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label and phase III study. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the combination of ribociclib with endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) is superior to palbociclib with endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) in prolonging progression-free survival in patients with advanced HR+/HER2- and HER2-E breast cancer. The study will enroll approximately 456 patients with HER2-E disease from approximately 95 sites worldwide.

In addition, the HARMONIA trial will include an exploratory cohort of patients with HR+/HER2- and Basal-like disease treated with paclitaxel +/- Tislelizumab. This cohort does not have a predefined sample size and the objective is only exploratory, given the suggested lack of efficacy of the combinations of hormone therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors in this subgroup of patients. Enrolment into the basal-like cohort will stop once the HER2-E disease cohort is fully enrolled.

Progression-free survival, using RECIST 1.1 criteria, as assessed by local radiologists/investigators, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, death, lost of follow-up, withdraw consent or the study is terminated by SOLTI, whichever occurs first, assessed up to approximately 62 months after the first patient enrolled
Progression-free survival 2, defined as the time from randomization to first documented progression on next-line therapy or death, whichever occurs first, From randomization until documented progression to second line of therapy, death, lost of follow-up, withdraw consent or the study is terminated by SOLTI, whichever occurs first, assessed up to approximately 62 months after the first patient enrolled|Overall Survival, the proportion of exitus patients, until patient death, assessed up to approximately 62 months after the first patient enrolled|Overall response and clinical benefit, defined as percentage of patients with CR, PR per RECIST 1.1 or SD lasting 24 weeks or longer, as defined by RECIST 1.1., until disease progression or 24 weeks from treatment start.|Time to response and duration of response, defined per RECIST 1.1, time from treatment start to response and time from response to disease progression, assessed up to approximately 62 months after the first patient enrolled|Adverse events (safety), Occurrence /severity of AEs, laboratory abnormalities, discontinuation rates, dose reductions/interruptions, from randomization/enrollment to end of study assessed up to approximately 62 months after the first patient enrolled
