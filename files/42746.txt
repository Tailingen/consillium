VTE has high incidence in lung cancer and increases the mortality. Appropriate preventive measures contribute to 50% increase of incidence. The investigators are to investigate the VTE in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and delineate the risk factors to establish a VTE risk model system helping clinicians to differentiate VTE high risk population and apply early prevention in order to reduce the incidence of VTE.
