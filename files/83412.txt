UNIty-Based MR-Linac Guided Adaptive RadioThErapy for High GraDe Glioma-3 (UNITED-3)
The goal of this study is to test whether an adaptive radiation therapy (RT), two-phase approach in participants with glioblastoma impacts local control compared to standard non-adaptive RT approach. The main questions of the study are to see how this adaptive, two-phase RT approach compares to standard RT in terms of:

* Local control
* Overall and progression-free survival
* Patterns of failure
* Toxicity, Neurological Function, and Quality of Life

Rate of marginal failure (if 20-80% of the recurrent GTV (rGTV) falls within the 95% isodose line), Through study completion, anticipated 6-12 months
Overall survival, Through study completion, anticipated 6-24 months|Progression-free survival, Through study completion, anticipated ~5 months|Rate of local control, in accordance with RANO-HGG criteria, Through study completion, anticipated ~5 months|Patterns of failure, Through study completion, anticipated 6-24 months|Rate of toxicity, Assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute toxicity scale, which assesses acute toxicity using a scale of 0-5, and late toxicity using a scale of 1-4. In both scales, a higher score means a worse outcome., Through study completion, anticipated 6-24 months|Health-related Quality of Life, Assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 to measure quality of life, Through study completion, anticipated 6-24 months|Changes in neurologic function, Assessed through the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale, Through study completion, anticipated 6-24 months|Adaptive Radiation Dosimetry, 6 weeks|Functional Imaging Kinetics as a Correlate of Treatment Response, Through study completion, anticipated 12-24 months
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a high grade glioma (brain tumor) that is treated with surgery or biopsy followed by radiotherapy (RT) given daily over 6 weeks with or without an oral chemotherapy. Radiation is targeted to the visible residual tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images plus a large margin of 15 to 30 mm to account for possible cancer cells outside the visible tumor and for potential growth or shifts in tumor position throughout the prolonged RT course. Standard RT uses MRI to create a reference plan (with large margins) and treats that same volume every day. This exposes a large amount of healthy brain tissue to radiation leading to toxicity and reduced quality of life.

A new technology, the MR-Linac, combines an MRI scanner and a Linac (radiation delivery machine) into one unit. This allows for "adaptive" RT by obtaining an updated MRI scan each day just prior to treatment, adapting the RT plan to take into account any changes in the tumor or the patient's anatomy on that given day. This allows for a smaller (5 mm) margin on the visible tumor as its position can be tracked daily. The goal of this study is to use adaptive RT with small margins with a two-phase approach to test the impact on local control of the visible tumor compared to the large volumes used with standard non-adaptive RT, as well as impacts on neurocognitive function and quality of life.
