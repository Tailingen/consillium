Prediction Model for Multiple Pulmonary Nodules
This study compares the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of radiologists, thoracic surgeons and a predictive model (PKUM model) to discriminate malignancy from benign nodules in patients with multiple pulmonary nodules.
Multiple Pulmonary Nodules
Performance of PKUM model, Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of PKUM model in predicting the probability of a nodule to be malignant in patients with multiple pulmonary nodules., 3 months
Comparison between PKUM model and clinicians, Comparison of sensitivity and specificity of radiologists, thoracic surgeons, and PKUM model in predicting the probability of a nodule to be malignant in patients with multiple pulmonary nodules., 3 months|Performance of PKUM model in equivocal nodules which is difficult to judge by clinicians, Sensitivity and specificity of PKUM model in predicting malignant probability of equivocal nodules judged by radiologists and thoracic surgeons., 3 months
It is clinically difficult to diagnose and manage patients with multiple pulmonary nodules (MPNs). We have developed a web-based mathematic model (PKUM model) by using a multi-centric database from three institutions (Peking University People's Hospital, Haidian Section of Peking University Third Hospital, People's Hospital Affiliated to Hebei Medical University) to predict the probability of a nodule to be malignant in patients with MPNs. This prospectively observational study will recruit patients with MPNs between January 2019 and March 2019, allowing radiologists, surgeons, and a predictive model (PKUM model) to discriminate malignancy from benign nodules, and compare their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
