MRI Scans of Blood Vessel Changes Caused by Bevacizumab Alone or Given Together With Interferon Alpha-2a in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: Comparing results of MRI scans done after bevacizumab may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab alone is more effective than giving bevacizumab together with interferon alpha-2a in detecting kidney cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying MRI scans of blood vessel changes caused by bevacizumab to see how well it works compared with bevacizumab given together with interferon alpha-2a in treating patients with stage III or stage IV kidney cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To establish whether bevacizumab-induced changes in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI vascular parameters are significantly enhanced by recombinant interferon alpha-2a.
* To establish whether there is an interferon alpha-2a dose response in potentiating bevacizumab-induced changes in DCE-MRI vascular parameters.

Secondary

* To correlate changes in DCE-MRI vascular parameters for each treatment group with progression-free survival.
* To correlate changes in DCE-MRI vascular parameters for each treatment group with tumor response and changes in tumor size.
* To correlate changes in DCE-MRI vascular parameters for each treatment group with other surrogate biomarkers.
* To assess the degree of change in baseline K\^trans within each arm of treatment.
* To investigate changes in diffusion and blood oxygen-level dependent MRI and their correlation with other pharmacodynamic endpoints.
* To assess the efficacy and safety profile of bevacizumab monotherapy or in combination with low or standard doses of recombinant interferon alpha-2a.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks.
* Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I and low-dose recombinant interferon alpha-2a subcutaneously (SC) 3 times weekly beginning on day 0.
* Arm III: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I and standard-dose recombinant interferon alpha-2a SC 3 times weekly beginning on day 0.

After 8 weeks of treatment, recombinant interferon alpha-2a dosage may be modified or discontinued at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (gadopentetate dimeglumine) MRI scans at baseline and weeks 2 and 6. Peripheral blood and serum samples are collected at baseline and weeks 2, 6, and 8 for analysis of surrogate biomarkers by flow cytometry and mRNA analysis by PCR. Archival histopathological specimens are analyzed by IHC, fluorescence resonance-energy transfer, and fluorescence lifetime-imaging. Urine samples are also collected at baseline for proteomic profiling by MALDI-TOF.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
