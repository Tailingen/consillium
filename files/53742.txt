Trial of Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation for Haematological Cancers
This trial investigates stem cell transplants from partially mismatched donors in patients with blood and bone marrow cancers. The trial will test two kinds of transplants - a full intensity transplant using a high dose of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and a reduced intensity transplant with lower doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients will be entered for the treatment pathway that is most appropriate for their level of health and fitness
