A Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of HS-10296 as First-Line Treatment in Patients
This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: HS-10296|DRUG: Gefitinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of radiological disease progression or until death due to any cause, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by investigators. Progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, approximately 2 years.
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression. Target lesions and assessed by CT per RECIST v1.1 (Complete Response(CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.)., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study.（up to 24 months）|Assess the Anti-tumor Activity: Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression assessed up to 24 months., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. (up to 24 months)|Assess the Anti-tumor Activity: Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD assessed up to 24 months., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study.|Assess the Anti-tumor Activity: Depth of Response (DepOR), DepOR is defined as the percentage change in tumor shrinkage, based on longest diameter or reconstructed volume, observed at the lowest point (nadir) compared with baseline., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study.（up to 24 months）|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Safety was assessed by AEs, which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug. AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if the AE resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization., Continuously throughout the study until 28 days after HS-10296 discontinuation.From first dose of study drug up to 28 days after last dose of study drug taken (up to data cut-off (15 Jan 2021)),approximately 2 years.|Number of Participants With Dose Interruptions, Participants had at least one delay in planned treatment due to treatment emergent adverse events., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. (up to 24 months)|Number of Participants With Dose Reductions, Participants had at least one reduction in planned treatment dosage due to treatment emergent adverse events. Every participant took 2 pills of HS

-10296 + 1 pill of placebo(experimental arm) or 2pills of placebo + 1pill of Gefitinib (control arm). When a dose reduction was decided by INV, the set of "2 pills of placebo" was decreased resulting in no reduction of active compound in control arm, compliance with dose modification for AEs in Gefitinib's label which includes interruption, discontinuation but reduction., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. (up to 24 months)
This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of HS-10296 compared to gefitinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor sensitizing mutations (EGFRm+) who have not received systemic therapy. Patients are randomly assigned to an HS-10296 treatment group or a gefitinib treatment group at a ratio of 1:1 and receive a once-daily oral dose of HS-10296 or gefitinib, in order to compare the efficacy and safety of the two different treatment regimens.
