A Study of the Drug I131-Omburtamab in People With Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors and Other Solid Tumors in the Peritoneum
The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug 131I-omburtamab. 131I-omburtamab could prevent the cancer from returning, or delay the cancer from getting worse, but it could also cause side effects. Researchers hope to learn more about how 131I-omburtamab works in the body, and how effective it is in treating cancer. 131I-Omburtamab is not approved by the FDA to treat DSRCT or other cancers of the peritoneum.
