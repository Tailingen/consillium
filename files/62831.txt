A Study of Foretinib in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects this new drug foretinib has on this type of breast cancer, called "triple negative" breast cancer because the cancer tissue is estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptor negative.
Recurrent Breast Cancer
DRUG: Foretinib
Objective response and early progression rate, All patients will be assessed for response at the end of every second cycle (every 8 weeks). Response and progression will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1., Every 8 weeks
Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, All patients will be assessed for toxicity at the end of every cycle (every 4 weeks). Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE V4.0., every 4 weeks|Relationship between response and biomarkers, Archival tissue will be collected on all patients. Pre-treatment fresh tissue biopsies CTC's will be collected on all patients entered in the second stage of accrual. Translational research studies will be done as described in protocol section 17.0., 2 years (end of study)|Biomarkers in Tumour cells, Archival tissue will be collected on all patients. Pre-treatment fresh tissue biopsies CTC's will be collected on all patients entered in the second stage of accrual. Translational research studies will be done as described in protocol section 17.0., 2 years (end of study)
This research is being done because there is no treatment that will cure this type of cancer. Although some types of chemotherapy can cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better options are needed.
