Impact of Psychological Stress on Treatment Response and Prognosis in Lung Cancer Patients
This study explores how psychological stress may influence the treatment response and long-term outcomes in patients with lung cancer. While advances in surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies have improved survival, emotional well-being remains an often-overlooked factor. We aim to investigate whether high levels of stress, anxiety, or depression at the time of diagnosis or during treatment are linked to poorer responses to therapy or shorter survival. By identifying these associations, the study hopes to highlight the importance of psychological care as part of comprehensive cancer treatment. The findings may inform future strategies to integrate mental health support into routine care for patients with both early-stage and advanced lung cancer.

OTHER: Exposure: psychological stress status
Advanced Stage Cohort: Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the beginning of first-line immunotherapy to the first progression (PD) in patients with lung cancer, 3 years|Early-Stage Surgical Cohort: Disease-free survival (DFS), The duration between the date after surgery to the date of any recurrence or death firstly, 5 years|neoadjuvant therapy Cohort: Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, pCR is no viable tumor cells in tumor bed and lymph nodes. The pCR rate is the proportion of patients with a pathologic complete response., 3 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the beginning of first-line immunotherapy until death due to any cause. Subjects who are still alive at the end of the study observation period will be censored at the time of last known vital status., 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), 3 years
The correlation between gut microbiota and chronic stress, The baseline faeces is collected and assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. And explore the association between gut microbiota and chronic stress during the enrolled observation process, 5 years|The correlation between peripheral stress biomarker and immune cells signature and chronic stress, The baseline peripheral venous blood is collected. The stress biomarkers including epinephrine, cytokines, norepinephrine, cortisol and ACTH. The peripheral immune cells signature and assessed by flow cytometry, including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, NK lymphocytes, macrophagocyte, and DC cells., 5 years|The correlation between tumor microenvironment signature and chronic stress, The baseline paraffin-embedded tissue is collected and assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry, including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, NK lymphocytes, macrophagocyte, and DC cells. And explore the association between tumor microenvironment signature and chronic stress during the enrolled observation process., 5 years
