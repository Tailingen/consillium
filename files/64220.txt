Combination COMBO Endoscopy Oropharyngeal Airway With High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygenation in Sedated Gastrointestinal Endoscopy for Obese Patients
Hypoxia is the most common adverse event during propofol sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly in obese patients.

A recent innovation in this domain is the COMBO Endoscopy Oropharyngeal Airway-a multifaceted device that encompasses capnography monitoring, bite block , oxygenation support, and oropharyngeal airway management.

This device has been purposefully designed to cater to the unique requirements of endoscopic procedures. The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the COMBO Endoscopy Oropharyngeal Airway in combination with High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygenation for reducing the incidence of hypoxia in obese patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation.

The incidence of hypoxia, 75% ≤ SpO2 \< 90% for \<60 s, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
The incidence of subclinical respiratory depression, 90% ≤ SpO2 \< 95%, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours|The incidence of severe hypoxia, SpO2 \< 75% or 75% ≤ SpO2 \< 90% for ≥60 s, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
The incidence of other adverse events, Other adverse events recorded by tools proposed by the World Society of Intravenous Anesthesia International Sedation Task Force, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
