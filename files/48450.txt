A Comparative Analysis of Ultrasound's Accuracy in Diagnosing HC Using Histopathology as Gold Standard
The study aims to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using histopathology as the gold standard. It addresses HCC's high global incidence and the utility of ultrasound as a non-invasive, cost-effective screening tool. Despite ultrasound's accessibility, its diagnostic limitations necessitate further investigation to improve clinical outcomes.
