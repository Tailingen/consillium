Evaluation of TRC105 in the Treatment of Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TRC105 in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

Angiogenesis plays a central role in the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer. In mouse models, VEGF-inhibitors diminish ovarian tumor growth, metastasis and malignant ascites formation. Independent Phase 2 trials have demonstrated single-agent activity for bevacizumab in recurrent ovarian cancer, and randomized controlled Phase 3 trials are ongoing in the first-line setting (GOG 0218 and ICON-7) and for recurrent disease (GOG 0213, OCEANS).

TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an important non-VEGF angiogenic target on vascular endothelial cells. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models. In a Phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, TRC105 therapy caused a global reduction in angiogenic biomarkers and reduced tumor burden at doses that were well-tolerated. We hypothesize that TRC105 will have single-agent activity in recurrent ovarian cancer. By targeting a non-VEGF pathway, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGF inhibitors which could represent a major advance in ovarian cancer therapy.
