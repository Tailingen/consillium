Humanized CAR-T Therapy for Treatment of B Cell Malignancy
The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of humanized Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) in treating recurrent or refractory B cell malignancy targeting CD19 with a humanized scFv. All participants will receive autologous chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells.
Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T
CAR-T cells persistence in peripheral blood, The presence of CAR T cells in patients' peripheral blood will be quantified with real time qPCR, 12 months
B cell number and immunoglobulins in peripheral blood, The number of B cells and immunoglobulins in peripheral blood will be evaluated by routine methods, 12 months
CD19 has been extensively evaluated as a therapeutic target for recurrent or refractory B cell malignancy by chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, the single chain antibody sequence (scFv) against CD19 derived from a mouse hybridoma was widely employed. However, the immunogenicity of the mouse scFv sequence might be one of the reasons that CAR-T cells cannot persist in vivo for long. In present study investigators replace the mouse-derived scFv with a a humanized one and evaluate its safety and efficacy.
