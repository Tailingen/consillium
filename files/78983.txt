Study of Adjuvant Chemotherapy With or Without PD-1 Inhibitors and Chemoradiotherapy in Resected pN3 Gastric (G) or GEJ Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors and chemoradiotherapy, in comparison with adjuvant chemotherapy only, in D2/R0 resected pN3 gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. PD-1+CRT cohort: A total of 216 patients will receive 6 weeks of PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy, then receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy, followed by 6 weeks of PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy, finally receive maintenance treatment of PD-1 inhibitors until (maximum 1year after radiotherapy). CT cohort: A total of 217 patients will receive 6 months of chemotherapy. The disease-free survival(DFS), overall survival(OS) and adverse effects will be analyzed.

3-year DFS rate, Defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented progression or death from any cause., Up to 3 years
3-year OS rate, Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 3 years|3-year local recurrence free survival rate, Defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented recurrence or death from any cause., Up to 3 years|Percentage of participants with treatment-related acute adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 28 days from last dose|Quality of life as assessed by Quality of Life Scale (range 0-60), It evaluates the quality of life from 12 aspects, including appetite, mental status, sleep quality, fatigue, etc. The higher scores mean a better quality of life., Through study completion, up to 10 years
