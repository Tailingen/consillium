A Phase II Study of Ivonescimab Combined with Cadonilimab and Chemotherapy in Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Ivonescimab combined with Cadonilimab and chemotherapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients. And also explore the potential biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of Ivonescimab combined with Cadonilimab for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
