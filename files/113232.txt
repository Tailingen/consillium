The Risk Factors for Acute Radiation Pneumonitis in Patients With Prior Receipt of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The purpose of this non-interventional study is to collect data on the risk factors for acute radiation pneumonitis in patients with prior receipt of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Cancer Patients
RADIATION: Cancer patients underwent thoracic intensity-modulated radiotherapy
Incidence of acute radiation pneumonitis (aRPs) in patients with prior receipt of immune checkpoint inhibitors., All suspected diagnoses of pneumonitis (regardless of grade) were centrally reviewed by a multidisciplinary committee consisting of at least one radiologist, pulmonologist, and oncologist. CT (or PET-CT) imaging was reviewed for each patient, which was then compared to the radiation treatment plan; other causes such as infection or tumor progression had to be ruled out using the appropriate workup., 6 months after last-patient- radiation
1. Incidence of acute radiation pneumonitis (aRPs) in in patients with prior receipt of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
2. Risk factors (especially analysis of the dosimetric risk factor) which may affect the product of aRPs events.
3. Establish a model to predict aRPs and guide clinical treatment.
