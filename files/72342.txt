The DoR will be calculated for responding participants (confirmed PR or confirmed CR) only., From the date of first documentation of confirmed response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 37 months|Disease Control Rate As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator Following I-DXd in Combination With Atezolizumab With Carboplatin (Part A and B of Cohort 2 Only), Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD by BICR and investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 37 months|Clinical Benefit Rate as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator Following I-DXd in Combination With Atezolizumab With Carboplatin (Part A and B of Cohort 2 Only), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD lasting for at least 180 days., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 37 months|Time to Response As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator Following I-DXd in Combination With Atezolizumab With Carboplatin (Part A and B of Cohort 2 Only), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment/randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) in responding subjects., From the start date of study drug to the date of the first documentation of response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed, up to approximately 37 months|Best Percentage Change in the Sum of Diameters (SoD) of Measurable Tumors As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator Following I-DXd in Combination With Atezolizumab With Carboplatin (Part A and B of Cohort 2 Only), The best percentage change in SoD is defined as the percentage change in the smallest SoD from all post-baseline tumor assessments, taking as reference the baseline SoD., Baseline up to approximately 37 months|Overall Survival Following I-DXd in Combination With Atezolizumab With or Without Carboplatin (Part A and B), Time from the date of enrollment/randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From the start date of study drug to the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 37 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Serum Concentration of I-DXd, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose up to Cycle 9 (and every 2 cycles thereafter up to 37 months) Day 1 pre-dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Serum Concentration of I-DXd, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose up to Cycle 9 (and every 2 cycles thereafter up to 37 months) Day 1 pre-dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Concentration Curve of I-DXd, Area under the concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable time (AUClast) and Area under the concentration-time curve during dosing interval (AUCtau) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose up to Cycle 9 (and every 2 cycles thereafter up to 37 months) Day 1 pre-dose (each cycle is 21 days)|The Number of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive At Any Time and Who Have A Treatment-emergent Anti-Drug Antibody, The ADA prevalence, which is the percentage of participants who are ADA positive at any time point (baseline or postbaseline), as well as the ADA incidence, which is the proportion of participants having treatment-emergent ADA during the study period, will be reported., Baseline up to approximately 37 months
This study consists of two parts and two cohorts: Part A (Phase 1b; Safety Run-in) and Part B (Phase 2; Dose Optimization), Cohort 1 (I-DXd in maintenance) and Cohort 2 (I-DXd in induction + maintenance).

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of I-DXd in combination with atezolizumab with or without carboplatin by assessing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and other safety parameters which will inform optimal dose selection of I-DXd in the combination regimens (Dose Optimization Part B) of this study.
