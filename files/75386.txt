High Dose SBRT for Abdominal-Pelvic Lymph Nodal Lesions in Oligometastatic Patients
This is a prospective, multicentric, phase II and feasibility study aimed to address early and late side effects of hypofractionated ablative radiotherapy for oligometastatic patients with lymph node metastases for genito-urinary, gastro-intestinal and gynaecological cancer.
Lymph Node Cancer Metastatic
RADIATION: Oligometastatic patients with abdominal-pelvic lymph nodes
Feasibility in terms of toxicity related to radiation therapy, Evaluation of acute and late toxicity performed during and after radiation therapy, 2 months
Tumour response to local radiation therapy (RECIST criteria), Evaluation of tumour response to local radiation therapy by means of imaging, 2 months|Overall survival in the oligometastatic patients, Statistical evaluation of how local control of the metastatic disease can affect overall survival, 2 months|Disease free survival in the oligometastatic patients, Statistical evaluation of how local control of the metastatic disease can affect disease free survival, 2 months|Quality of life questionnaire of treated patients, Evaluation of quality of life of patients during and after radiation therapy, 2 months
The purpose of this prospective, multicentric, phase II study is to determine the feasibility of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in stage IV selected oligometastatic patients, by looking at acute and late toxicity. Investigators also want to verify what is the impact of local control in irradiated metastatic foci in the context of the systemic disease, how local control can affect disease free survival and overall survival, and moreover quality of life of patients treated.
