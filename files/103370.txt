An Extension Study of NKTR-102 in Cancer Patients Previously Enrolled in NKTR-102 Studies
The study objective of this open label, multicenter study is to provide access to NKTR-102 treatment to subjects previously enrolled in a NKTR-102 study who are without signs of disease progression since receiving NKTR-102.

In addition the study will evaluate the safety of continued exposure to NKTR-102, observe disease status and survival status in subjects receiving NKTR-102, and evaluate the efficacy of NKTR-102 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
