KPT-9274 in Patients with Relapsed and Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral KPT-9274 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia, in Relapse|Acute Myeloid Leukemia Refractory
DRUG: KPT-9274
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose escalation will continue until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which â‰¤1 patient experiences a DLT in Cycle 1., 28 days
Establish Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), A RP2D equal to or less than the MTD will be declared after the MTD is determined and will be used for the Dose Expansion Phase, if conducted. After the RP2D is determined, a dose expansion phase, of up to 10 additional patients, might be conducted, in which a preliminary determination of efficacy will be conducted, using the ELN criteria., 28 days
KPT-9274 is a first-in-class orally bioavailable, non-competitive, small molecule, dual modulator of p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase /PBEF/visfatin (NAMPT). NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolic scavenging pathway that utilizes nicotinamide to replenish nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), an essential metabolic cofactor and second messenger. Recent investigations have shown that in in vitro and in vivo models, NAMPT is uniquely essential for relapsed or refractory AML stem cells. Targeting relapsed AML stem cells, through targeting of NAMPT, may allow for a promising therapeutic opportunity for patients with relapsed or refractory AML.
