Safety & Efficacy of Atorvastatin for Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease in Patients With Hematological Malignancies HLA- Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Phase II trial evaluating the safety \& efficacy of Atorvastatin for prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) in patients with hematological malignances undergoing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Matched Related Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT).
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: atorvastatin|DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: methotrexate
Percentage of Participants With Grades II to IV aGVHD at Day +100 of Atorvastatin Administration, The incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD at day +100 of atorvastatin administration. The grading of aGVHD and cGVHD were done using the Consensus Conference criteria., Up through day 100 following transplant
Safety of Atorvastatin in Transplant Recipients in Terms of Adverse Events and Toxicities., Adverse events and toxicities were monitored in patients using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 criteria., Patients: Baseline, weekly for 9 weeks and then on days 84, 91-100, 180 and 365. Donors: at apheresis and then 30 days later.|Time to Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment, Neutrophil engraftment will be defined as first of three consecutive days with ANC ≥ 0.5 x 109/L post-conditioning regimen induced nadir. Similarly platelet engraftment is defined as first day of platelet count ≥ 20,000 x 109/L, without transfusion for 7 consecutive days., weekly for 12 weeks, 100 days, 6 months, and 12 months|Percentage of Patients With Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD), cGVHD occurring anytime after day 100 post transplant will be termed chronic GVHD, and evaluated in patients who were followed for at least 100 days without early progression or death. Grading of cGVHD was done using the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Project Criteria, up 1 year post transplant|Non Relapse Mortality (NRM) at One Year, Cumulative incidence of NRM will be calculated as the time from transplant until death not related to disease, where the competing risk for NRM was death due to disease. Patients who had not died were censored at last follow up., up to 12 months post transplant
The study is a single-arm phase II single institutional trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing HLA matched related donor HSCT. This study will explore a two-pronged acute GVHD prophylaxis strategy, consisting of pre-treating consenting related donors with atorvastatin before stem cell mobilization and collection, followed by atorvastatin plus methotrexate/tacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis in transplant recipient patients.
