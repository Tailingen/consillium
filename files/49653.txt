Study to Assess the Safety of Escalating Doses of AT13387 in Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors
AT13387/0001 is a dose-finding study of an experimental anticancer agent. In accordance with the protocol increasing doses of AT13387 are given to patients with advanced cancer who do not have alternative treatment options. The preferred dose of AT13387 will be identified according to the side effects experienced at different dose levels.
Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: AT13387|DRUG: AT13387
The identification of the maximum tolerated dose for twice or once weekly dosing, on three weeks out of four, 12 months
Pharmacokinetic profile, Safety and tolerability of maximum tolerated dose, pharmacodynamic effect, identify dose limiting toxicities, 12 months
Increasing doses of AT13387 will be administered to groups of 3 to 6 patients at each dose level. The pharmacokinetic profile of AT13387 following a one hour intravenous infusion will be determined and the effect of AT13387 on predefined biomarkers in blood plasma and circulating white blood cells will be established. Patients will be closely monitored for the development of side effects which would preclude further dose escalation.
