A Phase II Study of Cladribine and Low Dose Cytarabine in Combination With Venetoclax, Alternating With Azacitidine and Venetoclax, in Patients With Higher-risk Myeloproliferative Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia or Higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes With Excess Blasts
To learn if the combination of cladribine, cytarabine, venetoclax, and azacitidine can help to control higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts and/or higher-risk chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Myeloproliferative Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine
To establish the overall survival (OS)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

* To determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination of cladribine, cytarabine and venetoclax in higher-risk MDS with excess blasts and higher-risk CMML.
* MDS relapsed cohort (Cohort A, N=20): MDS with Int-2 or High risk IPSS and \>5% blasts with no response after 6 cycles of azacitidine, decitabine, guadecitabine, CC-486 or ASTX727 (decitabine/cedazuridine) or relapse or progression after any number of cycles
* CMML relapsed cohort (Cohort B, N=10): CMML 1 or 2 with no response after 6 cycles of azacitidine, decitabine, guadecitabine, CC-486 or ASTX727 (decitabine/cedazuridine) or relapse or progression after any number of cycles
* MDS HMA-naïve cohort (Cohort C, N=20): MDS with Int-2 or High risk by IPSS and \>10% blasts OR diagnosis
* CMML HMA-naïve cohort (Cohort D, N=10): CMML-2; OR CMML-1 with at least one of the following high-risk features: extramedullary disease, splenomegaly of \>5cm below costal margin, platelets \<100x109/L, Hgb level \<10g/dL, WBC \>13x109/L, clonal cytogenetic abnormality (other than monosomy Y).

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response, leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS).
* To evaluate proportion of transplant-candidate patients bridged to allogeneic stem-cell transplant.
* Correlative studies including correlation of response with disease subtype and genomic profile.
* To evaluate changes in clonal composition and VAF of identified mutations with therapy.
