Safety and Efficacy of Lenvatinib and Anti-PD1 Antibody Combined With Radiotherapy Neoadjuvant Treatment for Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma With PVTT
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT can benefit from surgical resection and radiotherapy. As the rapid development of systematic treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma, ICIs neoadjuvant therapy is being actively explored .But there is no evidence to prove the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib and anti-PD1 antibody combined with radiotherapy neoadjuvant treatment for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT. This study intends to supplement the evidence of benefit in such patients.
