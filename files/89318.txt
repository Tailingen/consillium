B-mode Ultrasound Imaging in Detecting Early Liver Cancer
This pilot trial studies how well B-mode ultrasound imaging works in detecting liver cancer that is early in its growth and may not have spread to other parts of the body. Diagnostic procedures, such as B-mode ultrasound imaging, may help find and diagnose liver cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.

OTHER: Ultrasound Tomography
Mid-band fit, The Mid-band fit is related to the intensity of the returned ultrasound signal at different frequencies has been shown to change with tissue morphology., Up to 16 months|Spectral intercept, Spectral intercept (SI) is mostly related to the number scatterers and their density in the tissue. Changes in the SI have been demonstrated to occur due to different pathologies and result from treatments that change the structure of the tissue being imaged., Up to 16 months|Spectral slope, Summarized as the maximum and/or average value over the lesion of interest (using a region of interest selection) and the liver image as a whole., Up to 16 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate the use of quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy to detect early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an inexpensive and widely available quantitative (i.e. robust) method to confirm disease in developing countries.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo B-mode ultrasound imaging of the liver over 15 minutes.
