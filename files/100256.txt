The objective of this exploratory trial is to determine the disposition and characterise the metabolic profiling of dietary polyphenols in normal and malignant glandular breast tissues from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.

The patients consumed a polyphenol-rich dietary supplement containing 37 different phenolics and 2 methylxanthines (theobromine and caffeine) from the diagnosis to the surgery. The metabolic profiling was characterized in normal and malignant breast tissues as well as plasma and urine using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS.
