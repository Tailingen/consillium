This is a single-arm, single-site pilot of Radium-223 (55 kBq/kg) IV q3 weeks for up to 6 doses in combination with Atezolizumab 1200mg IV once every 3 weeks until investigator determined lack of benefit, unacceptable toxicity, or 17 doses in patients with urothelial carcinoma with bone metastases who have disease progression after platinum-containing chemotherapy.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Radium-223
Percent of Patients that respond to Treatment, Primary efficacy will be measured by Objective Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response). Complete response will be defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions. Partial Response will be defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions., Up to 52 weeks
Median Overall Survival Time, Up to 52 weeks|Median Progression Free Survival Time, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression., Up to 52 weeks|Number of Patients with Complete Response, Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions., Up to 52 weeks|Change in QOL Score From Baseline, Quality of life as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 (A questionnaire developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer to assess the quality of life of cancer patients) at baseline and during treatment will be described using means or medians and associated measures of variability., Up to 52 weeks
