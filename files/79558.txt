Multicenter RCT of the Clinical Effectiveness of Oncothermia With Chemotherapy in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Patients with pancreatic cancer often suffer from pain. Because of such a pain, their quality of life have seriously deteriorated. There have been a few studies that showed an effect for pain control by hyperthermia (heating the patient's body). However, there are several limitations in conventional hyperthermia.

In a previous pilot study (NCT02150135), we found the improvement of quality of life, function, and symptom.

From this background, the investigators tried to show the effect of "Oncothermia" with conventional chemotherapy for pain control, increasing quality of life, and anti-tumor treatment.
