Endoscopic Treatment for Local Residual Neoplasia
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is considered to be a gold standard of therapy of colorectal lateral spreading tumors (LST) without significant risk for lymphatic spread. According to the investigators previous study, local residual neoplasia (LRN) after conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)occurs in up to 21% of cases. Endoscopic therapy of LRN was not sufficient in 53 % and has not been standardized yet.
