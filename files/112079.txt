AMG 193 Alone or in Combination With Other Therapies in Subjects With Advanced Thoracic Tumors With Homozygous MTAP-deletion (Master Protocol) (MTAPESTRY 104).
The study aims to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended combination dose of the MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor AMG 193 administered in combination with other therapies in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted thoracic tumors. The study also aims to determine the safety profile of AMG 193 administered in combination with other therapies in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced MTAP-deleted thoracic tumors.
Thoracic Tumors|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AMG 193|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Sotorasib
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Up to approximately 21 days|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), TEAEs are any event that occurred after the participant received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests that occurred after study treatment administration were recorded as TEAEs. A serious TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant after first dose irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment(s) that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another medically important serious event., Up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAE), An SAE is defined as any AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect or important medical events that do not meet the preceding criteria but based on appropriate medical judgment may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above., Up to approximately 3 years
Objective Response (OR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), Up to approximately 3 years|Disease Control (DC) per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 3 years|Time to Response (TTR) per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS) per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 3 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 3 years|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of AMG 193, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 5 (one cycle = 21 days)|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (tmax) of AMG 193, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 5 (one cycle = 21 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of AMG 193, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 5 (one cycle = 21 days)|Intracranial objective response (IOR) per Response Assessment in Neuro Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM ), Up to approximately 3 years|Intracranial Disease Control (IDC) per RANO-BM, Up to approximately 3 years|Intracranial Duration of Response (IDOR) per RANO-BM, Up to approximately 3 years|Time to Intracranial Radiation Therapy per RANO-BM, Up to approximately 3 years
