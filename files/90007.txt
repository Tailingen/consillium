Icotinib as Adjuvant Therapy Compared With Standard Chemotherapy in Stage II-IIIA NSCLC With EGFR-mutation
Adjuvant therapy has been proved effective in treating earlier stage or less advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib as adjuvant therapy in treating stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival.

DRUG: Icotinib|DRUG: Chemotherapy
disease free survival, the time from the date of randomization to the first observation of tumor recurrence, metastasis (based on imaging ) or death, 48 months
