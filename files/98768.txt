An Observational Study of Menopausal Symptom in Patients With Gynecological Malignancy After Oophorectomy
Through long-term dynamic monitoring of gynecologic malignant tumor patients undergoing early menopause after ovaries resection in our center, we explored the changes in menopausal symptoms and bone health status of this population, and studied the effects of platinum combined chemotherapy drugs on menopausal symptoms and bone loss in gynecologic malignant tumor patients. To find the optimal time point and effective regimen for MHT in gynecologic malignancies undergoing surgical menopause, and to provide guidance for osteoporosis screening and prevention strategies in women with gynecologic cancer.

Gynecological malignancies are affecting the health of more and more women in the world, and the age of onset is also gradually younger. For women of reproductive age with gynecologic malignancies, surgery involving bilateral ovariectomy, followed by chemoradiotherapy or anti-estrogen therapy to maintain endocrine therapy, can lead to early menopause, leading to earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome and bone loss. Unlike the management of healthy women with natural menopause, the management of prognosis and quality of life in cancer patients with early menopause resulting from surgery combined with adjuvant therapy is more challenging and specific, and it is critical to identify management options for this complex patient population.

This study aims to conduct long-term dynamic monitoring of patients with gynecologic malignancies undergoing early menopause after ovaries resection in our center, explore the changes in menopausal symptoms and bone health status of this population, and study the effects of platinum combined chemotherapy drugs on menopausal symptoms and bone loss in patients with gynecologic malignancies. To find out the best time point and effective program of menopausal hormone therapy for gynecological malignant tumor patients with surgical menopause, and provide guidance for osteoporosis screening and prevention strategies for women with gynecological cancer.
