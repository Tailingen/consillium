MEN1611 With Cetuximab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (C-PRECISE-01)
Open-label, dose-confirmation and cohort expansion, multicenter, Phase Ib/II study to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of MEN1611 in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of participants with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide gene (PIK3CA)-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: MEN1611|DRUG: Cetuximab
Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, RP2D was defined as the highest dose level in milligrams (mg) at which no more than 1 participant during the dose confirmation phase (Phase 1b) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the DLT assessment window (28 days), or the maximum dose judged to be tolerable by the data safety committee., Day 1 through Day 28 of Cycle 1 (28 days/cycle)|Best Overall Response Rate (ORR) of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, The best ORR was defined as percentage of participants who had a best overall response to therapy of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) and was defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 assessment locally performed using computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and abdomen (including pelvis and adrenal glands)., Up to 37 Months|Phase 1b: Number of Participants With DLTs for MEN1611, A DLT was defined as any of the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to the combination regimens or to MEN1611 alone and unrelated to the participants' underlying disease or concomitant medication occurring during Cycle 1 over the DLT assessment window of 28 days: any Grade 3 (lasting \>7 days) or Grade 4 increase in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase; any Grade ≥3 cardiac disorder or new segmental wall-motion abnormalities; any Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, hyperglycemia. An ADR was defined as any adverse event suspected by the investigator and/or the sponsor to be related to MEN1611, cetuximab, or both given in combination., Day 1 through Day 28 of Cycle 1 (28 days/cycle)
Plasma Concentration of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, Blood samples were taken for the analyses of MEN1611 in plasma at designated time points. Results are reported as nanograms/millilitre (ng/mL)., Day 22 (1.5 hours postdose) of Cycle 1 (28 days/cycle)|Disease Control Rate (DCR) of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, DCR was defined as percentage of participants whose disease shrank or remained stable over a certain time period and was calculated based on the sum of the CR, PR, and SD rates according to local assessment., Up to 37 Months|Duration of Response (DOR) of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, DOR was defined as the time from confirmation of a PR, CR or SD as locally assessed, until the disease had been shown to progress following treatment. Participants with a previous response who did not show a relapse or died without recording a relapse were censored at their last available relapse-free tumor assessment date. Participants with only one tumor assessment after baseline showing a PD were not included in the calculation., Up to 37 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, PFS was defined as the number of days between the first study treatment administration to the date of first documented disease progression as per local assessment, relapse or death from any cause. Responding participants and participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at their last tumor assessment date., Up to 37 months|Overall Survival (OS) of MEN1611 in Combination With Cetuximab, OS was defined as the number of days between the first study treatment administration and death from any cause. Participants still alive that had withdrawn from the study were censored using the latest among end of study and follow-up dates. Drop-out participants were considered censored and the last available date in which the participant was known to be alive was considered., Up to 37 months
This Phase Ib/II study investigated the anti-tumor activity and safety of daily oral doses MEN1611 in combination with cetuximab in female and male participants affected by PIK3CA-mutated, neuroblastoma-Kristen-rat sarcoma virus (N-K-RAS) wild-type, and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.

MEN1611 is a potent, selective class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The maximum tolerated dose of MEN1611 given as single agent was assessed in a Phase I trial in participants with advanced solid tumors.

This Phase Ib/II started with a dose confirmation part (Step 1) to identify the recommended phase 2 dose of MEN1611 given in combination with cetuximab.

The study continued with a cohort expansion (Step 2) to explore the anti-tumor activity of the selected MEN1611 dose level combined with cetuximab with further assessment of safety and tolerability.
