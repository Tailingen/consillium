A Study of Alectinib and Duvelisib in People With Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALK+ALCL)
The researchers are doing this study to see if alectinib in combination with duvelisib is a safe and effective time-limited treatment for people with relapsed or refractory ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The researchers will test different doses of the study drugs to find the highest doses that cause few or mild side effects in participants. Once they find this dose combination, they will test it in a new group of participants to learn how long the effect of the combination lasts after the end of treatment
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Alectinib|DRUG: Duvelisib
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of alectinib (A) + duvelisib (D) The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which the estimated dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate from the CRM model is closest to the target acceptable rate of 25%., 2 years
1-year relapse-free rate, in patients who achieve CR and stop treatment For PET/CT scan, a five-point scale for visually assessing response, referred to as the Deauville criteria, was developed by international experts in the field and will be utilized for grading of PET/CT response. The Lugano criteria will be applied to define complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progression of disease (PD)., 1 year
