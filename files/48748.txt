Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
Lymphoma
DRUG: bortezomib
Response rate, To assess the efficacy (response rate) of PS-341 given as a bolus intravenous injection twice weekly for two out of every 3 weeks in the treatment of a population of patients with previously untreated or relapsed Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, 4 years
Toxicity, To assess the toxicity of PS-341 in patients with Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia as well as time to progression, stable disease duration and, if responses are observed, response duration., 4 years|Cytogenetics and genome profiling, To assess bone marrow and peripheral blood for cytogenetics and genome profiling by microarray in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia., 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, in patients with previously untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the time to progression, stable disease duration, and response duration in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease are followed every 3 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2 years.
