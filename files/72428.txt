Decitabine and HQP1351-based Chemotherapy Regimen for the Treatment Advanced CML
This phase II trial studies how well the combination of based decitabine and olverembatinib（HQP1351)chemotherapy work for the treatment of blast phase or accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. HQP1351 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving decitabine and ponatinib based chemotherapy may help to control blast phase or accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.
