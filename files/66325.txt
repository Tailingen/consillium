Patient Experience and Acceptance of Horizontal Rotation
Patients will complete validated psychometric questionnaires to quantify their experience of being rotated at different speeds using the Nano-X patient rotation system.

Study participants will be asked to attend the clinic on two separate occasions. Each session will last less than one hour. Patients will be asked to complete validated psychometric surveys assessing 1) their level of claustrophobia, 2) their level of anxiety and 3) their (baseline) motion sickness, before and after each session. They will then be rotated 3-4 times on the Nano-X patient rotation system, at varying speeds ranging from 6°/sec to 45°/sec. Each rotation will be designed to simulate a typical radiotherapy treatment; that is 9 angles, pausing for around 30 seconds at each angle. Straight after each rotation, patients will again complete the questionnaire assessing their anxiety levels and motion sickness.
