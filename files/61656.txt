FDG-PET/CT for Simulation and Radiation Treatment Planning of Early Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is:

* to assess the potential benefits of 18F-\[FDG\] PET/CT and PET/MRI for operable breast cancer in order to define the size and location of the primary tumor, as well as axillary, supraclavicular and internal mammary lymph nodes.
* to apply the imaging results to the simulation and the radiation treatment planning and partial breast for 3-D radiation treatment and partial breast irradiation with intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT).
Breast Neoplasm
Drawing of target volumes, Compare the drawing of target volumes using the PET/CT, PET/IRM information, or without these imaging informations., Up to 12 weeks after surgery
Correlate the FDG PET/CT PET/IRM with surgical pathology findings, Compare the pre-operative imaging information with histopathological description of the resected primary tumor, and with the extent of lymph node involvement., Up to 12 weeks after surgery
Pre-operative FDG PET/CT, and in option PET/IRM, are intended for women with histologically confirmed operable clinically node-negative breast cancer, in whom breast conserving and post-operative radiotherapy are planned.
