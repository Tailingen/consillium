A Study of Veliparib in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Japanese Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 open-label study and consists of 3 treatment groups (dose levels) . Treatment cycles are 3 weeks in duration. The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of veliparib (ABT-888) when administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in Japanese subjects with solid tumors. Secondary objectives are to assess pharmacokinetics and to obtain a preliminary efficacy of anti-tumor activity in the subjects.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: veliparib (ABT-888)|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel
Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase two dose, During the first cycle (21 days from first dose of veliparib)
Pharmacokinetics; Area Under the Curve (AUC), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and Time to Cmax (Tmax) of veliparib (ABT-888), Eight timepoints on Day 1 of first cycle (21 days)|Pharmacokinetics; Area Under the Curve (AUC), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and Time to Cmax (Tmax) of veliparib (ABT-888) when administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, Eight timepoints on Day 3 of first cycle (21 days)|Pharmacokinetics; Area Under the Curve (AUC), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and Time to Cmax (Tmax) of paclitaxel when administered in combination with veliparib (ABT-888) and carboplatin, Eight timepoints on Day 3 of first cycle (21 days)|Pharmacokinetics; Area Under the Curve (AUC), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and Time to Cmax (Tmax) of carboplatin when administered in combination with veliparib (ABT-888) and paclitaxel, Six timepoints on Day 3 of first cycle (21 days)|Preliminary tumor response, Computerized tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis to assess tumor burden, From date of first dose of veliparib until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever come first, assessed up to 6 cycles.|Safety assessment; Physical exam including vital signs, Blood pressure, pulse and body temperature, From date of first dose of veliparib until 30 days after last dose of veliparib (up to 6 cycles)|Safety assessment; Clinical lab testings, Hematology, Chemistry and Urinalysis, From date of first dose of veliparib until 30 days after last dose of veliparib (up to 6 cycles)|Safety assessment; Adverse event monitoring, Collect all adverse events at each visit, From date of first dose of veliparib until 30 days after last dose of veliparib (up to 6 cycles)|Safety assessment; Change from Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG), Day 8 of first cycle (21 days)
