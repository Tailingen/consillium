Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Organ Confined Prostate Cancer
A single arm phase II study of SBRT for prostate cancer to primarily assess acute and late toxicity and secondarily PSA outcomes and quality of life measurements of an extreme hypofractionated regimen of 36.25Gy in 5 fractions over 10-11 days.

This is a single arm phase II study of SBRT for prostate cancer to primarily assess acute and late toxicity and secondarily PSA outcomes and quality of life measurements of an extreme hypofractionated regimen of 36.25Gy in 5 fractions over 10-11 days. The radiation therapy is to be delivered using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with the aid of volumetric image guidance to ensure accuracy. Toxicity will be measured at preset intervals, as will HRQOL parameters using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) questionaire which focuses on bowel, urinary, sexual and hormonal symptoms.
