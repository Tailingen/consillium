This is an open label randomized controlled phase II study of AS1411 combined with Cytarabine in the treatment of patients with primary refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: AS1411|DRUG: Cytarabine
To compare the response rate (CR + CRi) of AS1411 at 40 and 80mg/kg/day in combination with cytarabine therapy with the response rate (CR + CRi) of cytarabine therapy alone, Dec 2011
To compare duration of remission, disease free survival and overall survival of AS1411 at 40 or 80mg/kg/day in combination with cytarabine therapy with that of cytarabine alone., Dec 2011|To compare the time to hematological recovery of AS1411 at 40 or 80mg/kg/day in combination with cytarabine therapy with that of cytarabine alone., Dec 2011|To compare the safety of AS1411 at 40 or 80mg/kg/day in combination with cytarabine therapy with that of cytarabine alone., Dec 2011|To evaluate and compare a range of PD markers in patients administered AS1411 in combination with cytarabine therapy with the same PD markers in patients administered cytarabine therapy alone., Dec 2011|To further define the PK of AS1411, Dec 2011
