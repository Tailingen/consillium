Study of Molecular Response in Adult Patients on Nilotinib With Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (Ph+ CML) in Chronic Phase and a Suboptimal Molecular Response to Imatinib
This exploratory study will evaluate the change in molecular response in chronic myelogenous leukemia - chronic phase patients with a complete cytogenetic response and have a suboptimal molecular response to imatinib
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia - Chronic Phase
DRUG: Nilotinib
Log Change From Baseline in Breakpoint Cluster Region Gene (BCR) - Abelson Proto-oncogene (ABL) (Bcr-Abl) Transcript Levels, The change on a logarithmic scale at 12 months from a standardized baseline value (100% on the international scale \[IS\]) in Bcr-Abl transcripts as assessed by peripheral blood Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)., From Baseline up to 12 Months
Number of Participants Who Achieved Major Molecular Response (MMR), Major Molecular Response (MMR) value at molecular MD is designated a percentage, which is equivalent to a 3-log reduction from a standardized baseline value from the International Randomized InteYesrferon versus STI571 (IRIS) study or 0.1 percent (%) per International Scale (IS)., From Baseline up to 12 Months|Number of Participants Achieved Reduction From a Standardized Baseline Value in Bcr-Abl Transcript Levels up to Month 12, Number of participants experiencing either a greater than or equal to (\>or=) 1, \>or= 2, or \>or= 3 log10 reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels from Baseline to End of Cycle (EOC) 45 (Day1219 - Day1302) were presented., From Baseline up to 12 Months|Median Time to Best Molecular Response, The median time to best molecular response, defined as the time (in months) from the date of enrollment to the date when the maximum reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript level was observed., From Start of Study up to End of the Study (up to 41 Months)|Duration of Best Molecular Response, Duration of best molecular response, defined as the time (in months) from the date of best molecular response to a date when an increase in \>1 log10 was observed, From Start of Study up to End of the Study (up to 41 Months)|Number of Participants With an Event-free Survival, Event-free survival was defined as the number of participants from the date of enrollment to the date of first occurrence of any of the following: loss of complete hematological response (CHR), loss of Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), \>1 log increase in Bcr-Abl transcripts from the lowest recorded value, progression to accelerated or blast phase, and death., From Start of Study up to End of the Study (up to 41 Months)|Number of Participants With a Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the number of participants from the date of enrollment to the date of first occurrence of progression to Accelerated phase (AP) or Blast crisis (BC) phase, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or death. Participants who did not have an event or dropped out without an event are considered censored at the date of the last observed event., From Start of Study up to End of the Study (up to 41 Months)|Number of Participants With an Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the number of participants from enrollment to the date of death., From Start of Study Enrollment up to End of the Study (up to 41 Months)
