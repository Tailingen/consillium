IN10018+ Standard Chemotherapy (+KN046) in Subjects With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase Ib/II clinical study comprising two phases: dose confirmation phase and dose expansion phase. The objective of the dose confirmation phase is to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of IN10018+ standard chemotherapy (albumin-bound paclitaxel + gemcitabine) and IN10018 + KN046 + standard chemotherapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer. The dose expansion phase will further explore the antitumor activities and safety of combination therapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer.

This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activities of IN10018 + standard chemotherapy (albumin paclitaxel + gemcitabine) and IN10018 + KN046 + standard chemotherapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer.

This study includes two cohorts, Cohort 1: IN10018 + standard chemotherapy; Cohort 2: IN10018 + standard chemotherapy + KN046. Each cohort consists of 2 phases: a dose confirmation phase and a dose expansion phase. The dose confirmation phase aims to determine recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of IN10018+ standard chemotherapy and IN10018 + KN046 + standard chemotherapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer. The dose expansion phase will further explore the antitumor activities and safety of combination therapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer.

According to the Package Insert of standard chemotherapy (albumin paclitaxel and gemcitabine), the Investigator's Brochure (IB) and drug characteristics of KN046, it is expected that IN10018 has little possibility of interaction with standard chemotherapy and KN046, and the safety characteristics are clearly non-overlapping. The therapeutic dose of KN046, albumin-bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine are fixed in this study. In the dose confirmation phase, IN10018 dose will be modified according to the causality between dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and IN10018.
