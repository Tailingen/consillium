Validity of HER2-amplified Circulating Tumor Cells to Select Metastatic Breast Cancer Considered HER2-negative for Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment.
Patients with metastatic breast cancer considered HER2 negative are screened for HER2-amplified circulating tumor cells. If at least HER2-amplified circulating tumor cell is detected, patients are treated by Trastuzumab - Emtansine (T-DM1) in a single arm phase II with an adaptive design.
Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 Negative Primary Tumor
DRUG: Trastuzumab - Emtansine
Tumor response rate to T-DM1 in patients with HER2 amplified circulating tumor cells, Assessment every 6 weeks., Until disease progression (estimated duration : 1 year)
Detection rate of HER2 amplified circulating tumor cells, heterogeneity rate between circulating tumor cells and correlations with patient characteristics, 1 month|Technical failure rate and reproducibility of HER2 FISH on circulating tumor cells, 1 month|Correlation between HER2 FISH and immunofluorescence on circulating tumor cells, 1 month|Progression-free survival, 4 years|Disease control rate (responses and stable diseases), Until disease progression (estimated duration : 1 year)|Correlation between treatment efficacy and HER2 FISH results (level of amplification, absolute number and percentage of amplified cells), Until disease progression (estimated duration : 1 year)|Changes in CTC numbers during treatment, Until disease progression (estimated duration : 1 year)|Circulating tumor DNA before and during treatment, Until disease progression (estimated duration : 1 year)|Treatment toxicity, Toxicity of the treatment from first intake until disease progression, Until disease progression (estimated duration : 1 year)
