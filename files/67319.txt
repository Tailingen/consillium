Laparoscopic Hepatectomy and Radiofrequency Ablation in the Treatment of Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this research is to compare short-term and long-term efficacy of laparoscopic hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation in the Treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma, and provide the evidence for the choice of surgical method from the pathology and cytology.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic Hepatectomy|PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency Ablation
Survival rate, follow-up after the surgery every 2 months, to understand relapse, death, statistics 1 year, 2-year and 3-year survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate., 5 years
postoperative complications, hepatic failure,hemorrhage,biliary leakage,ascites,intra-abdominal infection,pleural effusion,pulmonary infection,cardiac insufficiency., Duration hospitalization(an expected average of 7 days)
Background:The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic hepatectomy(LH) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Methods:A total of 110 patients with early HCC with nodular diameters of less than 3 cm and up to three nodules were randomly divided into LH (n=55) and RFA groups (n=55). Outcomes were carefully monitored and evaluated during the 3-year follow-up period.

Results:

operation time, intraoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, resection margin, number of micrometastases ,long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed.

groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank survival curves were used.
