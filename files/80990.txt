Efficacy Analysis of Complete Laparoscopic Resection of Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is aiming to evaluate the clinical efficacy of complete laparoscopic resection of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic resection
Perioperative complications, The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, shortest distance between the tumor edge and normal liver tissue, postoperative pain scores, postoperative time until the patient could walk, postoperative time until the patient could pass gas, hospital stay, and inpatient costs were compared between the two groups., within the first 30 days
relapse-free survival, The patients were followed up for one year after surgery, and the relapse-free survival was compared between the two groups., 1 year after surgery
The investigators conducted a prospective study of 64 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent HCC and underwent surgical resection at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from June 2014 to November 2014; 31 patients were enrolled in the laparoscopic group and underwent complete laparoscopic resection of HCC, and 33 patients were enrolled in the control group and underwent open surgical resection. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, shortest distance between the tumor edge and normal liver tissue, postoperative pain scores, postoperative time until the patient could walk, postoperative time until the patient could pass gas, hospital stay, and inpatient costs were compared between the two groups. The patients were followed up for one year after surgery, and the relapse-free survival was compared between the two groups.
