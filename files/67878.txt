Nedaplatin Versus Cisplatin and Capecitabine Versus Fluorouracil in IC + CCRT for Locoregionally Advanced NPC
This is a phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised factorial trial. The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy and safety of nedaplatin versus cisplatin, and capecitabine versus fluorouracil in induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (P-RT) in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever is first., 3 years
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause., 3 years|Distant failure-free survival, Distant failure-free survival is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Locoregional failure-free survival, Locoregional failure-free survival is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 (acute toxicity) and RTOG/EORTC (late toxicity), Incidence of acute and late toxicity, Up to 3 years|Quality of life (QOL) as assessed by EORTC quality of life questionnaire(QLQ)-C30, QOL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 during the treatment period, Up to 16 weeks
In this study, patients with non-keratinizing NPC and staged III-IVA (except T3-4N0) are randomly assigned to one of the four groups: Group A: TPF+P-RT; Group B: TNF+N-RT; Group C: TPX+P-RT; Group D: TNX+N-RT. In induction chemotherapy, patients will receive docetaxel(60 mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin or nedaplatin (60 mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 5) or capecitabine (625 mg/m2 bid, on Days 1 to 14) every three weeks for three cycles before the radical radiotherapy. Concurrent cisplatin or nedaplatin (100mg/m2 on day 1) was given every three weeks for two cycles during radiotherapy. Patients are stratified according to the treatment centers and stage. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), toxic effects, and quality of life (QOL). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
