ARREST - A Phase I Study of SABR for Poly-metastatic Disease
Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a new radiation treatment that delivers high-dose, precise radiation to small areas in the body. This new technique can potentially allow radiation treatments to be focused more precisely, and be delivered more accurately than with older treatments. This improvement could help by reducing side effects overall (through radiation exposure to a smaller area of the body over a shorter time period), and by improving the chance of controlling the cancer by more precisely treating the cancer and by giving higher doses of radiation. SABR is considered a standard treatment for some lung cancers, and selected cancers that have spread to the brain. Ongoing studies are evaluating the use of SABR for treating people with up to 10 sites of cancer in the body, but its safety and value for treating patients with poly-metastatic cancer (more than 10 sites of cancer) is not yet known.

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using SABR to treat people with poly-metastatic disease. To our knowledge, this is the first time that SABR will be tested in people who have poly-metastatic disease.
Metastatic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy - Level 1|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy - Level 2|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy - Level 3|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy - Level 4|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy - De-escalation Level
Maximally Tolerated Dose of Stereotactic Radiotherapy, In determining the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) grade 5 toxicity (patient death) attributable to treatment, any Grade 4 toxicity among the Hematologic, Hepatobiliary or Respiratory domains, more than 3 instances of Grade 3-4 toxicities occurring within 6 weeks of treatment will be taken into consideration. This is based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading system. Additionally, in determining the MTD, the feasibility of successfully planning and treating at a given dose level will be considered., 2 years and 3 months
Quality of life at 6 weeks post radiotherapy as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G ) is a standardized questionnaire used to measure quality of life. The questionnaire consists of 4 scales measuring 27 items in total. Categories of the 4 scales are: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. The score for each item in the scale ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 is not at all and 4 is very much. The scores from each scale are added up, and can be combined to provide a total score., 2 years and 3 months|Quality of life at 6 weeks post radiotherapy as measured by the EuroQOL Group EQ-5D-5L, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized questionnaire used to measure quality of life and health. The first section includes 5 categories: mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g. work, family), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each category contains 5 statements ranging from no problems to extreme problems, where no problems is assigned a code of 1 and extreme problems is assigned a code of 5. Participants are asked to select the statement that best describes their health that day. No score is generated, rather a 5 digit code is generated based on the response provided, which can then be combined into a data set and interpreted in a variety of ways. The second section includes a 20 cm analogue scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is the best health ever imagined and 0 is the worst health imagined. The participant will mark a score on the scale representing the state of their health on that day., 2 years and 3 months|Progression free survival post radiotherapy, Time from randomization to disease progression at any site or death., 4 years
