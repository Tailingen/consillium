"Effect of Screening Using Imaging (CT/ EUS) on Early Detection of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in Patients With New Onset Diabetes (NOD)" - A Prospective Pilot Observational Study
To assess whether EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound) can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying PDAC at an early stage in individuals who have recently been diagnosed with diabetes.

Purpose: To improve the rates of early detection of pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer that starts in the pancreas, a gland located in your abdomen. It happens when some cells in the pancreas start growing abnormally and form a cancer.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
PROCEDURE: A blood sample for CA 19-9 (cancer detection test)
Incidence of PDAC at 3 years, 3yrs
• Incidence of PDAC at baseline • Incidence of resectable PDAC at baseline • Incidence of resectable PDAC at 3 years, baseline and 3yrs
