Phase III Study of TY-9591 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (FLETEO)
To assess the efficacy and safety of TY-9591 versus Osimertinib in patients with locally advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.
NSCLC|EGFR Activating Mutation
DRUG: TY-9591|DRUG: placebo Osimertinib|DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: placebo TY-9591
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, approximately 18 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study treatment, approximately 18 months|Intracranial Overall Response Rate (iORR), iORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best intracranial response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study treatment, approximately 18 months|Intracranial Median Progression Free Survival (iPFS), iPFS is defined as time from randomization until the date of first documented intracranial disease progression or death due to any cause, approximately 18 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (PR or CR) until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause during the study treatment, approximately 18 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) , partial response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) ≥6 weeks during the study treatment, approximately 18 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) , partial response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) ≥24 weeks during the study treatment, approximately 18 months|Depth of Response (DepOR), The Depth of response was defined as the relative change in the sum of the longest diameters of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Target lesions (TLs) at the nadir compared to baseline, in the absence of new lesions (NLs) or progression of Non-target lesions (NTLs), approximately 18 months|Time To Progress (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression (excluding death), approximately 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause, From the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause or loss to follow-up, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Assessment of health-related quality of life (FACT-L), Change in FACT-L scores relative to Baseline, approximately 18 months|Safety variables, Adverse events, clinical symptoms, vital signs, ECG's, clinical laboratory safety tests, ect., Assessments performed throughout the study period|Plasma Concentrations of TY-9591, To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TY-9591, approximately 18 months|Plasma Concentrations of TY-9591-D1, To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TY-9591 metabolite D1, approximately 18 months|Plasma Concentrations of TY-9591-D2, To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TY-9591 metabolite D2, approximately 18 months
This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised study assessing the efficacy and safety of TY-9591 versus Osimertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that is known to be EGFR sensitising mutation (EGFRm) positive, treatment-naïve and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.
