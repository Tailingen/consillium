Almonertinib Therapy in Patients With Abnormal Liver Function After EGFR-TKI Treatment, or Almonertinib First-line Therapy in Patients With Basic Hepatopathy
To assess the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib therapy in patients with abnormal liver function after first/second generation EGFR-TKI treatment, or Almonertinib first-line therapy in patients with basic hepatopathy and locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.

DRUG: Almonertinib
Objective response rate, ORR is defined as the number of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR (Complete response) or PR (Partial response) according to RECIST 1.1., 24 months.
Liver Safety, Liver function indicators, including ALT, AST, TBIL, D-BIL, I-BIL, ALP, GGT, bile acid, ALB, GLB., From the screening period to 28 days after treatment completion.|Progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time from date of enrollment until the date of disease progression as assessed according to RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause on study., 24 months.|Disease control rate, Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants with disease control best overall response (complete response, partial response or stable disease)., 24 months.|Overall survival, OS is defined as time from date of enrollment until date of death due to any cause. For participants still alive at the time of analysis, OS time was censored on last date that participants were known to be alive., From baseline until death due to any cause,up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.
This is a single arm, open-lable, phase II clinical trialï¼Œaimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib therapy in EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with abnormal liver function after the first/second generation EGFR-TKI treatment or EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with basic hepatopathy and have not received any systematic treatment. The patients meet all the inclusion criterias, and do not meet any exclusion criteria can be included, the duration of patient observation is 24 months.
