To assess the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine given by fixed dose rate intravenous infusion in patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine
Proportion of patients obtaining disease control in the form of tumour response or stabilisation
Treatment related toxicity|Progression free survival
Previous lines of treatment recorded. Adjuvant and palliative.

Treatment will continue until clinical indication due to PD or toxicity, or until completion of 6 cycles of gemcitabine, whichever comes first.

All patients will be assessed for toxicity and followed up for disease recurrence/progression.

The study will be divided into two accrual stages - the first consisting of 17 patients. If 6 or more patients achieve tumour response or stabilisation in the first stage, the second stage will commence accrual of a further 20 patients. Hence, the total planned accrual will be 37 patients.
