Rarecells Molecular Biomarkers for Early Detection of Lung Cancer
Early diagnosis of lung cancer is a public health priority. Additionally, early detection of recurrences after treatment is crucial for optimizing disease management.

This study seeks to demonstrate the accuracy of the Rarecells ISET速 circulating tumor cells DNA (CTC-DNA), combined with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), for the early diagnosis of lung cancer.

Comparative and complementary in operable patients diagnosed with cancer, Number of patients with lung cancer-related mutations by CTCDNA alone, by ctDNA alone and by the ctDNA -CTCDNA pair divided by the number of patients with cancer enrolled in the study, 30 days post procedure
Comparative and complementary sensitivity of CTC-DNA and ctDNA per histological subtype, Number of patients with lung cancer-related mutations by CTCDNA alone, by ctDNA alone and by the ctDNA -CTCDNA pair per histologic subtype, 30 days post procedure
Researching for tumor biomarkers in the blood, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can non-invasively detect signs of cancer without risk to the patient. These are ideal and risk-free methods for monitoring patients and early detection of lung cancer.

This study aims to assess the sensitivity of molecular analyses performed on circulating tumor DNA in the blood and on DNA from circulating tumor cells, isolated using the highly sensitive ISET速 method. The purpose is to assess two circulating molecular biomarkers in the field of liquid biopsy in patients with lung cancer: Rarecells ISET速 CTC-DNA and ctDNA.

Subjects eligible for inclusion in the study are individuals diagnosed with operable lung cancer who will undergo biopsy or surgical resection of the tumor. Upon enrolment in the trial, participants will undergo an assessment including low-dose CT scan, isolation of CTCs by the ISET速 method, and separation of plasma for analysis of ctDNA.
