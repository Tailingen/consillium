Open-Label Study of the CDK4/6 Inhibitor SPH4336 in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Liposarcomas
Study SPH4336-US-01 is an open-label (no placebo), multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the safety, blood levels (pharmacokinetics) and preliminary anti-tumor effects of SPH4336, a selective enzyme blocker, in patients with specific types of liposarcomas (tumors expressing the target of the study drug).
Liposarcoma, Dedifferentiated
DRUG: SPH4336
Progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks, Number of total patients who are progression-free, as defined as RECIST v1.1, at 12 weeks, 12 weeks
Median PFS, Time when 50% or more patients have progressed disease (per RECIST v1.1) or died, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Best Overall Response, The best response (per RECIST v1.1) recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Time to Response, Time from start of treatment to partial or complete response per RECIST v1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Duration of Response, Time from start of treatment to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response per RECIST v1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events, The incidence of each reported adverse event (regardless of its relationship to study drug) will be tabulated and classified using MedDRA and the severity of each adverse event will be graded by the Investigator using NCI CTCAE v5.0, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Study SPH4336-US-01 is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of SPH4336 with a safety lead-in in subjects with CDK4-positive liposarcomas (dedifferentiated or well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas). SPH4336 is an orally administered, molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDK4/6 inhibitor), which acts to block the ability of cancer cells to divide and thus prevents tumors from growing. SPH4336 (tablets) will be administered orally once each day in successive 28-day cycles until demonstration of progressive disease or the development of unacceptable toxicity.

The study will incorporate a safety lead-in for the initial 10 subjects. Safety will be evaluated after 10 subjects (minimum 1 cycle completed) by a Safety Review Committee (SRC). The study will be stopped if unacceptable toxicity is observed in more than 2 subjects.

Tumor assessments according to RECIST v1.1 will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks (from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1)) for 36 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Plasma samples for pharmacokinetics will be collected in all subjects. Baseline (pretreatment) tumor tissue (archival or fresh) will be collected from all subjects to confirm histologically a liposarcoma with a dedifferentiated component and CDK4 positivity. Tumor tissue biomarkers (e.g., phospho-Rb, Ki-67) will be analyzed in the first 10 study subjects in baseline (pretreatment) and C1D15 tumor tissue samples.
