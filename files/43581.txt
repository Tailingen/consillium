HEAT Trial (HER2 Antibody Therapy With Lutetium-177)
This is a first-in-human, Phase 0/1, open-label study of177Lu-RAD202 consisting of an Imaging Period with 177Lu-RAD202im(imaging dose) and a Treatment Period with 177Lu-RAD202tr(treatment dose) to determine the recommended dose(s) for future exploration of 177Lu-RAD202 in participants with HER2 expressing advanced solid tumours.

This is a first-in-human, Phase 0/1, open-label study of 177Lu-RAD202 consisting of an Imaging Period with 177Lu-RAD202im (imaging dose) and a Treatment Period with 177Lu-RAD202tr (treatment dose) to determine the recommended dose(s) for future exploration of 177Lu-RAD202 in participants with HER2 expressing advanced solid tumours.

Screening Period: Screening period of up to 4 weeks Phase 0 (Imaging Period): Low dose 177Lu-RAD202 (starting at 10mCi) administered on Day 1 with a follow-up period of 2 weeks to assess imaging, safety and dosimetry. Following assessment of the imaging, safety and dosimetry results of the first 3 to 6 participants dosed with 177Lu-RAD202im (10mCi) the dose may be increased in subsequent participants, if needed, to improve image quality. Prior to determining the recommended dose level of 177Lu-RAD202im for future exploration, there is a minimum of 2 weeks between administration of 177Lu-RAD202im in Phase 0 and 177Lu-RAD202tr in Phase I. Following the dose determination for imaging, the timeframe can be reduced to \< 2 weeks by the Sponsor based on emergent safety and imaging quality data.

Phase I (Treatment Period): 177Lu-RAD202tr dose escalation

* Treatment Period of up to 3 cycles every 6 weeks. Extension of the planned dose intervals are possible following discussion and agreement between the Sponsor and Investigator. After the first 3 cycles, additional cycles may be evaluated following review and approval by the Sponsor and Investigator, depending on emergent safety, dosimetry, image quality, clinical activity and pharmacokinetic data.
* DLT observation period for 177Lu-RAD202tr is 6 weeks following first injection of 177Lu-RAD202tr.
* Should an alternative treatment schedule be explored, the DLT observation period for 177Lu-RAD202tr at that dose level will be the proposed cycle duration.
