Effect of Pelvic Floor Stimulation on the Pelvic Floor Function in Cervical Cancer Patients With Type III Hysterectomy
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of electric stimulation on the pelvic floor function in cervical cancer patients with type III hysterectomy.

Urination function recovery rate, From 14 days to 24 months after operation
Number of participants with recovery of defecation function and urinary function after III hysterectomy, From 14 days to 24 months after operation|Quality of life Questionnaire, From 14 days to 24 months after operation|Overall Survival, The overall survival (OS) in cervical cancer patients after 3 years' III hysterectomy after comparison of pelvic floor rehabilitation therapy and control group, From 14 days to 24 months after operation|Disease-free survival, Comparison of pelvic floor rehabilitation treatment group and control group of cervical cancer patients with type III hysterectomy 3 years disease-free survival (DFS), From 14 days to 24 months after operation
This is a prospective, multi center, open, randomized, controlled clinical trial. All cervical carcinoma patients who undergo type III hysterectomy in the hospitals involved in this study were recruited. 5-7 days postoperative, those who meet the inclusion criteria and without the exclusion criteria and sign the consent were randomized grouped of intervention and control objective by 1:1. At the same time, according to the research hospital, menopausal status (menopause vs menopause) and surgery approach (laparoscopic vs open)ï¼Œthey were further stratified randomly. Patients in the intervention group received electrical stimulation treatment based on conventional clinical nursing, while patients in control group only receive routine clinical care. Except for the treatment of electrical stimulation, other research procedures is the same in the two groups. The recovery rate of urination function, pelvic floor function and life quality of the two group is compared.
