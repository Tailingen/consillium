Percutaneous Irreversible Electroportion for Unresectable Breast Cancer
This trial is studying how well Irreversible Electroportion (IRE) therapy works in treating patients with breast cancer. IRE kills tumor cells by Electrical impulses creating nano-pore on the cell membrane and inducing target cell death.This may be an effective treatment for patients with unresectable breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: NanoKnife LEDC System
Treatment efficacy as measured by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging., 3 months post treatment to 24 months
Safety using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 criteria., 1 day post treatment to 3 weeks
Adverse Events, 1 day post surgery to 3 weeks
This is a phase I/II non-randomized exploratory study. All fully eligible and registered patients will undergo imaging by mammography, ultrasound, and breast MRI. The primary and secondary objectives of the study are described below.

OBJECTIVES

Primary

Treatment efficacy as measured by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging.

secondary

Safety using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 criteria.

To describe the adverse events associated with IRE To prospectively gather pain assessment data on cryoablation and surgical resection Explore technical variables that may affect the success of IRE
