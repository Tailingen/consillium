Study of the Capacity of the MRI Spectroscopy to Define the Tumor Area Enriched in Glioblastoma Stem Cells. Proof of Concept Study
This is a prospective biomedical study of interventional type which includes 16 patients on 52 months (24 months of inclusion and 28 months of follow up).

This pilot study, combining a metabolic imaging approach (Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy = 1HMRSI) and a biological one, will be performed in patients harbouring a Glioblastoma (GBM)to determine whether MRI markers of aggressiveness (CNI2) are associated with specific biological patterns as regards to GBMSC (GBM contains tumor stem cell).

In the first part of the study, patients with radiological criteria of GBM amenable to surgical resection will be included ; pre-operative multimodal MRI scans will be done and all data acquired (including H1MRS and DTI data) will be integrated in the image-guided surgical device (ie neuronavigation system) to be used intraoperatively. During tumor resection, tissue samples will be individualized, based on their multimodal imaging characteristics and sent to the radiobiology laboratory INSERM for biological analysis.

After surgery, patient will be treated by the standard radio-chemotherapy stupp protocol and will be followed according to standard practices; multimodal MRI will be performed every 2 months during the first year and then every 3 months until progression.
Glioblastoma
PROCEDURE: Surgery (based on preoperative multimodal MRI) followed by the standard radio-chemotherapy stupp protocol
Biologic analysis of the GBM resected samples for the capacity to form neurospheres in vitro, comparison CNI2 versus nCNI areas on the capacity to form neurospheres (yes or no) in vitro in stem cells medium up to 5 passages., 4,5 years|Biologic analysis of the GBM resected samples on the RNA expression of 5 stem cells markers, comparison CNI2 versus nCNI areas on the following criteria : scoring from 0 to 5 according to the RNA expression of 5 stem cells markers (CD133, Nestine, Sox2, Olig2 and Musashi), 4,5 years|Biologic analysis of the GBM resected samples for their capacity to form invasive brain tumor after orthotopic implantation of the cells in nude mice, 4,5 years
Time to progression, The time to progression is defined as the time from surgery until progression, 4,5 years|Overall survival, The overall survival is defined as the time from surgery until death from any cause or last of follow-up news (censored data), 4,5 years
Ancillary study of neurocognitive function, The neurocognitive function will be evaluated using the following tests:

* trail making test
* stroop color test
* line-bissection task
* Subtests of the WAISIII
* MT 86 (Joanette 1992)
* HDAE (BDAE) (Goodglass 1972)
* MEC (Joanette 2004)
* ECOSSE (Lecocq 1996) Quality of life will be evaluated using EORTC questionnaire QLQ C-30 and QLQ BN20., 4,5 years|Ancillary study of quality of life, Quality of life will be evaluated using EORTC questionnaire QLQ C-30 and QLQ BN20, 4,5 years
