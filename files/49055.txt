The Combination of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy in Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer
The study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, two-cohort, phase II clinical trial. Patients aged 18 years or older who had pelvic recurrence rectal cancer with or without resectable distant metastasis, with treatment naive disease (cohort A) or progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy (cohort B), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, will receive 25-40Gy/5Fx irradiation or 15-30Gy/5Fx reirradiation (pelvic radiation history), 18 weeks toripalimab and investigator's choice of chemotherapy +/- target therapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for all metastatic lesions between chemoimmunotherapy cycles, followed by multidisciplinary team (MDT) for decision:follow-up of complete response (CR), radical surgery, sustained treatment of non resection, or exit.

The primary endpoint was local objective response rate. Secondary endpoints were extrapelvic objective response rate, R0 resection rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety and tolerability of the treatment.

For patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC), response rate of chemoradiotherapy is 40-50% and only approximately 40-50% of patients with recurrent rectal cancer can undergo R0 resection. Recent studies have shown promising synergistic effects of the combination of immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Thus, for LRRC patients, addition of immunotherapy to CRT is likely to further improve the response rate and prognosis.
