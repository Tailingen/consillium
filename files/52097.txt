Haploidentical Transplantation With CD3/CD19 Depleted Grafts in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to study the feasibility and Toxicity of allogeneic haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation with CD3/CD19 depleted stem cells and a dose reduced conditioning.
