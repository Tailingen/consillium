Vitamin D and Head and Neck Cancer: Impact on Toxicity and Prognosis
The goal of this observational study is to learn about relation between vitamin D levels in subjects with head and neck cancer. The main question it aims to answer are:

* variation of vitamin D levels in the study population at different time points
* relation between therapy side effects and vitamin D level
* relation between disease outcome and vitamin D level Participants will be followed as per clinical practice
Head and Neck Cancer
Vitamin D variation, Difference in vitamin D levels between baseline and during radiotherapy, 7 weeks
Baseline vitamin D level and radiotherapy toxicity, Evaluation of the impact of baseline vitamin D levels on acute toxicity (mucositis, dermatitis and weight loss \>10%), 8 weeks|Baseline vitamin D level and response, Evaluation of the impact of baseline vitamin D levels on response measured in term of ORR (Objective Response Rate), 12 weeks|Baseline vitamin D level and relapse free survival, Impact of baseline vitamin D levels on relapse free survival, up to 2 years|Baseline vitamin D level and survival, Impact of baseline vitamin D levels on overall survival, up to 2 years|Variation of vitamin D level, Difference and relation between vitamin D levels at baseline and after 4 weeks, 4 weeks
There are only a few works in the literature that correlate the circulating levels of vitamin D with the prognosis or development of toxicity in treated HNSCC patients with radical intent radiation therapy. These small studies have highlighted a worse outcome and greater toxicity in patients with low vitamin D levels. The study aims to study the variations in circulating levels of vitamin D in a multicenter cohort of patients with HSNCC prospectively collected and to evaluate the impact of vitamin D levels at diagnosis on the development of toxicity and on disease outcome
