A Study Developing a Non-invasive Urine-based Proteomic Model for Early Lung Cancer Detection.
Brief Summary:

The goal of this observational study is to develop a non-invasive urine proteomic diagnostic model to improve early-stage lung cancer detection. The study aims to answer the following main questions:

Can urine proteomics reliably differentiate early-stage lung cancer from benign conditions? How does the diagnostic model compare to current clinical and imaging methods in accuracy?

Participants will:

Provide preoperative urine samples. Undergo proteomic analysis of urine samples. Have clinical, imaging, and proteomic data integrated into an AI-assisted diagnostic model.

The study will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this innovative diagnostic approach.

Prediction Accuracy of Diagnostic Models, The primary outcome measure is the accuracy of preoperative predictions (sensitivity and specificity) for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. Predictions are based on:

1. Urine proteomics in the experimental group.
2. Chest CT imaging in the control group.

Accuracy will be assessed by comparing preoperative predictions with postoperative pathological findings, including tumor histopathological subtypes, lymph node metastasis, and other pathological factors., Within 2 weeks post-surgery.
Cut-off Value for Urine Proteomics Diagnostic Test, Determination of the optimal cut-off value for urine proteomic markers to maximize diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Within 1 month after data analysis.|Comparative Performance of Diagnostic Models, Evaluation of the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve \[AUC\]) of the urine proteomic model versus chest CT imaging for predicting tumor histopathological subtypes, lymph node metastasis, and staging., Within 2 months post-surgery.|Long-term Diagnostic Effectiveness, Evaluation of the correlation between preoperative diagnostic accuracy and 2-year postoperative clinical outcomes (e.g., recurrence rates, survival outcomes)., Up to 2 years post-surgery.
Detailed Description:

This study focuses on developing a urine proteomic-based diagnostic model to improve the early detection of lung cancer. It leverages non-invasive urine sampling, proteomic analysis, and artificial intelligence to create a high-sensitivity, high-specificity diagnostic tool.

The study will recruit 480 participants with suspected early-stage lung cancer (I-IIIA, non-N2). Urine samples will be collected before surgery, and participants will undergo standard imaging and diagnostic evaluations, including chest CT, abdominal ultrasound or CT, brain MRI or CT, and bone scans.

The primary objectives of the study include:

1. Biomarker Identification: Identifying differentially expressed urine proteins associated with early-stage lung cancer.
2. Diagnostic Model Construction: Combining proteomic findings with clinical and imaging data to construct a diagnostic model using AI-based algorithms.
3. Validation: Evaluating the model's diagnostic accuracy compared to current clinical practices.

Participants will contribute to the advancement of a novel diagnostic method that aims to minimize unnecessary invasive procedures and improve lung cancer prognosis through early and accurate detection.
