IMA402 T Cell-Engaging Receptor Molecule (TCERÂ®) in Recurrent and/or Refractory Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of IMA402 in patients with recurrent and/or refractory solid tumors.

Primary objectives:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for extension for IMA402 (Phase I)
* To characterize the safety and tolerability of IMA402 (Phase I/II)
* To evaluate anti-tumor activity of IMA402 (Phase II)

Secondary objectives:

* To evaluate the initial anti-tumor activity of IMA402 (Phase I)
* To evaluate anti-tumor activity of IMA402 (Phase II)
* To describe the PK of IMA402 (Phase I/II)

Phase I: ORR based on BOR of CR and PR locally assessed using RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 37 months|Phase II: ORR based on BOR of CR and PR locally assessed using iRECIST, 40 months|Phase I/II: Disease control rate (DCR) of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) (lasting 6 or more weeks) following the initiation of IMA402 based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 40 months|Phase I/II: Duration of response (DOR) of CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 40 months|Phase I/II: Progression-free survival (PFS) based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 40 months|Phase I/II: Overall survival (OS), 40 months|Phase I/II: Determination of PK parameter: half-life (t1/2), 40 months|Phase I/II: Determination of PK parameter: minimal serum concentration (Cmin), 40 months|Phase I/II: Determination of PK parameter: maximal serum concentration (Cmax), 40 months|Phase I/II: Determination of PK parameter: area under the curve (AUC), 40 months
The study will be conducted in two phases:

* Phase Ia: Dose escalation/de-escalation
* Phase Ib: Dose extension
* Phase II: Dose extension in selected Indication-specific extension cohort(s) (ISEC)
