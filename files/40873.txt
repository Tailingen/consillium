Randomized Study of Maintenance Therapy With MGN1703 in Patients With SCLC
Evaluation of efficacy and safety of MGN1703 administered twice weekly subcutaneously (SC) as maintenance treatment in patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who achieved at least a partial response (PR) following platinum-based first-line therapy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: MGN1703|OTHER: Standard of care
Overall survival (OS), The primary efficacy endpoint is the OS which is defined as the time interval starting with the randomization and lasting until death (=event) or until the date of last information available from the patient., 24 months
OS1, The secondary efficacy endpoint OS1 is defined as the time interval starting at the first cycle of induction therapy and lasting until death (=event) or until the date of last information available from the patient.

OS1 will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier estimates. The comparison between the treatment groups will be performed using the log-rank test with a significance level of Î± = 2.5% for the 1-sided test. The OS1 will be presented as Kaplan-Meier figures also., 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS) PFS from the start of the first cycle of induction therapy (PFS1) ass, Progression-free survival is the time after randomization to either disease progression (PD), measured using RECIST 1.1 and irRC criteria and confirmed via centralized review or death, 24 months
