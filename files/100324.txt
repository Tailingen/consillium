Study of Ixabepilone in Asian Subjects With Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study was to determine whether ixabepilone is effective in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer in Asian participants.
Stomach Neoplasms
DRUG: Ixabepilone
Percentage of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to modified RECIST, as determined by investigator. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. In case of lymph node, the lesions short axis of all nodes measuring \<10 mm. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. CR and PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks after initial assessment. A 2-sided confidence interval (CI) was computed using Clopper-Pearson method., During treatment, assessed every 6 weeks (± 1 week) starting from the 1st dose of therapy until disease progression, or development of intolerable toxicity, for a maximum of 8 cycles (maximum time that any participant was on therapy was 30 weeks)
Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the time in weeks from the first dose of study therapy until measurement criteria are first met for PR or CR (whichever status is recorded first). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. In case of lymph node lesions, the short axis of all nodes should measure \<10 mm. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the LD of all target lesions. CR and PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks of initial assessment., Assessed every 6 weeks (± 1 week) starting from the first dose of study therapy until CR or PR (up to 12.1 weeks.)|Duration of Response, Defined as the period in months from the time measurement criteria are first met for PR or CR until the first date of documented PD or death. Refer to outcome measure 1 for CR and PR. PD=≥20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm of tumor size in reference to the smallest sum LD recorded at or following baseline or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Estimated by Kaplan-Meier product limit method and a 2-sided 95% CI for median duration was computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method., From the date of first PR or CR assessment to the date of progression, death, or last tumor assessment (maximum: 4.1 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS=the time interval from date of randomization to the earliest (first) progression or date of death. Participants who progressed or died were counted as events. PD=≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions and an absolute increase ≥5 mm in tumor size in reference to the smallest sum LD recorded at or following baseline or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method for all treated participants and a 2-sided 95% CI for the median PFS was computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method)., From the date of initiation of study therapy to the date of progression (up to 8.1 months).|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control Rate, Defined as percentage of participants whose best response was PR, CR, or SD as determined by the investigator. SD=Neither PR or PD are met, taking the smallest sum of the LD recorded at baseline as reference. Refer to outcome measure 1 for definition of CR or PR and refer to outcome measure 4 for definition of PD. A 2-sided 95% CI was computed using Clopper-Pearson method., During treatment, assessed every 6 weeks (± 1 week) starting from the 1st dose of therapy until disease progression, or development of intolerable toxicity, for a maximum of 8 cycles (maximum time that any participant was on therapy was 30 weeks)|Number of Participants With Death as Outcome, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs), and AEs Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy Per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0, AE: New untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not have causal relationship with this treatment. SAE: Untoward medical event that at any dose: results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, drug dependency/abuse; life-threatening, an important medical event, a congenital anomaly/birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization/prolongs existing hospitalization. Grade (GR) 3=Severe; and GR4=Life-threatening or disabling. DR=Drug-related. Any Peripheral Neuropathy includes peripheral sensory and motor neuropathies, including muscle weakness, and hypoaesthesia., Assessed from the date of first dose until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Median time on ixapebilone therapy was 10.5 weeks (range: 3 to 30 weeks)|Number of Participants With Hematology Abnormalities, Grading: NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0.

Number of Participants With Best Response as Assessed With Modified RECIST, Best overall response that any participant can have is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since the start of treatment as reference). PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the LD of all target lesions. PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks. Stable disease (SD)=Neither PR or progressive disease (PD) are met, taking the smallest sum of the LD recorded at baseline as reference.
