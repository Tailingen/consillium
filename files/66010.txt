Patient-Centered Intervention to Reduce Cancer Patients' Financial Toxicity
The purpose of this study is to incorporate feedback from cancer patients and providers to adapt, implement, and test an intervention. The intervention aims to prompt screening for financial distress, facilitate discussions about care costs with cancer patients, support health insurance selection, and ultimately reduce cancer patients' financial toxicity associated with cancer care.
