Reproducibility and Repeatability of Multifunctional MRI Biomarkers of the Body
Advanced MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technique called DCE (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced) and DWI MRI can provide valuable information regarding tumor biology and response to treatment through various parameters. Validating stability of these parameters will further establish robustness and reliability of these promising biomarkers.
