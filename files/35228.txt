Evaluating Gardasil HPV Vaccine Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in People With and Without HIV
This is a phase 2, open-label study to assess the immunogenicity of the 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) recombinant vaccine (Gardasil9) in people born male with current or past exposure to androgen blockers or estrogen (BM-EABE). Investigators will enroll BM-EABE with HIV and HIV negative controls (BM-EABE or men who have sex with a person with a penis (MSPP)) and administer Gardasil9 at timepoints Day 0, Month 2, and Month 6. The immune response to the vaccine will be analyzed at Month 7 (1 month following the final vaccine dose).

The proportion of proliferating T- cells, expressing activation-induced markers (AIM+) and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secreting T-cells will be evaluated by flow-cytometric assays; in addition the expression of exhaustion markers, perforin/granzyme B and skin- and gut-homing receptors, as well as the transcriptional analysis of T cells proliferating upon HPV antigenic stimulation will be assessed. This response will be assessed in HIV positive BM-EABE and HIV negative controls (BM-EABE and BM without EABE)., 7 months post 1st vaccine dose|Compare systemic HPV T-cell immune response to Gardasil9 between HIV positive BM-EABE and HIV negative controls., The proportion of proliferating T- cells, expressing activation-induced markers (AIM+) and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secreting T-cells, the expression of exhaustion markers, perforin/granzyme B and skin- and gut-homing receptors and the transcriptional analysis of T cells proliferating upon HPV antigenic stimulation will be compared between: HIV positive BM-EABE and HIV negative controls; BM-EABE and BM without EABE, 7 months post 1st vaccine dose|Compare systemic HPV T-cell immune response to Gardasil9 between BM-EABE (regardless of HIV status) and BM without EABE., The proportion of proliferating T- cells, expressing activation-induced markers (AIM+) and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secreting T-cells, the expression of exhaustion markers, perforin/granzyme B and skin- and gut-homing receptors and the transcriptional analysis of T cells proliferating upon HPV antigenic stimulation will be compared in BM-EABE and BM without EABE., 7 months post 1st vaccine dose|Evaluate the impact of HPV vaccination on HIV reservoir in CD4 T cells of BM-EABE with HIV., Distribution and density of mucosal immune cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B/plasma cells, Dendritic/Langerhans cells, Natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages) as seen on confocal microscopy from anal biopsies from HIV positive BM-EABE and HIV negative controls before Gardasil vaccination.

This will be a phase 2, open-label study to assess the humoral and cellular immune response to the FDA-approved 9-valent HPV recombinant vaccine in people born male with current or past exposure to androgen blockers or estrogen (BM-EABE). At baseline, BM-EABE with HIV, HIV negative controls (BM-EABE or men who have sex with a person with a penis (MSPP)) will provide blood samples and anal swabs for evaluation of HPV immunity, anal HPV and anal dysplasia. All participants will undergo a 3-dose vaccine series of the Gardasil vaccine (at Day 0, Month 2 and Month 6). Participants will then return one month after completion of third vaccine (Month 7) to provide repeat blood samples and anal swabs. Samples will be compared pre and post vaccination and in-between participants based on HIV and exposure to androgen blockers or estrogen (EABE).

Any participant with human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and/or anal dysplasia on anal cytology at any point will be referred to high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) for clinical management. Anal biopsies will be procured from different pathology laboratories - after clinical evaluation has been complete - for research analysis, including confocal microscopy. Those who had anal dysplasia at study entry will undergo repeat HRA, as clinically indicated, and will have an optional study visit following their repeat HRA to provide blood draw and anal swabs.
