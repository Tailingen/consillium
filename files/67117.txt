A Phase I Study of HS-10386 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS-10386 in participants with advanced solid tumors who have failed prior treatments.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HS-10386
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Applicable Dose (MAD) (Dose Escalation Phase), MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 2 or more patients exhibit dose limiting toxicity. MAD is defined as the maximum administered dose, when MTD is not reached., Up to 21 days from the first dose|Objective Response Rate (ORR) defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) (Dose Expansion Phase), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months.
Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), The number and percentage of patients that experience an AE. The severity of AEs are assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0., From Informed consent until the end of the follow-up period which is defined as 28 days (+7 days) after study treatment is discontinued.|Cmax of HS-10386, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed plasma or serum concentration., Approximately 1 month.|Tmax of HS-10386, Tmax is defined as the time to maximum concentration., Approximately 1 month.|λz of HS-10386, λz is defined as the apparent terminal-phase disposition rate constant., Approximately 1 month.|t1/2 of HS-10386, t1/2 is defined as the apparent terminal-phase disposition half-life., Approximately 1 month.|AUC0-t of HS-10386, AUC0-t is defined as the area under the plasma or serum concentration-time curve from time = 0 to the last measurable concentration at time = t., Approximately 1 month|CL/F of HS-10386, CL/F is defined as the apparent oral dose clearance., Approximately 1 month.|ORR defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) (Dose Escalation Phase), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months.|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from random assignment (dose expansion stage) or first dose (dose escalation stage) to PD or death from any cause., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months.|Overall Survival (OS) (Dose Expansion Phase), OS is deﬁned as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., From the time of randomization to death due to any cause, approximately 3 years.|The correlation between PD-L1 expression and efficacy of HS-10386, The study will collect tumor tissue samples during screening period and after the treatment. Stratified analysis of the efficacy endpoint of HS-10386 (such as object response, DoR, PFS, etc.) by PD-L1 expression level will be performed to assess the correlation between PD-L1 expression as biomarker and study dose and effeicacy of HS-10386., Approximately 3 years.
This is a phase I open label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS-10386 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
