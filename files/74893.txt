This is a longitudinal, one arm, prospective phase II study, designed to evaluate the efficacy of Olanzapine Netupitant and Palonosetron in the controll of nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
Nausea Post Chemotherapy
DRUG: Olanzapine|DRUG: Netupitant|DRUG: Palonesetron
Nausea Complete Response Rate, Defined as no nausea and no rescue medication, 5 days after chemotherapeutic administration
Complete Emesis Control, Defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue medications, For the following time periods: 0-24 hours (acute), 24+ to 120 hours (delayed), and 0-120 hours (overall)|Complete Control, Defined as no nausea, no emesis and no rescue medication, For the following time periods: 0-24 hours (acute), 24+ to 120 hours (delayed), and 0-120 hours (overall)
The population of the study is women diagnosed with breast cancer, who will start chemotherapy (Doxorubicine and Cyclophosfamide). We will evaluate the control of nausea and vomiting in the first cycle of chemotherapy, utilizing Netupitant (300mg) + palonosetron (0,56mg) in day 1 and Olanzapine 5mg starting on Day 0, given once a day for five days. The primary endpoint of this study is complete response rate (no nausea, no emesis no use of rescue medication).
