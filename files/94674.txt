The Effect of Perioperative Lidocaine Infusion on Neutrophil Extracellular Trapping
This study will be done to investigate perioperative lidocaine infusion on neutrophil extracellular trapping in the patients undergoing the robot-assisted prostatectomy.

DRUG: lidocaine group|DRUG: control group
Concentration of citrullinated histone3, This will be obtained using ELISA., 24 hours after surgery
Concentration of meyloperoxidase, This will be obtained using ELISA., 24 hours after surgery|Concentration of neutrophil elastase, This will be obtained using ELISA., 24 hours after surgery
the severity of postoperative pain using NRS, This will be measured using NRS (numeric rating scale; 0=no pain, 10=the worst pain), during postoperative 24 hours
