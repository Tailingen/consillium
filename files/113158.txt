UCSF PANC Cyst Registry
Pancreatic cysts are found incidentally on 15-50% of CT and MRIs for all indications and their prevalence is increasing. Many of these cysts may be precursors to pancreatic cancer, and thus pose a substantial risk, however, the vast majority are benign. Increased detection of pancreatic cysts provides an opportunity to diagnose pancreatic malignancy at an early, curable stage yet also increases the potential to over-treat clinically insignificant lesions. This presents a clinical challenge to prevent unnecessary resection of indolent disease, with associated risks of infections, bleeding, diabetes, and costly disability. Unfortunately, there is little information on the epidemiology and natural history of pancreatic cysts to help guide management.

OTHER: Survey
Cancer, While not the primary outcome measure, the development of cancer from a pancreatic cyst is a critically important study endpoint, which the investigators do not expect to be frequent occurrence., 1-10 years|Indolency, If a patient with a pancreatic cyst experiences no or minimal change in size, and no development of worrisome or high-risk stigmata (Tanaka 2017), this will be considered to be an indolent lesion. Most patients will fall under this category., 1-10 years
This study develops a large, prospectively managed, electronic, patient-directed pancreatic cyst registry based at UCSF. The UCSF Pancreatic Cystic Lesions Registry (PANC Cyst) will facilitate work to improve clinical care and understanding of pancreatic cysts by prospective follow-up of patients with cystic lesions, especially the diagnostically challenging small cysts, to identify factors related to cyst formation and progression to malignancy. Longitudinal data capture that includes clinical outcomes will also enable us to more precisely define anatomic, radiographic and biomarker information that can be used to differentiate populations of patients for whom surgery is indicated, surveillance is warranted, or no further evaluation is necessary.
