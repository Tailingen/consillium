A Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of TAK-228 in Combination With TAK-117 in Adult Participants With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and dosing schedules of oral TAK-228+TAK-117. It also evaluated the single- and multiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-228+TAK-117 in participants with advanced nonhematologic malignancies.
Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies
DRUG: TAK-228|DRUG: TAK-117
Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above-mentioned criteria., From Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 68 weeks)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|AUClast: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Observed Quantifiable Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (T1/2) After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|CL/F: Apparent Clearance After Extravascular Administration, Calculated Using the Observed Value of the Last Quantifiable Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|RAC: Accumulation Ratio for TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Accumulation ratio was based on AUC(0-24) between Cycle 1 Day 24 and Cycle 1 Day 1 (e.g. AUC(0-24) \[Cycle 1 Day 24\]/ AUC(0-24) \[Cycle1 Day 1\]., Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Peak to Trough Ratio for TAK-228 After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-228 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-117 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-117 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|AUClast: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Observed Quantifiable Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-117 in Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (T1/2) After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-117 in Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|CL/F: Apparent Clearance After Extravascular Administration, Calculated Using the Observed Value of the Last Quantifiable Concentration After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-117 in Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|RAC: Accumulation Ratio for TAK-117 in the Dose Escalation Cohort, Accumulation ratio was based on AUC(0-24) between Cycle 1 Day 24 and Cycle 1 Day 1 (e.g. AUC(0-24) \[Cycle 1 Day 24\]/ AUC(0-24) \[Cycle1 Day 1\]., Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Peak to Trough Ratio After Single-dose and Multiple-dose of TAK-117 in Dose Escalation Cohort, Cycle 1: Days 1 and 24 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) postdose|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for TAK-228 in DDI Expansion Cohort, Cycle 1, Day 3 predose and at multiple timepoints (up to 8 hours) postdose;

Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator's Assessment According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, ORR defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., Baseline, Days 22 up to Day 28 of Cycle and every even-numbered cycle until disease progression or EOS (Up to approximately 68 weeks)|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response of CR/PR to the first documented progressive disease (PD), or censored at the last response assessment date that is SD or better for a participant that has not progressed. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and for non-target lesions, the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined of at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and for non-target lesions., Baseline, Days 22 up to Day 28 of Cycle and every even-numbered cycle until disease progression or EOS (Up to approximately 68 weeks)
The drug being tested in this study was TAK-228. TAK-228 was tested to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, of TAK-228 in combination with TAK-117 when administered to adult participants with advanced nonhematologic malignancies.

The study enrolled 101 patients. The study consisted of 2 phases: an escalation stage followed by an expansion stage. Participants in escalation stage were assigned to the following treatment arms:

* Dose escalation treatment arm A: TAK-228 2 or 4 mg capsule
* Dose escalation treatment arm B: TAK-228 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg capsule
* Dose escalation treatment arm C: TAK-228 3 mg capsule

Upon completion of the escalation stage, 1 combination treatment regimen was selected for further safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and mutual drug-drug interaction characterization in the expansion stage. During treatment, participants in both stages received TAK-228 and TAK-117 capsules at prespecified doses in repeated 28-day cycles.

This multi-center trial conducted in the United States, United Kingdom and Spain. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 68 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and a final visit after 30 days after last dose of study drug.
