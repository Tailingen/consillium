LCI-SAR-BSTS-CTDNA-001: Circulating Tumor DNA Liquid Biopsy in Sarcoma Patients
The purpose of this research study is to see how well Low Pass Whole Genome Sequencing (LP-WGS) can detect circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) in the blood of participants who have bone or soft tissue sarcoma (type of cancer).
Sarcoma
OTHER: Non-Metastatic and Resectable|OTHER: Metastatic and Un-resectable|OTHER: No evidence of disease, under surveillance|OTHER: ALT or WDLS
Number of participants with ctDNA detected, A binary variable indicating whether or not ctDNA was detected by low pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) in the sample., Approximately 24 months
Quantity of ctDNA detected, A longitudinal continuous variable indicating the quantitative levels of ctDNA in the sample as measured by LP-WGS. Timepoints include pre-treatment, at disease evaluations during treatment, post-treatment, at remission/complete response (if applicable), during surveillance (if applicable), and at recurrence/progression (if applicable), Approximately 24 months
In this ever-expanding age of precision oncology, the stagnant treatment algorithms and subsequent oncologic outcomes for sarcoma patients highlight the need for novel technologies to help clinicians treat these patients. While countless prognostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers have been identified for many other cancers, sarcoma practitioners have strikingly few tumor markers to guide treatment. The development of a sarcoma-specific liquid biopsy could greatly help clinicians with diagnosis, prognostication, treatment response, minimal recurrent disease, and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate ctDNA liquid biopsy approaches in adult and pediatric patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.
