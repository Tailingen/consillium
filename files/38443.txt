Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) in Cervical Cancer
This study collects blood samples to determine if the DNA of HPV that causes cervical cancer can be detected in patients with cervical cancer that is new (primary), has come back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and are undergoing treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Researchers may use this information to predict response (good or bad) of the cervical cancer to treatment and detect recurrent cancer sooner.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection
Proportion of patients with undetectable circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) posttreatment in patients with detectable ctDNA pre-treatment, The proportion will be reported along with the exact 95% binomial confidence interval. Additionally will report the mean standard deviation and median interquartile range ctDNA post-treatment in these patients., At 6 weeks post-surgery (cohort 1), at 4-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and radiation (cohort 2), 4-6 weeks post End of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (cohort 3), at 8 weeks after start of chemotherapy or immunotherapy (cohort 4)
ctDNA levels, Will be associated with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and assessed using linear regression, reporting the correlation as well as the model estimates., Baseline|Clinical tumor response, Will be assessed for association with baseline and post-treatment ctDNA using logistic regression. Depending on the number of tumor response, or non-response patients whichever is fewer, multiple variable models may be considered including additional relevant baseline covariates such as disease stage., At post-treatment assessment, assessed up to 2 years|Radiographic tumor response, Will be assessed for association with baseline and post-treatment ctDNA using logistic regression. Depending on the number of tumor response, or non-response patients whichever is fewer, multiple variable models may be considered including additional relevant baseline covariates such as disease stage., At post-treatment assessment, assessed up to 2 years|Recurrence-free survival, Baseline ctDNA and ctDNA at measured time points will be considered in Cox models., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, Baseline ctDNA and ctDNA at measured time points will be considered in Cox models. ctDNA other than at baseline will be considered in these models as a time dependent covariate. Depending on the number of events, multiple variable models may be considered including additional relevant baseline covariates such as disease stage., Up to 2 years|ctDNA clearance kinetics, Will be correlated with recurrence-free survival. ctDNA other than at baseline will be considered in these models as a time dependent covariate. Depending on the number of events, multiple variable models may be considered including additional relevant baseline covariates such as disease stage., Up to 2 years|ctDNA conversion, Will be correlated during the active monitoring phase with recurrence-free survival., Up to 2 years
