F511 Cream in Preventing Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia in Patients Receiving Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome for Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: F511 cream may prevent or reduce palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in women receiving doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome for metastatic breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying F511 cream to see how well it works compared with a placebo cream in preventing palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in patients receiving doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome for metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Palmar-plantar Erythrodysesthesia
DRUG: antiperspirant cream F511|DRUG: pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE, hand-foot syndrome, HFS) grade ≥ 2, Until PPE grade ≥2
Patient-reported outcome, Until PPE grade ≥2|Adverse skin reaction to local therapy, Until PPE grade ≥2|Extent of symptom relief, Until PPE grade ≥2|Recurrence of PPE grade ≥ 2, Until PPE grade ≥2
OBJECTIVES:

* Evaluate the effects of F511 cream on the occurrence of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride according to local practice on 1, 2, or 4 weeks course schedules with at least 10 mg/m\^2 per week allowed.

Patients apply F511 cream on one side, hand and foot and the corresponding placebo on the other side hand and foot once daily (the morning) during the first week of the first pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment only, then once daily, three times per week thereafter. Treatment continues throughout chemotherapy administration in the absence of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) ≥ grade 2

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days. Patients with PPE ≥ grade 2 are followed until the PPE resolves to ≤ grade 1.
