This study is a retrospective real-world study. The diagnosis and treatment of patients, disease management, and information collection are completely dependent on the daily medical practice. In this study, we plan to select 5 to 8 hospitals nationwide to collect the clinical data of LASCCHN patients who received chemoradiotherapy combined with or without nimotuzumab from January 2015 to December 2018. Patients included in the study will be followed up for survival. The main endpoint is 3-year overall survival (OS) rate; the secondary endpoint are 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 3-year Local-regional control (LRC) rate, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety.
