Dose-Reduced Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation After Autologous High-Dose Chemotherapy in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a autologous stem cell transplantation followed by a Melphalan/ Fludarabine based dose-reduced allograft from HLA-identical and HLA-compatible unrelated donor in patients with Multiple Myeloma. In those with non complete remission DLI and/ or new agents such as Bortezomib, Thalidomid or Lenalidomide can be used to upgrade remission.
Multiple Myeloma|Stem Cell Transplantation
PROCEDURE: allogeneic hematopoietic SCT
Safety and efficacy of a conditioning regimen with Fludarabine, Melphalan and ATG prior allogeneic SCT after high dose chemotheraoie and autologous SCT. Evaluation of underlying disease and donor-recipient-chimerism.
Evaluation of engraftment of leucocytes and platelets|Evaluation of incidence of acute and chronic GvHD|Evaluation of infectious complications|Evaluation of the effects of DLI in case of no CR|Evaluation of disease-free and overall survival
