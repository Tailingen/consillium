A Clinical Study on LM103 for the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerance, immune response, and initial efficacy of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte LM103 injection in advanced solid tumor patients . The research treatment includes fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) infusion, and IL-2 therapy.
