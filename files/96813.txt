Carcinosarcoma, Ovarian|Carcinosarcomas Uterine
DRUG: Trabectedin
Objective response rate (ORR), The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the activity of trabectedin in terms of the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced uterine and ovarian carcinosarcoma., three years
Duration of response, three years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), the diagnosis of progression will be assessed by radiological criteria; CA 125 increases alone (GCIG criteria of progression) will not be considered as progression of disease without a radiological confirmation of progression, three years|Overall Survival (OS), three years|Adverse events, Incidence of adverse events, according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) v 4.03., three years
This is a Phase II, multi-centre, single arm study aiming at evaluating efficacy and toxicity of Trabectedin in a population of advanced or recurrent ovarian and uterine carcinosarcoma.
