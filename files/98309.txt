Safety and Efficacy Study of TX103 CAR-T Cell Therapy for Recurrent or Progressive Grade 4 Glioma.
This is a phase I, open-Label, single/multiple dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of anti-B7-H3 CAR-T cell injection (TX103) in subjects with recurrent or progressive Grade 4 Glioma.The study also plan to explore the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of the CAR-T cell therapy.
High-grade Glioma|WHO Grade Ⅳ Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-B7-H3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (CAR-T Cell) Injection/TX103

Eligible subjects will be enrolled into two sequential dose-escalating cohorts (i.e., A and B), and will be administrated TX103. Cohort A will receive TX103 exclusively through intraventricular (ICV) delivery, while cohort B will undergo dual intracavitary (ICT) and ICV delivery. Patients in each individual cohort will receive two TX103 infusions on Day 1 and 8 respectively, followed by a 14-day observation period in a 21-day treatment cycle.

Three escalating dosage levels are planned for each cohort. Both Cohorts A and B will adopt the traditional 3+3 dose escalation design with each dose level enrolled with 3 to 6 patients. The starting dose will be 6 × 10\^7 CAR+ T cells (i.e., Dose Level 1, DL1). Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed during the first cycle .
