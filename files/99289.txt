Advanced Diffusion Imaging in Renal Cancer Patients
The objective of this study is to apply advanced diffusion imaging in a two-pronged assessment of renal mass patients: (1) characterization of lesion malignancy and subtype, and (2) prediction of renal function stability or decline following partial nephrectomy.
Renal Cancer
DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan|DRUG: Tc-99m Pentetate
Percentage of Times Lesion Type is Correctly Predicted using IVIM-MRI at Pre-Surgery, Intravoxel incoherent imaging-MRI (IVIM-MRI) data will be used to predict lesion type., Baseline (1 Week Prior to Operation)
Percentage of Times Post-Surgical Renal Function is Correctly Predicted Using REFMAP-MRI at Pre-Surgery, Results from the Renal Flow and Microstructure AnisotroPy-MRI (REFMAP-MRI) pre-surgical scan will be considered as predictors for either stability in renal function or incremental decline in renal function following surgery that would lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by mGFR values and proteinuria status at follow-up.

Post-surgical renal insult will be assessed based on either mGFR decline by over 2 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year or the appearance of proteinuria., Up to Year 1 Post-Operation
