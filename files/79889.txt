Radiotherapy + Sintilimab + Bevacizumab Biosimilar for uHCC With PVTT
This study was a prospective, single-arm, single-center, phase II exploratory clinical study. To investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with sintilimab and bevacizumab biosimilar in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: radiotherapy combined with sintilimab and bevacizumab biosimilar
Objective Response rate, assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST Version 1.1, undergoing enhanced CT/MRI, up to 2 years from enrollment
Objective Response rate, assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria, assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, undergoing enhanced CT/MRI, up to 2 years from enrollment|overall survival, the time from enrollment until death or the last follow-up, up to 2 years from enrollment|number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, up to 2 years from enrollment
After signing informed consent, patients received sintilimab 200 mg intravenously on the first day of each cycle, Q3W; Bevacizumab biosimilar 7.5mg/kg was administered intravenously on the first day of each cycle, Q3W; Concurrent radiotherapy (single dose 3-8Gy, times 3-10, total dose 20-50Gy; The duration of radiotherapy was completed between the first administration of sintilimab and the second administration of bevacizumab, but it should be noted that the interval between before and after the administration of sintilimab and bevacizumab was at least 3 days.

Patients will be performed enhanced CT/MRI every 2 months, to access the efficiency according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, undergoing enhanced CT/MRI. The overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time from enrollment until death or the last follow-up. Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 to access the safety.
