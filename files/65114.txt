Tecemotide (L-BLP25) in Rectal Cancer
The objective of this mechanistic study is to determine the impact of tecemotide (L-BLP25) administration on the mucinous glycoprotein 1 - (MUC1) specific immune response in subjects with newly diagnosed rectal cancer who are eligible for neoadjuvant therapy.

Tecemotide (L-BLP25) is designed to induce an immune response that may lead to immune rejection of tumor tissues that aberrantly express MUC1 antigen. MUC1 is highly expressed in all colorectal cancers and since the adaptive immune system plays a role in the prognosis of rectal cancer, it is reasonable to speculate that tecemotide (L-BLP25) administration might boost the tumor-specific immune response and increase the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
Rectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Tecemotide (L-BLP25)|DRUG: cyclophosphamide (CPA)|OTHER: Chemoradiotherapy
Change From Baseline in Tumor Immune Response Evaluated by Immunohistochemical (IHC) Analysis of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) at Week 14 (Post-surgery), Tumor biopsy samples were collected prior to baseline and after the surgery. The TILs were evaluated in 3 of the most abundant high-power fields (x40) per sample and the mean value considered (after excluding the lowest and the highest value). The tumor immune response was calculated as number of TILs divided by 100 tumor cells., Baseline and Week 14 (post-surgery)|Immunological Response to Treatment in Relation to Microsatellite Instability (MSI) Status: Number of Subjects Per MSI Category, A potential association between MSI status (present or absent) and the primary endpoints (difference from baseline to surgery in CD8+ and CD8+/GrB+ T cell infiltration) was evaluated. Determination of mismatch repair protein (MRP)-expression (hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6 and hPMS2) was performed for the detection of the MSI-H-phenotype by IHC and/or on tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample using 5 microsatellite markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27)., 18 weeks|Change From Baseline in Interferon (IFN)-Gamma Secretion of Mononuclear Cells in Response to MUC1 by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISpot) at Post-baseline, IFN-gamma secretion of mononuclear cells in response to MUC1 was to be measured by ELISpot. The maximal post-baseline value out of Week 5, Week 11-13 (pre-surgery), and Week 16-18 (follow-up / end-of trial) was evaluated in comparison to Baseline., Baseline, Week 5, Week 13 (pre-surgery), and Week 18 (end-of trial)|Change From Baseline in IFN-gamma Secretion of Mononuclear Cells in Response to Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) by ELISpot at Post-baseline, IFN-gamma secretion of mononuclear cells in response to CEA was to be measured by ELISpot. The maximal post-baseline value out of Week 5, Week 11-13 (pre-surgery), and Week 16-18 (follow-up / end-of trial) was evaluated in comparison to Baseline., Baseline, Week 5, Week 13 (pre-surgery), and Week 18 (end-of trial)
Change From Baseline in Peritumoral Immune Response at Week 14 (Post-surgery), Immunological changes in the tumor microenvironment were evaluated based on IHC expression of CD3+, CD4+, and Ki67+CD3+ T cells; regulatory T cells (FOXP3+) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD33+CD14-); other immune cells such as NK cells (CD3-CD57+), B cells (CD20+), macrophages (CD68+), and dendritic cells (S100+). Peritumoral immune response was calculated as number of lymphoid cells at the margin of the tumor or in the tumor bed (if there is complete pathological response)., Baseline and Week 14 (post-surgery)|Change From Baseline in Immunological Response in Peripheral Blood at Week 18 (Follow-up / end-of Trial), Immunological changes in peripheral blood were evaluated based on fluorescence analysis cell sorter phenotypic characterization of T cells (CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+) and of markers of activation and proliferation (CD27, BTLA); and regulatory cells such as CD3+CD4+ (or CD8+) CD45RA+CD25+FoxP3+CD127 T cells. Immunological Response in peripheral blood was measured on a continuous scale., Baseline and Week 18 (follow-up / end-of trial)
