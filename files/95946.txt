This first-in-human study will consist of two parts: Part A and Part B.

Part A will characterize the safety and tolerability of JZP815, assess pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, and determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be further investigated in the Expansion phase (Part B).

Part B will further investigate the RP2D determined in Part A, and assess antitumor activity in various subsets of disease (based on mutation and/or tumor type) in which the mechanism of action of JZP815 is applicable.
