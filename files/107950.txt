Systemic Antitumor Treatment with or Without Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy for Colon Peritoneal Metastases (PIPOX02)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) significantly improve the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer.

Researchers will compare 2 strategies, systemic treatments (chemotherapy + targeted therapy) corresponding to standard treatment with or without intraperitoneal oxaliplatin (PIPAC) to see if PIPAC improve the progression-free survival.

Participants will:

* receive a standard treatment every 2 weeks for 12 cycles of intravenous FOLFIRI or FOLFIRINOX + targeted systemic therapy (anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF) in the both arms.
* receive up to a maximum of 4 PIPAC every 6 weeks with pressurized aerosol containing oxaliplatin in experimental arm.
* receive a maintenance treatment until progression or until the onset of severe toxicity after 12 cycles.
* be asked to perform a CT scan and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay every 8 weeks until progression

Progression free survival (PFS) between the two groups, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time (in months) from randomisation until the date of progression or death from any cause., From randomisation to 18 months after last patient randomisation
Overall survival (OS) between the two groups, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time between randomisation and death from any cause, From randomisation to 18 months after last patient randomisation|EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Quality of life between the two groups evaluated by the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, At enrollment, week 16 and week 32 after the start of treatment|EORTC QLQ-CR29 questionnaire, Quality of life between the two groups evaluated by the scores of EORTC QLQ-CR29 questionnaire, At enrollment, week 16 and week 32 after the start of treatment|Peritoneal progression free survival (PPFS) between the two groups, Peritoneal progression free survival defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of peritoneal progression or death from any cause., From randomisation to 18 months after last patient randomisation|Obstruction-free survival (OFS) between the two groups, Obstruction-free survival is defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the appearance of gastrointestinal obstruction requiring medication with high dose of corticosteroÃ¯d (\> 1mg/kg) or intervention as nasogastric decompression, intraluminal stenting, surgical bypass, or decompression stomy (gastrostomy or ileo/colostomy) or death., From randomisation to 18 months after last patient randomisation|Histological tumor response, Peritoneal regression grading score (PRGS) on biopsies performed at surgical exploration in both groups, and systematically during 1st and 2nd PIPAC procedure., At the end of the 12th course of treatment (week 24)
