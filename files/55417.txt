Twenty Years' Experience in Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection for Testicular Cancer in a Tertiary Referral Center
The aim of this study is to evaluate the oncologic and functional outcomes of RPLND as primary treatment (stage I and IIA-IIB with negative markers) or of residual masses after chemotherapy (PC-RPLND) in the treatment of patients with seminomatous and non-seminomatous.

In order to evaluate the role and theÍ›clinical impact of different surgical techniques of RPLND will be included patients treated with open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted techniques
Testicular Cancer
Overall Survival (OS) and Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), To evaluate oncological outcomes, namely Overall Survival (OS) and Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), of O-RPLND, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Intraoperative and postoperative complications, To describe intraoperative and postoperative complications, including ejaculatory disorders., up to 3 months
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the oncologic and functional outcomes of RPLND as primary treatment or residual masses after chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumors.

In order to evaluate the role and clinical impact of different surgical techniques of RPLND will be included patients treated with open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted techniques.

The study will be divided into two phases (a prospective and a retrospective phase):

* Phase 1 prospective is characterized by a multicenter prospective observational study international in which patients, competitively enrolled, undergo RPLND with open, laparoscopic or robot-assisted performed according to standard clinical practice from September 1, 2021 to October 31, 2026 and with 5-year follow-up.
* Retrospective Phase 2 is characterized by a multicenter retrospective international study involving the selection of patients who have already undergone RPLND, from January 2000 to December 2020 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and data available from medical records, institutional databases, outpatient referrals or follow-up phone calls
