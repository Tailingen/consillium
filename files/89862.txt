Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Head and Neck Cancer or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase I trial is studying the side effects of gefitinib in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. Gefitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients ages 75 years or older and 50 years and younger with metastatic or unresectable head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer, to a structured pilot study that includes pharmacokinetic sampling in a special patient population.

II. To preliminarily compare the ZD-1839 peak concentration level, elimination half-life and steady state level between the two patient age groups.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (75 years and over vs 50 years and under)

Patients receive oral gefitinib on day 1 and then daily beginning on day 8. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for 30 days and then for up to 3 years after study registration.
