Yield of Cryoprobe vs Flexible Forceps Pleural Biopsy
This is a prospective study to assess the yield of pleural biopsy obtained with the routine flexible thoracoscopic biopsy forceps versus that obtained with a flexible cryoprobe during semirigid thoracoscopy
Pleural Effusion|Pleurisy|Tuberculosis|Metastatic Malignancy
DEVICE: Cryoprobe pleural biopsy first|DEVICE: Flexible forceps biopsy first
Yield of pleural biopsy obtained with the routine flexible thoracoscopic biopsy forceps versus that obtained with a flexible cryoprobe during semirigid thoracoscopy, The proportion of patients where a definitive histopathological diagnosis was obtained will be compared between the cryoprobe and flexible forceps biopsy, One week
Biopsy size, Size of biopsy specimens obtained with the two techniques, One day|Duration of procedure, Time taken for the procedure with the two techniques, One day|Ease of biopsy VAS, Ease of taking biopsy with the two techniques assessed using a visual analog scale, One day|Artifacts, Number of patient speciemens with histopathologic artifacts with either technique including crush artefacts with the flexible forceps and freeze artifacts with the cryoprobe, One day|Tissue depth, Depth of the tissue obtained on histopathology, One day|Bleeding, Number of participants with bleeding seen while taking biopsy categorised into "no bleeding", "minimal self limited ooze", "bleeding requiring prolonged suctioning" , "major hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion, causing hemodynamic instability or ICU admission", One day
Consecutive patients with exudative pleural effusions who are planned to undergo semirigid thoracoscopy will be enrolled in the study if they satisfy the inclusion criteria. They will be randomized in 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization sequence to the following groups:

Group A: Four pleural biopsy specimens obtained using the flexible cryoprobe followed by eight pleural biopsy specimens obtained using the flexible thoracoscopic forceps OR Group B: The above two procedures will be performed in the reverse order The biopsies will be performed from different areas of the involved pleura with the two techniques. Thoracoscopy will be performed in the bronchoscopy suite on spontaneously breathing subjects (fasting for 8 h) under conscious sedation (using midazolam, pentazocine, and tramadol) observing complete aseptic precautions.
