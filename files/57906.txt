Assessing Circulating Tumor Cell as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Detection in Patients With Gray Zone PSA Level
Prostate cancer screening with PSA is plagued by high rate of unnecessary prostate biopsies, especially in the "gray zone" (4.00ng/ml e 10.99ng/ml). We introduce a new circulating-tumor-cell (CTC) biomarker for detection of prostate cancer in patients in the PSA "gray zone" level, with the clinically verified potential to substantially decrease the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.
