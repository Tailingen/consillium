Phase III Trial BI 695502 Plus Chemotherapy vs. Avastin® Plus Chemotherapy in Patients With Lung Cancer
The objective of this phase III trial is to establish statistical equivalence in terms of efficacy (best overall response rate \[ORR\], proportion of patients with complete response \[CR\] plus partial response \[PR\]) until 18 weeks of first-line treatment with BI 695502 plus chemotherapy versus Avastin® plus chemotherapy followed by maintenance monotherapy with either BI 695502 or Avastin®.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: BI 695502|DRUG: Avastin
Best Overall Response Rate (ORR), Based on Unconfirmed Response Assessment, as Assessed by Central Imaging Review Until 18 Weeks After the Start of Treatment, ORR was defined as the percentage of patients who achieved at least one visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after the start of treatment. The response criteria evaluation was carried out according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. CR and PR did not need to be confirmed by a subsequent tumor assessment due to blinded central assessment. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions since baseline; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Tumor assessments were performed prior to trial drug administration, until 18 weeks., Tumor assessment scans were performed at baseline, Cycle 3 (Week 6), Cycle 5 (Week 12) and at Week 18 ±14 days. Best ORR evaluated until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or up to 18 weeks, whichever happened earlier.
Percentage of Patients With Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) For Comparability Assessment of BI 695502 and US-licensed Avastin®, The following selected adverse events (AEs) were evaluated for comparability assessment of BI 695502 and US-licensed Avastin®:

* Infusion reactions (anaphylactic/hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions),
* Thromboembolic events (arterial or venous),
* Febrile neutropenia,
* Gastrointestinal perforations,
* Hypertension,
* Proteinuria,
* Pulmonary hemorrhage,
* Other hemorrhages (not including pulmonary hemorrhages),
* Wound-healing complications/abscess/fistulas. The analysis of AEs was based on the concept of TEAEs. For non-switched patients, all AEs that started or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of trial drug and prior to the date of last administration of trial medication + 16 weeks inclusive were defined as TEAEs., From first dose of trial drug until 16 weeks after the last dose of trial medication, up to 218 days.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time as Determined by Investigator Assessment, PFS was defined as the time from randomization until disease progression as determined by Investigator assessment or death from any cause, whichever occurred first during the pre-switch period. Disease progression was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters. Tumor assessments were performed prior to trial drug administration. PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Cycle 3 (Week 6), Cycle 5 (Week 12), Cycle 7 (Week 18), then every 3 cycles (~9 weeks) until confirmed disease progression. Analysis performed for pre-switch period only; maximum duration of up to 35 cycles (105 weeks).|Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS was defined as the time randomization until death from any cause during the pre-switch period. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline until death due to any cause, ie., up to 35 cycles (105 weeks).|Duration of Response (DOR) as Determined by Investigator Assessment, DOR was the time from first documented CR or PR until time of progression as determined by Investigator assessment during the pre-switch period. Tumor assessments were performed prior to trial drug administration. DOR was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor scans performed at baseline, Cycle 3 (Week 6), Cycle 5 (Week 12), Cycle 7 (Week 18), then every 3 cycles (~9 weeks) until confirmed disease progression., ie up to 35 cycles (105 weeks).
The objective of this phase III trial is to establish statistical equivalence in terms of efficacy (best overall response rate \[ORR\], proportion of patients with complete response \[CR\] plus partial response \[PR\]) until 18 weeks of first-line treatment with BI 695502 plus chemotherapy versus Avastin® plus chemotherapy followed by maintenance monotherapy with either BI 695502 or Avastin®.
