Tailored Axillary Surgery With or Without Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Followed by Radiotherapy in Patients With Clinically Node-positive Breast Cancer (TAXIS)
RATIONALE: The use of tailored axillary dissection as a tailored procedure will avoid surgical overtreatment by selectively removing the lymph nodes that are affected by the cancer, thereby sparing many women the unnecessary complications of a radical surgery, providing a better quality of life while keeping the same efficacy.

PURPOSE: The phase III trial is evaluating the optimal treatment for breast cancer patients in terms of surgery and radiotherapy.
Node-positive Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms|RADIATION: Radiotherapy - Arm A|RADIATION: Radiotherapy - Arm B
Disease-free survival (DFS), The primary endpoint of this trial is DFS, defined as time from randomization until one of the following events, whichever comes first:

* Local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence
* Second breast cancer
* Death from any cause Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment., at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient
Overall survival (OS), OS will be calculated from randomization until death from any cause. Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive., at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient|Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), BCSS will be calculated from randomization until death from breast cancer. Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive., at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient|Time to local recurrence (TTLR), TTLR will be calculated from randomization until local recurrence or death from breast cancer. Patients not experiencing an event or patients who died due to other reasons before experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment., at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient|Time to distant recurrence (TTDR), TTDR will be calculated from randomization until distant recurrence or death from breast cancer. Patients not experiencing an event or patients who died due to other reasons before experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment., at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient|Physician reported morbidity outcomes (Lymphedema), at baseline, at week 1 and 4 after surgery, before the beginning of radiotherapy. During follow-up: 9 and 12 months after randomization then every 6 months up to 3 years, then every year up to 20 years after randomization of the last patient.|Physician reported morbidity outcomes (Decreased range of shoulder motion), at baseline, at week 1 and 4 after surgery. During follow-up: 9 and 12 months after randomization then every 6 months up to 3 years, then every year up to 10 years after randomization of the last patient.|Adverse events according to NCI CTCAE v4.03, Clipping-related AEs and specific AEs related to the surgical procedure and radiotherapy will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4.03., from date of patient consent and up to 20 years after randomization of the last patient|Late radiotherapy-related adverse events, Late adverse events related to the radiotherapy will be assessed according to the Late Effects in Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic (LENT-SOMA) scale, from date of patient consent and up to 20 years after randomization of the last patient|Surgical site infections (SSI), SSIs will be assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Surgical Site Infection Classification System., from date of patient consent and up to 20 years after randomization of the last patient
The removal of all lymph nodes in the armpit through conventional axillary dissection has been standard care for all patients with breast cancer for almost a century. In the nineties, the sentinel lymph node procedure, which involves the selective removal of the first few affected lymph nodes, was introduced in clinical practice. Today, conventional axillary dissection is still performed on many women with breast cancer that has spread to the nodes. It is the cause for relevant morbidity in the form of lymphedema, impairment of shoulder mobility, sensation disorders and chronic pain in as much as one third of all women undergoing the procedure.

The TAXIS trial will evaluate the optimal treatment for breast cancer patients in terms of surgery and radiotherapy. In particular, it will investigate the value of tailored axillary surgery (TAS), a new technique that aims at selectively removing the positive lymph nodes. TAS combines the removal of palpably suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure. TAS is a promising procedure that may significantly decrease morbidity in breast cancer patients by avoiding surgical overtreatment.

This trial has the potential to establish a new worldwide treatment standard with hopefully less side effects and a better quality of life, while keeping the same efficacy as provided by radical surgery.

The main objective of the trial is to show that TAS and axillary radiotherapy (RT) is non-inferior to ALND in terms of disease-free survival of node positive breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence in the era of effective systemic therapy and extended regional nodal irradiation.
