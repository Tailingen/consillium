Docetaxel and Carboplatin for Patients With mCRPC and DNA-Repair Deficiencies
In this study, patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone treatment and who have mutations in certain cancer-related genes will be treated with docetaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy.
Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer|Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma|Recurrent Prostate Carcinoma|Stage IV Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel
Percentage of Patients Achieving >= 50% Reduction in PSA According to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) Criteria, Achievement of a PSA50 decline is whether the treatment results in a 50% or greater decline in PSA from baseline PSA prior to therapy, From Day 1 of treatment and up to 30 days after completion of treatment (typically up to 10 cycles of chemotherapy)
This is a phase 2 study of the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with germline inactivation of genes in the homologous recombination pathway, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM).

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess rate of 50% Prostate Specific Androgen (PSA) decline to docetaxel and carboplatin
