Radiofrequency Treatment for Pilonidal Disease : Safety of Use, Efficacy and Patient Satisfaction at 6 Months
Infected pilonidal sinus is a common suppuration that occurs twice as often in men as in women, usually between the ages of 15 and 30. Clinical diagnosis is easy, whether the presentation is acute or chronic. Exeresis with a wound left open requiring secondary postoperative healing is the most widely practiced technique in France because its recurrence rate is the lowest, but it has the disadvantage of requiring daily or even twice-daily local nursing care, long healing, and a break in activity.

In order to limit the disadvantages of the open technique, "conservative" minimally invasive techniques have also recently been developed in response to strong patient demand: such as endoscopic treatment (EPSIT = Endoscopic Pilonidal Sinus Treatment, or VAAPS = Video-Assisted Ablation of Pilonidal Sinus), or the SiLaT (Sinus Laser Therapy) laser.

More recently, radiofrequency has emerged as a new technique in the treatment of hemorrhoidal pathology according to the Rafaelo procedure as well as the Fistura procedure for anal fistulas. The principle of the treatment is similar to that of the laser, based on radio frequency thermocoagulation using very high frequency electromagnetic waves (4MHz), similar to the principle of microwaves. However, its use in the infected pilonidal sinus has not yet been described. The fibers used in anal fistulas are perfectly adapted to the treatment of the pilonidal sinus. In addition, and in contrast to the laser, several fiber diameters are available depending on the size of the fistula path(s). For example, the large diameters of 9 Fr seem to be more adapted to the deep and wide cavities of the pilonidal sinuses than those of the SiLaT, which has a single fiber diameter. The investigators can therefore think that this type of fibers could allow a more efficient destruction of the granulation tissues and a better docking of the cavity walls.

According to published studies in the treatment of anal fistulas, the safety profile of this treatment is perfectly reassuring since the penetrance of the energy released does not exceed 3 mm in depth.

The aim of this study is to propose a competing alternative to the SiLaT laser, which is radiofrequency according to the Fistura® procedure, by evaluating its safety, efficacy and patient satisfaction on a series of consecutive patients treated
Infected Pilonidal Sinus
DEVICE: radiofrequency treatment
Incidence rate of at least one complication of the surgery, incidence rate of haemorrhagic complication or acute urinary retention or other complication (such as post surgery abcess, localized infection, haematoma), Within 15days after surgery
Incidence rate of of haemorrhagic complication after surgery, Within 15days after surgery|Incidence rate of acute urinary retention after surgery, Within 15days after surgery|Incidence rate of other complication of surgery, incidence rate of other complication such as post surgery abcess, localized infection, haematoma, Within 15days after surgery|Evaluation of post-surgery pain, Patient will be asked daily to evaluate post surgery pain using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Patients will be asked to circle the number between 0 and 10 that fits best to their pain intensity. Zero represents 'no pain at all' whereas10 represents 'the worst pain ever possible'., within 15 days post surgery|Evaluation of radiofrequency treatment efficiency, During the last patient visit, a clinical evaluation will be performed during which closure of all existing fistula external opening will be assessed (Yes or No), as well as the absence or presence of abcess and new external opening (Yes or no) . The patient will be asked to evaluate the presence or absence of pain (yes or no)

The Treatment will be evaluated as efficient if there is closure of all fistula external opening AND absence of pain AND absence of abscess or new external opening, 6 months after surgery|Length of the medical leave after surgery, Record of number of medical leave days prescribed after surgery Record of number of day after surgery necessary before returning to normal activity., within 6 months post surgery|Measurement of patient satisfaction after surgery, patient will evaluate their satisfaction regarding their surgery using a visual 5 point scale ranking from "very unsatified" to "very satisfied", 1 month and 6 months post surgery
