A Study of Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in Combination With Another Anti-cancer Drug in Participants With Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with another anti-cancer drug in participants with NSCLC that is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (stage IV). The study will also investigate how the body processes the combination treatment and how the study drug affects the body. The study will also collect disease-related symptoms and participant-reported pain related to NSCLC.
Carcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung
DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: LY3023414|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) or DLT-equivalent in Part A, B, C, D and E, A DLT defined as adverse event(AE) occurring between Day 1 and Day 21 of Cycle 1 that was considered at least possibly related to either abemaciclib or the combination therapy and fulfilled a criteria selected (using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,version 4.0 \[NCI-CTCAE v 4.0\] \[NCI 2009\]):Grade(Gr)≥3 nonhematological toxicity,Gr4 thrombocytopenia lasting at least 5 days and/or complicated with bleeding,Gr≥3 febrile neutropenia(ntr) and for Part D participants (pts): Gr3 hyperglycemia (fasting) of \<5 days, Gr3 hypertriglyceridemia or hyperlipidemia without optimal treatment.A DLT-equivalent defined as AE that would have met the criteria for DLT if it had occurred during Cycle 1 for pts enrolled in dose-escalation phase,but that occurs between 1)Day 1 and Day 21 of Cycle 2 and beyond for a participant enrolled in dose-escalation phase 2) at any time for a participant in dose-expansion phase., Baseline through study completion (Up To 15 Months)
Number of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate [ORR]) in Part A, B, C, D and E, ORR is the best response of CR or PR as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., Baseline through study completion (Up To 15 Months)|Progression Free Survival Time in Part A, B, C, D and E, Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first evidence of disease progression as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. If a participant does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time was censored at the date of randomization, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death has been observed for the participant. If a participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date. PFS time was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates., Date of first dose until first documented progression or death (Up To 15 Months)|Change From Baseline in MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Scale-Lung Cancer (MDASI-LC) in Part A, B, C, D and E, The MDASI-LC is a self-reported lung cancer instrument included 22 items covered by one of the following dimensions: Mean core symptom severity (Core items 1-13: pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, remembering things, lack of appetite, drowsy, dry mouth, sad, vomiting, numbness/tingling), Lung cancer symptoms (3 items: coughing, constipation, sore throat), Mean symptom severity (13 core items plus 3 lung items) and Interference with mood or functional status (6 items: general activity, mood, work, relations with other people, walking, enjoyment of life). The mean of all symptom subscale items was calculated where 0 equals "not present" and 10 equals "as bad as you can imagine." A change from baseline with negative values indicate improvement, positive values indicate worsening., Baseline, through study completion (Up To 15 Months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Abemaciclib on Day 1 and at Steady State (Cycle 2 Day 1) in Part A , B, C, D and E, Cmax of Abemaciclib on day 1 and at steady State (Cycle 2 Day 1) Part A , B, C, D and E was evaluated., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose; Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Pemetrexed at Steady State in Part A, Cmax of pemetrexed at steady state in Part A was evaluated., C2D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|PK: Dose-normalized Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Active Gemcitabine Metabolite: 2',2'-Difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) on Day 1 and at Steady State (Cycle 2 Day 1) in Part B, Cmax of active gemcitabine metabolite (dFdU) on day 1 and at steady state (Cycle 2 Day 1) dose-normalized to 1250 mg/m\^2 in Part B was evaluated., C1D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose; C2D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab at 1 Hour Post-End-of-Infusion in Part C, Cmax of ramucirumab at 1 hour post-end-of-Infusion in Part C was evaluated., C1D1 and C2D1: 1 hour post-end-of-infusion|PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3023414 in Part D, Cmax of LY3023414 in Part D was evaluated., C1D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose; C2D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|PK: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of Abemaciclib in Part A, B, C, D and E, Area under the concentration time curve from zero to 8 hours AUC(0-8h) of abemaciclib in Part A, B, C, D and E was evaluated., C1D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose; C2D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|PK: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of Pemetrexed at Steady State in Part A, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC\[0-∞\]) of Pemetrexed in Part A was evaluated., C2D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|PK: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of Active Gemcitabine Metabolite: 2',2'-Difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) on Day 1 and at Steady State (Cycle 2 Day 1) in Part B, Area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to 12 hours (AUC\[0-12h\]) of active gemcitabine metabolite (dFdU) in Part B was evaluated, C1D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose; C2D1 pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|PK: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of LY3023414 in Part D, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC) of LY3023414 in Part D was evaluated.
