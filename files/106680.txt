Capecitabine and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining capecitabine with gemcitabine in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.
Kidney Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride
Response rate, Up to 2 years
Overall survival, Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival, Up to 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with gemcitabine and capecitabine.
* Determine the duration of overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
