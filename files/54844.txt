Research on the Safety and Efficacy of Intraoperative Radiation Therapy in Malignant Cerebral Tumor
According to the latest national cancer statistics released by the National Cancer Center in February 2022, intracranial tumors account for about 60%-70% of the more than 3.5 million cancer patients, and the morbidity and mortality remain high. Intracranial malignant tumors have become a problem that needs to be solved urgently because of their early recurrence, rapid progression, and short survival, and intracranial malignant tumors include high-grade gliomas, metastases, lymphomas, etc.

Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary malignancy in the adult central nervous system, accounting for about 57% of all gliomas and 48% of all primary weighted nervous system malignancies. At present, the standard treatment for glioblastoma is mainly surgical treatment, supplemented by postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, but the prognosis of patients is still poor, with a one-year survival rate of 40.6%, a five-year survival rate of only 5.6%, and an average survival time of 12-15 months.

For patients diagnosed with intracranial malignancies (including high-grade glioma, metastases, lymphoma, etc.), multimodal image-guided microsurgery combined with postoperative chemoradiotherapy recommended by the guidelines, and intraoperative radiotherapy with tumor bed radiation therapy to achieve targeted and precise tumor treatment, thereby improving the prognosis of patients (including progression-free survival and median overall survival, etc.)
