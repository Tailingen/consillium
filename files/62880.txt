A Comparison of mXELIRI Regimen and FOLFIRI Combined Bevacizumab Regimen as First-line Chemotherapy Regimen for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a Phase II, multicenter，randomized, two arms, open-labeled, controlled clinical trial. This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus mXELIRI compared with bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus FOLFIRI as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: CF|DRUG: Irinotecan
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the date of enrollment to the earlier of the date of confirmed progression or death from any cause., 6 Months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of eligible patients with measurable lesions with a best overall response of CR or PR assessed by the attending physician., 6 Months|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of enrollment to death from any cause., 1 Year|Incidence of Adverse Events, The incidence of adverse events as graded by NCI-CTCAE v 4.0., 6 Months|Quality of life (QoL) Questionnaire, Determined by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Score, 6 Months
This is a Phase II, multicenter，randomized, two arms, open-labeled, controlled clinical trial. This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus mXELIRI compared with bevacizumab (Avastin®) plus FOLFIRI in not previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In experimental group, untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will receive Irinotecan 150 mg/m2 (D1, q2w) , Xeloda 2000mg/m2 (D1-10, q2w) and bevacizumab 5mg/kg (D1, q2w) for 6-9 cycles as the first-line treatment. While in control group, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will receive Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 (D1, q2w) , CF 300mg/m2 (D1 q2w), 5FU 400mg/m2, D1 2400 mg/m2, civgtt 44h (q2w) and bevacizumab 5mg/kg (D1, q2w) for 6-9 cycles as the first-line treatment.The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Overall survival, Objective Response rate, adverse event and life quality will be assessed as secondary outcomes.
