Single Port Robotic Lung Anatomical Resection
This is the first human clinical study for explore the feasibility of lung anatomic resection through Da Vinci SP surgical platform
Robotic Surgical Procedure
DEVICE: Lung Anatomic Resection (Da Vinci SP)
Incidence of conversion rate, The primary performance endpoint will be assessed as the ability to successfully complete the planned anatomic resection procedure with the da Vinci SP System, with no conversion to thoracoscopic, multi-port robotic, or open surgery. Usage of additional assistant port(s) is not considered a conversion., During Surgery

During the past several years, minimally invasive thoracic surgery has evolved from thoracoscopic approaches using 3 -4 ports to a single incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques. Recently, the experience acquired with the uniportal VATS technique through the intercostal space has allowed the development of a uniportal VATS subxiphoid or subcostal approach for major pulmonary resections. The advantage of using a subxiphoid or subcostal entry is to reduce pain by avoiding possible trauma of intercostal nerves caused by thoracic incisions. However, the longer distance from the subxiphoid or subcostal incision to the hilum makes this approach more difficult to perform anatomical pulmonary resections.During this same period of evolution into uniportal VATS surgery, robotic thoracic surgery has gained popularity as an alternative to traditional VATS. The advantages of robotics are the ability to perform surgery more precisely with articulated or wristed instruments, motion scaling, and tremor filtration, as well as improved visualization thanks to 3D high-definition video. However, currently 4 -5 incisions are still necessary to perform anatomic robotic resections.Recently, there has been a convergence of these two trends-uniportal surgery and robotic-assisted surgery-and has resulted in a single port robotic system, the da Vinci SP by Intuitive Surgical Cooperation. For this new platform, investigators plan to practice in thoracic anatomic lung resection
