A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Zoledronic Acid in the Prevention or Delaying of Bone Metastasis in Patients With Stage IIIA and IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
30-40% of patients with lung cancer will develop bone metastases during the course of their disease, which can lead to pain, decreased mobility and skeletal complications. This study will investigate the effect of zoledronic acid on preventing or delaying the development of bone metastases and the impact on disease progression/survival in patients with stage IIIA and IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Zoledronic acid 4 mg
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented progression or recurrence of disease or death from any cause. Time to disease progression (TTP) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines with evaluations every 3 months., Up to 24 months|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented progression or recurrence of disease or death from any cause. Time to disease progression (TTP) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines with evaluations every 3 months., Months 6, 12, 18, and 24|Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival Events, Percentage of Participants with the Progression-free survival events: disease progression and death. Time to disease progression (TTP) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines with evaluations every 3 months., Up to 24 months
Percentage of Participants With Bone Metastases at 6, 12, 18, and 24 Months, Percentage of participants developing at least 1 bone metastasis, whether or not symptomatic. Bone scans were scheduled at screening and at 6-monthly intervals after study entry, or when symptoms suggested the presence of bone metastases. Positive bone scans required confirmation by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT)., Months 6, 12, 18 and 24|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of the Time to Occurrence of Bone Metastases, Time to occurrence of bone metastases was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented bone metastases which could be asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of detection. Bone scans were scheduled at screening and at 6-monthly intervals after study entry, or when symptoms suggested the presence of bone metastases. Positive bone scans required confirmation by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT)., Months 6, 12, 18, and 24|Percentage of Participants With Skeletal Related Events (SREs) at 12 and 24 Months From Study Entry, Skeletal Related Events were defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, spinal cord compression event or a pathologic bone fracture event., Months 12 and 24|Kaplan-Meier Estimates of the Time to the First Skeletal Related Event (SRE), Time to the first skeletal related event defined as the time from randomization to the date of occurrence of the first SRE. Skeletal Related Events were defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone, spinal cord compression event or a pathologic bone fracture event, Months 6,12, 18, and 24|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Overall Survival, Months 6, 12, 18, and 24
