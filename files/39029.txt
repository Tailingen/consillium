Study for Participants With Advanced, Not Amenable to Surgery, or Metastatic Lung Cancer Comparing Treatment With Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + Enzastaurin Versus Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + Placebo
This study is intended for participants with advanced, not amenable to surgery, or metastatic lung cancer who have not received any prior chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

* Part 1 is intended to evaluate safety of pemetrexed + cisplatin + enzastaurin combination chemotherapy
* Part 2 whose main objective is to compare the efficacy of pemetrexed + cisplatin + enzastaurin versus pemetrexed + cisplatin + placebo. Participants to be included in Part 2 are those with Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Lung Cancer
DRUG: enzastaurin|DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: placebo
Part 1: Evaluate Safety [Toxicity, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Reasons for Participant's Discontinuation], Presented are data that evaluates safety based on toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0), SAEs, and discontinuations due to SAEs or other non-serious adverse events (AE's) of study participants. A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Cycle 1 (28-day cycle), Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (21-day cycles) and 30-day follow up|Part 2: Compare Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Between the 2 Treatment Arms Through the Assessment of Tumor Response, PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who did not have objective progressive disease (PD), PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free assessment. For participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to objective disease progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last objective progression-free assessment prior to the initiation of post discontinuation anticancer therapy. PFS was calculated and analyzed based on an alternative definition of censoring; for each participant who is not known to have died or who have had objective disease progression as of the data cut-off date, PFS was censored at the date of last prior contact. Zero participants were analyzed in this outcome as study was terminated early., Baseline to measured PD up to 5 months
Part 2: To Evaluate the Safety and Toxicity Profile of Study Treatments, The safety and toxicity profile for Part 2 was defined as serious adverse events (SAEs) and other non-serious adverse events (AEs). A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Cycle 1 (28-day cycle), Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (21-day cycles) and 30-day follow-up|Part 2: Number of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Response Rate), Response rate was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Best response was confirmed by a second assessment in ≥28 days. Response rate was defined as the number of participants with best response of CR or PR divided by the total number of treated participants. Zero participants were analyzed in this outcome as study was terminated early., Baseline to measured progressive disease (PD) up to 5 months|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS time was defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date, OS was censored at the last contact date (last contact for participants in post discontinuation was equal to the last known alive date in mortality status). Zero participants were analyzed in this outcome as study was terminated early., Baseline to date of death from any cause up to 5 months|Part 2: Duration of Disease Control (DDC) and Response, DDC and response defined as time from complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) to first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause using RECIST (v1.0) criteria. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR defined as having ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. PD defined as having ≥20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions. SD defined as small changes not meeting above criteria. Participants not known to have died as of data cut-off date, had no objective PD or were lost to follow-up, DCC was censored at date of last objective progression-free assessment (OPFA). Participants who received subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from study treatment) prior to objective PD or death were censored at date of last OPFA prior to initiation of post discontinuation anticancer therapy. Zero participants were analyzed in this outcome as study was terminated early., Baseline to measured PD up to 5 months|Part 2: Time to Worsening of Symptoms (TWS), TWS was measured from the date of study enrollment to the first date of a worsening in any of the 6 Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) symptoms (appetite, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, hemoptysis and pain). Participants marked each symptom on a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 millimeter (mm) (as good as it can be/none) to 100 mm (as bad/much as it could be). TWS was also measured individually for each of the 6 symptoms independently and were also measured from the date of enrollment to the first date of worsening in pain. For both measurements, worsening was defined as a 15-mm increase from baseline in the participant-reported score for any symptom. Participants who are not known to have had a worsening TWS were censored at the date of the participant's last LCSS assessment. Zero participants were analyzed in this outcome as study was terminated early., Cycle 1 (28-day cycle), Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (21-day cycles) and 30-day follow-up|Part 2: To Assess Biomarkers of the Disease State and Their Correlation to Clinical Outcome, Presented are data that evaluates of biomarkers relevant to the study drug and the disease state of the participant's clinical outcome. Zero participants were analyzed in this outcome as study was terminated early., Baseline, Cycle 1 (28-day cycle), Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (21-day cycles) and end of study up to 5 months
