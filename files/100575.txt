An Extension Treatment Protocol for Subjects Who Have Participated in a Study of Tivozanib Versus Sorafenib in Kidney Carcinoma (Protocol AV-951-09-301).
Open-label, multi-center extension treatment protocol to allow access to tivozanib and sorafenib for subjects who have participated on the AV-951-09-301 protocol. Eligible subjects who were randomized to receive sorafenib on AV-951-09-301 and had documented progression of disease will receive a tivozanib dose of 1.5 mg/day. Eligible subjects who were randomized to tivozanib or sorafenib in AV-951-09-301, and displayed clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability to treatment, will continue to receive tivozanib or sorafenib at the same dose and schedule as in AV-951-09-301.

Subjects could be discontinued due to unacceptable toxicities or clinical or documented PD, From enrollment to until all subjects discontinue (due to documented PD or unacceptable toxicities) or until 3 years after the first subject was enrolled in Protocol AV-951-09-902|Average Daily Dose Administered to Subjects in Each Treatment Arm, The average daily dose administered to subjects who were from Protocol AV-951-09-301 who either continued on tivozanib in this trial (subjects with first-line experience on tivozanib treatment), who crossed over from sorafenib to tivozanib in this trial (crossover subjects) participated in, and who continued on sorafenib in this trial (subjects with first-line experience on sorafenib treatment). Subjects could be discontinued due to unacceptable toxicities or clinical or documented PD, From enrollment to until all subjects discontinue (due to documented PD or unacceptable toxicities) or until 3 years after the first subject was enrolled in Protocol AV-951-09-902|Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) of Treatment Administered to Subjects in Each Treatment Arm, RDI is defined as 100% times the actual dose intensity divided by the intended dose intensity. The RDI of subjects who were from Protocol AV-951-09-301 who either continued on tivozanib in this trial (subjects with first-line experience on tivozanib treatment), who crossed over from sorafenib to tivozanib in this trial (crossover subjects) participated in, and who continued on sorafenib in this trial (subjects with first-line experience on sorafenib treatment). Subjects could be discontinued due to unacceptable toxicities or clinical or documented PD, From enrollment to until all subjects discontinue (due to documented PD or unacceptable toxicities) or until 3 years after the first subject was enrolled in Protocol AV-951-09-902|Number of Subjects With Adverse Events, Number of subjects with Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs) as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, From enrollment assessed up to 3 years of treatment or until follow-up (up to 30 days end-of-trial visit after treatment discontinuation), whichever occurs earlier
Number of Subjects With Objective Response Rate (ORR) Who Continued Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib and Who Received Tivozanib After Failure of Sorafenib, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST (Version 1.0), relative to the total population of dosed subjects. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the loading dose (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. To allow long-term access to sorafenib for subjects who participated in Protocol AV-951-09-301 (NCT01030783), and demonstrated clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability to sorafenib., From Day 1 to the end of treatment (EOT) Visit, approximately every 8 weeks|Duration of Response (DR), DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) according to RECIST (Version 1.0) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any reason. DR was calculated for the subgroup of subjects with a confirmed objective tumor response (PR or CR). CR is Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PR is At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Number of subjects with disease progression or death and censored endpoints were summarized and statistical analysis were performed for duration of response., From the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression, assessed up to treatment discontinuation or to death due to any reason or maximum up to 3 years, whichever occurs earlier|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurred first. For the crossover subjects and subjects with first-line experience on tivozanib treatment, the timeframe for PFS assessment started from the date of first dose of tivozanib in the AV-951-09-902 study. For subjects with first-line experience on sorafenib treatment, the timeframe for PFS assessment started from the date of first dose of sorafenib in the AV-951-09-902. Number of subjects with disease progression or death was summarized and statistical analysis were performed for PFS., From the date of first dose of study drug (tivozanib or sorafenib) in the AV-951-09-902 study to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any reason or maximum up to 3 years, whichever occurred first|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug (tivozanib or sorafenib) date on this study to date of death due to any cause. Number of subjects died or alive was summarized and statistical analysis were performed for OS., From the date of first dose of study drug (tivozanib or sorafenib) in the AV-951-09-902 study to death due to any reason or maximum up to 3 years, whichever occurred first
This is an extension treatment protocol to allow access to tivozanib or sorafenib for subjects enrolled on AV-951-09-301(parent protocol). Subjects who failed sorafenib on the parent protocol will be offered tivozanib. Subjects who were randomized to tivozanib, and demonstrated clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability will be offered long-term access to tivozanib. Subjects who were randomized to sorafenib, and demonstrated clinical benefit and acceptable tolerability will be offered long-term access to sorafenib. Subjects who continue receiving sorafenib on this protocol and progress will be allowed to cross-over to tivozanib.
