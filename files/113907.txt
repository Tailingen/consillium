Low-dose CT-based Method for Detection of Subclinical Anthracycline-induced Cardiotoxicity
Prospective single arm study to evaluate a low-dose CT-based protocol for early detection of myocardial dysfunction in 50 cancer patients undergoing anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
Neoplasms
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: low dose CT
cardiomyopathy, Cardiomyopathy is defined as a decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography of greater than 10 percentage points, to a value \< 53% (normal reference value for 2D echocardiography)., 12 months after completion of chemotherapy
Change in CT-based left ventricular strain parameters, Change in CT-based left ventricular strain parameters before and after the chemotherapy, 12 months after completion of chemotherapy|Change in left ventricular global longitudinal strain based on echocardiography, Change in left ventricular global longitudinal strain between baseline and post-chemotherapy., 12 months after completion of chemotherapy|Change in echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular ejection fraction change between baseline and post-chemotherapy., 12 months after completion of chemotherapy
