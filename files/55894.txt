Adjuvant Ribociclib With Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor+/HER2- Intermediate Risk Early Breast Cancer
This is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ribociclib with endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, intermediate risk breast cancer.

DRUG: Ribociclib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Adjuvant endocrine therapy
Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) using STEEP criteria, iDFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first event of local invasive breast recurrence, regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, death, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second primary non-breast invasive cancer, and is assessed locally by investigators., up to 90 months
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) using STEEP criteria, RFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first event of local invasive breast recurrence, regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, or death., up to 90 months|Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) using STEEP criteria, DDFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first event of distant recurrence, death, or second primary non-breast invasive cancer, up to 90 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., up to 90 months|Quality of Life (QOL), Change from baseline in the physical functioning sub-scale score and global health status/QOL scale score as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, Baseline, 90 months
While adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) is effective in reducing risk of recurrence in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer (EBC), recurrences are still common, especially in patients with unfavorable clinical, pathological and/or molecular features. Ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicity when added to ET in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of addition of ribociclib to standard adjuvant ET on invasive disease-free survival in patients with HR+, HER2- intermediate-risk EBC.
