AMG 172 First in Human Study in Patients With Kidney Cancer
This is the first-in-human (Phase I) study of AMG 172, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), in subjects with kidney cancer \[Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)\] who have relapsed or who have refractory disease following at least two prior therapies. The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 172, and also evaluate the objective response rate in patients with ccRCC receiving AMG 172. The study will be conducted in two Parts: Part 1 will explore doses of AMG 172 given every two weeks and every three weeks to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and Part 2 (dose expansion) will examine safety, tolerability, PK and overall response rate in subjects treated at the MTD established in Part 1 for either every two week or every three week dosing.

This First in- human study of AMG 172 will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (dose exploration) and Part 2 (dose expansion). Part 1 of the study is aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability and PK of AMG 172 given every two weeks and every three weeks in subjects with relapsed / refractory cc RCC, and Part 2 is aimed at evaluating safety, tolerability, PK and response rate in subjects treated at the MTD established in Part 1 for either every two week or every three week dosing. Up to 48 subjects may be enrolled in Part 1, and up to 30 subjects may be enrolled in Part 2. The dose of AMG 172 utilized in Part 2 will be dependent upon data obtained in Part 1 of the study.
