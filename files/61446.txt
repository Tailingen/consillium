Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of AMP-224 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, first time in human study of AMP-224 in adult patients with cancer that is not responding to standard therapy. This study will be conducted in two stages consisting of a Dose-Escalation stage and an Expansion Stage.
Cancer
DRUG: AMP-224|DRUG: AMP-224
Number of participants with adverse events., From start of study drug administration until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause; through Day 56 of final cycle.|Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities., From start of study drug administration until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause: through Day 56 of the final cycle.|Number of participants with changes in laboratory values, vital signs, physical exam, and electrocardiogram., From start of study drug administration until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause: through Day 56 of the final cycle.|Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose based on the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities., From start of study drug administration through Day 28 of Cycle 1.|Determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose following analysis of adverse events, pharmacokinetics and changes in laboratory evaluations., From start of study drug administration until withdrawal; through Day 56 of final cycle.
Evaluate pharmacokinetics, including area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and clearance of AMP-224 following single and repeat doses of AMP-224., From Day 0 pre-dose through Day 56 of final cycle.|Evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR), including Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS)., From Screening through 12 weeks following final cycle.|Characterization of the effects of AMP-224 on its receptor, PD-1, in peripheral T cells via flow cytometry and correlate with response to treatment., From Screening until 12 weeks post-final cycle.|Evaluation and correlation between response to treatment and expression of PD-1 on tumor infiltrating T cells or in available malignant pleural effusions via flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry., Screening through 12 weeks post-final cycle.|Evaluation and correlation between response to treatment and expression of B7-H1 on tumors via immunohistochemistry., Screening through 12 weeks post-final cycle.|Identification of peripheral patient selection and pharmacodynamic markers from blood samples that predict and/or correlate with response to treatment., Screening through 12 weeks post-final cycle.
