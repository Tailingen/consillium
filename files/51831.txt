Clinical Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) With Mitomycin C Used During Surgery for Treatment of Locally Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) with Mitomycin C used during surgery for treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma is effective in the treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: MITOMYCIN-C 30 mg|PROCEDURE: Proactive cytoreductive surgery
Locoregional Control (LC), Time elapsed from the surgical intervention clinical up to the date the patient is free of clinical and radiological locoregional recurrence, 3 years
Overall survival, Evaluate the effect of the addition of HIPEC with Mitomycin C to cytoreductive surgery in 12 months and 3 years overall survival rate (%OS)., 12 months and 36 months after surgery|Disease Free Survival, Evaluate the effect of addition of HIPEC with Mitomycin C to cytoreductive surgery in 12 months and 3 years disease free survival rate (% DFS)., 12 months and 36 months after surgery|Evaluation of the morbidity and mortality related with the treatment, Evaluate the safety (treatment-related morbidity and mortality) of addition of HIPEC with Mitomycin C to cytoreductive surgery in locally advanced colo-rectal cancer. It will be measured by the incidence rate of adverse events and deaths., 36 months after surgery|HIPEC technique operating time, Average operating time calculation., 36 months after surgery|HIPEC technique length of hospital stay, Average length of hospital stay calculation., 36 months after surgery|HIPEC technique re-admission rate, Average re-admission rate calculation., 36 months after surgery|HIPEC technique laparoscopic vs laparotomy approach, With this outcome it will be calculated the frequency of both surgery techniques and if it has any impact on the locoregional control of the disease., 36 months after surgery|HIPEC technique open vs. closed HIPEC technique, With this outcome it will be calculated the frequency of both surgery techniques and if it has any impact on the locoregional control of the disease., 36 months after surgery|Quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30, With this outcome it will be calculated the effect on the quality of life of patients using questionnaire QLQ-C30., At baseline, 1 month after surgery, 6 months after surgery, 12 months after surgery, 24 months after surgery and 36 months after surgery|Quality of life questionnaires QLQ-CR29, With this outcome it will be calculated the effect on the quality of life of patients using questionnaire QLQ-CR29., At baseline, 1 month after surgery, 6 months after surgery, 12 months after surgery, 24 months after surgery and 36 months after surgery
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) with Mitomycin C used during surgery for treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma is effective in the treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.

The Hyperthermic Intra-peritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is expected to be an effective treatment with minimal side effects, it has already provided clear benefits in terms of overall survival in patients with advanced cancer.

This is an attractive option for the healthcare professionals who face daily to peritoneal recurrence after performing complex surgeries, however its application is difficult due to the cost and resources increase. This leads to the necessity of administering the treatment within a clinical trials and in order to obtain a significant power this clinical trials will be multicenter and it will be performed in several Oncological surgery Units highly specialised and with extensive experience in colorectal carcinoma.
