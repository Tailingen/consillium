Tirellizumab+Anlotinib VS Anlotinib for MSS-type CRC
To compare the efficacy and safety of tirellizumab combined with anlotinib in the treatment of mss colorectal cancer. To investigate the effective biomarker of anlotinib combined with tiralizumab
Colon Cancer|Immunotherapy
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Tislelizumab+anlotinib|DRUG: anlotinib
PFS, Defined as the time from the beginning of treatment to the first imaging disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), 36 months
OS, the time from the beginning of treatmentto death of any cause, 36 months|Multiomic molecular characterization of the response to combination immunotherapy, Including WES and RNA-seq analysis. using WES(Whole-exome sequencing) to analyse the differences in the mutational profiles between responders and non-responders. RNA-seq was used to reveal pathways and TME feature associated with the response to the combination therapy, 36 months
This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study to compare the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor（TKI） combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs) versus tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone in the treatment of advanced MSS colorectal cancer. Patients with MSS CRC who have been confirmed by pathology and have relapsed or failed multiline therapy were included in the study. Patients who had received tirellizumab plus anlotinib were considered the combination group, and those treated with anlotinib were classified as the monotherapy group. The efficacy and safety of the two regimens were compared. At the same time, Whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing were performed on the patients in the response and non-response groups of the combination group to reveal the characteristics of their microenvironment and search for biomarkers related to response.
