Study of Docetaxel and Gemcitabine in Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer
Gemcitabine is a novel analog of the nucleoside deoxycytidine that acts via inhibition of DNA synthesis.Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane and promotes microtubule assembly and inhibits microtubule depolymerization.

In this study, patients received gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 plus docetaxel 100 mg/m2 on day 8 with G-CSF support every 3 week.
