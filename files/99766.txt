Busulfan, Melphalan, Fludarabine and T-Cell Depleted Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Followed by Post Transplantation Donor Lymphocyte Infusions
The patients are being offered a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are very early blood cells. They have not yet matured to become red or white blood cells or platelets. They have already received the standard treatment of chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant. An autologous stem cell transplant is when the patient receives their infusion of their own cells. Thi will give the patient a better chance of curing the disease, this protocol includes an infusion of stem cells from the blood (or the bone marrow) of another person. This is called an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The stem cells will begin to grow in the bone marrow and produce new blood cells.

Allogeneic stem cell transplants can cause a condition called graft-versus-host disease or GVHD. In GVHD, a kind of white blood cell from the donor (graft) begins to attack the body (host). That blood cell is called a T-cell. It is a cell that normally helps to protects against things like bacteria and viruses. In this case, the donor's T-cells see the body as foreign in the same way they would see bacteria as foreign. GVHD can be fatal. In order to lower the chance that the patient will get GVHD this protocol treatment will remove the T-cells from the donor's cells. This is called T-cell depletion. The T cells are removed by a system called "Clinimacs". This method is still being evaluated through clinical trials and not been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) at this time.

Before the transplant, the physician will treat the bone marrow to get rid of the cancer. The physician uses three chemotherapy drugs plus ATG. The chemotherapy drugs (Busulfan, Melphalan and Fludarabine) kills the cancer. ATG gets rid of any of the patients T cells that survive the chemotherapy. This ensures that the donor stem cells are not rejected. The patient will also receive additional white blood cells called lymphocytes from the donor. This is called a donor lymphocyte infusion or DLI. These additional infusions will help cause a graft-versus-myeloma effect and can help the donor stem cells grow.
