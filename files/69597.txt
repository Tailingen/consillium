A Phase II Study of Carelizumab Combined With Irinotecan and Apatinib of Second-line Treatment for Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall survival time (OS), objective remission rate（ORR）, progression-free survival time（PFS）, disease control rate（DCR）of Carelizumab combined with irinotecan and apatinib for the second-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable, recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach and gastroesophageal junction. At the same time, the safety and tolerance of the scheme were preliminarily evaluated.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Carelizumab Combined With Irinotecan and Apatinib
Overall Suvival time（OS）, The time from randomization to death due to any reason. For those who have lost follow-up before death, the last follow-up time is usually calculated as the time of death., Up to 24 months
Progress Free Survival time（PFS）, The time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|objective response rate（ORR）, Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain amount and kept for a certain time, including CR and PR cases, Up to 24 months|duration of response （DoR）, It is the curative effect evaluation index of tumor reaction, which refers to the time from the first evaluation of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to the first evaluation of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, Up to 24 months|Disease control rate（DCR）, The proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk or remained stable for a certain period of time, including cases of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and stable (SD), Up to 24 months
Safety and tolerability, The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Up to 24 months
