Safety and Efficacy of MEDI0457 and Durvalumab in Participants With Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Associated Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, anti-tumor activity, and immunogenicity of MEDI0457 (also known as INO 3112) a HPV Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) vaccine in combination with durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) which is a human monoclonal antibody directed against Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), which blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and Cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80).

An initial three to 12 participants (Safety Analysis Run-in participants) will be enrolled and assessed for safety before additional participants are enrolled.

The initial safety analysis run-in participants along with an approximate total of 50 participants with human papilloma virus associated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) will be enrolled in this study and evaluated also for anti-tumor efficacy to MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab.

ECOG performance status is used by doctors and researchers to assess how a participant's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living activities of the participant and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The scores are: 0 = Fully Active, able to carry out all pre-disease performance without restrictions; 1 = Restricted activity but ambulatory and able to carry out light work or work of a sedentary nature; 2 = Ambulatory and capable of self-care but unable to carry out work activities; 3 = Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; 4 = Completely Disabled, unable to carry out any self-care and totally confined to bed or chair; 5 = Dead., Day 1 through 90 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately 45 months)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 in Response-evaluable Population, The objective response is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) guidelines. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. The PR is defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion. A confirmed CR or PR is defined as 2 CRs or 2 PRs that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression or not evaluable response in-between. Percentage of participants with objective response is reported., Day 1 through end of study (approximately 45 months)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response by RECIST Version 1.1 in As-treated Population, The objective response is defined as confirmed CR or confirmed PR based on RECIST v1.1 guidelines. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. The PR is defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion. A confirmed CR or PR is defined as 2 CRs or 2 PRs that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression or not evaluable response in-between.
