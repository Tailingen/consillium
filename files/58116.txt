LOD Before IVF/ICSI in PCOS Patients With High AMH
To evaluate the effect of performing laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) before proceeding to in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) on the cycle outcomes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with high antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels
Infertility|Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
PROCEDURE: LOD
Number of oocytes retrieved, Number of collected oocytes during oocyte retrieval, 36-38 hours after triggering of oocyte maturation|Oocyte maturity rate, Calculated for each woman by dividing the number of mature oocytes (MII oocytes) by the total number of oocytes retrieved, Within one hour after oocyte retrieval|Fertilization rate, Calculated for each couple by dividing the number of fertilized oocytes by the number of injected (or inseminated) oocytes, 20-24 hours after injection (or insemination)
Clinical pregnancy rate, Number of clinical pregnancies (defined as presence of at least one intrauterine gestational sac with fetal pole and cardiac activity on TVS scan at 4-6 weeks after the ET) divided by the number of ET procedures, 6 weeks after embryo transfer|Implantation rate, Number of gestational sacs on TVS scan at 4-6 weeks after ET divided by the number of transferred embryos, 6 weeks after embryo transfer|Incidence of early OHSS, Incidence of OHSS within 9 days of final triggering of oocyte maturation, Within 9 days of final triggering of oocyte maturation
Retrospective case-control study of PCOS women with high serum AMH level (â‰¥ 7 ng/ml) who were subjected IVF/ICSI. Women underwent LOD in the preceding 3 months prior to IVF/ICSI (study group) will be compared with a control group of women who did not underwent LOD (control group)
