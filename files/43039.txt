Immuno-persistence Study of a Recombinant Human Papillomavirus 16/18 Bivalent Vaccine in Preadolescent Girls (54m)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immuno-persistence (type specific IgG antibody) of the tested vaccine administered in girls aged 9-17 years,comparing to young healthy adults of 18-26 years who received the standard 3-dose schedule (0,1,6 months).

DRUG: Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16, 18) Vaccine (Escherichia coli)
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 seroprevalence and geometric mean concentrations at Month 54 (type-specific IgG antibody), To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 type-specific IgG antibody level on 54 month after the dose 1, Month 54
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 seroprevalence and geometric mean concentrations at Month 54 (type specific neutralizing antibody), To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 type specific neutralizing antibody level on 54 month after the dose 1, Month 54
This is a follow-up study that is based on the bridging study of a recombinant human papillomavirus 16/18 bivalent vaccine in preadolescent girls(Unique Protocol ID:HPV-PRO-006,Identifiers: NCT02562508) .The investigators will recruit people who have participated in bridging study before and collect their serum samples to test the seroprevalence and geometric mean concentrations of anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 antibody on 54 months after dose 1
