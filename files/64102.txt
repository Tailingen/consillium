Complete Remission Rate, Complete Remission Rate after CAR-T cell therapy, up to 28 days after CAR-T cells infusion|Overall survival (OS), From the first infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells to death or the last visit, Up to 2 years after CD19 CAR-T cells infusion|Leukemia-free survival (LFS), From the complete remission to the occurrence of any event, including death, relapse (any one occurs first), and the last visit, Up to 2 years after CD19 CAR-T cells infusion|Quality of life, Assessment using European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) scale \[For item1-28: max score: 112, min score: 28, higher scores mean a better outcome; for item 28-29: max score: 14, min score: 2, higher scores mean a worse outcome\] to measure Quality of life at Baseline, Month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12, At Baseline, Month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12
This is a prospective, single arm study. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sequential CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cells in the treatment of adult newly diagnosed Ph chromosome negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The main endpoints were dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and incidence of adverse events (TEAEs).
