Combination Chemotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the objective tumor response of the first-line therapy combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: cisplatin
Objective Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria that defines when participants improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable"), or worsen ("progression") during treatment., baseline to measured progressive disease (eight 21-day cycles of therapy and follow-up period was 24 months starting from the date of the last drug administration. Data collected every 4 months.)
Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., first documented complete or partial response to measured progressive disease (eight 21-day cycles of therapy and follow-up period was 24 months starting from the date of the last drug administration.)|Time to Progressive Disease, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first date of disease progression., first active treatment dose to measured progressive disease (eight 21-day cycles of therapy and follow-up period was 24 months starting from the date of the last drug administration.)|Time to Treatment Failure, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first observation of disease progression, death as a result of any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment., first active treatment dose to last contact for patients, death as a result of any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment (eight 21-day cycles of therapy and follow-up period was 24 months starting from the date of the last drug administration.)|Survival Time, Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death due to any cause., first active treatment dose to date of death due to any cause (eight 21-day cycles of therapy and follow-up period was 24 months starting from the date of the last drug administration.)|Number of Participants With Maximum Common Toxicity Criteria-National Cancer Institute Toxicity (CTC-NCI) of Gemcitabine-Cisplatin Combination, The CTC provides descriptive terminology for adverse event reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each adverse event term. Grades range from 0 (none) to 5 (death)., Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (eight 21-day cycles of therapy)|Number of Participants With Hematology Maximum Common Toxicity Criteria - National Cancer Institute Grades, Maximum CTC-NCI toxicity grade for hematology. Grades range from 0 (none) to 5 (death)., Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (eight 21-day cycles of therapy)|Number of Deaths, Baseline through follow-up (eight 21-day cycles of therapy and follow-up period was 24 months starting from the date of the last drug administration.)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation, Baseline through eight 21-day cycles
