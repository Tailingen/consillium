Oral Calcitriol With Ketoconazole in CRPC
The aim of this study is to estimate the PSA response rate with the use of ketoconazole (400mg QD + hydrocortisone 20mg AM, 10 mg PM) among men with CRPC in whom disease has progressed despite abiraterone
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Calcitriol, Ketoconazole, Hydrocortisone
PSA Response Rate, Assessment of PSA every 4 weeks, 2 years
Tumor Response, Objective tumor response among patients with measurable disease using modified RECIST1.1, 2 years|Toxicity and Tolerability of Experimental Arm, Descriptive analysis of observed toxicity and patient reports of tolerating experimental treatment, 2 years
This study will aim to describe objective tumor responses to the combination of oral calcitriol and ketoconazole and hydrocortisone-among patients with measurable disease using modified RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Additionally, we will determine toxicities, and tolerability of oral calcitriol combination with daily oral ketoconazole, and hydrocortisone in this patient population.

this is a single arm phase II trial of ketoconazole (400mg QD + hydrocortisone 20mg AM, 10 mg PM) among men with CRPC in whom disease has progressed despite abiraterone
