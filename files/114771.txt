PDR001 in Combination With Platinum-doublet Chemotherapy and Other Immunology Agents in PD-L1 Unselected, Metastatic NSCLC Patients
The primary purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of PDR001 when administered in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy and other immunooncology agent(s) in treatment naive patients with PD-L1 unselected, advanced NSCLC, and to estimate the preliminary anti-tumor activity in this patient population.
