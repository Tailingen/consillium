CRISPR-Edited Allogeneic Anti-BCMA CAR-T Cell Therapy in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety of CB-011 (the study treatment), an allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy that targets the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), to determine the best dose of CB-011, and to assess the effectiveness of CB-011 in treating multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or that is no longer responding to other treatment (refractory).
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: CB-011
(Part A) Number of patients with dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Number of patients with DLTs during the 28 days following the first administration of CB-011., 28 days|(Part B) Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR will be evaluated by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., 12 Months
