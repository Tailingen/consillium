Evaluating in Vivo PARP-1 Expression With 18F-FluorThanatrace Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) in Prostate Cancer
Men with a history of prostate cancer may be in this study. Subjects recommended for a prostatectomy or oligometastectomy will undergo PET/CT imaging using a novel radiotracer \[18F\]FTT to evaluate PARP-1 activity in known or suspected sites of primary or metastatic disease. Imaging will be compared with pathology results, including additional research assays when possible.
