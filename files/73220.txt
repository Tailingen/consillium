Outpatient Care Pathway for Patients Treated Intra-arterially for Primary Liver Cancer
Randomized trial comparing two care organizations (outpatient versus conventional inpatient care) using a mixed method (quantitative and qualitative data and analysis).

The protocol involves randomization between an ambulatory group and a conventional hospitalization group. Patients will be monitored for 7 months to assess satisfaction, complications and treatment efficacy. A qualitative study will be carried out to understand the obstacles and facilitate implementation of the ambulatory pathway. A medico-economic analysis will accompany this study to assess the financial impact of adopting the ambulatory pathway. The expected results will help determine the best management strategy for these patients.

The study's hypotheses are that performing intra-arterial treatments for primary liver cancer on an outpatient basis, combined with telephone follow-up, will improve patient satisfaction with their care, and that analysis of the implementation of this outpatient pathway will help improve the pathway and facilitate its implementation at other sites, by identifying obstacles and solutions.
