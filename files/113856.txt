The mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, It was measured over a segment of the common carotid artery that was 1 cm long, located approximately 0.5 cm below the carotid-artery bulb, and considered not to contain any plaque (i.e., not to have any perceivable protrusion of the artery wall into the lumen)., 3 months|The maximum intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery, It was defined as the greatest intima-media thickness in either the right or left internal carotid artery extending from the bulb to 1 cm above the carotid sinus, ascertained from a total of four views on each side., 3 months|Carotid plaque burden, Carotid plaque area measured by ultrasound (cross-sectional area of longitudinal views of all plaques seen) to quantify the increase or decrease of atherosclerotic carotid plaques., 3 months
This is a perspective, self-controlled cohort study. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 mAbs (PD-1 immune checkpoint blockades) on atherosclerotic carotid plaques in those anti-PD-1 mAbs treated patients. The method for quantification and evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques are based on the: ① The mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (Mean CCA thickness); ② The maximum intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery (maximum ICA thickness); ③ Carotid plaque burden: by calculation of the plaque area of atherosclerotic plaques on the long axis direction of artery on the ultrasound images. By comparing the above-mentioned parameters at the same location of carotid artery in each patient when initiate the first-dose of anti-PD-1 mAbs therapy and 3 months post anti-PD-1 mAbs therapy. It is designed to assess the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 mAbs on the progression of carotid plaques.
