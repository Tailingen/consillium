Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy With Chemotherapy for Stage I-IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
A phase II, single-arm, open-label study that assesses feasibility, safety and efficacy of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy with PD-(L)1 inhibitor in stage I-IIIB NSCLC adult patients followed by adjuvant PD-(L)1 inhibitor treatment for up to 1 year
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor
MPR (major pathologic response), Major pathologic response (MPR) is defined as \> 90 percent decrease in viable tumor., Up to 8 weeks
DFS(disease-free survival), Time from first dose of neoadjuvant treatment to recurrence of tumor or death, at 3 years from the first dose of neoadjuvant treatment|OS(overall survival), Time when the patient is still alive, at 3 years from the first dose of neoadjuvant treatment|Toxicity profile, Toxicities caused by the drug during the studyï¼Œaccording to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, from the first dose of neoadjuvant treatment until 90 days after the last dose of adjuvant treatment
A phase II, single-arm, open-label study that assesses feasibility, safety and efficacy of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitor in stage I-IIIB NSCLC adult patients followed by adjuvant treatment for up to 1 year with PD-(L)1 inhibitor.

Two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be administered before surgery, followed by another one to two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitor and PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy for up to 1 year.

After completion of neoadjuvant therapy and before surgery, a tumor assessment will be done. Patients with stable disease or partial response may be considered for surgery.

The report imaging response and pathological response rate will be evaluated. Patients eligible for the trial are those with a histological diagnosis or cytologically proven operable and resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. The total number of patients to be included will be 60 from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS).

Accrual period of 2 years or until the inclusion of the last patient necessary to achieve the sample set in the protocol of 60 patients. After that all patients will be treated for up to 1 year with adjuvant immunotherapy and they will be followed during 3 years after adjuvant treatment.
