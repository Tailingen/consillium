The Effects of Replacing Red and Processed Meat With Quorn on Biomarkers of Gut Health
This study will evaluate the effects of substituting red and processed meat in the diet with Quorn; a meat replacement product, on biomarkers of gut health. This will be a crossover design where participants will take part in 2 study periods where they will consume a diet containing red and processed meat during one of the study periods, whereas in the other study period, they will consume a diet containing Quorn.

There is a strong association between a diet which is high in red and processed meat, while low in fibre, and the incidence of colorectal cancer. This study aims to evaluate the effects of replacing red and processed meat in the diet with an alternative meat product such as Quorn, on biomarkers of gut health that may be associated with colorectal cancer.

Quorn is a product which has a considerable fibre component; thus, the replacement of red and processed meat with Quorn, will not only reduce the amount of compounds implicated to have deleterious effects in the gastrointestinal tract (E.G. haem, nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines), but will also increase the delivery of fibre into the gastrointestinal system, that may well have an overall positive impact on gut health.

In this study, the participants will consume 240 grams (raw weight) of either red and processed meat, or Quorn each day for a 2 week period, this will be followed by a 4 week period where they will return to their usual dietary habits; before swapping to consume the alternative food (red/processed meat or Quorn) for another 2 week period.
