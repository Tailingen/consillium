Validation of Software-based Fusion of Ultrasound and MRI Images of the Prostate
The investigators hypothesize software-based fusion/navigation will be accurate to within 3 mm of the reference standard of EM fusion. The investigators aim to evaluate the accuracy of prostate US/MRI software-based fusion/navigation technology.
