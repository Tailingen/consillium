Exercise-based Rehabilitation to Treat Persistent Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the EX-CIPN exercise-based intervention is feasible, acceptable, and safe in participants with persistent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). It will also give insight on the effectiveness of the exercise intervention in treating CIPN symptoms. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is EX-CIPN safe, acceptable, and feasible in cancer survivors experiencing persistent CIPN?
* Are the study design and methods feasible (recruitment and retention rates, feasibility of data collection and procedures)?

Researchers will provide all participants with the exercise-based intervention.

Participants will:

* Complete assessments at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3-months post-intervention
* Complete a 10-week remote, individualized exercise program
* Receive health coaching calls on weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 of the intervention
* Wear a FitBit throughout the study to track physical activity and promote behaviour change
Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy
BEHAVIORAL: EX-CIPN
Accrual Rate, Assessed based on CONSORT criteria through a screening log that tracks data collected of all screened patients. Eligibility screening will be performed to identify eligible consented and eligible non-recruited individuals with non-recruitment reasons documented. Number of participants consented and enrolled will be tracked each month., Throughout study completion, up to 24 weeks.|Retention Rates, Retention rates will be calculated as the proportion of participants that attend each assessment time point. The investigators will also examine rates of complete and missing data., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|Adherence, Assessed through health coaching call attendance, Fitbitâ„¢ usage, and self-report completion of weekly exercise plan, Through study completion, up to 24 weeks.|Intervention Safety, All adverse events will be scored on the CTCAE version 5.0 and documented during weekly appointments and at follow-up assessments with the Registered Kinesiologist (RKin). Assessment, tests, and all exercises will be stopped at any time if any pain or discomfort is experienced., Through study completion, up to 24 weeks.
Pain Intensity, Measured using the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). Scored on a 1-10 scale, 1 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|CIPN Symptoms, Measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (EORTC CIPN-20) questionnaire. Results are scored on a scale between 20-80 with higher scores meaning worse outcomes., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|CIPN-related Disability, Measured using the Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale for patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy CIPN-RODS. Results are scored on a scale between 0-56 with lower scores meaning worse outcomes., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|Strength (Upper Body), Measured via handgrip dynamometry or grip strength test (GST)., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|Strength (Lower Body), Measured by a 30-second sit to stand test (30-s STS)., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|Balance, Measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Balance Test. The SPPB balance test provides a score from 0 to 4 with lower scores meaning worse outcomes., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|Gait Speed, Measured using the Four-Metre Gait Speed Test., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)|Aerobic Functional Capacity, Measured using a 6-minute walk test (6MWT)., Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks), 3-months post-intervention (20-24 weeks)
