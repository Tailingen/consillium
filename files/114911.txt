PCR Based CEUS in BI RADS 4A Nodules
The aim of this study was to investigate the added value of Principal Component Regression (PCR) based contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for differentiating low risk patients with breast nodules categorized as 4A using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).

surgery or biopsy, According to the PCR result, if it's positive, the nodule category was maintained, however, if it's negative, the nodule was downgraded. all nodules were submitted to biopsy or biopsy., up to 3 months
The aim of this study was to investigate the added value of Principal Component Regression (PCR) based contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for differentiating low risk patients with breast nodules categorized as 4A using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The study included patients with 4A nodules confirmed by core biopsy and/or surgery. The CEUS parameters were assessed and PCR scores were calculated to evaluated the added value in BI-RADS 4A nodules.
