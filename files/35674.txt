Gardasil Versus Cervarix in the Treatment of Warts
Warts are common, benign, epidermal proliferations caused by HPV infecting skin and mucous membranes. Treatment of warts poses a true challenge despite existing variable therapeutic modalities, whether destructive or immunotherapeutic. Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines are FDA approved for the prevention of genital warts and wart related precancerous and cancerous lesions but they are not indicated for treatment of preexisting warts yet

Therapeutic response, The percentage of patients in each group achieving complete, partial or no response at the end of the treatment sessions, Through study completion for a maximum of 12 weeks, evaluation held at two weeks interval and at the end of treatment sessions (12th week visit)
Safety measure, Immediate adverse events recorded by the treating physician within 1 hour post injection, Through study completion every treatment session held at two weeks interval for a maximum of 5 sessions|Safety measure, Delayed adverse events reported by the patients in between sessions, Through study completion for a maximum of 12 weeks held every two weeks till the end of the treatment sessions (12th week visit)|Recurrence, Percentage of patients experiencing recurrences in each group, 6 months following the end of treatment sessions
Approximately 35% of viral warts tend to be recalcitrant either showing no response to treatment or having prompt recurrences after treatment, causing frustration for both patients and physicians. Success rates vary significantly across patients and across different therapeutic interventions ranging from 7% to 90%.

Immunotherapy is proposed to enhance virus recognition by the cell mediated immunity, which allows the clearance of both treated and untreated warts and helps to prevent recurrences through induction of a long-term acquired immunity to HPV.

Few reports suggest the possibility of using quadrivalent or bivalent HPV vaccines as therapeutic modality rather than only preventive modality. This is a randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of quadrivalent and bivalent HPV vaccines in the treatment of warts
