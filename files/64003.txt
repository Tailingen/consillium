Low Dose Radiation to Improve T-Cell Infiltration in Pancreatic Cancer
Principal purpose of the study is the determination of an active local external beam radiotherapy dose leading to a maximum number of tumor infiltrating T-cells.
Primarily Resectable Pancreatic Cancer

Principal purpose of the study is the determination of an active local external beam radiotherapy dose leading to a maximal number of tumor infiltrating T-cells. The total T-cell activity serves as primary surrogate parameters for anti- tumoral activity, Principal purpose of the study is the determination of an active local external beam radiotherapy dose leading to a maximal number of tumor infiltrating T-cells.
