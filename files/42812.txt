Intratumoral/Intralesional Administration of MK-4621/JetPEI™ With or Without Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic or Recurrent Solid Tumors (MK-4621-002)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of intratumoral (IT) / intralesional injections of MK-4621 delivered via the JetPEI™ in vivo linear polyethylenimine nucleic acid delivery system as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: MK-4621|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The following toxicities during DLT evaluation period were considered DLT, if assessed by investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment: Grade (Gr) 4 nonhematologic toxicity; Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days or protocol-specified thrombocytopenia; any nonhematologic adverse event (AE) ≥Gr 3 in severity (with exceptions); any Gr 3/Gr 4 nonhematologic laboratory value if clinically significant medical intervention was required to treat the participant, or the abnormality led to hospitalization, or the abnormality persisted for \>1 week; or the abnormality resulted in a drug-induced liver injury; febrile neutropenia Gr 3/Gr 4; \>2 week delay in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; any treatment-related toxicity that caused the participant to discontinue treatment during Cycle 1; missing \>2 injections of MK-4621 during Cycle 1, or Gr 5 toxicity. The percentage of participants who experienced DLTs were reported for each arm., Up to 21 days (Cycle 1)|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who experienced an AE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 13 months|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due to AEs, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 13 months
Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of MK-4621, AUC is the area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time after drug administration and is of particular use in estimating bioavailability of drugs, and in estimating total clearance of drugs. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points (pre-dose and post-dose) during the study to assess the AUC of MK-4621., Day 1 of 21-day Cycles 1 and 2: pre-dose (1-8 hours), end of IT injection up to +5 minutes (0.0 hours), 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, and 6 hours. Samples also collected at 24 hours after MK-4621 dose for Cycle 1 Day 1 only.|Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of MK-4621, Cmin was defined as the minimum or "trough" concentration of MK-4621 observed after its administration and just prior to the administration of a subsequent dose. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points (pre-dose and post-dose) during the study to assess the Cmin of MK-4621., Day 1 of 21-day Cycles 1 and 2: pre-dose (1-8 hours), end of IT injection up to +5 minutes (0.0 hours), 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, and 6 hours. Samples also collected at 24 hours after MK-4621 dose for Cycle 1 Day 1 only.|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-4621, Cmax was defined as the maximum or "peak" concentration of MK-4621 observed after its administration. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points (pre-dose and post-dose) to assess the Cmax of MK-4621., Day 1 of 21-day Cycles 1 and 2: pre-dose (1-8 hours), end of IT injection up to +5 minutes (0.0 hours), 0.5, 1.0, 2, 4, and 6 hours. Samples also collected at 24 hours after MK-4621 dose for Cycle 1 Day 1 only.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR, disappearance of all evidence of disease) or Partial Response (PR, ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based upon investigator assessment. ORR was reported for each treatment arm., Up to approximately 22 months (through data cut-off of 02-Mar-2021)
