The Effect of Ketogenic Diet on Malignant Tumors- Recurrence and Progress
The aim of the study is, to study the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in delaying or preventing recurrence and tumor growth progression of patients who have been previously treated by concomitant chemoradiotherapy (6 months) for high-grade glial tumors.

It will be an open-label trial of nutritional intervention for up to 1 year. An interim analysis of the data will be carried out to assess safety, compliance and efficacy of the diet. This will be reviewed by both SHS and the Clinical trial team.

OTHER: Nutritional support with Standard diet|OTHER: Nutritional intervention with the Ketogenic diet
To study the effect of the ketogenic diet on tumor growth progression and longevity in patients with Malignant glioblastoma., This will be done by comparing tumor size by repeated MRI studies (every 2 months)
