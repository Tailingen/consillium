Intervention With General Practitioners to Improve Women's Participation in Cervical Cancer Screening
In France, cervical cancer is the 12th most common female cancer with nearly 3,000 new cases per year.

Since 2018, a national Organized Cervical Cancer Screening program (DOCCU) has been set up and concerns all asymptomatic women aged 25 to 65.

This program, managed by the Regional Cancer Screening Coordination Centers (CRCDC), invites women who have not taken a sample within the recommended time frame to consult for screening. However, only 59% of patients participated.

The intervention of the general practitioner, an essential player in prevention, could allow for better awareness.

The objective of the INDIGO study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention of a general practitioner on the participation rate in the DOCCU of patients who are not up to date with their screening.

This is a cluster-randomized trial. Randomization will be performed at the GP practice level to limit the potential contamination bias between doctors within the same practice. GP practices will be randomized either to the 'usual practice' arm or the 'intervention' arm."

If they are in the "intervention" group, they or one of the professionals in their team will contact the patient (phone call, SMS, email, etc.), to encourage her to make an appointment to carry out the screening. Contact arrangements are left to the discretion of each general practitioner..

If they are in the "Usual practice" group, they will use their usual practices to encourage screening.
