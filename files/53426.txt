Effect of Prolonged Nightly Fasting on Immunotherapy Outcomes in HNSCC - Role of Gut Microbiome
This study aims to evaluate if eating within an 8-10-hour window during the day, without any caloric restriction, can lead to better response rates to immunotherapy in head and neck cancer patients.
Head and Neck Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Prolonged Nightly Fasting|BEHAVIORAL: Regular Eating pattern
Rates of Prolonged Nightly Fasting (PNF) compliance, Adherence to the 8-10 hour time restricted feeding window will be measured using "mycircadianclock" app ,which has been validated as a tool to conveniently and reliably track time of food intake and its correlation with timing of the day and sleep. It can be tailored to restrict feeding duration to specific set points., at 3 months|Change in gut microbiome and microbial metabolites, Changes in gut microbiome composition/diversity as well as gut microbial metabolites in participants using PNF will be compared with participants that are not restricting eating times will be measured using stool samples., Baseline and at 12 weeks
