Cabozantinib and Nivolumab for Carcinoid Tumors
This research study, is studying the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating advanced carcinoid tumors.

- Carcinoid tumor is another term used to refer to neuroendocrine tumors that arise in organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or thymus.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response or partial response at any time during treatment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 46 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesion and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions are also considered progression. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status and must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase., Time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. The median survival follow-up time was 5.6 months (range 1.4 - 31.0 months).|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per Immune-related Response Criteria, ORR will be determined according to immune-related response criteria (irRC). irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions. irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, or 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all target and all new measurable target lesions. irStable Disease (irSD): Does not meet criteria for irRC or irPR, in the absence of progressive disease. irProgressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase Percentage Change in Tumor Burden when compared to SPD at nadir., 46 months|Overall Survival (OS), Kaplan and Meier to assess Overall survival (OS)., Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. OS was calculated for a median of 6.9 months, ranging from 2.8 - 31.0 months.|Number of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events, Safety was assessed by analysis of adverse event (AE) and toxicity data. AE and toxicity data are defined according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0. Adverse Events were reviewed between the initial dose of study treatment and 100 days of the last dose of treatment. All adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on CTCAEv5 as reported on case report forms will be counted. Rate is the proportion of treated participants experiencing at least one treatment-related AE of any type during the time of observation., AEs were reviewed between the initial dose of study treatment and 100 days of the last dose of treatment. AEs were assessed for a median of 8.8 months, ranging from 4.7 - 33.7 months.|Duration of Response, To evaluate duration of response of participants receiving Nivolumab and Cabozatinib. Duration of response was evaluated from date of registration to date of death or last known date alive., The median survival follow-up time was 5.6 months (range 1.4 - 31.0 months).
This is open-label, single-arm, phase II research study, studying the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab in treating advanced carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumor is another term used to refer to neuroendocrine tumors that arise in organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or thymus.
