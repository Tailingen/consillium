Bevacizumab Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Platinum for Immunotherapy-treated Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based regimen has been widely used in first-line treatment of driver-gene-negative non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This study investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination of bevacizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and platinum as second-line treatment for driver-gene-negative non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients progressed after ICI-based treatments.
