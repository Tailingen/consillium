Clinical Study of CWP232291 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients
This is a multicenter (S. Korea/US), Phase Ib, open-label, dose-finding study to assess safety, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of CWP232291 administered in combination with ara-C in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML.

The primary objectives in phase 2a is to assess the efficacy of CWP232291 administered in combination with cytarabine (response rate complete remission \[RR-CR\]/complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery \[CRi\]/partial remission \[PR\]).
