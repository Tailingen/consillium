Efficacy and Safety of Radiotherapy in Oligoprogressive HCC Following First-line PD-1 Therapy
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved the survival outcomes of HCC patients. However, a considerable proportion of patients eventually experience disease progression due to the development of resistance. Among these, oligoprogression is a common manifestation, occurring in 10-55.3% of advanced cancer patients. Local therapy, especially radiotherapy (RT), has been increasingly considered in the setting of oligoprogression to overcome ICIs resistance and delay the need to change systemic therapy. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of RT in oligoprogressive HCC following first-line PD-1 therapy.
