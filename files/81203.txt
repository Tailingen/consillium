Zanubrutinib, Chidamide, and Rituximab Induction With or Without CHOP Versus R-CHOP in Newly Diagnosed Double-Expressor DLBCL
Zanubrutinib, as a new generation of BTK inhibitors, has shown more potent antitumor activity and lower adverse reactions than ibrutinib in head-to-head clinical studies, which make it a promising regimen for B cell lymphoma. Chidamide is an oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor.

This Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label Phase II Clinical Study is comparing the efficacy and safety of Zanubrutinib, Chidamide, and Rituximab induction therapy sequentially combined with or without CHOP versus R-CHOP in the first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed double-expressor DLBCL.

The consistency between ctDNA clearance and radiographic disease response, ctDNA will be collected from patients in the experimental group at baseline, the end of cycle 2, and the end of treatment. This includes, but is not limited to, evaluating the relationship between the clearance of the MYD88 L265P mutation and radiographic complete response after cycle 2 and at the end of treatment, as well as the relationship between the clearance of TP53 mutations and radiographic complete response., Approximately 12 months
This study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib, chidamide, and rituximab (ZCR) induction therapy sequentially combined with or without CHOP regimen versus the standard R-CHOP regimen as first-line treatment for newly diagnosed double-expressor DLBCL. This study targets patients with MYC/BCL2 double-expressing DLBCL, a group with poor prognosis under traditional R-CHOP treatment.

The study consists of screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period, with subjects randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is the end-of-treatment complete response rate (EOT-CRR), while secondary endpoints include the overall response rate (EOT-ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 128 patients are planned to be enrolled.

Efficacy evaluation will be conducted using the 2014 Lugano criteria, with imaging examinations such as PET-CT to objectively measure treatment response. adverse events (AEs) throughout the entire trial and grade the severity of adverse events will be recorded according to the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0.
