Multicentric Study Comparison Between Erythropoietin and Erythropoietin Associated to Differentiating Therapy With Acid 13-cis-retinoic and Dihydroxyvitamin D3 in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Without Excess of Blasts
This is a prospective, randomized multicenter phase III clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and activity of comparison between Erythropoietin and Erythropoietin Associated to Differentiating Therapy With Acid 13-Cis-Retinoic and Dihydroxyvitamin D3 in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Without Excess of Blasts
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: infusion A: rEPO|DRUG: B Infusion rEPO combined with vitamins pills
study of comparison between standard theraphy rEPO (40.000unit/week) and association therapy between rEPO (40.000unit/week)plus Acid 13-Cis-Retinoic and Dihydroxyvitamin D3, After 8 months
TO evaluate if,the patients without eritroyd response at the end of the 4° month of therapy, the increase of dose of rEPO to 80.000 U / week allows to get an increase of valued response at the end of the 8° month., 8 months|To evaluate if there is a difference of duration in the eritroyd response with standard therapy rEPO in comparison with association therapy rEPO plus Acid 13-Cis-Retinoic and Dihydroxyvitamin D3., 20 mounths|To evaluate the existing relationships among eritroyd response and clinical-biological parameters at baseline of anemia, subclass of MDS, silky dosing of the EPO etc., 20 mounths|To evaluate the quality of life improvement due to therapy., 8 mounths|To evaluate the percentage of leukemic progression., 20 mounths
This is a prospective, randomized multicenter phase III clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and activity of comparison between Erythropoietin and Erythropoietin Associated to Differentiating Therapy With Acid 13-Cis-Retinoic and Dihydroxyvitamin D3 in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Without Excess of Blasts
