Ofatumumab Maintenance Treatment vs No Further Treatment in Relapsed CLL Responding to Induction Therapy
The purpose of this study was to determine if maintenance therapy with ofatumumab would prolong remission in patients with CLL who have responded to second or third line treatment. This study would also evaluate the safety of ofatumumab maintenance compared to observation (the current standard of care). This study was co-developed with the HOVON and NORDIC CLL group and would be conducted as a collaborative effort with GSK.

Progression-free Survival, as Assessed by the Investigator, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined by the investigator according to the definitions of response in the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines. According to the guidelines, PD is characterized by at least one of the following: lymphadenopathy (appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (\>1.5 centimeter \[cm\]), spleen or liver or other infiltrates or an increase by 50% or more in the greatest diameter of any previous site); an increase by 50% or more in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen; an increase by 50% or more in the numbers of blood lymphocytes with at least 5000 lymphocytes per microliter; transformation to a more aggressive histology, or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to chronic lymphocytic leukemia., From randomization until progression or death (up to 79 months)|Progression-free Survival, as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause.

Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as time from randomization to date of death., From randomization until death (up to 88 months)|Number of Participants With Improvement in Response From Baseline, Improvement in response was assessed by calculating the percentage of participants who changed from partial response (PR) at Baseline to complete response during the study., From Baseline until the end of the study (up to 88 months)|Time to Next Therapy, Time to next therapy is defined as the time from randomization to the date of receiving the next CLL treatment., From randomization until the end of the study (up to 88 months)|Progression-free Survival After Next-line Therapy, Progression-free survival after next-line therapy is defined as the time from randomization until progression or death following the next-line therapy and counted as events deaths prior to next-line therapy. Participants who received next-line therapy and who did not have progression or death after next-line therapy were censored at their last date of contact. Participant who died prior to next-line therapy, was counted as an event., From randomization until progression or death (up to 88 months)|Time to Progression After Next-line Therapy, Time to progression after next-line therapy is defined as the time from progression following randomization until progression or death following next-line therapy and counted as events deaths prior to next-line therapy. Participants who received next-line therapy with a PD prior to receiving next line therapy and who did not had progression or death after next-line therapy were censored at their last date of contact. If a participant died prior to next-line therapy, this was counted as an event., From randomization until progression or death (up to 88 months)|Change From Baseline (BL) in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 16 Item Module (EORTC QLQ-CLL 16), The EORTC QLQ-CLL16 is comprised of 16 questions that address 5 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) important in CLL. There are 4 multi-item scales - fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects (\[TSE\], 4 items), disease symptoms (disease effects scale \[DES\], 4 items), and infection (4 items) - and single-item scales (social activities \[Social Problems (SP) Scale\] and future health worries \[Future Health (FH) Scale\]). These are measured on a four-point Likert scale, where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. These scores are transformed to give a rating from 0 - 100, where 0 = no symptoms or problems and 100 = severe symptoms or problems. Changes from Baseline were analyzed by a mixed model-repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)., From randomization until the end of the study (up to 47 months)|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-reported, 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses 15 domains: physical functioning (5 items), role functioning (2 items), emotional functioning (4 items), cognitive functioning (2 items), social functioning (2 items), pain (2 items), fatigue (3 items), nausea and vomiting (2 items), five single-item symptom scores (insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspnea), a single item asking about financial difficulties, and global health status/quality of life (QOF) consisting of 2 items. Functional and symptoms scales were measured on a four-point Likert scale, where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much, whereas global health status or QOF was assessed using a 7-item Likert scale, ranging from "poor" (worse quality of life) to "excellent" (better quality of life).

The utility score measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses to each of the 5 health states are measured on a 3-point scale (level 1 = no problem; level 2 = some or moderate problem\[s\] and level 3 = unable, or extreme problems). Responses are typically converted into health utilities or valuations on a scale ranging from 0 (worst health) to 1 (perfect health). The thermometer score ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Changes from Baseline were analyzed by mixed model-repeated measures ANCOVA.

The confirmed positive samples were reported as HAHA positive and further evaluated in the titration test to obtain a titer of HAHA. A confirmed positive result at any time point means the participant is positive for HAHA.Results are reported as the number of participants positive for HAHA., Pre-dose (Visit 1), Months 7, 13, 19, and 25 during treatment and at 3 and 6 months after last ofatumumab dose (up to 30 months)|Mean Change From Baseline in the Immunoglobulin (Ig) Antibodies IgA, IgG, and IgM at Indicated Time Points, Immunoglobulins, or antibodies, are large proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses. Their normal blood levels indicate proper immune status. Low levels indicate immuno-suppression. IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured in the blood samples of the participants. Baseline IgA, IgG, and IgM values are the last pre-dose assessment values performed on Cycle 1 Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-baseline value minus the Baseline value., Baseline, every six months during treatment, and after last treatment visit and/or upon relapse (up to 88 months)|Number of Participants Who Were Positive and Negative for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) at Any Visit, MRD refers to small number of leukemic cells that remain in the participant during treatment or after treatment at the time the participant achieved a confirmed complete remission.

Flow cytometry is a technique for counting and examining microscopic particles with an electronic detection apparatus. Baseline CD5+CD19+ and CD5-CD19+ cell count value is the last pre-dose assessment values performed on Cycle 1 Day 1.
