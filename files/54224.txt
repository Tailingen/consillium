Empowering Cessation ACS South Region
Sexual and/or gender minority (SGM) people face a disproportionate burden of cancer risk, and tobacco use is a key modifiable risk factor. SGM tobacco-related disparities are especially pronounced in places with high levels of stigma against SGM people. This community-engaged and remotely-delivered Research Scholar Grant project will evaluate an empowerment-based smoking cessation intervention tailored for SGM people in high-stigma places. In partnership with Freedom Oklahoma (OK) and a Community Advisory Board from Arkansas (AR) and Texas (TX) this projects aims to: (1) Adapt SGM-serving volunteer activities from the Oklahoma intervention pilot study for delivery in nearby states; (2) Test intervention efficacy among SGM adults in OK, AR, and TX; (3) Identify treatment mechanisms.
