Combined Fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FCH-PET/MRI) in Curative Treatment of a Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in terms of incidence and the second in terms of mortality. At an early stage, which is based on a low number and size of liver nodules and the absence of extra-hepatic locations (Milan criteria), a curative treatment can be performed, i.e. liver transplantation, surgical resection, or thermo-ablation. These treatments can lead to severe complications, so patients benefiting from them must be carefully selected. The correct identification of all HCC lesions at the time of the therapeutic decision is crucial. MRI is the reference examination for diagnosis but its field of exploration is limited to the upper abdominal area and its sensitivity decreases for nodules of less than two centimetres. Such lesions could actually be HCC that will cause early post-operative progression.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET; functional imaging) with fluorodeoxyglucose can provide prognostic information but impacts initial staging in less than 5% of cases. However, PET with fluorocholine (FCH), available in France since 2010, could detect intra- and extra-hepatic HCC lesions not identified by conventional imaging, potentially impacting patient management (e.g. 52% of patients in a small case study).

FCH-PET/MRI could therefore be the ideal examination for the initial staging of HCC, combining in a single multimodality investigation the reference morphological imaging technique and an efficient functional one. The hypothesis of this study is that FCH-PET/MRI is able to detect, in patients eligible for curative treatment, additional preoperative intra- and extra-hepatic early or metastatic HCC unseen or equivocal with conventional imaging (CT and MRI) and responsible for recurrence or disease progression at 6 months.

Specificity of FCH-PET/MRI for the detection of preoperative lesions, Specificity of FCH-PET/MRI for the detection of preoperative lesions not visible with conventional imaging techniques and confirmed as being HCC Specificity of preoperative FCH-PET/MRI will be calculated as a ratio of the number of patients with negative FCH-PET/MRI and no additional lesions in histopathology and/or no progressive lesions confirmed at follow-up, to the total number of patients with no additional lesions in histopathology and/or no progressive lesions confirmed at follow-up., 6 months post-treatment
