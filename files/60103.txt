Comparing 18F-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Cancer Detection
Evaluating fluoro-18-fibroblast activation protein inhibitor-04 positron emission computed tomography's diagnostic efficacy for primary malignancies versus 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose.
Malignant Neoplasm
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET/CT
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT, McNemar test, 1 week
In recent years, radionuclide labeled fibroblast activating protein inhibitors (FAPIs) have gradually become a new strategy for targeted diagnosis and therapy. In this study, radionuclide 18F was used to label FAPI, and the imaging value of FAPI was compared with that of common developer 18F-FDG. To evaluate the diagnostic value of 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT in various malignant tumors.
