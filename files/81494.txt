A Trial of Y101D, a PD-L1/TGF-Î² Bispecific Antibody, in Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of Y101D in patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors.
Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Cohort 1 of Y101D|DRUG: Cohort 2 of Y101D|DRUG: Cohort 3 of Y101D|DRUG: Cohort 4 of Y101D|DRUG: Cohort 5 of Y101D
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were assessed using the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., From the time of the first dose (Day 1) until the 2nd dosing (Day 28)|Adverse Events according to CTCAE V5.0, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Time Frame: From the start of administration to the end of the study or 28 days after the administration is stopped (up to 6 months and 28 days)

This study will consist of two parts: dose escalation part and cohort expansion part.

In dose escalation part, up to 5 dose-escalation cohorts will be sequentially enrolled in this study. The five dose levels are 1, 3, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg. DLTs will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle, which is 28 days. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 4-week core treatment period for DLT evaluation, a treatment extension period, a safety follow-up visit for approximately 30 days following the last dose of Y101D, and survival follow-ups every 3 months thereafter.

In cohort expansion part, To further characterize safety and efficacy of Y101D, cohort expansion will be allowed in the following two circumstances: MTD cohort expansion if the MTD could be identified; Benefited dose cohort if it could be determined by Investigator.
