Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders: Comparison Between Surgical Treatment and Wait and See Approach
This research protocol is comparing the effectiveness of surgical excision to the "wait and see" approach for the management of oral leukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia in prevention of oral squamous cell carcinoma onset.
Leukoplakia, Oral
PROCEDURE: Surgical excision of the lesion|OTHER: Wait and see approach
Oral cancer incidence, Number of patients who will develop oral squamous cell carcinoma, every 3 or 6 months (according to the clinical case) up to 5 years
Time to malignant transformation from diagnosis, Period of time required to develop malignancy, every 3 or 6 months (according to clinical case) up to 5 years|Quality of life after surgical excision, To evaluate the quality of life of patients affected by leukoplakia and treated with surgical excision, via Functional Intraoral Glasgow Scale (FIGS) questionnaire. FIGS is a simple point scale used to assess a patient's ability to speak, chew and swallow. Each of these functions is scored independently on a scale of 1-5, five being no disability and one meaning the patient has an inability to speak, chew, or swallow., month 1 and month 6
Different treatments have been proposed for the management of oral leukoplakia (OL) in order to prevent oral squamous cell carcinoma onset. However, there is still no consensus on the most effective approach for the patients affected by such oral potentially malignant disorders. Surgery is often performed, but there is no randomized clinical trial which demonstrates its real effectiveness in preventing oral cancer onset.

A recent RCT compared surgical treatment with "wait and see approach" care in patients with nondysplastic OL, assuming that regular clinical follow-up could be considered a reliable standard of care among patients with nondysplastic oral leukoplakias.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of surgical excision in treating OL and or reducing the onset of potential oral squamous cell carcinoma, with a follow-up of 5 years. This study will be the first RCT comparing the effectiveness of surgery to "wait and see approach" in the management of both dysplastic and nondysplastic oral leukoplakias.
