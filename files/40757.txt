Frailty is an age-related syndrome characterized with diminished physiological reserve that results in decreased homeostatic capacity and increased vulnerability to any stress from minor to major. Approximately 10% to 20% of adults aged 65 years and older present with frailty, and the incidence doubles among those of 85 years and older. Among elderly cancer patients especially those with digestive cancer, the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty can be as high as 50%. Malnutrition often coexists with frailty, and indeed contribute to the development of frailty. As a matter of fact, the proportion of malnutrition also increases with age even in high-income countries.

Frailty is strongly associated with worsening outcomes in surgical patients, including higher delirium, high non-delirium complications, high perioperative mortality, as well as decreased activity of daily life, cognitive dysfunction and work disability in long-term survivors. Furthermore, malnutrition as a prominent factor in the development of frailty also has adverse impacts on the duration of hospitalization, complications, and survival after surgery. Therefore, it is urgently needed to understand how to enhance the recovery of these patients following surgery.

Exercises and rehabilitation, in combination with nutritional supplement, may reverse or mitigate frailty, promote postoperative recovery, and improve clinical outcomes. However, the reported effectiveness varies with interventions and are not sufficiently robust to guide good clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of multimodal prehabilitation on early and long-term outcomes in elderly patients with frailty.
