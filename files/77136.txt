Evaluate the Port-wine Stain Birthmark Treatment Before and After Pulsed Dye Laser Treatment
Port-wine stain is a congenital, progressive vascular malformation of human skin involving post-capillary venules that occurs in an estimated 0.3% of children and can alter personality development and psychological in children.
Port-wine Stain
DEVICE: Photo Acoustic Microscopy and Optical Coherence tomography
evaluate the port-wine stain birthmark, pulsed dye laser treatment, up to 12 months
The researchers at University of California, Irvine and Washington University in Saint Louis are collaborating in this project and developes new multiple imaging devices call photoacoustic microscopy and optical coherence tomography imaging technologies can be use to evaluate the response of port-wine stain from Pulse Dye Laser treatment.
