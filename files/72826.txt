A Phase II Study of Iressa in Patients With Chemo Refractory Germ Cell Tumors Expressing EGFR
This study will evaluate the use of ZD1839 in the treatment of subjects with refractory germ cell tumors. Subjects will take ZD1839 for one year in the absence of excessive toxicity or decision to withdraw.
Refractory Germ Cell Tumors Expressing EGRF
DRUG: ZD1839 Iressa
To determine the response rate of ZD1839
To determine duration of response, time to progression and overall survival
The primary objective is to determine the response rate of ZD1839 in patients with refractory germ cell tumors expressing EGFR. The secondary objectives are to determine the duration of response, time to progression and overall survival in patients with refractory germ cell tumors expressing EGFR and treated with ZD1839; to evaluate the tolerability of ZD1839 in patients with refractory germ cell tumors and to correlate tumor response to degree of EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry.
