Characterizing Chemo-Radiotherapy Treatment-Related Cardiac Changes
This trial studies cardiac changes after radiation or chemo-radiation for the treatment of lung or esophageal cancer that has not spread to other places in the body (non-metastatic) or has not come back (non-recurrent). Continuous cardiac monitoring with an implanted device may help to identify cardiac changes that would remain unnoticed, and facilitate the treatment of these early cardiac changes as part of standard care.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|DEVICE: Cardiac Event Monitor|OTHER: Chemoradiotherapy|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Cardiac event rate at 12 months, Assessed as any cardiac event after registration, including electrophysiological changes as defined by the continuous insertable cardiac monitor (ICM); congestive heart failure (CHF); myocardial infarction; pericarditis or myocarditis; cardiac ablation or cardiac pacemaker; cardiac stent placement or any coronary procedure for coronary damage; or any cardiac event as defined by the patients' medical records or autopsy if done., Up to 12 months
Loco-regional recurrence, Loco-regional recurrence is defined as local recurrences of the cancer in the same location where the disease was found on any diagnostic or staging study., Up to 12 months|Disease-free survival, Disease- free survival is defined as the time from study registration until any disease recurrence or death., Up to 12 months|Distant recurrence, Distant recurrence is defined as metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread to organs or tissues far from the original cancer) that has either been biopsy confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent., Up to 12 months|Cardiac event free survival, Cardiac event free survival is defined as the time from registration to any cardiac event or death., Up to 12 months|Cardiac death, Cardiac death is defined as the time from registration to death due to cardiac reasons. Cardiac death would include documented congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia\*, heart block\*, or any other cardiac cause documented in the medical records, death certificate, or autopsy as one of the major contributing causes of death. \*Any lethal electrophysiologic change documented by before death would also be included., Up to 12 months|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause., Up to 12 months|Incidence of acute adverse events (AE), Adverse Event incidence and severity will be measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0., Within the first 6 months from the date of enrollment|Incidence of late adverse events, Adverse Event incidence and severity will be measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0., After the first 6 months from the date of enrollment|Cause specific survival, Cause specific survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to cancer., Up to 12 months
Imaging changes, Imaging changes in the heart substructures associated with occurrence of cardiac events will be an exploratory component of this trial. Changes will be described at each time point using frequency distributions., Baseline up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the 12-month cardiac event rate after radiation or chemo-radiation for the treatment of lung or esophageal cancer.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Define the spectrum of cardiac toxicity among chemoradiotherapy (CRT) patients at highest risk of cardiac toxicity.

II. Establish the timeline of cardiac toxicity development and identify early predictive findings of permanent damage.

III. Characterize the areas of the heart at highest risk for persistent cardiac damage.

IV. Identify a dose response threshold for radiotherapy (RT) damage in different areas of the heart.

V. Improve survival by alerting the cardiology team of the need for life-saving standard of care interventions.

VI. Describe medical interventions employed for the cardiac events identified in the study.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive cardiac monitor implants then undergo standard of care RT or CRT at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients also undergo blood sample collection at baseline, 4 weeks, 3, 9, and 12 months.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 9 and 12 months post RT.
