A Study of V503 (A Multivalent Human Papillomavirus [HPV] L1 Virus-Like Particle [VLP] Vaccine) in Preadolescents and Adolescents (V503-002)
This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of V503 (a multivalent human papillomavirus \[HPV\] L1 virus-like particle \[VLP\] vaccine) in preadolescent and adolescent participants between 9 and 15 years old and demonstrate the consistency of the manufactured vaccine through assessment of 3 different final manufacturing process lots of V503.

The primary hypotheses are as follows:

1. The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine when administered to preadolescent and adolescent boys and girls 9 to 15 years of age and young women 16 to 26 years of age is generally well-tolerated.
2. 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induces non-inferior immune responses in preadolescent and adolescent girls 9 to 15 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type compared to young women 16 to 26 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative Day 1 through Month 7 to the relevant HPV type, as measured by anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 4 weeks post-dose 3.
3. The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induces non-inferior immune responses in preadolescent and adolescent boys 9 to 15 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type compared to young women 16 to 26 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 and PCR-negative Day 1 through Month 7 to the relevant HPV type, as measured by anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 GMTs at 4 weeks post-dose 3.
4. Three separate final manufacturing process (FMP) lots of the 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induce similar immune responses, as measured by anti-HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 GMTs at 4 weeks post-dose 3.
