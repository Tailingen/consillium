Ultrasound and Cytological Evaluation 3 Years After Radiofrequency Thermal Ablation of Benign Thyroid Nodules : a Prospective Exploratory Cohort of 180 Nodules
There is no scientific data on post-thermal ablation cytological aspects, but treated nodules that grow back significantly after a procedure justify a new cytology in order not to ignore a neoplastic process.

The EU-TIRADS classification usually used to stratify the risk of cancer (and to justify a fine needle aspiration biopsy) of thyroid nodules is not validated for nodules treated by thermal ablation (TA) (post-RF nodules). However, these nodules often acquire ultrasound criteria of suspicion making it necessary to develop an ultrasound stratification of the risk of malignancy specific to nodules treated by TA.

The objective of this work is to describe the ultrasound and cytological aspects of these treated nodules by performing a systematic assessment at 3 years after thermal ablation including systematic neck ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy. Thus, an ultrasound and cytological atlas (Bethesda classification 2017) of nodules treated by thermal ablation will be constituted.
