Early Palliative Care for Patients With Haematological Malignancies
Patients suffering from haematological disease present symptoms of discomfort and currently benefit from palliative care skills only for the management of their end-of-life. However, in medical oncology, more and more studies tend to demonstrate the benefit on the quality of life of an early collaboration between the two specialties.

Investigator did the hypothesis that early integration of palliative care with conventional haematological care could decrease discomfort symptoms and add a real benefit on the patients' quality of life .

Quality of life evaluation: standardized questionnaire, Evaluation of quality of life by a standardized questionnaire : Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An). The higher is the score the better is the quality of life. FACT-An is composed by five subscales: Physical Well-Being \[score range 0-28\], Social/Family Well-Being \[score range 0-28\], Emotional Well-Being \[score range 0-24\], and Functional Well-Being \[score range 0-28\] and specific questions concerning anemia \[score range 0-80\]. The score at each items is summed. The sum is multiplied par the number of items in the subscale and then divided by the number of items answered. This produces the subscale score. The subscale scores are added to derive total score \[score range 0-188\]., at 6 months
