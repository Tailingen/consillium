Study of Lenvatinib in Combination With Everolimus in Participants With Unresectable Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
Phase 1 study to investigate the tolerability and safety of lenvatinib in combination with Everolimus in participants with unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Everolimus
Number of Participants Who Experienced Any Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as toxicity related to the combination therapy and was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03)., From first dose of study drug up to Cycle 1 Day 28 (Cycle length=28 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 21.5 months)
Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Levatinib and Everolimus, Cycle 1 Day 1 predose and at 1, 2, 4 ,8, and 24 hours postdose (Cycle length=28 days)|Css,Max: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration at Steady State for Levatinib and Everolimus, Cycle 1 Day 15 predose and at 1, 2, 4 ,8, and 24 hours postdose (Cycle length=28 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Levatinib and Everolimus, Cycle 1 Day 1 predose and at 1, 2, 4 ,8, and 24 hours postdose (Cycle length=28 days)|Tss,Max: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) at Steady State for Levatinib and Everolimus, Cycle 1 Day 15 predose and at 1, 2, 4 ,8, and 24 hours postdose (Cycle length=28 days)|AUC 0-t: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Zero (Pre-dose) to Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration for Levatinib and Everolimus, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15 predose and at 1, 2, 4 ,8, and 24 hours postdose (Cycle length=28 days)|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR), BOR included complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and PD (progressive disease). BOR was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) 1.1, From first dose of study drug until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 23 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved BOR of CR or PR. ORR was assessed using RECIST 1.1., From first dose of study drug until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 23 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved BOR of CR, PR, or SD. DCR was assessed based on RECIST 1.1., From first dose of study drug until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 23 months)|Number of Participants With the Minimum Percent Change From Baseline in the Sum of Diameters of Target Lesions, Baseline up to first tumor assessment at which diameter of target lesions were available (up to approximately 23 months)
Phase 1 study to investigate the tolerability and safety of lenvatinib in combination with Everolimus in participants with unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC.
