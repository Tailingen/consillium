Comparison of Obturator Nerve Blockade and Neuromuscular Blockade
Patients diagnosed with posterolateral bladder tumors will be invited to participate in the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided obturator block or a neuromuscular blocking agent after the induction of general anesthesia in an attempt to block the obturator reflex during surgery.
Cancer of Bladder
DRUG: Obturator block|DRUG: Neuromuscular block
Number of Patients With Incidence of Intraoperative Adductor Spasm, Nerve Integrity Monitor will be used to detect adductor spasm and below are listed the numbers or patients with increased incidence of adductor spasm., intraoperative
Number Patients With Increased Risk of Falling, Based on TUG time measurements of patients below are the numbers of patients with an increased risk of falling., Changes from baseline (pre-op) to 72 hours post-operative|Number of Patients With Incidence of Leg Weakness, Test the strength of subject's lower extremity muscles on the timed up and go (TUG) test and determine how many patients had increased leg weakness., Changes from baseline (pre-op) to 72 hours post-operative
The purpose of this research is to compare the incidence of adductor spasm in patients undergoing general anesthesia with neuromuscular blocking agents versus obturator block. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s) (TURBT) is a commonly performed procedure to diagnose and treat bladder cancer. The obturator nerve is located lateral to the bladder wall in the pelvis prior to innervating the adductor muscles of the thigh. Depending on the location of the tumor(s), electrocautery or surgical stimulation may result in stimulation of the obturator nerve, resulting in adduction of the leg, which is called the adductor reflex or spasm. This may occur violently and unexpectedly, and result in bladder perforation, bleeding, or cancer dissemination.
