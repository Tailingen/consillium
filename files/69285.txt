A Clinical Study on the Feasibility and Safety of Abdominal Endoscopic Single-port Surgery System to Assist Gynecological Day Surgery
In this study, a prospective study is used to select patients who will undergo intra-abdominal endoscopic single-port surgery system for benign gynecological diseases from February 2025 to December 2026 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, including hysterectomy, myomectomy, ovarian cyst removal and adnexectomy. The study will perform statistical analysis to evaluate the feasibility and the main factors affecting the safety of intra-abdominal endoscopic single-port surgery system(SR-ENS-600) used in gynecological day surgery.
