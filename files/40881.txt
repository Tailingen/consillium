Study for Treatment of Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck or Skin
This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of TH-4000, a hypoxia-activated prodrug in participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or skin.

Hypoxic volume as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) hypoxia imaging, Baseline
An open label, multi-center Phase 2 study in which the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of TH-4000 will be assessed in participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or skin.

Hypoxia PET scans will be obtained in select centers to analyze potential predictors of tumor response.
