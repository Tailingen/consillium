A Study of PM1021 (Anti-TIGIT) With or Without PM8001 (Anti-PD-L1/TGF-Î²) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this research is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of PM1021 Monotherapy and PM1021 in Combination with PM8001 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumours. In this study, up to 30 patients will be enrolled in Australia only.

Advanced solid cancers are associated with poor prognosis and pose a significant challenge for treatment strategies. Effective treatments for advanced metastatic malignancies that have failed available standard of care treatment represent a major unmet medical need.

Biotheus Inc. is developing PM1021, a monoclonal anti-T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT) antibody (IgG1) and PM8001 (a PD-L1/TGF-beta bispecific Fc fusion protein) as treatment for advanced solid tumours.

This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase I study including a first-in-human study for PM1021, and the combination therapy of PM1021 with PM8001. The study will be following the accelerated titration design and the classic 3+3 design, and dose escalation will be investigated for PM1021 monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with PM8001 (Part B), respectively. In the absence of DLTs in Parts A and B, patients will continue to receive combination therapy (Part C) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, until the patient withdraws/is withdrawn, or study completion.

Up to 30 patients are planned to be enrolled. Four dose levels (150mg, 450 mg, 900 mg, and 1200 mg) of PM1021 with or without PM8001 (20 mg/kg) treatment will be explored in this study.
