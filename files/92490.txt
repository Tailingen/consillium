A Study of SHR-A1811 and Fulvestrant, With or Without HS-10352, in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-A1811 and Fulvestrant in Combination with or without HS-10352 in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients. Subjects will receive SHR-A1811 and Fulvestrant in Combination with or without HS-10352.

This study plans to enroll breast cancer patients whose disease progressed during treatment or within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy and who have not received prior systemic therapy. SHR-A1811 + fulvestrant group will receive treatment with SHR-A1811 and fulvestrant. HS-10352 group will receive treatment with SHR-A1811, fulvestrant, and HS-10352. Treatment will continue until disease progression or the occurrence of intolerable toxicity.
