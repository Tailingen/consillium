Second Line Therapy for Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a prospective, Two-arm, comparative, randomized, controlled phase II trial, to explore the efficacy and safety of Regorafenib and HAIC vs. FOLFOX as Second Line Therapy for Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Regorafenib and HAIC|DRUG: FOLFOX
Objective response rate (ORR), the rate of complete response and partial response among all evaluable patients, 12month
Disease control rate (DCR), the rate of complete response, partial response and stable disease among all evaluable patients, 12 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) or death of any cause., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), Duration from the date of initial treatment to the date of death due to any cause., 24 months|Adverse events (AE), Adverse events in each cycle were documented based on CTCAE v 4.03, 24 months
Currently, complete surgical resection represents the only potentially curative treatment option for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, including intrahepatic, hilar and distal CCA) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA). However,only less than 25% of patients are resectable at diagnosis and, even in this subset of patients, relapse rate is high.

Cisplatin and gemcitabine combination was identified as the standard first-line chemotherapy, yielding a median progression free survival (PFS) and median OS of 8.5 and 11.7 months, respectively. FOLFOX was the standard second-line chemotherapy. But the benefit of FOLFOX was limited.
