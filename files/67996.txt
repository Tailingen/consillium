Upon the successful product generation of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel, subjects will enter the treatment phase of the study. Treatment will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by Relmacabtagene Autoleucel administration. Subjects will then enter the post-treatment follow-up phase of the study and will be followed for approximately 24 months for safety, disease status, and survival. Long-term follow-up will continue under a separate long-term follow-up protocol, currently up to 15 years after the last Relmacabtagene Autoleucel administration.
