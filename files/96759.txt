Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy for Treatment of Adult GBM
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if DOC1021 + pIFN alongside standard of care (SOC) will improve survival in adult patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma (IDH-wt). It will also evaluate the safety of DOC1021 + pIFN. Researchers will compare DOC1021 dendritic cell immunotherapy regimen added to SOC compared to SOC treatment alone.

Participants in the DOC1021 + pIFN + SOC arm will:

* Take filgrastim subcutaneously x 5 doses and subsequently undergo a leukapheresis collection
* Undergo ultrasound guided perinodal DOC1021 injections every 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses
* Receive subcutaneous pIFN injections weekly for a total of 6 doses in parallel with the DOC1021 injections

Both arms of the trial will:

- Visit the clinic regularly to assess quality of life, symptoms, medication use, imaging, bloodwork, and to receive SOC treatment with surgery, temozolomide chemotherapy and radiation
Glioblastoma (GBM)
BIOLOGICAL: DOC1021|PROCEDURE: Tumor resection|DRUG: Temodar (Temozolomide)|RADIATION: SOC cranial radiation
Time in months from initial diagnosis of new diagnosed GBM until death for each participant, 5 years
Number of total participants treated with DOC1021 alive at one year post-GBM diagnosis date, One-year survival, 1 years|Number of total participants treated with DOC1021 alive two years post-GBM diagnosis date, 2-year survival rate, 2 years|Number of total participants treated with DOC1021 alive three years post-GBM diagnosis date, 3-year survival, 3 years|Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 3 years|Time in months from initial diagnosis of new diagnosed GBM until declared progression on imaging by RANO 2.0 criteria for all participants, 3 years
Health-related quality of life in all participants as assessed by EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Cancer QLC-C30 (Cancer 30-items) with QLQ-BN20 (Brain 20-items) module included., All items are scored 1 (worse outcome) to 4 (better outcome) or 1 (worse outcome) to 7 (better outcome). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., 5 years|Neuro-cognitive function in all participants as Assessed by the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale, 5 years
