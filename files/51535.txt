Study of PYX-201 in Solid Tumors
The primary objectives of this study are to determine the recommended dose(s) of PYX-201 for participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) solid tumors, and to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in participants treated with PYX-201 as a single agent.

DRUG: PYX-201
Part 1: Number of Participants who Experience a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as (1) an adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications that occurs after the treatment with PYX-201 and (2) meets any of the predefined criteria outlined in the protocol., Day 1 to Day 21|Part 1: Number of Participants who Experience an AE, Type, incidence, seriousness, relationship to study treatment and severity of AEs, including serious AEs and AEs at Grade 3 or above, based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0.
