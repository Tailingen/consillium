Survey on Lymphedema After Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in People With Cervical or Vulvar Cancer
The purpose of this study is to collect information that may identify people who are at risk of developing lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) during surgery for early-stage vulvar or cervical cancer, and to improve the quality and accuracy of the information that is given to people who have this procedure.

Please note that, during this study, the researchers will collect information from a questionnaire completed by people who had SLN and LND+/- SLN during surgery for early-stage cervical or vulvar cancer. No form of treatment will be provided as part of the study, and no investigational tests or procedures will be performed.
