Interaction Study of Zanubrutinib With Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors in Participants With B-Cell Malignancies
The primary objective of this study was to assess the steady-state zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics (PK) when co-administered with moderate and strong cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitors.
