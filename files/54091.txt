FLT PET/CT for Staging, Target Definition and Assessment of Response to Therapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this pilot study is to develop a more advanced software program that will collect, compare and analyze tumor images for evaluation. Another purpose of this study is to learn if a new radio-tracer for tumor imaging called 3'-deoxy-3'(18) F-fluorothymidine (FLT) can improve the evaluation of tumors during a PET/CT scan. This new type of image tracking is meant to improve the visualization of tumor active and size.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: 3'-deoxy-3'-(18) F-fluorothymidine
Feasibility: Determined by the Number of Participants Who Had All Three Sets of Completed Serial PET Scans That Were Imported for Analysis, Determine the possibility of aquiring three sets of serial Positron emission tomography (PET) scans from 5 patients at designated time points and to develop a mechanism to import and analyze images from F-fluoro-3'-deoxy-3'-L-fluorothymidine (FLT)-PET, Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG)-PET and Computed Tomography (CT) on a single advanced software platform with deformable image registration capability. We will report patient acceptance of and compliance with this regimen, as well as the utility of the software platform for conducting the proposed analysis., 1 year
Analyze Correlation Between FDG and FLT PET Scans, and the Correlation Between Both Types of PET Scan and the Response to Treatment., We will compare the findings of FDG and FLT PET scans at pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post-treatment time points to determine how closely they correlate with each other, and if there is a specific time point at which any observed differences between FDG and FLT PET scans are most pronounced. We will also determine which of the six PET scans may correlate most closely with the response to treatment as determined by pathologic findings at esophagectomy., 1 year
* The following are standard medical procedures that are part of regular cancer care that the participant would probably have done even if they did not join the study: Chemotherapy; physical examination; pregnancy test (if applicable); diagnostic FDG-PET/CT scan before and after treatment to evaluate disease.
* The following diagnostic procedures are being done specifically because of this study: Three FLT-PET/CT scans before, during and after treatment and one FDG PET/CT scan during treatment.
* Participants will be in this research study for approximately 12-14 weeks.
