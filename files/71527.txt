Effects of a Strength Physical Exercise Program in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a hematological neoplasm that primarily affects older individuals and is the most common type of leukemia in adults in Western countries. CLL mainly affects older adults, with an average age at diagnosis of around 70 years, and there is a slightly higher risk in men compared to women. It is characterized by the proliferation of clonal B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs. Although CLL has a relatively slow progression in many cases, patients may experience chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, functional impairment, and psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression, which significantly affect their quality of life.

In this context, it has been shown that physical exercise, especially strength training, can considerably improve physical and psychological conditions in oncology populations, such as those with breast cancer and colorectal cancer, as well as in older adults, where the benefits of resistance training are widely recognized. These benefits include increased muscle strength, reduced fatigue, improved functional abilities, psychological well-being, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, there is evidence that exercise can reduce systemic inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and improve lipid profiles by lowering total cholesterol and triglycerides, which is crucial for cancer patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases.

OTHER: Exercise|OTHER: Home exercise
Frailty, Frailty will be assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scale, which includes three components: a balance test, gait speed, and a chair stand test. The scale has a maximum score of 12 points, with higher scores reflecting better physical function., 8 weeks
Quality of life, Quality of life assessment: This will be conducted using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ). It is a general quality of life instrument for cancer patients. This questionnaire consists of 30 items, 24 of which are grouped into five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), and one global health status scale. The remaining six items assess five symptoms (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea) and economic impact. A high score on the functional scale indicates greater functional capacity, while a high score on the symptom scale indicates greater distress., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Anxiety and depression, Anxiety and depression assessment: These will be evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a reliable and valid questionnaire, consisting of seven questions (rated from 0 to 3) related to anxiety (subscale A) and another seven related to depression (subscale D), thus providing two separate scores., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Fatigue, Fatigue assessment: This will be measured using the 13-item subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F). The FACT-F is a self-report questionnaire specifically designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by individuals with cancer and is the most widely used. It consists of 27 items in the general FACT section and an additional 13 items in the fatigue subscale, with scores ranging from 0 to 160. Higher scores on this scale indicate lower levels of fatigue., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Sleep quality, Sleep quality assessment: The evaluation of insomnia will be conducted using the Athens Insomnia Scale. It consists of 8 items that assess sleep induction, awakenings during the night, early awakenings, duration, sleep quality, and daytime functioning. The response system is Likert-type, ranging from 0 (absence of the problem) to 3 (serious problem), and the overall score on the scale varies from 0 to 24 points., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Muscle strength, The strength of both the lower and upper limbs will be assessed.The Jamar® dynamometer (J00105 Lafayette Instrument Company, USA), a hydraulic dynamometer considered the gold standard in the evaluation of grip strength, will be used. Both hands will be measured. The measurement will be performed following the Southampton Protocol. The patient will be seated in a chair with a backrest and the test will be explained to them. Three consecutive measurements will be taken on the same hand with a duration of 5 seconds per contraction and with an interval of 10 seconds between measurements. Encouraging commands will be given during the test to squeeze harder. The patient shall be seated in a chair with backrest, shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90°, forearm in neutral position and wrist in slight extension (0°-30°). The second Jamar® position shall be selected for all participants, with the exception of small hands which shall be placed in the first position., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Body composition, Body composition assessment: The body mass index (BMI), appendicular lean mass (ALM), and estimated muscle mass will be calculated. This will be performed using electrical bioimpedance, which estimates muscle mass based on the electrical conductivity of the whole body. The TANITA BC-418 Body Composition Analyzer will be used., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Physical activity level, Physical activity level assessment: This will be determined using the validated IPAQ-e questionnaire for older adults., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.|Physical performance, In addition to the SPPB, walking speed is assessed as a measure of physical performance associated with frailty using the four-meter walk test (4MWT). The patient starts walking one meter before the start line, where the stopwatch is activated, and is instructed to maintain his or her usual speed until four meters past the finish line. The test is performed three times, and the best value is recorded, 8 weeks|Blood biomarker, Blood biomarker assessment: A blood sample will be taken prior to the start of the exercise program and another within two weeks after its completion. Data from blood samples included in routine clinical practice will be collected to obtain lipid profile values. Additionally, a proteomic analysis of the samples will be conducted at the Cancer Research Center (Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer Institute - Laboratory 11 of Dr. Manuel Fuentes García)., From enrollment to the end of the treatment, 8 weeks.
Current research on the effects of physical exercise in patients with CLL is limited. While some studies suggest that cancer patients may benefit from physical exercise, most research has focused on other types of cancer, such as breast, lung, or colorectal cancer. In the case of patients with CLL, in addition to functional and psychological issues, they often experience chronic inflammation and alterations in lipid profiles, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular comorbidities.

Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), are common in patients with CLL, and it has been suggested that modulating these markers through exercise may help control systemic inflammation. Strength training, in particular, could be beneficial for improving the inflammatory and lipid profiles in these patients, although this has not been thoroughly evaluated in this population.

Regarding mental health, studies have reported that patients with CLL experience high levels of anxiety and depression, which significantly deteriorate their quality of life. In other oncology populations, exercise has proven effective in reducing these symptoms and improving overall well-being. However, it has not been sufficiently studied whether these effects can be replicated in patients with CLL, representing a gap in the current literature.

Finally, the loss of muscle strength, a key indicator in the diagnosis of sarcopenia according to the diagnostic algorithm proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People in 2019 (EWGSOP2), should be considered another common issue in patients with CLL, due to both the average age of the patients (70 years) and the disease itself or the side effects of treatment. Although it has been shown that physical exercise in general, and strength exercise in particular, can improve muscle strength and functional capacity in older adults and cancer patients, studies evaluating these effects in patients with CLL are lacking. Assessing how a strength training program can influence functional recovery and improve the quality of life of these patients is crucial for their clinical management.
