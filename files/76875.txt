Phase I/II Trial of Cord Blood-Derived NK Cells Genetically Engineered With NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 Cell Receptor for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
To find the recommended dose of NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK cells that can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory MM.

To learn if the dose of NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK cells found in Part A can help to control the disease.
Myeloma
DRUG: Fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

* Part A: To assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and determine the safety and optimal cell dose of NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK cells in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
* Part B: To assess the day +90 overall response rate in patients treated at the optimal cell dose.

Secondary Objectives:

* Assess day +180 progression-free survival (PFS).
* Quantify the persistence of infused allogeneic donor TCR-transduced CB-derived NK cells in the recipient.
* To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.
* To obtain preliminary data on quality of life and patient experience.
* Assess duration of response (DOR)

Secondary end points

* Day +180 PFS rate;
* NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK cell numbers in peripheral blood vs time profile;
* Characterization of lymphocyte populations at various time points;
* PROMIS-29 quality of life questionnaire score.
* Duration of response
