Number of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that was not present prior to the start date of study drug or was worsened during treatment and 100 days after last dose of treatment. An AE that was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared and the event severity increase while the participant was on treatment is also a TEAE. A severe AE (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, and is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

This Phase 1 study is comprised of dose escalation and cohort expansions for FPT155 monotherapy and for FPT155 in combination with pembrolizumab. Monotherapy dose escalation is designed with initial accelerated titration followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation; combination dose escalation uses a standard 3+3 design. Patients will remain on study treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other specified reason for discontinuation.
