The Senstivity and Specificity of Using Salivary miRNAs in Detection of Malignant Transformation of Oral Lesions.
Due to cancer is a leading cause of death world wide , we will coduct the study to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of using salivary miRNAs (412,512) from the salivary extracellular vesicles (index test) in detection of the malignant transformation of the premalignant lesions using the qualitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in comparison to taking biopsy .
Oral Premalignant Lesions
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: using salivary miRNA (412,512)
the sensitivity and specificity of salivary miRNAs (412,512) to detect the malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant lesions, measuring the sensitivity and specificity of using the salivary miRNAs(412,512)to detect the malignant transformation in potentially malignant lesions, 2 years
our study is a case control study,we will coduct our study to evaluate specificity and sensitivity of using salivary extracellular vesicles miRNAs (412,512) in detection of malignant transformation in potientially malignant oral lesions by using qRT-PCR analysis ,participants will be selected and arranged in 3 groups the control group, potentially malignant group and malignant group ,the salivary samples from the participants will be collected and then microRNA extraction steps will be done through the laboratory steps ,that include extracellular vesicles isolation, PCR Analysis for miRNA-412 and miRNA-512 expression ,also the histopathologic diagnosis and examination of all specimens were confirmed by pathologist.
