This study is a prospective, multi-center case series of per standard of care colonoscopy procedures using a nonsignificant risk Saneso 360 degree colonoscope. 40 cases were included at 3 clinical sites. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria were included and had a clinically indicated colonoscopy procedure performed using the study device. Immediately thereafter, patients had a colonoscopy procedure using standard colonoscope (Olympus CF 180) by a second endoscopist. Enrolled subjects were followed for 7 days after their procedure. If the procedure was not successful with the study device, the endoscopist completed the procedure with a traditional colonoscope used at each facility. This study was approved by the institutional review board of respective sites. The clinical trial was conducted in accordance with the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
