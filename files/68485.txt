Dose Escalation Radiotherapy With Modulation of Intensity and Integrated Boost (SIB-IMRT) in the Treatment of Glioblastomas in Adults
The main goal of this study is to evaluate and to determine the dose of a highly accurate irradiation (allowing to increase the dose delivered while restricting the risk of complication) in association with temozolomide.
