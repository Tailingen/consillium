Regional Radiotherapy in Biomarker Low-Risk Node Positive and T3N0 Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on low risk breast cancer receiving usual care that includes regional radiation therapy, with receiving no regional radiation therapy. Researchers want to see if not giving this type of radiation treatment works as well at preventing breast cancer from coming back.

compare the breast cancer recurrence-free interval (BCRFI) between patients that received regional RT or not, Defined as time from randomization to time of invasive recurrent disease in the ipsilateral chestwall, breast, regional nodes, distant sites or death due to BC., 9.5 years
Compare the invasive disease-free survival between patients that received regional RT or not., Defined as time from randomization to time of invasive recurrent disease in the ipsilateral chestwall, breast, regional nodes, distant sites or death due to BC, 9.5 years|Compare the breast cancer mortality between patients that received regional RT or not., Defined as death due to BC, 9.5 years|Compare the overall survival (OS) between patients that received regional RT or not, Defined as the time from randomization to the time of death from any cause, 9.5 years|Compare the locoregional recurrence-free interval (LRRFI) between patients that received regional RT or not., Defined as time from randomization to time of invasive recurrent disease in the ipsilateral chestwall, breast or regional nodes, or death to due to BC, 9.5 years|Compare the distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) between patients that received regional RT or not., Defined as time from randomization to time of invasive recurrent disease in distant sites or death due to BC, 9.5 years|Number and severity of adverse events using the current CTCAE version 4, 9.5 years|Compare arm volume and mobility measurements between patients that received regional RT or not, A Fisher's Exact Test will be used to compare lymphedema and arm abduction deficit between two arms. Defined as a difference in arm abduction of 10% or greater in the comparison of the ipsilateral to the contralateral arm., 9.5 years|Compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and the quality of life (QOL) between patients that received regional RT or not, using the NSABP Questionnaire for patients treated by BCS or mastectomy., 9.5 years|Compare the quality of life (QOL) between patients that received regional RT or not, Overall QOL (EORTC QLQ-C30) will be compared between the two treatment groups using a similar approach., 9.5 years|Compare the cost-effectiveness between patients that received regional RT or not, Costs will be expressed in $US and $CAN base currencies based on the final year of the study. An average cost per study subject by treatment arm for an overall mean cost per study arm will be generated, 9.5 years|Compare the quality of life (QOL) between patients that received regional RT or not, breast symptoms (NSABP B32 Questionnaire) will be compared between the two treatment groups using a similar approach., 9.5 years|Compare the quality of life (QOL) between patients that received regional RT or not, skin symptoms and fatigue (EORTC QLQ-BR23) will be compared between the two treatment groups using a similar approach., 9.5 years
Women with node positive breast cancer normally will receive endocrine therapy and some may receive chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from coming back. Many women will also receive radiotherapy to the whole breast/chest area and the surrounding lymph glands (called regional radiotherapy). No one really knows whether patients with low risk breast cancer need to receive regional radiotherapy. Some women may be getting regional radiotherapy who do not need it. These women may be exposed to the side effects of their treatment without benefit.
