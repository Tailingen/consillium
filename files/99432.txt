The Application of Pectoral Nerve II(PECS II)block in Breast Fibroadenoma Resection Surgery
Patients were randomly assigned to the GA group, PECS II group, or TPVB group using a computer-generated random number table. Group assignments were kept in a sealed envelope, which was opened only after induction of general anesthesia on the day of surgery. This study was a double-blind trial, ensuring that neither the patients nor the investigators were aware of the analgesic method used. The same anesthesiologist was responsible for PECS II block or TPVB, while different anesthesiologists were responsible for anesthesia implementation and postoperative follow-up.
