An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study of Nivolumab Given After Surgery in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Participants With Minimal Residual Disease
The purpose of this study is to determine if nivolumab added to the standard of care therapy (SOC) given after surgery is more effective than SOC alone in prolonging disease free survival in NSCLC participants with minimal residual disease detected after surgery.
