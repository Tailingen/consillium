Using CICS-1 and SPM-011 and ［18F］FBPA Commissioned by CICS and Sumitomo Heavy Industries and STELLA PHARMA
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) in patients with recurrent thoracic solid tumors that are difficult to treat with standard radiation therapy or drug therapy and are unresectable. With "lung," "heart," "liver," "spinal cord," and "esophagus" as common risk organs in the treatment plan for BNCT using therapeutic CT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BNCT in patients with unresectable and recurrent thoracic solid tumors which are difficult to treat with standard radiation and drug therapy.

To evaluate the safety of ［18F］FBPA synthesized with MPS200FBPA. In addition, the usefulness of ［18F］FBPA-PET testing to determine the appropriateness of performing BNCT will be evaluated in an exploratory manner.
