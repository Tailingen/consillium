Anti-CD19 CAR-Engineered NK Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study is a single arm clinical study to observe the safety ，dose tolerance and pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR NK-CD19 in patients with recurrent or refractory CD19 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness, the immunogenicity of the product and the correlation between the changes of cytokines after infusion and CRS , ICANS.

It is planned to select 9-21 patients with recurrent or refractory CD19 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia （ALL）, from the lowest dose group. It is expected that 3-6 cases will be enrolled in each dose group. The protocol will be performed into screening period (-30\~-10 days), prophase of lymophodepletion (-10\~-5 days), Lymophodepletion (-5\~-3 days), pre-infusion evaluation (-2\~-1 days), infusion (day 0), and follow-up period (1-720 days). The incidence of DLT is observed after infusion. There are three preset dose groups in this clinical trial. The initial dose is 1.0 × 107 CAR positive NK cells/kg (body weight). Subsequent dose groups included 2.0 × 107 and 3.0 × 107 CAR positive NK cells/kg (body weight). The specific dose is determined by SRC based on the patient safety data and PK data. The maximum sample size of this study is tentatively 21 cases.
