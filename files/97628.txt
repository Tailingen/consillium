A Study of C-CAR039 (Prizloncabtagene Autoleucel) in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma
This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety of Prizloncabtagene Autoleucel (Prizlon-cel) and establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) (Phase 1b) and to evaluate the efficacy of Prizlon-cel (Phase 2) in patients with relapsed or refractory large b-cell lymphoma (LBCL).

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Prizlon-cel. It includes two phases, Phase 1b and Phase 2. In Phase 1b study, RP2D will be determined. The selected dose will be further evaluated in the Phase 2 study. The study includes the following sequential procedures: Screening, Apheresis and CAR-T manufacturing, Baseline, Lymphodepletion, CAR-T infusion, DLT period (Phase 1b) and Follow-up Visit. Subjects will be followed for at least 2 years after Prizlon-cel infusion, with up to 15 years long-term follow-up on a separate study.
