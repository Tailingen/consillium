A Study of BBI608 Administered in Combination With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Adult Patients With Advanced Cancers
This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study of BBI608 administered in combination with immunotherapy in adult patients with advanced cancers. The goal of the study is to determine the RP2D of BBI608 in combination with each of the immunotherapeutic agents.

DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Determination of the safety and tolerability of BBI608 administered in combination with selected immunotherapeutic agent by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 6 weeks|Determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 6 weeks
Assessment of the preliminary anti-tumor activity by performing tumor assessments every 8 weeks (Phase 2 portion), Evaluation of anti-tumor activity will be performed according to Immune Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST)., 6 months|Pharmacokinetic profile of BBI608 administered in combination with the selected immunotherapeutic agent as assessed by maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve, -5min, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 hours on day 1, cycles 1 and 2|Pharmacodynamic activity of BBI608 administered in combination with the selected immunotherapeutic agent as assessed by biomarker analysis, Histopathology and Cancer Stem Cell assays will be performed to provide information of the biomarkers on biopsied patient tumor tissue, and archival samples., 6 months
