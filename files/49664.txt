Bispecific Antibody in Finding Tumor Cells in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as radionuclide imaging using bispecific antibody, may help find colorectal cancer cells and learn the extent of disease.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well a bispecific antibody works in finding tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer.

OTHER: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay|OTHER: pharmacological study|PROCEDURE: whole-body scintigraphy|RADIATION: iodine I 131-labeled anti-CEA/anti-HSG bispecific monoclonal antibody TF2
Pharmacokinetics|Tissue distribution
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific monoclonal antibody TF2 in patients with colorectal cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive iodine I 131-labeled anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific monoclonal antibody TF2 (\^131I-TF2) IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo whole-body external scintigraphy at various times during the study.

Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically after \^131I-TF2 infusion for pharmacokinetic studies and \^131I-TF2 biodistribution by ELISA and radioactivity measurements.
