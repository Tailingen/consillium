HAIC Combined With Camrelizumab and TKI for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma After TACE Failure
The efficacy and safety of HAIC combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immunotherapy have been proved by the clinical research. In this single-arm, open-label, prospective study, for those patients with unresectable primary HCC, in the case of failure of TACE treatment, the combination of HAIC, TKI and immunotherapy is expected to bring new breakthroughs.
