Epacadostat and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Gastroesophageal Junction or Gastric Cancer
This phase 2 trial evaluates the benefit of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in combination to treat patients with gastroesophageal junction or gastric cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Epacadostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving epacadostat and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with gastroesophageal junction or gastric cancer.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed as the number of participants remaining alive without progression 6 months after beginning treatment. The outcome is reported as a number without dispersion., 6 months
Response Rate, Therapeutic response was assessed per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Criteria are:

* Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial Response (PR) = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR
* Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria

The outcome is reported as the number of participants with a documented clinical response (ie, either PR or CR) at 6 months after initiation of treatment., Up to 6 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was assessed as the number of participants remaining alive 6 months after beginning treatment. The outcome is reported as a number without dispersion., 6 months|Number of Adverse Events, Participants were monitored for adverse events. The outcome is reported as the overall number of adverse events of any grade, a number without dispersion., Up to 6 months|Number of Adverse Events ≥ Grade 3, Adverse events were assessed per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. The outcome is reported as the number of adverse events ≥ Grade 3, a number without dispersion., Up to 6 months|Treatment Delay or Reduction, The assessment for clinical value of the treatment combination included treatment delays or reductions, a measure of how well the combination treatment was tolerated. The outcome is reported as the number of participants that experienced a treatment delay, or reduction in treatment dose level, a number without dispersion., Up to 6 months
Patients receive epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on Days 1 to 21 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on Day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 9 weeks for 18 months, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Assess 6-month progression free survival (PFS).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate objective response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 and immune-related response criteria (irRC).
* Evaluate overall survival (OS).
* Assess the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the responder rate defined as the proportion of subjects with an increased ratio of CD8+ to Treg cells in on-treatment compared with pre-treatment biopsies.
* Identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response.
