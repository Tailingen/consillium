A Trial of Gemcitabine, Pembrolizumab and IMM-101 as First Line Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Trial to investigate if the addition of two novel immunotherapy agents in combination with a chemotherapy agent can reduce the size of the cancer and how long they can delay the growth of the cancer in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Neoplasms Pancreatic
DRUG: IMM-101, Pembrolizumab, Gemcitabine
Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients achieving an objective response, defined by RECIST 1.1, measured using CT scans for radiological assessment of disease until disease progression, Measured every 6 weeks by CT scan(most patients will receive 3-4 CT scans over 24 weeks)
Progression Free Survival, Progression Free survival as measured from date of registration to progression or death (from any cause), At time of progression (estimated to be between 3 and 6 months)|Safety and Tolerability of Gemcitabine in combination with IMM-101 and Pembrolizumab, Occurrence and Frequency of grade 1-5 adverse events measured using NCI CTCAE Version 5, Measured during combination treatment and for up to at least 30 days after the last dose of study therapies. In addition, immune mediated adverse events that occur up to 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab|Overall Survival, Survival will be measured from the date of registration and include all causes of death, From date of registration until date of death from any cause ( estimated to be between 6-12 months)
The PRIMUS-006 study is a study for first line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1, who are not sufficiently fit to tolerate a combination treatment regimen of two or more cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in the opinion of the investigator. The study is a single arm phase II signal seeking trial of gemcitabine + pembrolizumab + IMM-101 (a heat inactivated mycobacterium, immune modulator) using objective response rate as the primary endpoint
