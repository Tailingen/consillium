Symptomatic Study Investigating Degarelix in Patients Suffering From Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this trial was to see how well a new trial drug (degarelix) worked on lower urinary tract symptoms (also known as LUTS) in prostate cancer patients as compared to how a standard drug hormonal treatment worked on the same symptoms. The advancement/worsening of prostate cancer may be associated with LUTS and the symptoms may impact the ability to urinate normally and thereby the quality of life for these patients.

Patients were randomly selected (like flipping a coin) to receive either degarelix or standard hormone therapy (combination of goserelin and bicalutamide) for a 3 month treatment period. During this period the relief of urinary symptoms was evaluated via a questionnaire filled in by patients and addressing the severity and frequency of their symptoms.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Degarelix|DRUG: Goserelin|DRUG: Bicalutamide
Change From Baseline in Total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 12, The IPSS is a tool commonly used to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and to monitor the progress of the disease once treatment has been initiated. The participant completes a questionnaire containing 7 questions regarding incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia. Each question is assigned a score of 0-5. The total score is then classified according to the following scale: 0 to 7 = mildly symptomatic; 8 to 19 = moderately symptomatic; and 20 to 35 = severely symptomatic., After treatment of 12 weeks compared to Baseline
Change From Baseline in Total IPSS at Weeks 4 and 8, The IPSS is a tool commonly used to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and to monitor the progress of the disease once treatment has been initiated.

Each question is assigned a score of 0-5. The total score is then classified according to the following scale: 0 to 7 = mildly symptomatic; 8 to 19 = moderately symptomatic; and 20 to 35 = severely symptomatic., After treatment of 4 and 8 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Maximum Urine Flow (Qmax) at Each Visit, Uroflowmetry was used to quantify the maximum urine flow (Qmax; mL/sec), After treatment of 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Residual Volume (Vresidual) at Each Visit, Uroflowmetry was used to quantify the residual volume (Vresidual; mL), After treatment of 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Prostate Size Based on Trans Rectal Ultra Sound (TRUS) at Week 12, TRUS is a method of measuring the size of the prostate., After 12 weeks treatment compared to Baseline|Number of Participants With Testosterone <=0.5 Nanograms/Milliliter at Each Visit, After treatment of 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Percentage Change From Baseline in Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Concentration at Each Visit, After treatment of 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life (QoL) Related to Urinary Symptoms at Each Visit, The IPSS questionnaire included an additional single question to assess the participant's QoL in relation to his urinary symptoms. The question was: 'If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition the way it is now, how would you feel about that?' The possible answers to this question ranged from 'delighted' (a score of '0') to 'terrible' (a score of '6'). The figures in the tables present the change (ie decrease) in IPSS QoL score, i.e. the bigger the decrease the better QoL., After treatment of 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared to Baseline|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Vital Signs and Body Weight, This outcome measure included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight. The table presents the number of participants with normal baseline and at least one post-baseline markedly abnormal value., Baseline to 12 weeks of treatment|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Safety Laboratory Variables, The figures present the number of participants who had abnormal (defined as above upper limit of normal range (ULN)) levels of safety laboratory variables. Only the laboratory variables that had at least on participant with one abnormal value are presented, many more variables were included in the trial., Baseline to 12 weeks of treatment
