Effect of High-Dose Guarana And Cancer-Related Fatigue
This research will examine the effectiveness of a guaraná nutrition energy bar supplement on cancer-related fatigue based on scores from fatigue questionnaires. Participants will be randomized to one of three study arms: 1) two guaraná energy bars/day, 2) one guaraná energy bar/day 3) usual-care only/ no guaraná energy bars during study in cancer patients who have completed cancer treatment. We would also like to find out if this energy bar supplement improves physical performance, mood and reduces plasma glutamine and inflammation.
