A Safety and Efficacy Study of Duvelisib in Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma
This is a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib as a monotherapy in subjects diagnosed with follicular lymphoma (FL) that is relapsed or refractory to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT).

This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duvelisib administered to subjects who have been diagnosed with follicular lymphoma that is relapsed or refractory to either chemotherapy or RIT.

Subjects (n=57) will receive 25 mg duvelisib twice daily (BID) over the course of 28-day treatment cycles for up to 12 cycles.

After completing 12 treatment cycles of duvelisib, subjects may continue to receive additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, to receive additional cycles of duvelisib beyond 12 cycles, subjects must have evidence of response (CR, PR or SD) by the end of Cycle 12.
