Isoflavones & Lycopene in Localized Prostate Ca:Prior to Radical Prostatectomy
RATIONALE: Eating a diet rich in isoflavones, compounds found in soy foods, or lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may keep prostate cancer from growing. Giving isoflavones or lycopene before surgery may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of isoflavones with that of lycopene before surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Lycopene|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Multivitamin|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Soy isoflavones
Occurrences of Treatment Effect on Biomarkers in Each Group, Effect of isoflavones and lycopene on endpoint biomarkers as measured by tissue cell proliferation, apoptosis, or programmed cell death at prostate cancer biopsy and surgical excision, 4 years
Occurrences of Plasma Level Changes for Each Group, Plasma levels of isoflavones and lycopene as measured by plasma analysis at baseline and post-study intervention, 4 years|Occurrence of Tissue Level Increases, Correlation of plasma and tissue levels of isoflavones and lycopene as measured by plasma and tissue analysis at baseline and post-study intervention, 4 years|Occurrences of Disease Progression for Each Group, Effect of isoflavones and lycopene on markers of disease progression as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at baseline and post-study intervention, 4 years|Occurrences of Hormonal Effect, Effect of isoflavones and lycopene on serum steroid hormones as measured by sex-hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, and free testosterone at baseline and post-study intervention, 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the effect of isoflavones vs lycopene prior to radical prostatectomy on intermediate biomarkers (e.g., indices of cell proliferation and apoptosis) in patients with localized prostate cancer.
* Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on increases in plasma levels and tissue levels of these agents in these patients.
* Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in surrogate markers of disease progression (e.g., prostate-specific antigen levels) in these patients.
* Compare the effects of these nutritional supplements on changes in serum steroid hormones, estradiol, and free testosterone in these patients.
* Compare the magnitude of these changes in patients treated with these nutritional supplements vs patients in the control group.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage I vs stage II) and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients are randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
