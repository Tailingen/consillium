Efficacy and Safety of SCAI of Bevacizumab Combined With IC of Tislelizumab in the Treatment of Recurrent Glioblastoma.
To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of superselective cerebral arterial infusion of Bevacizumab combined with intrathecal injection of Tislelizumab in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab and Bevacizumab
Progression-Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from random assignment until objective tumor progression (independent image committee assessment) or death (any cause), Up to 10 approximately months
Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR relative to the appropriate analysis set., Up to 10 approximately months|Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from random assignment until death (any cause) or censored at the last date of known survival., Up to 10 approximately months|Duration of Response, Time from the patient 's first assessment of clinical response to the first assessment of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 10 approximately months|Safety and Tolerability, The safety endpoints will be assessed by a review of adverse events and serious adverse events according to CTCAE up to 10 approximately months after last dose, Up to 10 approximately months
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant intracranial tumor with a median survival of only about 15-17 months after standard treatment. Patients with GBM often experience disease recurrence, and once recurrence occurs, treatment options are very limited, with a median overall survival of only about 6 months. Results of a phase II clinical trial of nivolumab combined with standard or reduced-dose bevacizumab iv therapy for recurrent GBM showed that the median PFS for the two groups was 5.6 months vs. 4.6 months, respectively. The aim of this study is to improve the outcome of recurrent GBM patients by changing the route of administration of the two drugs, such as delivering Bevacizumab via intra-arterial infusion and administering PD-1 monoclonal antibodies via intrathecal injection.
