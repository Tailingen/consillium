A Study of RX108 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
RX108 is a novel, potent, small-molecule inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of RX108 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Locally Advanced Solid Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: RX108
Part 1: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RX108, All patients treated with RX108 across all dosing levels will have safety assessed in order to determine the MTD., Day 1 to 30|Part 2: Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)., The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) for each cohort dose will be assessed using CTCAE v 5.0., Day 1 to 30 days post last dose
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of RX108, Pharmacokinetics parameter, Day 1 and Day 3: Hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8|Time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax), Pharmacokinetics parameter, Day 1 and Day 3: Hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), Pharmacokinetics parameter, Day 1 and Day 3: Hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8|Elimination half-life (T1/2), Pharmacokinetics parameter, Day 1 and Day 3: Hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8|Systemic clearance (CL), Pharmacokinetics parameter, Day 1 and Day 3: Hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8|Response rate (per RECIST v1.1), Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of RX108 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (subjects with measurable disease in Part 2)., Screening and every 2 cycles for the first 6 cycles and every 3 cycles thereafter (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to 24 months.
This is a open-label, two-part study comprised of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part. In the dose escalation part, RX108 will be administered in ascending doses to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RX108 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The dose expansion part will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of RX108 at the RP2D.
