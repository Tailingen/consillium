Pemetrexed-Carboplatin and Gemcitabine-Vinorelbine in Advanced Breast Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

* whether the chemotherapy combination therapy Pemetrexed-Carboplatin or Gemcitabine-Vinorelbine can help participants with advanced breast cancer to make the tumor smaller or disappear and for how long
* to learn more about the side effects in each chemotherapy combination treatment arm
* to assess how participants with advanced breast cancer report health changes while receiving any of the chemotherapy combination arm
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Vinorelbine
Tumor Response Rate, Participants with best overall response determined from complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. For CR or PR, best response must be confirmed. A second assessment performed at 28 days. Two determinations of CR before progression required for rate to=CR. Evaluations include: CR=Disappearance of lesions. PR=≥30% size decrease of lesions. Progressive Disease (PD)=≥20% size increase of lesions. Stable Disease (SD)=Not enough shrinkage for PR nor enough increase for PD. Overall Response Rate=PR+CR/Qualified Participants\*100., Baseline up to 30 days of follow-up after 21 cycles of treatment
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR-RECIST criteria of (Complete Response \[CR =Disappearance of lesions\] or Partial Response \[PR=≥30% size decrease of lesions\]) is defined as time from the date when measurement criteria are met for CR or PR until the date of first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death from study disease. For participants who die from causes other than study disease and without PD, DOR will be censored at the date of death. For participants who have not died as of the data cut-off date who are without PD, DOR was censored at last contact date., Time of response to progressive disease (up to 19 months)|Time to Progressive Disease (PD), Time to PD is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the first documented date of PD or death from study disease. For participants who die from causes other than study disease and without PD, time to PD was censored at the date of death. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and do not have PD, time to PD was censored at the last contact date. For participants who received subsequent chemotherapy (after discontinuation from the study chemotherapy) prior to disease progression, time to PD was censored at the date of subsequent chemotherapy., Baseline to measured PD (up to 25.1 months)|Time To Treatment Failure (TTTF), TTTF is defined as the time from date of study enrollment to the first documented date of death, PD, or study treatment discontinuation due to adverse event (AE). For participants not known to have discontinued as of the data cut-off date, TTTF is censored at the last contact date. For participants who discontinued for reasons other than death, PD, or AE, TTTF is censored at the date of discontinuation., Baseline to end of treatment (up to 21.9 months)|Time to Response, Time to response (Complete Response(CR) or Partial Response (PR) is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the first date when the measurement criteria are met for complete response or partial response (whichever status is recorded first). CR=Disappearance of target lesions lesions. PR=≥30% size decrease of lesions., Baseline to response (up to 7.8 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), A listing of adverse events is presented in the Reported Adverse Event Module., every cycle up to twenty-one 21-day cycles (plus 30 days of follow-up)
