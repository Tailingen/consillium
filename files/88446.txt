A Phase Ⅲ Study of Hemay022 in Combination With AI In Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Hemay022 combined with AI (exemestane or letrozole) in the treatment of ER+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer patients based on the progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the independent review committee (IRC). The second purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Hemay022 in combination with AI, and the safety of Hemay022 in combination with AI.

The trial plans to recruit 339 subjects, who will be randomly divided into two cohorts (the experimental group is hemay022 combined with AI, and the control group is lapatinib combined with capecitabine). During the treatment period, imaging examinations and anti-tumor efficacy evaluations will be performed regularly until the subject develop disease progression or starts receiving other treatments or dies or refuses to come to the hospital for follow-up or the trial is terminated, etc.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Hemay022+AI|DRUG: Lapatinib+Capecitabine
Median progression-free survival（mPFS）based on IRC assessment according to RECIST v1.1, PFS defined as the proportion of patients alive and without progression, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Overall Survival (OS) of the two group according to RECIST v1.1, OS is defined as the time from random to any cause of death, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Objective response rate ( ORR, partial response rate+ complete response rate) according to RECIST v1.1, ORR defined as the proportion of subjects in complete response (CR) or (partial response) PR, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to RECIST v1.1, Clinical benefit rate defined as percentage of patients with stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months/partial response (PR)/complete response (CR)., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Duration of Response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1, DOR defined as the duration after the first assessment as CR or PR, only applicable to subjects who have achieved remission, The earliest date from the first recorded CR or PR to the first recorded disease progression or death，assessed up to 100 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR defined as the time from random to CR or PR for the first time, Start of treatment until the earliest date of CR or PR recorded for the first time，assessed up to 100 months
