A Phase I Clinical Study of HMPL-A83 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
This is an open-label, first-in-human (FIH) Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a humanized anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (HMPL-A83) in patients with advanced malignant neoplasm.
Advanced Tumors
DRUG: HMPL-A83 injection
safety information/AE,SAE, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HMPL-A83 in patients with advanced tumors, up to 3 years|MTD and RP2D, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of HMPL-A83 in patients with advanced tumors., up to 2 years
PK endpoints, To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of HMPL-A83 in patients with advanced tumors, including but not limited to the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Ctrough or Cmin), elimination half-life (t1/2), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC0-τ), apparent clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), etc., up to 3 years|Efficacy endpoints, objective response rate (ORR), up to 3 years
This is an open-label, first-in-human (FIH) Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a humanized anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (HMPL-A83) in patients with advanced malignant neoplasm. The sample size of this study is mainly based on the design of classical 3 + 3 combined accelerated titration dose escalation with a total of 6 dose groups, and approximately 31-84 patients are expected to be enrolled. During the dose escalation, DLT-nonevaluable patients will be replaced, or the actual number of patients enrolled may exceed the planned one due to adjustment of escalation schedule during the dose escalation. It is expected that no more than 99 patients will be enrolled.
