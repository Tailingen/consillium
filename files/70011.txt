Participation in Competing Strategies for Colorectal Cancer Screening - a Randomized Health Services Study Within the National Screening Program in Poland
The PICCOLINO is a randomized health services study performed within the framework of the Polish Colonoscopy Screening Program (PCSP) in Poland.

Within the study 12,298 eligible persons between 55 and 64 years of age will be drawn from the Population Registry and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive an invitation to participate in one of the three screening strategies: (I) postal invitation to colonoscopy and a re-invitation to colonoscopy for initial non-responders, (II) postal invitation for screening using fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for non-responders and subjects refusing a colonoscopy, or (III) postal invitation offering a choice between FIT and colonoscopy.

Colonoscopies will be performed in seven local centers participating in the study. FITs will be analyzed in the central laboratory. Subjects with positive FIT result will be recommended to undergo colonoscopy.

The primary outcome is participation with CRC screening within 18 weeks after enrollment, defined as completion of colonoscopy, or completion of FIT along with colonoscopy for positive FIT result. Secondary outcome will be diagnostic yield for advanced neoplasia (CRC or advanced adenoma). The study has been approved by a local bioethics committee.

Completion of the assigned screening strategy within 18 weeks of enrollment, Completion of the assigned screening strategy within 18 weeks of enrollment defined as:

* current screening strategy: documented screening colonoscopy,
* sequential and multiple options strategies: documented colonoscopy, or receipt of FIT containing stool specimen. A positive FIT result requires subsequent documented colonoscopy to qualify as completed., Within 18 weeks of enrollment
Diagnostic yield for CRC and advanced adenomas, Advanced adenoma defined as adenoma \>1 cm in size, or with high-grade dysplasia, or with villous component (\>25%)., Within 18 weeks of enrollment
