This is an open-label study to evaluate tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil in Japanese patients with previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Ofatumumab will be infused intravenously at Day 1 (300 mg) and Day 8 (1000 mg) in the first 28-day cycle, followed by infusions of 1000 mg at the first day of each 28-day cycle. Chlorambucil will be given 10 mg/m2 at Day 1-7 in each 28-day cycle.

The primary objectives are to evaluate tolerability and overall response rate (ORR) of ofatumumab with chlorambucil for previously untreated (frontline) CLL.

Secondary objectives include to evaluate complete remission (CR) rate, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to response, duration of response, time to next therapy, incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events, incidences of grade 3 and 4 infections and myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), and pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab and chlorambucil.
