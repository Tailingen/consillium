Cladribine in Combination With CAG in Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The vast majority of patients with AML will die of the disease, and no standard chemotherapy regimen were defined for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of cladribine in the treatment of AML, both de novo or relapse/refractory AML. Our previous experience has shown that Cladribine in combination of CAG (G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and aclarubicin) are effective with tolerable toxicity profiling.Thus, this phase 2 clincial trial is going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cladribine in combination with G-CSF, low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin (C-CAG) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Relapse Leukemia
DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: G-CSF|DRUG: Aclarubicin|DRUG: Cytarabine
Complete Remission (CR) rate, Less than 5% of blast cells in bone marrow aspiration is defined as CR., Bone marrow aspiration will be done within 2 weeks after blood cell count recovery (about 4 weeks after initiation of C-CAG treatment)
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], The hematologic toxicities and non-hematologic toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE version 3.0, From initiation of C-CAG treatment to end of the study (about within 3 months since enrollment)
AML is most common in the elderly patients, who can not tolerate the intensified treatments. The vast majority of patients with AML will die of the disease, and no standard chemotherapy regimen were defined for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of cladribine in the treatment of AML, both de novo or relapse/refractory AML. Our previous experience has shown that Cladribine in combination of CAG (G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and aclarubicin) are effective with tolerable toxicity profiling.Thus, this phase 2 clincial trial is going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cladribine in combination with G-CSF, low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin (C-CAG) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
