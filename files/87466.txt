VXM01 Plus Avelumab Combination Study in Progressive Glioblastoma
VXM01 in combination with avelumab in n=30 patients with progressive glioblastoma following standard treatment, with or without second surgery
Recurrent Glioblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: VXM01|BIOLOGICAL: Avelumab
Treatment-emerging adverse events (safety and tolerability of VXM01 in combination with avelumab), AEs listed together with information on onset, duration, severity, seriousness, relationship to the study drug, relationship to chemotherapy and to the underlying disease, outcome, and action taken. Frequency tables by System Organ Class and preferred term., Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration
Clinical response as assessed by time to progression (TTP), TTP is defined from the day of trial entry to the day of local tumor progression based on MRI (in days), Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration|Clinical response as assessed by progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined from the day of trial entry to the day of local tumor progression or recurrence after reoperation, based on MRI, or further positive biopsy, or the day of death of any cause. Subjects free of progression/recurrence will be censored at the day of last tumor assessment (in days), Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration|Clinical response as assessed by recurrence-free survival after re-operation (RFS), RFS is defined from the day of trial entry to the day of recurrence after reoperation, based on MRI (in days), Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration|Clinical response as assessed by Overall Survival (OS), OSOS will be defined by death of any cause and subjects alive at trial end will be censored at last contact day (in days), Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration|Best overall response (OR) on MRI according to iRANO in subjects with or without surgery prior to trial entry (up to re-operation), The proportion of subjects with OR will be estimated together with 95% confidence intervals constructed using the binomial Distribution (in %), Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration|Duration of Response (DoR) on MRI according to iRANO in subjects with or without surgery prior to trial entry (up to re-operation), The DoR on MRI according to iRANO will be summarized descriptively for the two subgroups and illustrated using a Kaplan-Meier plot, Up to 60 weeks after first IMP administration
The trial is conducted as a multicenter, open-label, Phase I/II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VXM01 in combination with avelumab in subjects with resectable and non-resectable progressive glioblastoma following tumor resection and radiochemotherapy containing temozolomide.

The trial will be performed in 30 subjects with progressive glioblastoma:

* 24 subjects who will not be candidates for a tumor re-operation (non-resectable subjects)
* 6 subjects who will be candidates for a tumor re-operation (resectable subjects) The trial, for each subject, will consist of a screening period, a treatment and observatioon phase of 60 weeks including, a treatment phase of up to 48 weeks with prime and boosting administrations of VXM01 in combination with avelumab and an observation phase of 12 weeks and with an end of trial visit at Week 60.

Subjects will receive VXM01 in combination with avelumab up to Week 48. The end of study (EoS) visit assessments will be performed Week 60.
