Efficacy of Botox Injection of the Masticatory Muscles in Head &Neck Cancer Patients with Trismus After Radiotherapy
Trismus is a common side effect in head and neck cancer patients after radiation therapy. This project aims to explore the therapeutic effect of Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection to the masticatory muscles in the above-mentioned patients.

In this project, Botulinum toxin will be injected into the masticatory muscles (medial pterygoid and masticatory muscles), combined with oral rehabilitation exercises, to reduce the patient's masticatory muscle tension and spasm. Patient's mouth opening range, quality of life, trismus condition and pain will be evaluated to understand its efficacy.
