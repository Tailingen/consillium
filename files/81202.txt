A Safety and Tolerability Study of NC318 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This research study is studying a new drug, NC318, as a possible treatment for advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors|Lung Cancer|Breast Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Endometrial Cancer|Melanoma|CRC|Urothelial Carcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: NC318
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The number of participants who have had at least one TEAE during the study., From enrollment through up to 90 days after end of treatment, an average of 1 year
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, To assess antitumor activity/efficacy by evaluating objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Approximately 1 year|Duration of Response (DoR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, To assess antitumor activity/efficacy by evaluating duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from the first documented complete response or partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 to the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Approximately 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, To assess antitumor activity/efficacy by evaluating disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of participants in whom a documented complete response, partial response, or stable disease is observed as the best overall response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Approximately 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first dose of NC318 to the first occurrence of documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Approximately 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the first dose of NC318 to death due to any cause., Approximately 1 year|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of NC318, To evaluate the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of NC318, Days 1, 2, and 3 of Cycles 1 and 5 and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Each cycle is 7 days during Cycles 1-8 and 14 days thereafter.|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of NC318, To evaluate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of NC318, Days 1, 2, and 3 of Cycles 1 and 5 and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Each cycle is 7 days during Cycles 1-8 and 14 days thereafter.|Half-life (t1/2) of NC318, To evaluate the half-life (t1/2) of NC318, Days 1, 2, and 3 of Cycles 1 and 5 and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Each cycle is 7 days during Cycles 1-8 and 14 days thereafter.
