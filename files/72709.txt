Using TRAP to Evaluate the Effect of Zometa on Bone Metastasis Due to Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new blood test as a way to follow the effect of Zometa in treating bone metastases due to lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung|Carcinoma, Small Cell Lung|Metastases
DRUG: zoledronic acid
Average Percent Change From Baseline in TRAP Levels at 2 Weeks, Change was calculated as 100% (value at baseline minus value at 2 weeks)/value at baseline, TRAP levels at Baseline and 2 weeks after first Zometa infusion
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new blood test as a way to follow the effect of Zometa in treating bone metastases. The blood test will look for a protein, called TRAP, which is released into the blood stream by the breakdown of bone. This study will compare the TRAP blood test with other blood tests for bone destruction.
