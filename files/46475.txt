Effect of Casodex on Tumour Hypoxia - Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancers, in common with many other tumours, are often hypoxic; that is, they have low levels of oxygen. It is thought that tumour hypoxia may hasten the progression of cancers and make them more resistant to treatment. One previous study has suggested that hormone therapy, such as Casodex, may improve the prostate oxygen level. This study is designed to test that finding.
Prostatic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: hypoxia measurement
To determine the effect of neoadjuvant anti-androgen therapy on oxygenation of prostatic tumours, Trans-rectal ultrasound and measurement of tumor oxygenation, 8 weeks|Correlate level of tumor oxygenation with PSA level, PSA test (ug/L), 8 weeks|Correlate level of tumor oxygenation with hemoglobin level, hemoglobin test (g/L), 8 weeks|Correlate level of tumor oxygenation with prostate volume, prostate volume measurement, 8 weeks
To study of the effect of neoadjuvant anti-androgen therapy on prostate tumour histopathology and gene expression, and correlation of these effects with changes in oxygenation., 8 weeks
