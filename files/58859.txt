Informed Decision-Making Regarding Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Screening in 50-70 Year Old Latino Men
The purpose of this intervention trial is aiming to increase inform decision- making in Latino men regarding prostate cancer screening.

The investigators propose to find out how much Latino men know about the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening and what factors influence how they decide whether or not to have screening. The investigators are also interested in learning how providing education information, both verbally and in print, about the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening affects men's interest and knowledge.

The intervention is an interactive multi-media presentation made up of a small group of 8-10 Latino men gathered to discuss about prostate cancer, screening methods, treatment, and the controversy within the medical community regarding PSA screening. A facilitator guides the 1-hour discussion and encourages participant interaction. The effect of this intervention was tested on 1000 Latino men within Los Angeles county.

Participants were recruited from 38 community venues (churches, community center, etc.). All participants were interviewed before being randomized to receive written (control group) or oral (intervention) prostate cancer education material. All of the participants will be followed up at 6-months via a telephone interview.

The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will have an increase knowledge of prostate cancer, will have increase communication with family, friends, and medical provider, and will have an increase rate of PSA screening compared to the control group.
