Regorafenib Alone or in Combined With Transcatheter Arterial ChEmoembolization in Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma After First Line Targeted Therapy
. 1 Clarify the difference in efficacy of regofinib combined with TACE compared with second-line treatment of advanced liver cancer; 2. To evaluate the safety and prognostic imaging factors of regorofenib in advanced second-line therapy; 3, to explore whether it is necessary to increase the treatment of TACE in the second-line treatment of advanced HCC.
