The Clinical Characteristics and Efficacy of Immunotherapy in First-line PD-L1-negative Advanced NSCLC Patients
This study aims to include patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who are PD-L1 negative and receiving first-line immunotherapy in routine clinical practice.
NSCLC
DRUG: PD-1 Inhibitors
1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate, The 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate is a clinical metric used to measure the percentage of patients who are still alive and have not experienced disease progression one year after the start of treatment., up to 12 month
Progression-Free Survival, PFS is the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. It is a standard measure used in clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment., up to 24 months|Overall Survival, OS refers to the length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment that patients diagnosed with a disease are still alive, up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) refers to the proportion of patients whose cancer shrinks (partial response) or disappears (complete response) after treatment., up to 9 month
This study aims to include patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who are PD-L1 negative and receiving first-line immunotherapy in routine clinical practice. Clinical treatment of patients will not be intervened unless disease progression, intolerable toxicity, initiation of new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, death, or other circumstances deemed appropriate by the investigator to discontinue treatment, whichever occurs first. The primary objective of the study is for investigators to assess the one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of immunotherapy as first-line treatment in PD-L1 negative advanced or metastatic NSCLC, evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
