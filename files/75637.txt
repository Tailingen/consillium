This is a phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ clinicaltrial. Phase I aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or, if the MTD is not reached, the maximum administered dose (MAD) of AK104 in combination with RC48 (disitamab vedotin) as first-line treatment for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GC/GEJ cancer, as well as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

Phase II aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104 in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GC/GEJ cancer; as well as the efficacy and safety of AK104 in combination with RC48 (disitamab vedotin) and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for HER2-expressing, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GC/GEJ cancer.
