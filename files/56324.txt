Cellular Immunotherapy in Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cellular immunotherapy in treating patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Placing a modified gene into white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

Toxicity profile of T-cell infusion as defined by all toxicities associated with T cells at the probably or definite levels, Assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The incidence of toxicity will also be measured according to the modified cytokine release syndrome grading as applicable. Tables will be created to summarize all toxicities and side effects by dose, time post treatment (first 28 days, days 29-60, 61-100, \> 100), organ, severity, and attribution., Up to 15 years|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate at the phase II recommended dose (RP2D) (CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ central memory T cells), Assessed using CTCAE version 4.0 for Arm I. Rates and associated 95% exact Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated., Up to 28 days|DLT rate at RP2D assessed using CTCAE version 4.0 for Arm II (CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ naive and memory T cells [TN/NEM]), Rates and associated 95% exact Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated., Up to 28 days|Complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) with the exception of participants in CR or CRi that go from minimal residual disease (MRD) negative to MRD positive or progress as determined by the principal investigator, Rates and associated 95% exact Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated., Within the first 28 days after infusion

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To examine the activity and safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded memory T cells that are enriched and genetically-modified to express a CD19-specific, hinge optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human EGFR (Arm 1: CD19R(EQ)28zeta/truncated human EGFR \[EGFRt\]+ central memory T cells \[TCM\]; Arm 2: CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ naive and memory T cells \[TN/NEM\]) shortly following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen for adults with poor prognosis CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

II. To determine the Phase II recommended dose (RP2D). III. To expand the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) dose to better describe the activity and safety of this dose.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To study additional antitumor activity endpoints of CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM and CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

ARM I (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL JANUARY 2019): Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-14 days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease, whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells after 28 days.

ARM II: Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-14 days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease, whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cells after 28 days.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.
