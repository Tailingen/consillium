A Multi Center Study Comparing the Efficacy of CAD EYE and the Standard of Care (White Light )
This study is to assess the sensitivity and added benefits of CADEYE compared to standard care (white-light) in detecting colon polyps in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

Adenoma detection rate, Adenoma detection rate is the primary end point which is the percentage of patients with at least 1 histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma., 1 year
Adenomas detected per colonoscopy, 1 year|Proximal Adenoma detection rate, 1 year|Withdrawal time, 1 year|Non-neoplastic detection rate, 1 year
Failure in polyp recognition is a major determinant for the high rate of missed colorectal neoplasms. In response, technological advances have paved the way for Computer-Aided Polyp Detection (CAD-e) systems. Artificial intelligence systems allow of real-time computer- aided detection of polyps with high-accuracy. CADEYE is a CAD-e system (FUJIFILM) that enables real-time video processing at the same rate as the standard procedure.

The data generated from this study will provide an estimate of the ADR throughout the Middle East as well as assess the accuracy of CADEYE in detecting adenomas in comparison to standard of care.
