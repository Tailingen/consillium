Comparison of the Physical Activity in Cancer Patients Assessed by Questionnaire and Motion Tracker
Physical activity is an important aspect of cancer therapy but correct measurement of physical activity is difficult. In this study, the physical activity of patients undergoing cancer therapy is assessed by questionnaire and by motion tracker. The results are then compared to answer whether there are differences between the two measurements. Findings of this study will help to improve the assessment of physical activity in cancer patients.

Although physical activity has been identified as a relevant determinant of cancer therapy outcome, its valid assessment remains challenging. In principle, direct and indirect assessment instruments can be employed for assessment of physical activity. While direct instruments, e.g. accelerometers, are considered to provide a more objective measurement, indirect tools such as questionnaires are less expensive and more applicable for use in larger study populations. The validity of both forms of measurements in cancer patients is however not well studied. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the relative validity of an accelerometer in comparison to a standardized physical questionnaire at different time points of cancer therapy. Findings of this study will allow conclusions regarding the ideal modalities for assessment of physical activity in cancer patients.
