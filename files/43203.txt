Evaluate the Relationship of Bone Remodeling Markers for Skeletal Complications in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
to evaluate whether bone marker can provide the valuable predictor of skeletal complications and whether regular assessing of NTX(N-telopeptide of type I collagen) and osteocalcin can be useful in advanced breast cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic acid.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: zoledronic acid
Urinary NTX and serum osteocalcin will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and when unexpected skeletal related events is detected., one year
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid by measuring changes in bone turnover markers

* the incidence of skeletal-related events
* time to skeletal-related events
* time to bone metastases progression
* overall survival
* the incidence of each adverse event including osteonecrosis
