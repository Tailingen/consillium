Efficacy and Safety of Idelalisib in Combination With Ofatumumab for Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of idelalisib to ofatumumab on progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Ofatumumab
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the interval from randomization to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. Definitive disease progression was CLL progression based on standard criteria (other than lymphocytosis alone) as defined by the 2008 update of the International Workshop on CLL guidelines, ie, appearance of any new lesion; increase by ≥ 50% in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of measured lymph nodes (SPD); new or ≥ 50% enlargement of liver or spleen; transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter's or prolymphocytic transformation); reduction in the number of blood cells (cytopenia) attributable to CLL. PFS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete response or partial response.

* Complete response was defined as no lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly; normal complete blood count; confirmed by bone marrow aspirate \& biopsy.
* Partial response was defined as \>1 of the following criteria: a 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, liver size, spleen size; plus ≥ 1 of the following: ≥ 1500/μL absolute neutrophil count, \> 100000/μL platelets, \> 11.0 g/dL hemoglobin or 50% improvement for either of these parameters without transfusions or growth factors. Overall response rate was analyzed using KM estimates., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response rate was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of index lymph nodes., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival was analyzed using KM estimates., Randomization to Last Long-Term Follow-Up Visit (up to maximum of 5 years)|Progression-Free Survival in Subgroup of Participants With Chromosome 17p Deletion and/or TP53 Mutation, Progression-free survival in subgroup of participants with chromosome 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation was analyzed using KM estimates., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response and maintain their response for at least 8 weeks (with a 1-week window)., Randomization to End of Study (up to 60 months)
