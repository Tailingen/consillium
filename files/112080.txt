Brentuximab Vedotin Prevention of (GVHD) After Unrelated Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
This pilot clinical trial studies the safety and maximum tolerated dose of brentuximab vedotin when given with tacrolimus and methotrexate after unrelated allogeneic donor stem cell transplant in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. The addition of brentuximab vedotin to tacrolimus and methotrexate may result in a significant reduction of graft versus host disease in these patients.

DRUG: brentuximab vedotin
MTD of brentuximab vedotin when administered with a GVHD prophylaxis regimen, Defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity; Hematologic DLT is defined as ANC \< 500/mm3 for three consecutive days beyond Day +21 that was determined by the investigator to be likely related to brentuximab vedotin.

Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity that was determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to brentuximab vedotin, with the following specific exceptions:

* Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, or fatigue thought to be associated with conditioning regimens
* Grade 3 rash will only be considered a DLT for patients who have received two weeks of supportive care treatment with no improvement., 37 days
