Feasibility of a Health Care Provider Guided Exercise Intervention Prior to Surgical Resection of Pancreatic Cancer
Pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a 2-4 week health care provider guided exercise intervention prior to surgery for pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: HCP-Guided Exercise Training Program
Number of Intervention Arm Participants in Compliance with HCP Exercise Intervention, Compliance with HCP exercise intervention is defined as successful completion of at least 150 minutes of weekly moderate-to-intense physical activity over a minimum of 2 weeks for every week of the prescribed intervention (2, 3 or 4 weeks)., Up to Week 4
Number of Participants who Experience Adverse Events (AEs), AEs defined as any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study., Up to Week 4|Number of Participants who Experience an Event that Leads to Delay in Surgical Resection, Up to Week 4|Change in Number of Tumor-Infiltrating CD8-Positive T Cells, Multiplex immune-fluorescence staining conducted on tumor tissue samples to assess number of cluster designation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells., Baseline, Final Study Visit (Between Weeks 2-4)|Change in Number of Tumor-Infiltrating CD8-Positive T Cells Expressing IL-15Ra, Multiplex immune-fluorescence staining conducted on tumor tissue samples to assess number of CD8-positive T cells expressing Interleukin 15 Receptor Alpha Subunit (IL-15Ra)., Baseline, Final Study Visit (Between Weeks 2-4)|Change in Number of Tumor-Infiltrating CD8-Positive T Cells Expressing GZMB, Multiplex immune-fluorescence staining conducted on tumor tissue samples to assess number of CD8-positive T cells expressing Granzyme B (GZMB)., Baseline, Final Study Visit (Between Weeks 2-4)|Change in Number of Tumor-Infiltrating CD8-Positive T Cells Expressing CD3, Multiplex immune-fluorescence staining conducted on tumor tissue samples to assess number of CD8-positive T cells expressing cluster designation 3 (CD3)., Baseline, Final Study Visit (Between Weeks 2-4)|Change in Number of Circulating CD8-Positive T Cells Expressing IL-15Ra as Assessed by Flow Cytometry, Flow cytometry conducted on patient blood samples to assess number of circulating CD8-positive T cells expressing Interleukin 15 Receptor Alpha Subunit (IL-15Ra)., Baseline, Final Study Visit (Between Weeks 2-4)|Time Spent in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA), Monitored using the ActiGraph Centrepoint Insight Watch in conjunction with ActiLife software and validated algorithms.

Moderate Activity is defined as between 3.00 and 5.99 metabolic equivalents (METs). Vigorous Activity is defined as at least 6.00 METs. MET is defined as the ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate., Up to Week 4|Time Spent in Sedentary Behavior, Monitored using the ActiGraph Centrepoint Insight Watch in conjunction with ActiLife software and validated algorithms.

Sedentary Behavior is defined as less than 0.11 metabolic equivalents (METs). MET is defined as the ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate., Up to Week 4|Average Daily MET Rates, Monitored using the ActiGraph Centrepoint Insight Watch in conjunction with ActiLife software and validated algorithms.

MET is defined as the ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. Light intensity activities are defined as less than 3 METs, moderate intensity activities are defined as between 3 and 5.99 METs, and vigorous intensity activities are defined as 6 METs or greater., Up to Week 4|Total Physical Activity Energy Expenditure, Monitored using the ActiGraph Centrepoint Insight Watch in conjunction with ActiLife software and validated algorithms. Expressed in kcal/day., Up to Week 4|Minutes Spent in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep, Monitored using ActiGraph Centrepoint Insight Watch., Up to Week 4
