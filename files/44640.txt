Safety, Immunogenicity and Preliminary Clinical Activity Study of PDC*lung01 Cancer Vaccine in NSCLC
PDC-LUNG-101 trial is an open-label, dose-escalation, phase I/II study to assess the safety, the tolerability, the immunogenicity and the preliminary clinical activity of the therapeutic cancer vaccine, PDC\*lung01, associated or not with anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: PDC*lung01|DRUG: Keytruda Injectable Product|DRUG: Alimta Injectable Product
Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) related to the administration of PDC*lung01, Up to one week after the last injection (Day 42)
Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs), deemed as related to the association of PDC*lung01 and the anti-PD-1 therapy, Up to Day 63|Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs), Up to Day 63|Detection of anti-HLA class I and II antibodies in the serum, Screening, Day 35 and Day 63|Ex vivo detection and characterization of CD8+ T cells against tumor antigens borne by PDC*lung01, using flow cytometry, Screening, Day 35 and Day 63|Objective Response Rate (according to RECIST version 1.1 for cohorts A1/A2 and iRECIST for cohorts B1/B2), Day 63|Progression-Free Survival, 9 months from the first day of platinum-based or anti-PD-1 antibody administration
The therapeutic cancer vaccine, PDC\*lung01 will be administered at two dose levels (low dose (LD) and high dose (HD)), as single agent or during maintenance treatment by pemetrexed (for adenocarcinomas in Cohorts A1 and A2) or added to the SoC (cohorts B1 and B2) i.e. anti-PD-1.

In cohorts A1 (low dose cohort) and A2 (high dose cohort), NSCLC patients will be treated at each of the six PDC\*lung01 treatment visits with low dose/high dose administered successively by subcutaneous and then by intravenous route.

In cohort B1 and B2, the first PDC\*lung01 injection will start within 48 hours after the first infusion of anti-PD-1. The fourth PDC\*lung01 injection will occur within 48 hours after the infusion of the second cycle of anti-PD-1.

For each patient, the study will be divided into three consecutive parts:

* Pre-screening (for HLA-A\*02:01 positivity), only patients with positive HLA-A\*02:01 status will be proposed to be screened.
* Active period comprising a screening period, a treatment period (visits V1 to V6, during which the patient receives PDC\*lung01 vaccine, at each visit), a V7 one week after the last injection and an end-of-treatment (EoT) visit (V8, 4 weeks after the last injection),
* Follow-up period which starts after the EoT visit and lasts up to two years after the first IMP administration.
