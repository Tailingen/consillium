A Phase 2b Study of Modified Vaccinia Virus to Treat Patients Advanced Liver Cancer Who Failed Sorafenib
This study is to determine whether JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) plus best supportive care is more effective in improving survival than best supportive care in patients with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who have failed sorafenib.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Cancer|HCC
BIOLOGICAL: JX-594 recombinant vaccina GM-CSF|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
Survival, Determine overall survival for patients receiving JX-594 plus best supportive care (Arm A) compared with those patients receiving best supportive care (Arm B) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have failed sorafenib treatment., CT scan every six weeks until progression or death, assessed up to 21 months
Time to Tumor Progression, Determine time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) for Arm A compared with Arm B based on mRECIST for HCC., CT scan every six weeks until progression or death, assessed up to 21 months|Quality of Life, Determine the Quality of Life (QoL) of patients treated in Arm A compared with Arm B., assessed up to 21 months (average)|Tumor Response, Determine tumor response based on mRECIST for HCC of Arm A versus Arm B, CT scan every 6 weeks until progression or death, assessed up to 21 months (average)|Safety profile of JX594, Safety will be assessed by the number of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), assessed up to 21 months (average)|Time-to-symptomatic-progression, Determine time to progression of Arm A compared to Arm B., assessed up to 21 months (average)
