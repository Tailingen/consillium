Objective Response Rate (ORR) Following Treatment With DS-8201a in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phases), Objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve either complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland (8 participants), breast with HER2-mutation (2 participants), endometrial (2 participants), esophageal (2 participants), Paget's disease (2 participants), cholangiocarcinoma (1 participant), extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma (1 participant), gallbladder (1 participant), pancreatic (1 participant), small intestine (1 participant), uterine cervix (1 participant) and HER2-low gastric/GEJ (1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg) cancer., From 6 months postdose of last participant up to 3 years 5 months

CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and SD as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and PD as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland (8 participants), breast with HER2-mutation (2 participants), endometrial (2 participants), esophageal (2 participants), Paget's disease (2 participants), cholangiocarcinoma (1 participant), extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma (1 participant), gallbladder (1 participant), pancreatic (1 participant), small intestine (1 participant), uterine cervix (1 participant) and HER2-low gastric/GEJ (1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg) cancer., From 6 months postdose of last participant up to 3 years 5 months|Time to Response (TTR) Following Treatment With DS-8201a in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors (Dose Expansion Phases), Time to response (TTR) by independent central review was defined as the time interval between the date of registration until the date at which the criteria were first met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Only participants who achieved CR or PR were included in the TTR analysis. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.
