Study of GPC-3 CAR-T Cells in Treating With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly heterogeneous disease. Treatment strategies for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma are limited. Phosphatidylinositol proteoglycan 3 (GPC3) is a heparan sulfate glycoprotein (HSPG) on the surface of the cell membrane. It is highly expressed in liver cancer tissues, but hardly expressed in normal liver tissues. It is an ideal target for tumor treatment. Investigators aimed to test the safety and efficacy of GPC3 CAR-T cells in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: GPC3 CAR-T cells
AE/SAE, adverse event/sever adverse event, from cell infusion to 30 days after infusion
ORR, overall response rate, From admission to the end of follow up, up to 2 years.
