Biological Imaging Guided Antalgic Radiotherapy of Bone Metastases (Phase II Trial)
Highly selective irradiation requires accurate target definition by high-resolution three-dimensional imaging. Co-registration of FDG-PET and high-resolution CT might be the imaging modality of choice. This choice might target radiation therapy precisely to the intra-osseous volume that is responsible for pain and to spare selectively healthy bone in the vicinity of the metastasis. This strategy could result in equal anti-pain efficacy as conventional large volume radiotherapy, but could allow bone remodeling and preservation of bone structural strength in the vicinity and could lead to reduced toxicity to neighboring organs.
