The Diagnosis and Prognosis of Nonpalpable Breast Cancer Detected by the US vs Mammography: a Clinical Noninferiority Trial.
To evaluate and compare the sensitivity, specificity, AUC, pathology results of core needle biopsy and surgical pathology results coincidence rate, tumor staging, and DFS (disease-free survival) of US-detected nonpalpable breast cancer vs mammography-detected nonpalpable breast cancer.
