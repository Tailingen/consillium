Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a minor complication after general anesthesia with tracheal intubation but may negatively affect patient satisfaction and postoperative recovery. Due to the multifactorial nature, the detailed mechanism of POST has not been fully understood. However, mucosal irritation and inflammation related to the presence of an ETT within the trachea appear to be one of the primary causes of POST, which may involve elements including the tube size, intracuff pressure, and duration of intubation. In addition, the cuff design of an ETT, which can determine the contact area between the cuff and the tracheal mucosa, is reported to affect the development of POST. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff shapes on the incidence and severity of POST. Additionally, we investigated the influence of ETT cuff shapes on the degree of subglottic injury following GA for breast cancer surgery.
