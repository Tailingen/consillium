Implementation of Shared Decision-Making in Cancer Care
This study aims to evaluate a theoretically and empirically grounded implementation program designed to foster shared decision-making in routine cancer care. The intervention program consists of several components (e.g. training for health care professionals, patient empowerment strategies) that will be rolled out in three clinics at a comprehensive cancer center in Germany.

Change in uptake of shared decision-making from the patients' perspective, Action to employ shared decision-making as measured by the German version of the 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9), All clinics: baseline, 8 months, 16 months, 24 months
Change in uptake of shared decision-making from external observers' perspective, Action to employ shared decision-making as measured by the German version of the Observer OPTION 5 scale using audio-recorded medical encounters. The Observer OPTION 5 scale measures the extent to which clinicians involve patients in decision-making. Each of the 5 items is assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 with higher values indicating more involvement of patients in decision-making. A sum score is calculated (ranging from 0 to 20) and rescaled to be between 0 to 100, for ease of interpretation., All clinics: baseline, 8 months, 16 months, 24 months|Acceptability of shared decision-making from the health care providers' perspective, Perception that shared decision-making is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory as measured by an adapted version of the acceptability survey developed by McColl et al., All clinics: baseline, 8 months, 16 months, 24 months|Readiness for implementing change from the health care professionals' perspective, As measured by an adapted version of the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) measure, All clinics: baseline, 8 months, 16 months, 24 months|Appropriateness of shared decision-making from the health care professionals' perspective, Perceived fit, relevance, or compatibility of shared decision-making for the given practice setting as measured by an adapted version of the IcanSDM measure, All clinics: baseline, 8 months, 16 months, 24 months|Change in penetration of shared decision-making at the clinic level, Integration of shared decision-making within a setting and its subsystems as measured by routine data from patient experience surveys of the clinics, baseline, 3 years|Change in penetration of shared decision-making in multidisciplinary team meetings, Integration of shared decision-making within a setting and its subsystems as measured by an adapted version of the Metric for the Observation of Decision Making in Multidisciplinary Team Meetings (MDT-MODe), All clinics: baseline, 8 months, 16 months, 24 months
