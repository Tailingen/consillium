Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Surgery Using ICG
This clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter, self-controlled clinical study. In order to meet the requirements of this plan, 130 breast cancer patients need the sentinel lymph node biopsy with novel near-infarred fluorescence imaging system produced by Beijing digital precision medical technology co., LTD. The fluorescence molecular imaging of indocyanine green (ICG) on imaging detection and the control group, routine medical using methylene blue test .The safety and efficacy of fluorescence and staining in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer were compared.
Sentinel Lymph Node|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Methylene Blue|DRUG: Indocyanine Green
Sentinel lymph node detection number, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 year, 1 year
This trial was a prospective, multicenter, and self controlled clinical trial. The subjects who were in line with this scheme were detected by fluorimetry and staining, and the primary effectiveness evaluation index, secondary effectiveness evaluation index and safety evaluation index were established during the operation. Record evaluation. At present, in the clinic for sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer, routine medical treatment is a blue staining method. A large number of clinical data show that the number of blue staining methods was 1-2.4, and the number of fluorescence detection is 2-3.7. Therefore, choosing a self controlled clinical trial can increase the number of sentinel lymph node detection.
