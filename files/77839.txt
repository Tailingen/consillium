Patient-Driven Transfusion Thresholds in Hematological Disorders: A Pilot Study
This pilot study evaluates safety of administration of red blood cell transfusions requested by patients based on their symptoms instead of levels of hemoglobin for the treatment of chronic anemia in patients with blood disorders.
Anemia|Aplastic Anemia|Bone Marrow Failure|Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm|Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Red Blood Cell Transfusions (RBCT)
Incidence of laboratory and clinical adverse events (AEs) assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03., Frequency, duration, and severity of AEs and severe adverse events will be determined. The proportion of subjects with serious side effects will be calculated with 95% confidence interval. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize subjects enrolled on the trial: age, sex, race and diagnosis., Up to 6 months of study participation
Frequency of RBC units transfused, The frequency of RBC units transfused will be compared between study period and prior to enrollment for the same patient (e.g. each patient will serve his/her own control) by Wilcoxon's sign rank test., Up to 6 months of study participation|Hemoglobin concentration at the time subject requests RBCT, Hemoglobin concentration (Hgb) will be measured in g/dL., Up to 6 months of study participation|Number of RBC units transfused, The number of RBC units transfused will be compared between study period and prior to enrollment for the same patient (e.g. each patient will serve his/her own control) by Wilcoxon's sign rank test., Up to 6 months of study participation|QoL scores from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia/Fatigue (FACT-An) questionnaire at the time hemoglobin is 8 +/- 0.5 g/dL, Will be compared to QoL scores at the time subjects request RBCT by paired t-test and/or Wilcoxon sign rank test., Up to 6 months of study participation|QoL scores from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia/Fatigue (FACT-An) questionnaire at the time subjects request RBCT, Will be compared to QoL scores at the time hgb is 8 +/- 0.5 g/dL by paired t-test and/or Wilcoxon sign rank test., Up to 6 months of study participation
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess feasibility and safety of red blood cell transfusions at the time subjects requested based on symptomatic anemia.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To define a patient-driven red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) threshold and to compare the median hemoglobin (hgb) at the time subjects request RBCT to the standard threshold of hgb \< 8 g/dL.

II. To compare the number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused and the frequency of transfusions at the time subjects request RBCT during the study period to the number of RBC units received and frequency using the standard threshold hemoglobin \< 8 g/dL during a comparable period prior to enrollment.

III. To compare the quality of life (QoL) scores when subjects request RBCT to the scores obtained at the time hgb is 8 +/- 0.5 g/dL.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo RBCT based on their perception and/or the presence of anemia symptoms for up to 6 months.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
