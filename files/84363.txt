A Study of Pemetrexed and Cyclophosphamide Given Every 21 Days in Advanced Breast Cancer Patients
This is the phase 2 portion of a phase 1/2 trial, testing the use of pemetrexed and cyclophosphamide in combination for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. A single arm Phase 1 dose finding (establish maximum tolerated dose) study precedes the randomized phase 2 portion.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: pemetrexed
Best Tumor Response, Tumor response was assessed using radiological imaging, which was repeated every 6 weeks prior to every other cycle. Confirmation of response was to occur no less than 4 weeks (28 days) after the first evidence of response., baseline to measured progressive disease
Time to Progressive Disease, Time to progressive disease was defined as the time from the date of the first treatment dose to the first date of progressive disease or death from study disease., baseline to measured progressive disease|Progression Free Survival, Defined as date of first treatment dose to first date of progressive disease or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of data cutoff date and who did not have progressive disease, the progression free survival date was censored at last contact date., baseline to measured progressive disease|Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax), cycle 1 (Day 1: <1 min prior to end of pemetrexed infusion; 1/2, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after start of pemetrexed infusion)|Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Curve (AUC), Area under the gemcitabine concentration-time curve from zero to last quantifiable concentration \[AUC(0-t)\] was calculated by combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods. Linear trapezoidal method was employed up to tmax (time to reach maximal concentration), and then log trapezoidal method was used for those data after tmax., cycle 1 (Day 1: <1 min prior to end of pemetrexed infusion; 1/2, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after start of pemetrexed infusion)|Pharmacokinetics - Clearance (CL), Total body clearance of drug calculated after intravenous administration., cycle 1 (Day 1: <1 min prior to end of pemetrexed infusion; 1/2, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after start of pemetrexed infusion)|Pharmacokinetics - Volume of Distribution, Central volume (V1) and peripheral volume (V2) of distribution., cycle 1 (Day 1: <1 min prior to end of pemetrexed infusion; 1/2, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after start of pemetrexed infusion)|Pharmacokinetics - Half-Life (tÂ½), The half-life associated with the terminal elimination rate constant., cycle 1 (Day 1: <1 min prior to end of pemetrexed infusion; 1/2, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours after start of pemetrexed infusion)
