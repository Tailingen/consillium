Local Anesthetic Wound Infusion and Functional Recovery After Colon Surgery
This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing colon open surgery. The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different analgesic techniques on functional recovery after surgery.

Twenty five patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia plus patient controlled analgesia (PCA) (epidural analgesia group) and 25 patients wound infiltration of local anesthetic plus PCA (wound infusion group).

Hypothesis: the postoperative recovery of patients receiving local anesthetic wound infusion will be faster than patients receiving thoracic epidural analgesia.

Functional recovery, pain intensity, opioid consumption and side effects, length of hospital stay and biological markers of inflammation after surgery will be measured in both groups.
Colon Cancer|Inflammatory Bowel Diseases|Diverticulitis
PROCEDURE: Epidural analgesia|PROCEDURE: Wound catheter
Postoperative functional recovery, at 24, 48, 72 hours, 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery
postoperative pain, at 24, 48, 72 hours after the surgery|opioid consumption, at 24, 48, 72 hours after the surgery|opioid side effects, at 24, 48, 72 hours after the surgery|return of bowel function, at 24, 48, 72 hours after the surgery and continue at the same time everyday until patients have return of bowel function.|length of hospital stay, at 24, 48, 72 hours after the surgery and continue at the same time everyday until the patients are discharged.
This is double blinded randomised study of patients undergoing colon open surgery. One group of patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia plus patient controlled analgesia (PCA) (epidural analgesia group) and the other group will receive infiltration of local anesthetic plus PCA (wound infusion group). Functional restoration, assessed by self-administered quality of Life questionnaires (SF-36, CHAMPS, ICFS) and 2 and 6 min walking test will be assessed in the two groups at 3 and 8 weeks after the surgery.
