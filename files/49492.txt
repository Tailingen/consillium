The neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy with surgery is the standard treatment in NCCN guideline. But many patients refused or abandon radiotherapy because of the intolerable adverse effects. We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of pembrolizumab plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by radical surgery for locally advanced adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety.
