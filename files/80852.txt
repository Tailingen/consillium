Trastuzumab and Standard Treatment With Chemo- and Immunotherapy as First Line Treatment for HER2 Positive Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients
The study aims to determine the efficacy of trastuzumab added to standard treatment (fluoropyrimidine/platinum doublet with pembrolizumab) in patients with HER2 positive Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) determined by 6 months progression free survival (PFS) (RECIST 1.1).
