The Effect of Toripalimab Plus Radiotherapy in Patients With Operable Stage II-IIIA (N+) Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This randomized phase II trial is to explore the clinical efficacy, safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus radiotherapy compared with neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy in operable stage II-IIIA (N+) non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the optimal radiotherapy pattern.

In recent years, the survival rate after diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has improved with advances in treatment. In terms of 5-year average overall survival (OS) by stage at the time of diagnosis, OS decreases significantly from stage IB to IIIA NSCLC, with 68% for stage IB, 53-60% for stage II, and 36% for stage IIIA. How to optimize the perioperative treatment strategy to reduce postoperative recurrence and prolong the survival of patients has raised great concern in early and mid-stage NSCLC. Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy is suggested for advanced NSCLC in preclinical basic studies and recent clinical trials. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) at 8 Gy × 3 Fx plays an effective immunoregulated role and can further enhance the antitumor immune response promoted by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although little is known about the optimal SBRT dose and fraction pattern, 6 Gy × 5 Fx or 8-9 Gy × 3 Fx have shown effectiveness in clinical studies.
