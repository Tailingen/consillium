The study was intended to be a Phase 1/2 study, however, the study was terminated early and the phase 2 portion was never initiated. A limited number of participants were enrolled in Phase 1 and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Phase 2 dose was identified for the combination of ublituximab and lenalidomide. Thus, Phase 2 data and results are not available to be reported.
