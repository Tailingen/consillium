Genetic Susceptibility to Lung Cancer in Never Smokers
The purpose of this study is to help us better understand the cellular changes that may lead to the development of lung cancer. We want to compare people who have never smoked and yet have been diagnosed with lung cancer to never smokers who have not developed lung cancer. We hope to use the information obtained in this study as the basis for future studies and will not regard the results from this study as final.
