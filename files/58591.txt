Effects of PEEP on Intracranial and Intraocular Pressure in Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy
To investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the intracerebral pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP)
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: PEEP group|PROCEDURE: ZEEP group
IOP, IOP is directly assessed by measurement of IOP with the Tono-Pen AVIAÂ®, Changes from pre-induction (baseline) at Post-induction 5 min, Pneumoperitoneum insufflation and Trendelenburg position 5 min, Pneumoperitoneum insufflation and Trendelenburg position 30 min, Penumoperitoneum desufflation and supine position 5 min|ICP, ICP is indirectly assessed by measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter(ONSD) with the ultrasound, Changes from pre-induction (baseline) at Post-induction 5 min, Pneumoperitoneum insufflation and Trendelenburg position 5 min, Pneumoperitoneum insufflation and Trendelenburg position 30 min, Penumoperitoneum desufflation and supine position 5 min
Application of PEEPmay reduce pulmonary complication following RALRP. Meanwhile, it may increase ICP and IOP, which has been debated for decades. Moreover, Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum, which are mandatory for RALRP, may augment elevation of ICP and IOP. This study aims to investigate the effects of PEEP on the ICP and IOP in patients undergoing RALRP.
