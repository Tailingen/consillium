Tumor Associated Neutrophils as a Biomarker of Chemo-immunotherapy Response in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer : a Model Based on Neoadjuvant Strategy
evaluate the predictive value of circulating neutrophil DNA methylation profiles, identified from the ALCINA 2 cohort, on pre-treatment blood samples (T0), for the histological response to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
