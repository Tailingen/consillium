A Study of PRS-344/S095012 (PD-L1x4-1BB Bispecific Antibody-Anticalin Fusion) in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), phase 1/2, multi center, open-label, dose escalation and cohort expansion study designed to determine the safety and tolerability of PRS-344/S095012 in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors.

The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety trial of PRS-344/S095012. The trial consists of two parts, a dose escalation part (phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) and an expansion part (phase 2)). The expansion part of the trial will be initiated once the optimal biological dose (OBD) has been determined.
