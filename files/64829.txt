Study of ONCOFID-P-B™ (PACLITAXEL-HYALURONIC ACID)
Phase I exploratory, open-label, single arm, multicenter study to assess safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of ONCOFID-P-B™ therapy in adult patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of bladder carcinoma in situ (CIS), who were unresponsive or intolerant to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-therapy.

Patients are initially treated with 12 weekly intravesical instillations of ONCOFID-P-B™ (intensive treatment phase). Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) after the 12 weekly instillations entered the maintenance phase of the study, during which ONCOFID-P-B™ is furtherly administered once a month for 12 months.
Bladder Carcinoma in Situ (CIS)
DRUG: ONCOFID-P-B™ (PACLITAXEL-HYALURONIC ACID)
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using MedDRA and their severity graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Overall safety profile evaluated based on clinical safety parameters (i.e. hematology and blood chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs and adverse events)., Safety data will be evaluated in the treated patient population through study completition, an average of 15 months.|Laboratory test values will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE scale, v 4.03., For each laboratory test included in the NCI CTCAE system, the incidence of abnormalities will be evaluated by considering the worst occurrence for each patient throughout the whole treatment period., Safety data will be evaluated in the treated patient population through study completition, an average of 15 months.
Complete Response Rate (CRR) - End of intensive treatment phase,, Calculated as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response after 12 weekly instillations of ONCOFID-P-B™., CRR will be evaluated after intensive treatment phase, at 12 weeks.|CRR - End of maintenance phase, Calculated as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response after the end of the entire treatment period (intensive + maintenance)., CRR will be evaluated after the end of the entire treatment period (intensive and maintenance), at 15 months.|CRR - At 6 months, Calculated as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response after 6 months since treatment start., CRR will be evaluated at 6 months since treatment start.|Rate of Overall Complete Response - Duration of Response (DoR), defined as the time from when criteria for Complete Response were first met until the first documented occurrence of CIS relapse or progression was reported., Calculated as the proportion of patients who achieved complete response at any time during the study., CR will be evaluated at any time during the study up to 12 months after the end of treatment period
