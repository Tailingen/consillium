Artificial Intelligence in Breast Cancer Screening Programs in Córdoba (AITIC)
The use of artificial intelligence software in breast screening (Transpara®) makes it possible to identify studies with a very low probability of cancer.

The hypothesis raised in this work is that reading strategies based on artificial intelligence (single or double reading only of cases with a score\> 7 with Transpara®), allow reducing the workload of a screening program by more than 50 % with respect to the standard reading of the program (double reading of all cases without Transpara®), without presenting inferiority in terms of detection rates and recalls of the program, both with the use of 2D digital mammography and with the use of tomosynthesis or 3D mammogram.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Mammograms
Assessment of Workload of each strategy, The workload of each strategy shall be assessed by multiplying the average time for a reading of that strategy by the total number of readings of that strategy.

The average reading time of a case in each strategy shall be calculated from the measurement of the individual reading time in a sample of 500 cases in each strategy., In the middle of the study, at 1 year.|Assessment of Workload of each strategy, The workload of each strategy shall be assessed by multiplying the average time for a reading of that strategy by the total number of readings of that strategy.
