Prediction of the Effectiveness of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Early Stage Lung Cancer by Bio-imaging and Biomarkers
Surgical resection with mediastinal lymph node sampling is currently the therapy of choice for early stage (I-II) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selected patients unwilling or unable to tolerate surgery are referred for so-called 'curative' high dose radiotherapy. This has shown to result in a long term local disease control rate and a high cancer specific survival.

The current trial addresses the issue if progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with radiotherapy can be predicted by a multi-variate model derived from a composite of bio-imaging and biomarkers
