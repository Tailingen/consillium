Clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety of the TQB2103 for Injection
TQB2103 injection is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting claudin (CLDN) 18.2. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of TQB2103 injection in patients with advanced malignant tumors as well as its initial effectiveness.
Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: TQB2103 for injection
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, and assessed as having suspected relationship to investigational drug that occurred within the first treatment cycle (21 days)., During the first treatment cycle (21 days).|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose at which dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., During the first treatment cycle (21 days).|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D of anticancer agents is determined traditionally by dose-limiting toxicities. Nontoxicity or biological endpoints such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy can also be used to identify RP2D., During the first treatment cycle (21 days).

Each cycle is 21 days.|Peak concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of ADC drug, total antibody and small molecule toxin after administration., 2 hours pre-dose, 0, 2, 4, 7, 24, 72, 144, 312, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 1 and cycle 3; 2 hours pre-dose, 0 hour, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 2, cycle 4, cycle 6, cycle 8. Each cycle is 21 days.|Immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), 120 minutes pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day1, Cycle 4 Day1, Cycle 7 Day1, Cycle 12 Day1; 90 days after the last infusion. Each cycle is 21 days.|Terminal half-life (T1/2), T1/2 is the time required to decrease the concentration of a drug within the body by one-half., 2 hours pre-dose, 0, 2, 4, 7, 24, 72, 144, 312, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 1 and cycle 3; 2 hours pre-dose, 0 hour, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 2, cycle 4, cycle 6, cycle 8. Each cycle is 21 days.|Apparent Clearance (CL/F), Apparent clearance refers to the rate of drug removal in the body, which reflects the degree of drug elimination in the body, as well as the bioavailability of the drug in the body., 2 hours pre-dose, 0, 2, 4, 7, 24, 72, 144, 312, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 1 and cycle 3; 2 hours pre-dose, 0 hour, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 2, cycle 4, cycle 6, cycle 8. Each cycle is 21 days.|Apparent distribution volume (Vss/F), When the drug distribution in plasma and tissue reaches equilibrium, the required body fluid volume for drug distribution in the body according to the plasma drug concentration at this time., 2 hours pre-dose, 0, 2, 4, 7, 24, 72, 144, 312, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 1 and cycle 3; 2 hours pre-dose, 0 hour, 504 hours (when necessary) after dose on cycle 2, cycle 4, cycle 6, cycle 8. Each cycle is 21 days.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first documented response to documented disease progression., Up to 2 years|Progress Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the first dose of TQB2103 to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival refers to the time from the first treatment to death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Adverse event rate, The occurrence of all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) evaluated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0., Up to 2 years
