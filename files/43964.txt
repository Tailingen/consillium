Creatine in Treating Patients With Cancer-Associated Weight Loss
RATIONALE: It is not yet known whether the supplement creatine is effective in increasing weight and improving appetite and quality of life in patients who have cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well creatine works in increasing weight and improving appetite and quality of life in patients with weight loss caused by cancer.
Anorexia|Cachexia|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific|Weight Changes
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: creatine monohydrate|OTHER: placebo
Percentage of patients who gain weight over 1 month, 1 month
Percentage of patients who manifest weight stability (i.e., weight within 5% of baseline) at 1 month, 1 month|Percentage of patients who manifest stability in appetite, Up to 5 years|Overall survival, Up to 5 years|Incidence of treatment-related toxicity, Up to 5 years|Quality of life, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare weight-gain effects of creatine vs placebo in patients with cancer-associated weight loss and/or anorexia.
* Determine the effect of these regimens on quality of life in these patients.
* Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare survival rates of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to primary cancer type (lung vs gastrointestinal vs other), weight loss severity (\< 10 lbs vs ≥10 lbs), age (\< 50 years vs ≥ 50 years), planned concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), gender, and prognosis. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral creatine daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity as long as treatment is considered beneficial.

Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.
