InterLeukin-7 to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Lymphopenic Patients With COVID-19 Infection ( ILIAD-7-US-O )
Comparison of the effects of CYT107 vs Placebo administered IM at 10μg/kg twice a week for three weeks on immune reconstitution of lymphopenic COVID-19 patients
COVID-19|Lymphocytopenia
DRUG: CYT107|DRUG: Placebo
Improvement of the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of lymphopenic (ALC≤1000/mm3) COVID-19 infected participants out to approximately 30 days following initial Study drug administration or Hospital discharge (HD), whichever occurs first, A statistically significant increase of the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) from randomization to day 30 or HospitalDischarge, one month
To obtain "clinical improvement" as defined by an improvement in a 11-points WHO score for Clinical Assessment, through day 30 or HD., to determine if CYT107 will improve the clinical status of hospitalized COVID-19 patients as measured by 11 steps WHO clinical improvement score, one month|a significant decline of SARS-CoV-2 viral load through day 30 or HD, The decrease of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from measurements at baseline and days of treatment dose 4 and dose 5, Day 21 and Day 30 or HD (whichever occurs first), 1 month or HD (whichever occurs first)|frequency of secondary infections through day 45 compared to placebo arm, Incidence of secondary infections based on pre-specified criteria as adjudicated by the Secondary Infections Committee (SIC) through Day 45, 45 days|length of hospitalization compared to placebo arm, Number of days of hospitalization during index hospitalization (defined as time from initial Study drug treatment through HD), 45 days|length of stay in ICU compared to placebo arm, Number of days in ICU during index hospitalization, 45 days|number of readmissions to ICU compared to placebo arm, Readmissions to ICU through Day 45, 45 days|organ support free days compared to placebo arm, Organ support free days (OSFDs) during index hospitalization (This includes ventilator assistance free days), 45 days|Frequency of re-hospitalization through day 45 compared to placebo arm, Number of readmissions to the hospital through Day 45, 45 days|All-cause mortality through day 45 compared to placebo arm, All-cause mortality through Day 45, 45 days|CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts compared to placebo arm, Absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts at time points indicated on the Schedule of Activities (SoA) through Day 30 or HD, 30 days|level of other known biomarkers of inflammation: Ferritin compared to placebo arm, Track and evaluate other known biomarkers of inflammation, Ferritin, from baseline to day 30, 30 days|Level of other known biomarkers of inflammation: CRP compared to placebo arm, Track and evaluate other known biomarkers of inflammation, CRP from baseline to day 30, 30 days|Level of other known biomarkers of inflammation: D-dimer compared to placebo arm, Track and evaluate other known biomarkers of inflammation, D-dimer from baseline to day 30, 30 days|Physiological status through NEWS2 evaluation compared to Placebo arm, Evaluate improvement of the NEWS2 score value. Score form 0 to 4: NO Risk Score of 7 or more: High risk, 30 days
Safety assessment through incidence and scoring of grade 3-4 adverse events, Incidence and scoring of all grade 3-4 adverse events through Day 45 (using CTCAE Version 5.0) to assess safety, 45 days
Approximately forty-eight (48) participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive

(a) Intramuscular (IM) administration of CYT107 at 10 μg/kg followed, after 72hrs of observation, by 10 μg/kg twice a week for 3 weeks (maximum 7 administrations adjusted to patient's length of stay in the hospital) or (b) Intramuscular (IM) placebo (normal saline) at the same frequency.

The aim of the study is to test the ability of CYT107 to produce an immune reconstitution of these patients and observe possible association with a clinical improvement.

This cohort is dedicated to oncology patients
