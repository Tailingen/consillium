OAR-Based, Dose Escalated SBRT With Real Time Adaptive MRI Guidance for Liver Metastases
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a noninvasive local therapy with proven efficacy in a number of solid tumor types. However, colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases have been shown to be particularly resistant to SBRT, and often are found to have significantly worse rates of control compared with other histologies. Higher SBRT dose was recently shown to improve local control in CRC pulmonary metastases, however, increasing dose delivery with SBRT has been limited based on the risk of toxicity to adjacent structures, and the ability to visualize them during treatment. This is particularly relevant in treating liver tumors, as tumor and small bowel movement can often make tumor targeting and organs-at-risk (OAR) avoidance especially difficult. MRI-guided SBRT for liver tumors is both safe and feasible and offers an as yet unprecedented opportunity to achieve the highest possible safe dose to liver tumors.

The purpose of this trial is to identify a safe maximum tolerated dose level for MRI-guided SBRT treatment of bowel and liver metastases, respectively.

Eligible participants will be on study for up to 12 months.
