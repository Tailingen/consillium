Clinical Trial Comparing Dose-intensified SBRT With Conventional Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases
This study will compare pain (primary end-point) and local metastatic tumor control (secondary end-point) after dose-intensified image-guided fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for painful mass-type spinal metastases versus conventional radiation therapy.
Spinal Metastasis
RADIATION: dose-intensified image-guided SBRT using simultaneous integrated boost|RADIATION: External 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT)
Pain response - improvement by â‰¥ 2 points on the pain Visual Analogue Scale at 6 months post-treatment at the treatment site, 6 months
Local metastasis control, Local metastasis control is defined from the day of randomization to a day of local (at the site of the treated spinal metastasis) progression, i.e. local failure, determined on control MR images as a change in signal intensity or on CT images as increasing soft-tissue mass. Increased epidural disease or enlargement of paraspinal disease on control images will be documented as progression., up to 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined from the day of randomization to a day of death of any cause., up to 2 years|Cancer-specific survival, Cancer-specific survival is defined from the day of randomization to a day of death due to cancer progression., up to 2 years|Quality-of-life (QoL), Quality-of-life (QoL) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C15-PL, EORTC-BM22 and EQ-5D-5L patient reported questionnaires, Day 1 and last day of treatment (usually day5 if Radiotherapy is delivered in 5 fractions, and day 12 if Radiotherapy is delivered in 10 fractions); months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24|Epidural spinal cord compression, Epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) will be scored using Bilsky criteria., up to 2 years|Acute and late toxicity, Acute aund late toxicity will be assessed in accordance to NCI CTCEA version 4.03 criteria., Acute toxicity: up to 3 months; late toxicity: from 3 months up to 24 months
Rationale: Radiation therapy is an effective palliative treatment for painful spinal metastases. A sub-group of patients with mass-type spinal metastases, a factor associated with poor local metastasis control, require treatment optimization ensuring durable pain control and metastatic tumor control.

Proposed solution: To intensify (escalate) radiation dose using simultaneous integrated boost with image-guided hypofractionated SBRT for painful mass-type spinal metastases in a randomized controlled trial. Two experimental fractionation regimes will be tested in the study depending on presence or absence of epidural involvement. Dose intensification is expected to achieve long-term pain control and long-term palliation as well as long-term local metastatic tumor control without adding toxicity as compared to conventional fractionation regimes with conventional radiation therapy.

The study will be carried out as multinational, multicentre phase II clinical controlled trial enrolling patients with painful mass-type spinal metastases who are eligible for radiation therapy without surgery. This study additionally includes a prospective observational arm for patients not eligible for randomisation who are treated in analogy to arm A of the randomised arm.
