Unilateral vs Bilateral Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling In Clomiphene Citrate Resistant Cases of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic unilateral ovarian drilling with bilateral ovarian drilling in clomiphene citrate resistant cases of polycystic ovarian syndrome in terms of clinical response (regularity of the cycle), change in biochemical parameters, ovulation rate over six months, pregnancy rate within six months.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is considered the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive age in females. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by reproductive and metabolic disturbances. Androgen excess is a hallmark of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), driving many of the phenotypic features

The clinical response to laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) seems to be thermal energy dose-dependent. Two punctures (300 J) per ovary are associated with poor results. Between three and five (450-750 J) punctures per ovary seem to represent the effective thermal dose. The application of six or more (C900 J) punctures per ovary may result in excessive destruction to the ovary and should therefore be discouraged.
