This study is a post-approval, company-sponsored, observational study. This study is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective, chart review of patients with ALK+ NSCLC patients treated using lorlatinib as the second/later line therapy in Japan after failure of alectinib treatment as the first line therapy from 20 November 2018.

All decisions regarding clinical management and treatment of the participating patients were made by an investigator as part of standard care in real-world clinical setting and were not contingent upon the patient's participation in the study. Data will be collected if available per study site. Patients in this study are those who started treatment with lorlatinib from 1 May 2019 to 31 December, 2020 in clinical practice.
