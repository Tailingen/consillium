99mTc Labeled FAP Targeted Molecular Probe in Early Diagnosis of Tumors
At present, radiopharmaceuticals targeting FAP have been developed for the diagnosis and treatment of various tumors. Considering the problems of fast tumor tissue clearance and short retention time in small molecule FAP inhibitors based on quinoline rings, this project optimized their ligands and developed a new FAP targeted technetium labeled molecular imaging probe for SPECT/CT imaging research to evaluate its safety in clinical application and its effectiveness in tumor diagnosis.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: SPECT-CT imaging
Tumor uptake, Compare the lesion site with surrounding normal tissue to evaluate whether there is a significant increase in radioactive uptake. Select the lesion in the abnormal area of the image and draw a 3D area of interest (ROI) to obtain the average lesion volume count (T). Calculate the tumor target/non target value (T/NT) statistically, 1 hour after administering the probe
