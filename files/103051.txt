T-Dxd in Combination With Ramucirumab as HER2 Low Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma
This is a Phase Ib/II study to identify the RP2D of T-DXd combination with Ram and to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combined treatment in advanced gastric cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts: Phase Ib dose escalation study to determine the MTD and RP2D of T-DXd combination and Ram, and Phase II to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of T-DXd combinations with Ram at the RP2D and determine anti-tumor activity.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer
DRUG: T-Dxd(Trastuzmab deruxtecan), Ramucirumab
RP2D, Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) and Recommended phase 2 dose as determined by Dose limiting Toxicity (DLT)., within first 6 weeks of treatment|PFS rate at 24 weeks, Defined as the time from start of study treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of disease progression) Progression is defined in accordance with the RECIST v1.1 criteria. Determination of PFS rate at 24 weeks., within first 2 4weeks of treatment
Overall Survival (OS), Defined from the date of treatment assignment until the date of death due to any cause. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive., 6 months after the last treatment of the last subject|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants with measurable disease who achieve complete response(CR) or partial response(PR), as determined by the Investigator per RECIST v1.1. Data obtained up until disease progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. Confirmatory scan is needed for the patients with CR or PR after 4 weeks of the first response. Participants who discontinue treatment without progression, receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond, will not be included as responders in the ORR., 6 months after the last treatment of the last subject|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR or who have SD (without subsequent cancer therapy) after the date of treatment assignment., 6 months after the last treatment of the last subject|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR or who have SD (without subsequent cancer therapy) after the date of treatment assignment., 6 months after the last treatment of the last subject|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as time from the date of treatment assignment until progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, or death due to any cause. Participants who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST v1.1 assessment., 6 months after the last treatment of the last subject|adverse events categorized in accordance with CTCAE 5.0 Criteria., Safety and tolerability, 6 months after the last treatment of the last subject
This is a Phase Ib/II study to identify the RP2D of T-DXd combination with Ram and to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combined treatment in advanced gastric cancer after first-line treatment. The study will be conducted in two parts: Phase Ib dose escalation study to determine the MTD and RP2D of T-DXd combination and Ram, and Phase II to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of T-DXd combinations with Ram at the RP2D and determine anti-tumor activity.
