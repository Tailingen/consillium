A Phase 2 Study of Pertuzumab and Erlotinib for Refractory Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
A phase 2 study combining pertuzumab with erlotinib for patients with gemcitabine refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Erlotinib
Overall Response Rate by RECIST Criteria, CT imaging every 9 weeks while on protocol
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Disease status evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scan and progression-free survival assessed per RECIST criteria.

Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported., 9 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), 1 year|Quality of Life (QoL), Quality of life as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, 3 weeks|No. of Events of Drug-related Toxicity, Number of incidences of serious and non-serious drug-related adverse events, 3 weeks|Proportion of Participants With 50% Decrease in Tumor Marker, Change in tumor marker CA19-9, assessed as a 50% decrease from baseline, 3 weeks
A single-institution, single-arm phase 2 study investigating pertuzumab and erlotinib as a palliative regimen in the treatment of locally-advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
