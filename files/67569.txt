Study Investigating Safety,Tolerability,Pharmacokinetics and Antitumor Activities of HBM4003 Combine With Toripalimab
HBM4003 in combination with Toripalimab. The expected duration of treatment for each subject will vary according to the number of cycles completed; the number of cycles will depend on whether the subject benefits from the treatment. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 21-day treatment cycle (repeatable, depending on the presence/absence of clinical benefit), EOT visit after discontinuation of treatment, and 2 follow-up visits 28 days (± 2 days) and 84 days (± 5 days) after the last study medication.

An open-label Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD and preliminary efficacy of HBM4003 combined with toripalimab in patients with advanced melanoma and other solid tumors.

The study is composed of two part, part 1 will be approximately 31subjects and Part 2 will be approximately 30 subjects.
