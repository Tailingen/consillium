Phase 2 Study of Trastuzumab and Etoposide for Her2 Positive Breast Cancer
This study is for women and men who have previously treated metastatic (has spread to other parts in the body), Her2- positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) the FDA-approved drugs etoposide and trastuzumab have on this type of breast cancer and to determine if these drugs are safe to use together. This research is being done to find more effective treatment for this type of condition.

In this study, trastuzumab and etoposide will be given by intravenous infusion (IV; through a vein) on the first 3 days of every 3-week cycle. This is repeated for 6 cycles. After 6 cycles, only trastuzumab will be given until worsening of disease. In this study, a small amount of your tissue that was collected when you had surgery will be evaluated in the lab to look at genetic differences among people and how those differences may affect a response to a specific drug or medicine. This testing will look for a gene called Top2A. Previous studies suggest that people who have both the Top2A and Her2 genes respond to certain chemotherapies (anti-cancer drugs) differently from those who only have the Her2 gene.
HER-2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Trastuzumab
To Determine ORR of Trastuzumab Combined With Etoposide in Patients With HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, and to Assess Toxicity of the Combination of Trastuzumab With Intravenous Etoposide., To determine the overall response rate, The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of first treatment until the date of first progression or date of death from any cause whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|To Determine Efficacy of Trastuzumab Combined With Etoposide in Patients With HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, and to Assess Toxicity of the Combination of Trastuzumab With Intravenous Etoposide., Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, From the start of first treatment until unacceptable toxicity or date of death, whichever came first, over 24 months
Determine Duration of Response, Stable disease, Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, assessed by CT scans at a minimum interval of 8 weeks over 5 years|Determine Duration of Response, Time to disease progression, Time to disease progression is defined as time from registration date to the date of documented disease progression or death on study, whichever occurs first for 5 years|Determine Duration of Response, The duration of overall response will be measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurements are met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented, The progression-free survival rate is defined as the percentage of patients who are without disease progression while on the study treatment at the end of study, over 5 years
