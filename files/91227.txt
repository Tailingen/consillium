Weekly Topotecan in Combination With Carboplatin in Two Different Schedules for Refractory and/or Advanced Solid Tumors
In this phase I study we will characterize the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of weekly bolus topotecan when administered in combination with two different dosing schedules of carboplatin. We will also evaluate any antitumor activity of these combination regimens.

DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Carboplatin
Maximum tolerated dose
Dose limiting toxicity|All over response
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

* Topotecan + Carboplatin

In order to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen to progress into future phase II trials, two different dosing schedules of topotecan and carboplatin will be utilized (ARM I and ARM II). Patients will be accrued to both treatment arms simultaneously.
