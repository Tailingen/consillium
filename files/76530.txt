Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in Gastric Cancer
The objective of the study is to assess the value of PET/CT in diagnosis, staging, response evaluation, and relapse monitoring of gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DEVICE: pet -ct
comparison of pet -ct finding with ct finding, The 18F-FDG PET/CT scan is visually estimated in the patients included in the study and quantitatively assessed by estimation of standardized uptake value(suv max). Statistical analysis of the included quantitative data., base line
gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide (1) It carries a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival of only 20%-30% (2) Clinical staging, based mainly on imaging, is critical in determining the best treatment.There is a widely accepted consensus of the usefulness of FDG PET/CT in staging and restaging of gastric cancer. According to evidence-based data, this modality can evaluate gastric cancer more accurately and is helpful for evaluation of tumor biologic characteristics, detection of lymph node and distant metastases, assessment of tumor response to therapy(9).

retrospective and prospective study will conducted at Sohag oncology hospital, nuclear medicine unit\& Assuit university hospital, nuclear medicine unit including 50 patients in 12 months .
