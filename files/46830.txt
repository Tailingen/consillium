Cancer Pain Rehabilitation Program to Reduce Pain Related Distress, and Reliance of Pain Medication Through Multimodal Nonpharmacological Solutions
This clinical trial studies the effect of an interdisciplinary program with strong patient involvement on managing long-term chronic pain for cancer survivors. The purpose of this study is to determine whether enrolling patients into an interdisciplinary program can improve mobility with physical and occupational therapy and participation in online group psychotherapy that teaches coping skills to enhance quality of life.

Feasibility of Functional Restoration Program, Feasibility of the program will be determined by the proportion of referred eligible cancer survivors enrolled into the program (at least 50% who are eligible enroll) and the proportion of enrolled patients completed at least half of the intervention., 24 months from the intervention date
Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program in reducing pain (NSR), Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NSR) score: patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10, zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit 10 represents 'the worst pain ever possible'., Pre-intervention , End of intervention (6 weeks), 3 months post-intervention|Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program in reducing pain (PSEQ), The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) score: the PSEQ is a 10-item questionnaire, developed to assess the confidence people with ongoing pain have in performing activities while in pain. Scores can range from 0 - 60 and is done by simple addition. High PSEQ scores are strongly associated with clinically-significant functional levels and provide a useful gauge for evaluating outcomes in chronic pain patients. Higher scores (and a higher percentile) represent lower confidence to function with pain., Pre-intervention, End of intervention (6 weeks), 3 months post-intervention|Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program to restore physical function (ADL), Activities of Daily Living (ADL): Medical Outcomes Study \[MOS\] subscale, Measures limitations in physical function activities, ranging from bathing and dressing to running., Pre-intervention, End of intervention (6 weeks), 3 months post-intervention|Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program to restore physical function (OARS), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL): Older American Resources and Services \[OARS\] subscale, Measures ability to complete activities required to maintain independence, ranging from making telephone calls to money management., Pre-intervention, End of intervention (6weeks), 3 months post-intervention|Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program to restore physical function (6MWT), Six minutes walk test (6MWT): The 6-min walk test is a submaximal exercise test that entails the measurement of distance (meter) walked over a span of 6 minutes., Pre-intervention, End of intervention (6 weeks), 3 months post-intervention|Preliminary effect of the Functional Restoration Program to restore physical function (10mWT), Ten meter walking test (10mWT): The 10 Meter Walk Test is a performance measure used to assess walking speed in meters per second over a short distance., Pre-intervention, End of intervention (6 weeks), 3 months post-intervention
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To test the feasibility of an interdisciplinary functional restoration program in cancer survivors with chronic pain and restoring physical function.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

I. To explore the preliminary effect of functional restoration program (FRP) in restoring physical function and reducing pain which ultimately decreases opioid consumption.

OUTLINE:

Patients participate in the cancer pain rehabilitation program for 6 weeks, including educational sessions over 2 hours once weekly, group psychological interventions, group physical therapy, and 1:1 physical and occupational therapy treatment per the patient's treatment plan. Patients may also undergo osteopathic manual treatments per physical and occupational therapy assessments.

After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months.
