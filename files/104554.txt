Trial to Evaluate the Improvement of Chronic Low-grade AEs in Patients With Ph+ CML With Optimal Response to Imatinib When Switched to Nilotinib
Primary Objective for this study is to evaluate changes in chronic low grade non-hematological adverse events experienced by patients who have been treated with at least 6 months of imatinib and who have not responded to supportive measures, when they are switched to nilotinib (CTCAE grading system).
Philadelphia Positive (Ph+) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Nilotinib
Number of Participants With Improvement of Grades of Persistent Non-hematological Adverse Event (AE) for Grade 1 and 2 at 6 Months, Improvement was defined as decreasing of grade of non-hematological toxicity from 2 to \<2 or from 1 to \<1. In case of multiple low-grade non-hematological toxicities improvement was defined as an improvement of at least one non-hematological AE and no worsening of any other persistent non-hematological AEs., at 6 month after switching from imatinib to nilotinib
Number of Participants With Improvement of Grades of Persistent Non-hematological Adverse Event (AE) for Grade 1 and 2 at 3 Months, Improvement was defined as decreasing of grade of non-hematological toxicity from 2 to \<2 or from 1 to \<1. In case of multiple low-grade non-hematological toxicities improvement was defined as an improvement of at least one non-hematological AE and no worsening of any other persistent non-hematological AEs., at 3 month after switching from imatinib to nilotinib|Number of Participants With Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR), Cytogenetic response will be assessed as the percentage of Ph+ metaphases in the bone marrow and is defined as the following: Complete (CCyR) - 0% Ph+ metaphases., at months 6,12 and 24 after switching from imatinib to nilotinib|Number of Participants With a Major Molecular Response, MMR was defined as a ≥ 3.0 log reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts compared to the standardized baseline or ≤ 0.1 % BCR-ABL/ABL % by international scale as measured by RQ-PCR, confirmed by duplicate analysis of the same sample. Molecular response was described for all time points except screening where response was estimated., Months 1, 3, 6, early termination|Time to and Duration of CCyR and MMR After Switch From Imatinib to Nilotinib at 24 Months, to evaluate time to achievement and duration of CCyR and MMR after switching from imatinib to nilotinib, at 24 Months|Time to First Improvement of Persistant Chronic Low-grade Non-hematologic AEs at 24 Months After Switch From Imatinib to Nilotinib, Evaluate time to first improvement of low-grade non-hematologic adverse events, experienced by patients treated with imatinib and persistent despite of best supportive measures after switching to nilotinib therapy. Optimal improvement is defined as AE grade decreasing to 0., first improvement of AEs after switch to 24 Months|Lisiting by Participant of EORTC-QLQ-C30 for Quality of Life, EORTC-QLQ-C30 was administered to evaluate quality of life changes after switching to nilotinib. Scores ranged from 1 (very poor) to 6 (excellent), Screening, months 1, 3, 6, after switch to nilotinib
