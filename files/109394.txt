A Study of IMM01 Combined With Azacitidine in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This trial is an open-lable , multi-center, Phase 1/Phase 2 study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and and immunogenicity of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: IMM01|DRUG: Azacitidine
Incidence rate and the grade (severity) of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of IMM01 combination azacitidine, To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Though end of DLT evaluation period,up to approximately 28 days.|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is the highest dose in patients with DLT incidence \<1/3.For a dose group to be assessed as MTD, at least 6 DLT data must be available to evaluate the subject., Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during the first cycle (28 days) of treatment.
Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Maximum observed concentration in serum, Within 60 minutes prior to infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Cycle 2-6 Day 1 (28 days cycle).10 minutes post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 6 Day 22 (28 days cycle ) .10 minutes and 4 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (28 days cycle).|Pharmacokinetics - AUC, Area under the serum concentration - time curve, Within 60 minutes prior to infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Cycle 2-6 Day 1 (28 days cycle).10 minutes post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 6 Day 22 (28 days cycle ) .10 minutes and 4 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (28 days cycle).|Pharmacokinetics - tmax, Time to peak (maximum) serum concentration, Within 60 minutes prior to infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Cycle 2-6 Day 1 (28 days cycle).10 minutes post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 6 Day 22 (28 days cycle ) .10 minutes and 4 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (28 days cycle).|Pharmacokinetics - T1/2, Terminal half-life (T1/2), Within 60 minutes prior to infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Cycle 2-6 Day 1 (28 days cycle).10 minutes post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 6 Day 22 (28 days cycle ) .10 minutes and 4 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (28 days cycle).|Response Rate, Response determined per European LeukemiaNet response criteria:

CR = bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \> 1.0 x 10e9/L; platelet count \> 100 x 10e9/L; and independence of red cell transfusions.

CRi = all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\< 1.0 x 10e9/L) or thrombocytopenia (\< 100 x 10e9/L)\].

To evaluate clinical benefit defined as CR, CRi, morphologic leukemia-free state, and partial remission (PR)., When the last subject enrolled completes approximately 12 months of treatment|Overall Remission (OR):, Response Criteria are according to the Modified IWG (International Working Group) Response Criteria in Myelodysplasia.CR: bone marrow evaluation shows less than or equal to (\<=) 5% blasts; normal maturation of all cells lines (mCR), peripheral blood evaluation shows hemoglobin \>= 11 gram per deciliter (g/dL), neutrophils \>= 1000/mL, platelets \>= 100,000/mL, 0% blasts; PR: Same as CR, except blasts decrease by \>=50%, still greater than 5% in bone marrow. Hematologic improvement are measured in participants with pretreatment abnormal values: hemoglobin level less than 110 g/L (11 g/dL) or red blood count (RBC)-transfusion dependence, platelet count \<100 x 10\^9/L or platelet-transfusion dependence, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.0 x 10\^9/L., When the last subject enrolled completes approximately 12 months of treatment
Exploratory Endpoint, Anti-drug Antibody (ADA), In cycle 1(each cycle is 28 days) and cycle 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, at the end of treatment or early study withdrawal, and 30 days after the last dose.
Main study purpose:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine in patients with AML and MDS.
* To explore the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine, and determine the phase 2 clinical recommended dose (RP2D) of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine.

Secondary study purpose:

* To evaluate the efficacy of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine in patients with AML and MDS.
* To evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine, in patients with AML and MDS.

Exploratory study purpose:

â€¢ To evaluate the immunogenicity of IMM01 combined with Azacitidine in patients with AML and MDS.
