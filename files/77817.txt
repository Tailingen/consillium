A Study of SKB264 (MK-2870; Sac-TMT) for the Treatment of Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (SKB264-II-04) (MK-2870-003)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and objective response rate of SKB264 as combination with therapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SKB264|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Osimertinib
Safety and tolerability, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT); Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs); Discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs, From subject sign the informed consent form (ICF) to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, up to approximately 36 months|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, The proportion of subjects with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), up to approximately 36 months
Duration of response (DOR), For subjects with a confirmed CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From baseline until disease progression, death, or other protocol defined reason, up to approximately 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from first dose of study intervention to first documentation of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From baseline until disease progression, death, or other protocol defined reason, up to approximately 36 months|Overall survival (OS), the time period from the start of study intervention to death due to any cause., From baseline until death due to any cause, up to approximately 36 months
This is a multicenter, open-label study of SKB264 as combination therapy or monotherapy in subjects with NSCLC. Approximately 498 subjects will be enrolled in this study including around 88 subjects for the safety run-in period and 410 subjects for the expansion period.
