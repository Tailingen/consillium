A New Mutational and Epigenetic Signature to Predict Early OPSCC Relapse
Inclusion of new biomarkers to improve the personalized treatment approach for HPV-positive and -negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients is urgently needed. Emerging evidences suggest that mutations in epigenetic regulators, as well as epigenetic changes, deeply influence the biology of OPSCC, thus representing attractive targets for the definition of novel molecular markers for this malignancy. Based on these considerations, our project aims to retrospectively identify a new mutational and epigenetic signature to identify OPSCC patients at high risk of early relapse, and to set up a new multicenter prospective study in order to validate it
