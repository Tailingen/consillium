Recurrent GBM Treated With Neurosurgical Resection and IORT Using the Xoft Axxent eBx System and Bevacizumab
The purpose of this trial is to assess the overall survival of patients treated with the Xoft Axxent eBx System and post-radiation adjuvant Bevacizumab for single-fraction IORT following maximal neurosurgical resection of recurrent glioblastoma. A historical comparison will be made to the results of the EBRT + Bevacizumab arm of RTOG 1205.

The rationale for IORT, as the sole radiation therapy following surgical resection of recurrent GBM is to expand upon the favorable preliminary results in feasibility, safety and efficacy outcomes obtained at the European Medical Center Study Group (EMC Study Group). The rationale to add Bevacizumab as a systemic treatment is to target radio-resistant and highly tumorigenic cancer stem cells as well as to benefit from its radioprotective effects, i.e. reducing risk of radiation necrosis. Lastly, using Bevacizumab as a systemic therapy will enable the comparison of the results to the historic control arm, the EBRT arm of RTOG 1205.
