Docetaxel, Radiation Therapy, and Hormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when given with radiation therapy and hormone therapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Bicalutamide|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: GnRh analog|RADIATION: radiotherapy
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Taxotere with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, To determine the MTD of Taxotere with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy in patients with high risk locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The dose limiting toxicity (CLT) period for determining the MTD is 57 days., 57 days
Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Docetaxel may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as leuprolide, goserelin, or bicalutamide, may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy and hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.
