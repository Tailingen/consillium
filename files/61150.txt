Exploratory Study of a Novel Based rbcDNA Liquid Biopsy Technique for Colorectal Cancer Early Detection
Exploration of a novel rbcDNA liquid biopsy technique for early detection of colorectal cancer is a promising development in the field of disease diagnosis and screening. This technique has the potential to establish an efficient and sensitive system for the early detection of colorectal cancer, which can provide a new perspective for individual health monitoring.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: rbcDNA test
Evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of rbcDNA in colorectal cancer screening, A diagnostic colonoscopy procedure is the reference method. Lesions will be confirmed as malignant by histopathologic examination. The rbcDNA test was deployed to a composite score. The tests were processed independently of colonoscopy procedure., Through study completion，an average of 1 year
Sensitivity of the rbcDNA screening test with comparison to FIT, with respect to advanced adenoma (AA) and CRC, A diagnostic colonoscopy procedure is the reference method. Lesions will be confirmed as malignant by histopathologic examination. The rbcDNA and FIT test were performed., Through study completion，an average of 1 year
Patients who are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer and willing to undergo colonoscopy examination will be asked to collect a stool sample prior to bowel preparation for commercially available FIT (fecal immunochemical test) assay, as well as a blood sample for rbcDNA testing. The colonoscopy and histopathologic examination will be used as a reference for the results obtained from these tests.
