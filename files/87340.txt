Pelvic Sentinel Node Detection Using Indocyanine Green Learning Curve
According to ESGO-ESTRO-ESMO guidelines, pelvic Sentinel lymph node detection is suitable for lymph node staging in endometrial carcinoma of the uteri.

Nonetheless, a learning curve is mandatory to ensure the surgical quality of the sampling.

The aim of the study is to assess the success of sentinel lymph node detection according to SHREC-Trial surgical strategy.

Introduction:

According to ESGO-ESTRO-ESMO guidelines, pelvic Sentinel lymph node detection is suitable for lymph node staging in endometrial carcinoma of the uteri.

The aim of the study is to assess the success of sentinel lymph node detection according to SHREC-Trial surgical strategy.

Patients and Method:

All patients presenting with early FIGO stage and low, intermediate, high intermediate or high risk endometrial carcinoma will be prospectively enrolled.

Sentinel lymph node mapping will be performed using laparoscopic approach and cervical Indocyanine Green injection.

Based on the surgical algorithm for detection of pelvic sentinel lymph node in endometrial cancer from Persson and coll., we designed a study with a target of 70% to 90% of bilateral detection rate .

Thirty patients will be included over 18 months.
