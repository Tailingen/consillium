Clinical Study for the Impact of Bio-absorbable Felt (NEOVEIL®) With Fibrin Sealant on Removal of Drainage Tube After Minimally Invasive Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
This study is to evaluate if Bio-absorbable Felt(NEOVEIL®) makes the amount of exudate reduce and shortens time until drain removal after minimally invasive surgery for early gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DEVICE: bio-absorbable felt(NEOVEIL®)
Time to drain removal, Daily amount of exudate is less than 100cc during consecutive 2 days. There is no evidence of anastomotic leakage, intra-abdominal abscess or bleeding., two weeks
total amount of exudate drainage, Total amount of exudate after surgery is recorded., two weeks
Time to discharge after surgery and postoperative complication, Time to discharge after surgery and postoperative complication are recorded, up to 30days after randomization
We investigate the effect on drainage amount of Bio-absorbable Felt(NEOVEIL®) after D1+b or D2 lymphadenectomy with distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.

This study is an randomised controlled trial undertaken in 7 centers in South Korea. Patients with stage I-II gastric cancer who is going to have curative distal gastrectomy with D1+b or D2 lymphadenectomy are randomly assigned to use bio-absorbable felt(NEOVEIL®) or not to use it. Block randomisation will be done by a central interactive computerised system, stratified by center.
