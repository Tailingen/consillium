A Study to Assess Anti-Tumor Activity of Intravenously (IV) Infused Carboplatin With Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα)Expressing Advanced-Stage Serous Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant carboplatin and mirvetuximab soravtansine in participants with folate receptor alpha (FRα) -expressing advanced-stage serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC).

Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) is an investigational antibody drug conjugate designed to selectively kill cancer cells. The antibody (protein) part of MIRV targets tumors by delivering a cell-killing drug to cancer cells carrying a protein called folate receptor alpha (FRα). This is a single arm study in adult participants with advanced-stage Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) III-IV FRα-expressing serous EOC. Around 140 participants will be enrolled in the study at approximately 80 sites in the United States.

Participants will receive intravenous infusion of MIRV in combination with carboplatin on day 1 of each cycle, every 21 days for up to 6 - 9 Cycles. The total study duration will be approximately 3 years .

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, and scans.

DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Mirvetuximab Soravtansine
Objective Response (OR) by Independent Central Review (ICR), OR is defined as the best overall response of radiographic complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by ICR using RECIST Version 1.1 criteria, prior to any subsequent anticancer therapy, including interval debulking surgery (IDS)., Up to Approximately 3 years
Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AE), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug., Up to Approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants with AEs leading to study drug discontinuation or dose modification, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug., Up to Approximately 3 years|Objective Response (OR) by Investigator, Or is defined as the best overall response of radiographic CR or PR as assessed by investigator using RECIST Version 1.1 criteria, prior to any subsequent anticancer therapy, including IDS., Up to Approximately 3 years|Disease Control by ICR, Disease control defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by ICR per RECIST Version 1.1 prior to subsequent anticancer therapy including IDS., Up to Approximately 3 years|Disease control by Investigator, Disease control defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by investigator per RECIST Version 1.1 prior to subsequent anticancer therapy including IDS., Up to Approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With CA-125 Confirmed Response Per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria, The GCIG CA-125 response was defined as at least 50% reduction in CA-125., Up to Approximately 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator, PFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 is defined as the time from the date of C1D1 until investigator-assessed PD or death (whichever occurs first)., Up to Approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants that Underwent Interval debulking surgery (IDS), Percentage of participants that underwent IDS during the course of the study treatment, Up to Approximately 3 years|Percentage of participants with Grossly complete tumor cytoreduction at IDS, Grossly complete tumor cytoreduction is defined as the absence of macroscopically visible residual disease at the end of the surgery, Up to Approximately 3 years|Percentage of participants with Near-Complete Tumor Cytoreduction at IDS, Defined as macroscopically visible residual tumor ≤ 1 cm at the end of surgery., Up to Approximately 3 years|Time to deterioration in disease-related symptoms as measured by the NCCN-FACT Ovarian Symptom Index (NFOSI-18) disease symptom subscale - physical (DRS-P), The NFOSI-18 provides a total score that sums all 18 items, plus 2 multi-item scales that assess physical disease-related symptoms (DRS-P; 9 items) and general function/well-being (F/WB; 3 items)., Up to Approximately 3 years
