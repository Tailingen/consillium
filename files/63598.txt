A Phase I, Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Intravenous EZN-2208 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma (EZN-2208-02)
The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of EZN-2208 that can be given to patients with advanced cancer or lymphoma. The safety of the study drug and its effect on the disease will also be studied.

Enzon will also perform pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of EZN-2208. PK testing measures the amount of a drug in the body at different time points.
