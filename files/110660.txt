A Study To Assess The Tolerability And Clinical Activity Of Gedatolisib In Combination With Palbociclib/Letrozole Or Palbociclib/Fulvestrant In Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1b study in patients with mBC. This study will have a dose escalation to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/fulvestrant and gedatolisib plus palbociclib/letrozole and expansion to estimate the objective response rate (OR) of the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/letrozole or palbociclib/fulvestrant.

DRUG: Gedatolisib|DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, up to 28 days|Objective response rate observed in patients in the dose expansion portion, Number of patients for each response category, objective response rate (number of patients with a complete response (CR)) relative to the number of response evaluable patients, 16 weeks|Objective response rate observed in patients in the dose expansion portion, Number of patients for each response category, objective response rate (number of patients with a partial response (PR)) relative to the number of response evaluable patients), 16 weeks
Tumor response observed in patients in the dose escalation portion, 16 weeks|Duration of response, 16 weeks|QTc interval (corrected QT interval), The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle., Screening up to 6 months|Maximum observed plasma concentration, Day 1: 0, 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24, 72 and 168 hours. Cycle 2 Day 1: 0, 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24, 72 and 168 hours|Progression free survival, 16 weeks
This is a multicenter, open label, continuous Phase 1b study in patients with MBC. This study will have a dose escalation and expansion. The dose escalation will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/fulvestrant and gedatolisib plus palbociclib/letrozole. The expansion will estimate the objective response rate (OR) of the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/letrozole and the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/fulvestrant.
