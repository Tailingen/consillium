A Study of LY3076226 in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3076226 in participants with advanced or metastatic cancer.
Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: LY3076226
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of LY3076226, The MTD was defined as the highest dose tested that had less than 33% probability of causing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., Cycle 1 (21 Days)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3076226, Predose: Day 1 (Cycle 1) and 63 (Cycle 3); Postdose: 0.05, 1, 3, 6, 24 and 72 hours|PK: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of LY3076226, Predose: Day 1 (Cycle 1) and 63 (Cycle 3); Postdose: 0.05, 1, 3, 6, 24 and 72 hours|Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Tumor response was assessed using confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1). Complete response (CR) was the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels of non-target lesions; partial response (PR) was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline through Study Completion (Cycle 3, day 21)
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3076226 in participants with advanced or metastatic cancer.
