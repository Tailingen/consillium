A Study Of PF-03084014 In Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for PF-03084014 single-agent administration in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Pharmacokinetics and the overall safety profile of PF-03084014 will also be evaluated.
