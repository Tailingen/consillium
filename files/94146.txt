A Study of HB0030 Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase Ia single-center, open-label, dose escalation study.The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, toxicity, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics(PK/PD), immunogenicity, biomarkers, and antitumor activity of HB0030 in advanced solid tumor subjects.

Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT), * DLT refers to the following toxicity related to HB0030 occurred during the DLT evaluation period (the first treatment cycle):

  1. Hematological Dose Limiting toxicity include：

     1. Grade 4 anaemia
     2. Grade IV neutropenia confirmed by reexamination.
     3. Grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia
     4. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding
  2. Nonhematologic Dose Limiting toxicity include：

     1. Grade IV Nonhematologic Toxicity
     2. Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity, which cannot be recovered to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days after the best treatment
     3. Failure to control grade III hypertension (uncontrolled \<160/100 mmHg in 7 days with appropriate antihypertensive therapy)
     4. Other toxicities judged by investigators to require permanent discontinuation of HB0030
* the above toxic reaction is evaluated by laboratory ,physical ,ECG, radiographic examination and etc.
* Adverse events will be graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to 21 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD), - Maximum Tolerated Dose is defined as the highest dose in which the number of cases of DLT is less than 1/3 of the total patients in the first treatment cycle (DLT evaluation period) of the dose increasing stage.Six subjects are required to confirm MTD, Up to 24 Months
Maximum serum concentration(Cmax), * Cmax refers to The maximum blood concentration of HB0030 after administration.
* Sample concentration analysis method adopts ELISA .
* parameters will be calculated by Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 using noncompartmental analysis, within 48 hours after single HB0030 administered|half-life (t1/2), * t1/2 refers to time of a half reduction of total drug concentration in Body.
* parameters will be calculated by Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 using noncompartmental analysis, within 3 months after first dose of HB0030 administered|time of maximum concentration(Tmax), - peak time after HB0030 administration.parameters will be calculated by Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 using noncompartmental analysis, within 48 hours after single HB0030 administered|AUClast, * AUClast refers to Area under the curve (AUC) from the time of 0 to the last measurable concentration.
* parameters will be calculated by Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 using noncompartmental analysis., Up to 24 Months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the number of patients were confirmed complete response(CR) and/or partial response(PR) according to RECIST 1.1 divided by the patients with at least one tumour evaluation, Up to 24 Months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR defined as the number of patients were confirmed CR and/or PR and/or stable disease(SD) according to RECIST 1.1 divided by the patients with at least one tumour evaluation, Up to 24 Months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as time from the first record of CR or PR to the first record of disease progression or death of subjects, Up to 24 Months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Using the ELISA method to detect the anti-drug antibody production in peripheral blood after HB0030 administration., Up to 24 Months
The phase Ia study will enroll up to 19-36 subjects with advanced solid tumor who have progressing tumor after standard therapy and have no better treatment option.The conventional 3+3 design will be applied for dose escalation.This study will set up 8 dose groups.HB0030 injection is administered once every 3 weeks.
