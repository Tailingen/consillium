Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Image-guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Spinal Metastatic Tumors
Data of 100 patients with spinal metastatic tumor who received stereotactic radiotherapy or conventionally-fractionated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the multi-center of the research group from July 2019 to June 2021 will be collected, as well as their follow-up data.Previous treatment and follow-up data will be analyzed to evaluate the clinical efficacy comparison of stereotactic radiotherapy and conventionally-fractionated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for spinal metastatic tumors, local control rate and side effects, and to clarify the effectiveness and safety of different doses of radiotherapy.

Cancer pain score, Numerical grading (NRS) should be used for pain intensity assessment, and facial expression pain scoring should be used for patients with difficulty in expression., 1 year after the treatment|Muscle strength and muscle tension grading, Muscle strength and muscle tension were graded by Numbers, 1 year after the treatment|JOA score of cervical and lumbar vertebrae, JOA score of cervical and lumbar vertebrae, 2 years after the treatment|Quality of Life Score of Tumor Patients(0-60), Common methods for evaluating the quality of life of patients:The full score of quality of life is 60, the worst is \< 20, the worse is 21-30, the average is 31-40, the better is 41-50, and the good is 51-60., 2 years after the treatment

In this study, Data of 100 patients with spinal metastatic tumor who received stereotactic radiotherapy or conventionally-fractionated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the multi-center of the research group from July 2019 to June 2021 will be collected, as well as their follow-up data.The metastases were treated with SBRT.Using multimodal image fusion to outline the target area.PTV = GTV + 0-10mm Target volume radiation dose: The range of BED value of radiotherapy was 60-72 when the distance between the tumor and gastrointestinal tract or spinal cord was more than 5 mm (alpha/beta=10) and 51.3-59.5 when the distance between the tumor and gastrointestinal tract or spinal cord was less than 5 mm (alpha/beta=10).The metastases were treated with Conventionally-fractionated image- guided Intensity modulated radiotherapy.Using multimodal image fusion to outline the target area.The dose of the target volume radiotherapy dose is 30 Gy/10f or 40Gy/20f.Previous treatment and follow-up data will be analyzed to evaluate the clinical efficacy comparison of stereotactic radiotherapy and conventionally-fractionated image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for spinal metastatic tumors, local control rate and side effects, and to clarify the effectiveness and safety of different doses of radiotherapy.
