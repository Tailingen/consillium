A Phase II Study of the Combination of Azacitidine and Pembrolizumab for Patients Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This study is a Phase II single-center clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with the 7-day regimen of azacitidine for the treatment of relapsed/refractory HL.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Azacytidine|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
To assess the overall response rate (ORR), through study completion, an average of 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary Objectives:

â€¢ To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of Pembrolizumab in combination with azacitidine in patients with relapsed or progressed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the duration of response (DOR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed HL treated with this combination.
* To assess the safety of Pembrolizumab in combination with azacitidine in children with refractory/relapsed HL.
* To assess the proportion of patients who proceed to stem cell transplantation upon achieving response with the combination of Pembrolizumab and Azacitidine regimen.
