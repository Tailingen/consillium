Adoptive T Cell Therapy Following HER2-Pulsed Dendritic Cell Vaccine & Pepinemab /Trastuzumab in Patients w/ Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Adoptive T-Cell therapy following the Dendritic Cell (DC1) study vaccine given in combination with pepinemab added to standard of care therapy, trastuzumab to help people with HER2 positive breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Dendritic Cell (DC1) Vaccine|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pepinemab|BIOLOGICAL: T-Cell therapy
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of expanded CD4 T cells, MTD of expanded CD4 T cells after treatment with DC1 vaccines and trastuzumab/pepinemab., Up to 6 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR according to RECIST criteria v1.1 and iRECIST of treatment DC1 vaccines and pepinemab/trastuzumab, Up to 6 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) of DC1 vaccines and pepinemab/trastuzumab, To assess the 6-month clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to RECIST criteria v. 1.1 of treatment with DC1 vaccines and pepinemab/trastuzumab, at 6 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) of expanded CD4 T Cells, To assess the 6-month CBR according to RECIST criteria v. 1.1 of treatment with expanded CD4+ T cells following DC1 vaccines and pepinemab/trastuzumab., at 6 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the length of time from start of treatment to progression or death., Up to 36 months
Patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer will be treated with 6 weekly injections of dendritic cell (DC1) vaccines in combination with trastuzumab and pepinemab.

Investigators hypothesize these therapies will elicit CD4+ HER2 specific T cell responses. HER2 specific T cells will be expanded ex vivo which will be infused to patients subsequently following lymphodepletion therapy with cyclophosphamide. Trastuzumab and pepinemab will be given as maintenance in addition to booster DC1 vaccines.
