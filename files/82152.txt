Early Urinary Continence After Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Procedure and Anatomic Landmarks
This study describes how to perform a correct prostatic apex and membranous urethra in order to preserve all anatomical elements that are necessary to achieve a very fast urinary continence after open/laparoscopic/robotic radical prostatectomy, avoiding positive surgical margins at this level.
Prostatic Cancer|Surgical Procedure, Unspecified|Urinary Incontinence
change in the proportion of patients with of urinary incontinence, Assessment of the proportion of patients with urinary incontinence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, The follow-up was at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after removal of the urethral catheter (one week after surgery), and, thereafter, once a month over the first year after surgery
change in the proportion of patients with recovery of the erectile function, assessment of the recovery of the erectile function after surgery, every month during the first year after surgery|number of patients with overall positive surgical margins, postoperative assessment of positive surgical margins, immediate postoperative period|biochemical recurrence rate, until the completion of the study, with a mean follow-up of 72 months
This study describes a simple technical variation, aimed at the sparing of the muscle systems and neurovascular bundles in order to achieve high rates of urinary continence in the early postoperative period ( the first two months after surgery) in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.
