Niraparib and Neratinib in Advanced Solid Tumors With Expansion Cohort in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of niraparib and neratinib in combination in patients with advanced solid tumors during Phase 1. To evaluate clinical benefit (≥4-month progression-free survival \[PFS\]) of niraparib and neratinib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in Phase 1b.

Phase 1: To determine the Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of niraparib and neratinib in patients with advanced solid tumors, The RP2D will be identified during the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study using a modified 3+3 design and evaluated in a phase 1b dose expansion cohort of up to 12 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer., 4 Months|Phase 1b: To evaluate clinical benefit (≥4-month progression-free survival [PFS]) of niraparib and neratinib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer., Phase 1b: To evaluate clinical benefit (≥4-month progression-free survival \[PFS\]) of niraparib and neratinib given at the RP2D to in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. To evaluate the clinical benefit, (defined as ≥4-month progression free survival (PFS), using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer., 4 months
To assess the frequency of adverse events (AEs), To assess adverse events (AEs) characterized and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE V 5.0) to determine safety and toxicity of the combination of neratinib and niraparib, 5 months|Preliminary efficacy (objective response rate [ORR]) of niraparib and neratinib in patients with advanced solid tumors., To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR): The percentage of patients with objective response either partial response (PR) or complete response(CR), by analysis using RECIST 1.1 criteria, 5 years
This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1/1b trial to determine the RP2D of neratinib and niraparib when given in combination to patients with advanced solid tumors. The RP2D will be identified during the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study using a modified 3+3 design and evaluated in a phase 1b dose expansion cohort of up to 12 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
