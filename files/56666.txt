Phase II of Lenvatinib Plus PD-1 Antibody for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib combined with PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: PD-1 antibody
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first., 12 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on mRECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff., 12 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on mRECIST., 12 months|Adverse Events, Number of adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 30 days
Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and PD-1 antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus PD-1 antibody. Thus, the investigators carried out this single-arm, prospective, phase II study to find out it.
