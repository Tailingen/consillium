Benefits of MPACT in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy
The goal of this study is to test, in a randomized controlled trial among head and neck cancer patients, the short and longer term effects of the MPACT (Maintaining Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment) program (infused with motivational interviewing and self-determination theory-based strategies) initiated at the time of concurrent chemotherapy with radiation (CCRT), on key outcomes such as functional mobility and quality of life, and ultimately physical activity. The central hypotheses is that in head and neck cancer patients undergoing CCRT, the MPACT program, as compared to usual care controls, will result in less acute decline, faster recovery, and better maintenance of these key outcomes.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
OTHER: MPACT
Mean change in 6 minute walk distance (6MWD), 6 MWD will be assessed at baseline, at weeks 4, 7, 11, and 14 and at 6 months and 1 year. The change from baseline will be calculated for each participant and longitudinal mixed models will be used to characterize mean outcomes over time for each intervention group., 1 Year
