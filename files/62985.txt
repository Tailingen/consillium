Vorinostat to Prevent Graft Versus Host Disease Following Reduced Intensity, Related Donor Stem Cell Transplant
The proposed research study is to test the drug vorinostat, in a new use as an additional medication, with other standard treatments for the prevention of severe acute graft versus host disease (GVHD).

If this treatment is safe and effective, when combined with a reduced intensity transplant, the research may achieve a more effective therapy for patients with high-risk, blood cell related cancers.

All subjects will receive an identical, known treatment to test if the treatment is safe and effective (a phase II trial). For patients to take part they must have a high-risk, blood cell cancer, be suitable candidates to receive a reduced intensity transplant and have a matched, related donor.

Adult subjects (age 18 years and older) will be considered as subjects provided, as detailed in the protocol, they meet additional criteria and are not excluded from participating. About fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in this study at the University of Michigan.

Patients who receive blood stem cell transplants (HSCT), also called bone marrow transplants, to treat their cancer are at risk for serious complications, which may sometimes be fatal. The more common, serious ones are relapse (return of their disease), body organ injury from the intensity of the chemotherapy given prior to their transplant, and a serious complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a form of rejection, where the transplanted cells of the donor attack the recipient's body as foreign, and do damage to organs and tissues.

To decrease the side effects of the chemotherapy given before a transplant, reduced intensity treatment plans(regimens)have recently been developed at a number of transplant centers. A decrease in the side effects of chemotherapy (called toxicities) has been achieved; however, this success with "less intensive" treatments has been partially offset by less successful results in controlling the patient's cancer.

As mentioned above, GVHD is a form of transplant rejection. GVHD can affect the digestive system, skin, liver and other body systems. GVHD can increase the risk of infection. After a matched, related donor stem cell transplant, GVHD when severe, is a major cause of discomfort, organ damage, and even death. When a graft vs host reaction develops, but is kept under control, studies show there may be a beneficial graft versus tumor effect, helping to destroy tumor cells in the patient, and thus providing a more effective control of their cancer.

The goal of this study is to try to maximize the potential benefits, of giving patients less intense chemotherapy to reduce the toxic effects, letting the graft vs host effect help in destroying tumor cells, but preventing acute severe GVHD by using the drug vorinostat, combined with standard medicines, to reduce the chance of serious GVHD-related complications.
Hematologic Malignancies|Graft vs Host Disease
PROCEDURE: reduced intensity, related donor stem cell transplant|DRUG: tacrolimus (standard GVHD prophylaxis)|DRUG: mycophenolate (standard GVHD prophylaxis)|DRUG: vorinostat
100-day Cumulative Incidence of Grade 2-4 Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), Assess if the addition of Vorinostat to standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen can reduce the rate of grades 2-4 acute GVHD when compared to 48% in a cohort of identically treated RIC HSCT patients without vorinostat. A reduction of incidence to less than 25% will be considered successful., 100 days
Number of Serious Adverse Events, The safety and feasibility will be partially measured by the number of serious adverse events (SAE) recorded by participants receiving at least one dose of Vorinostat., 100 days|Percent Cumulative Incidence of Relapse at 2 Years., Determine the cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years., two years|Percent Survival at 2-years, To determine 2-year overall survival rate, two years
