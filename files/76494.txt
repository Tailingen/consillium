Computed Tomography (CT) - Guided Brachytherapy Versus Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Percutaneous, image-guided tumor ablation has evolved as a genuine alternative for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Published data exploring stereotactic or proton beam percutaneous irradiation have revealed,that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is radiosensitive to certain protocols. In Phase I and II studies, the investigators investigated the potential role of local irradiation in primary and secondary liver tumors employing a Iridium192 source. The promising results of previous studies indicate that CT-guided brachytherapy might play a role in the treatment of unresectable HCC.

Therefore, the investigators started a randomized, controlled, clinical Phase-II study to evaluate the efficacy and survival-benefits of brachytherapy versus transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable HCC.
