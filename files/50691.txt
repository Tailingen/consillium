Safety and Efficacy Study Using 5-ALA Oral Administration as an Adjuvant Therapy on the Rate of Local Tumor Recurrence in Patients Who Have Desmoids Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative 5-ALA oral administration and subsequently intraoperative tumor bed phototherapy with red light laser, as an adjuvant therapy on the 3 years rate of local tumor recurrence in patients with desmoid tumors. To evaluate the Safety of 5-ALA administration. 5 years local recurrence rate.
The Aim of the Study is to Evaluate the Efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy as an|Adjuvant Therapy on the Clinical Outcome of Patients With Desmoid Tumors After|Surgical Resection
DRUG: 5-AMINOLEVULINIC ACID (5-ALA), is a non fluorescent prodrug.
The primary endpoint is a binary variable where each patient is classified as a recurrence or a not recurrence case and will be determined by calculating the proportion of recurrence versus non recurrence rates, three years
To assess the safety of study drug administration in the study population. To assess the 5 years local recurrence rate., Data from all subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE whenever possible. Adverse events will be summarized by worst NCI CTC grade. Adverse events classified as NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4, study-drug-related events, and serious adverse events will be summarized separately. Laboratory data will be graded according to NCI CTCAE severity grade., five years
