Demonstration Of A Next Generation PET CT System
The intent of this evaluation is to obtain user feedback on device performance, user preference, image quality, workflow, and new device features, a necessary part of product development. This study will also help to inform protocol development in reducing both scan time and/or radiologic tracer dose. The goal of this study is to collect a library of image data from the hybrid PET/CT system to be used for evaluation and optimization of the image quality of the system in a clinical setting and as comparison with the standard of care hybrid PET/CT system, Discovery MI 25m (DMI5R).
