Sleeve Lobectomy for Lung Cancer in Minimally Invasive Surgical Techniques
The goal of this multicenter observational study is to evaluate the long-term survival and perioperative outcomes of sleeve lobectomy in robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) for patients with central lung cancer when compared with video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approach, both of which have been already applied to these patients in minimally invasive surgical techniques as part of their regular medical care recently. The main question it aims to answer is:

Are RATS sleeve lobectomy associated with similar or even better long-term survival and perioperative outcomes for patients with central lung cancer when compared with the VATS approach?
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
PROCEDURE: RATS Group|PROCEDURE: VATS group
3-year RFS, In this study, the investigators will focus on the 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the participants between the two groups (RATS vs. VATS) for the comparison of the long-term oncologic outcomes, as the primary outcome., 3 years
3-year OS, The investigators will also focus on the 3-year overall survival (OS) of the participants between the two groups (RATS vs. VATS) for the comparison of the long-term oncologic outcomes, as the secondary outcome., 3 years
Intraoperative blood loss, The intraoperative blood loss will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, measured in milliliter (mL)., up to 90 days|Operative time, The operative time will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, measured in minute (min)., up to 90 days|Length of hospital stay, The length of hospital stay will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, measured in day., up to 90 days|Postoperative drainage, The postoperative drainage will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, measured in milliliter (mL)., up to 90 days|Postoperative complications, The postoperative complications will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, showed in the number of the participants who occurred postoperative complications (n)., up to 90 days|Perioperative mortality, The perioperative mortality will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, showed in the number of the participants who died within 90 days of surgery (n)., up to 90 days|Number of dissected lymph nodes, The number of dissected lymph nodes will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes (n)., up to 90 days|Margin status, The margin status will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy as one of the perioperative outcomes, showed in the number of the participants who had the positive or negative surgical margins (n)., up to 90 days
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Approximately 85% of lung cancer is non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nowadays, radical surgery resection remains the recommended local treatment for resectable NSCLC, and bronchial and/or pulmonary artery sleeve lobectomy have been proven to be preferred surgical approaches for patients with centrally located lung cancer when compared with traditional pneumonectomy. The long-term survival and perioperative outcomes of sleeve lobectomy in robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for central lung cancer were found to be comparable in a few retrospective studies with a limited number of participants. Still, they have not been investigated in the high-volume cohort setting.

Thus, the investigators conducted the multicenter observational cohort study to investigate if RATS sleeve lobectomy was non-inferior to VATS in patients with centrally located NSCLC and to evaluate the long-term survival and perioperative outcomes of sleeve lobectomy in these two regular minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Participants with centrally located primary NSCLC receiving bronchial sleeve resection with or without pulmonary artery angioplasty in minimally invasive approaches (RATS or VATS) between January 2015 and September 2024 were retrospectively identified and enrolled from the institutional database.

In this study, the investigators will focus on the 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the patients between the two groups (RATS vs. VATS) for the comparison of the long-term oncologic outcomes in the propensity score matching method. Meanwhile, the perioperative outcomes will be investigated between RATS versus VATS sleeve lobectomy, including but not limited to intraoperative blood loss, operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative drainage, postoperative complications, perioperative mortality, number of dissected lymph nodes, and margin status. In addition, this study will also try to explore the learning curve for RATS sleeve lobectomy and assess the safety and feasibility of minimally invasive sleeve lobectomy in specific patient populations, such as NSCLC patients following neoadjuvant therapy or those with clinical mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the study is designed to summarize the key surgical techniques and practice skills in minimally invasive thoracic surgery to promote technical improvements.
