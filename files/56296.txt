Study of HRS-1167 as Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is designed to determine if treatment with HRS-1167 alone is safe, tolerable, and has anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HRS-1167
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of HRS-1167, up to 24 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HRS-1167, up to 24 months|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of HRS-1167, up to 24 months|AEs+SAEs, from the first drug administration to within 30 days for the last treatment dose, up to 24 months
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameter of HRS-1167: Cmax, The concentration of HRS-1167 in plasma will be determined (Cmax will be derived)., At Cycle 0 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameter of HRS-1167: Tmax, The concentration of HRS-1167 in plasma will be determined (Tmax will be derived)., At Cycle 0 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameter of HRS-1167: AUC, The concentration of HRS-1167 in plasma will be determined. Area under the curve is the integral of the concentration-time curve. The AUC reflects the actual body exposure to drug after administration. The AUC is dependent on the rate of elimination of the drug from the body and the dose administered., At Cycle 0 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Complete response + Partial response (CR+PR) based on RECIST 1.1., up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Complete response + Partial response + Stable disease (CR+PR+SD) based on RECIST 1.1., up to 24 months|Duration of response (DoR), Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression assessed among patients who had an objective response., up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from C1D1 to first assessment of disease progression or death, whichever is earlier., up to 24 months
This study is designed to determine if treatment with HRS-1167 alone is safe, tolerable, and has anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.
