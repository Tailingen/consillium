Modulated Accelerated RAdiotherapy in Early Breast Cancer
This trial was a retrospective study on postoperative accelerated hypofractionated IMRT (MARA-1) in patients with early stage breast carcinoma, to compare late toxicity after this treatment and standard fractionated RT delivered with 3D-CRT.
Breast Cancer|Radiation Toxicity
RADIATION: accelerated hypofractionated RT|RADIATION: conventional fractionated RT
Incidence of treatment-related late adverse events, late toxicity (cutaneous and subcutaneous) is evaluated using RTOG/EORTC criteria in both groups of patients, 5 years
Incidence of treatment-related acute adverse events, acute toxicity (cutaneous and subcutaneous) is evaluated using RTOG/EORTC criteria in both groups of patients, 6 months|local control, absence of locoregional relapse, 5 years|overall survival, defined as the time from diagnosis to death, 5 years
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results in terms of late skin and subcutaneous toxicity of accelerated hypofractionated forward-planned IMRT in patients with early stage BC. Results were compared with a historical control group (CG) of patients treated with 3D-conformal postoperative RT delivered with conventional fractionation.
