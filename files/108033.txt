A Phase 3 Comparative Study of TAP-144-SR(6M) in Prostate Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Hormonal Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate hormone dynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of TAP-144-SR(6M) against TAP-144-SR(3M) in prostate cancer patients previously treated with hormonal therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: TAP-144-SR(6M)|DRUG: TAP-144-SR(3M)
The Rate of Suppression of Serum Testosterone to Castrate Level, Comparison of the proportion of patients maintained at castration level (â‰¤100 ng/dL), From the start of study drug administration through Week 48
Time Course of Changes in Serum Testosterone, From baseline to Week 48|Time Course of Changes in Serum Luteinizing Hormone (LH), From baseline to Week 48|Time Course of Changes in Serum Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH), From baseline to Week 48|Time Course of Change Rate in Serum PSA (FAS), Evaluation according to the "Criteria for therapeutic effect" from the General Rule for Clinical Pathological Studies on Prostate Cancer, 4th edition (determination of therapeutic effect by prostate-specific antigen \[PSA\]), From baseline to Week 48|The Maximum Rate of Change in PSA Suppression (FAS), Evaluation according to the "Criteria for therapeutic effect" from the General Rule for Clinical Pathological Studies on Prostate Cancer, 4th edition (determination of therapeutic effect by PSA), From baseline to Week 48|Percentage of Participants With Progression by PSA (FAS), Evaluation according to the "Criteria for therapeutic effect" from the General Rule for Clinical Pathological Studies on Prostate Cancer, 4th edition (determination of therapeutic effect by PSA), From baseline to Week 48|Soft Tissue Response, Assessment in accordance with the "criteria for therapeutic effect" from the General Rule for Clinical Pathological Studies on Prostate Cancer, 4th edition. Soft tissue response was evaluated in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., At week 48|Bone Lesion Response, Partially revised assessment based on the "criteria for therapeutic effect" from the General Rule for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Prostate Canter, 4th edition. Response is measured using bone scintigraphy. Increase in new (2 or more) bone lesion is considered as progression, At Week 48|Serum Unchanged TAP-144 Level, From baseline to Week 48|12-lead ECG, At 1 hour, week 24, and week 48 after administration
The purpose of this study is to evaluate hormone dynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of TAP-144-SR(6M) against TAP-144-SR(3M) in prostate cancer patients previously treated with hormonal therapy.
