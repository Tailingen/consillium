Application of AS101 for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Solid Tumor Patients
Chemotherapy Induced Thrombocytopenia is a common side-effect of bone marrow suppression as a result of a chemotherapy treatment. AS101 is a tellurium based small compound with immunomodulating characteristics which attributed to the direct inhibition of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. AS101 was previously shown to induce a significant reduction in thrombocytopenia that accompany cancer therapy with no major toxicity . This phase II randomized open study will evaluate the efficacy of AS101 for the treatment of chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia in patients with various solid tumors.
