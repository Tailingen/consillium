Advanced Radiotherapy (ART) in Gynecological Cancer Patients (GYN-ART)
This is an observational mono-institutional study. Patients with gynecologic tumors treated with advanced radiotherapy- Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)- will be included and toxicity and outcomes analyzed.

RADIATION: Image Guided Radiotherapy
Local Relapse Free Survival, local control (on the treated site) of the disease, From date of radiotherapy end until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months|Regional Relapse Free Survival, regional control (regional lymph nodal chain) of the disease, From date of radiotherapy end until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months|Distant Metastases Free Survival, distant metastases developed after the treatment, From date of radiotherapy end until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months|Disease Free Survival, absence of disease progression during the follow-up, From date of radiotherapy end until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months|Overall Survival, survival from all causes, From date of radiotherapy end until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 120 months|Cancer Specific Survival, cancer survival, From date of radiotherapy end until the date of death from disease progression, assessed up to 120 months
Acute toxicity, Toxicity developed in the first three months after the treatment, assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 scale, which displayes grades from 1 to 5, with grade 1 meaning mild toxicity and grade 5 death related to toxicity, Up to three months from the start of radiotherapy|Late toxicity, Toxicity developed after three months until the end of follow-up or death, assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 scale, assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 scale, which displayes grades from 1 to 5, with grade 1 meaning mild toxicity and grade 5 death related to toxicity, From three months after the start of radiotherapy until the end of follow-up or death, assessed up to 120 months
Predictive factors for disease progression and death, Factors predicting survival. Survival trees, univariate/multivariate Cox regression models will be estimated to identify potential risk factors associated with survival outcomes, From radiotherapy end to date of local, regional progression, distant failure, or death, assessed up to 120 months|Radiomic predictive factors for disease progression and death, CT and PET/CT radiomic features predicting relapse or death will be extracted, acording to IBSI (Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative), owning to the different families of features: Morphology, Statistical, Intensity Histogram, Grey Level Cooccurrence Matrix 3D-average, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix 3D-combined, Grey Level Run Lenght 3D-average. Grey Level Run Lenght 3D_combined, Grey Level Size Zone Matrix 3D, Neighbors Grey Tone Difference Matrix 3D, Grey Level Distance Zone Matrix 3D, standard convolutional filters within radiomic workflow (wavelets, Laplacian of Gaussian), From radiotherapy end to the first registered event (disease progression or death), assessed up to 120 months
The patients with gynecological cancer treated with Advanced Radiotherapy (ART)- Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)- at the Department of Radiotherapy of "IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute" (IRCCSSRaffaele) from January 2005 to January 2024 will be identified and their clinical and dosimetric data retrieved and analyzed.

The study objectives are the analysis of acute and late toxicity, and clinical outcomes, such as local, regional and distant control,disease free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. Secondary objective is the identification of prognostic factors for toxicity, disease progression, survival, including radiomic characteristics.
