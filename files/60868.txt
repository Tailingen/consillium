Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Those who have a CR in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects who experience ongoing SD or an ongoing PR at 1 year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's and Sponsor's discretion. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment in the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences confirmed PD or unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, undergoes liver transplantation or surgical resection, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Subjects with an initial assessment of PD may, at the discretion of the Investigator, continue to receive study treatment until PD is confirmed. The maximum time on study treatment is 2 years.
