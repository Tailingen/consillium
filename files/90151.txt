* Treatments for CNS metastases, including type of treatment and dates of treatment, Patients will be followed from enrolment in the study until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or study end date. The minimum follow-up will be 12 months and the maximum allowed follow-up will be 36 months|Assessment of patient (HRQoL) using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ - Lung Cancer 13 items (EORTC QLQ-LC13)3, â€¢ Change in score from baseline for each Quality of Life (QoL) domain and for overall QoL, measured at each subsequent site visit, Patients will be followed from enrolment in the study until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or study end date. The minimum follow-up will be 12 months and the maximum allowed follow-up will be 36 months
Study Design This will be an observational cohort study of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer).

Patients will be recruited from participating sites in Europe, Asia, and Canada. Patients meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be selected during a 24-month enrolment period per country and will be followed from enrolment in the study until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or study end date (whichever occurs earlier). Data Sources Data will be collected following enrolment in the study and entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF). All data will be collected using patient medical records. The investigator will be responsible for ensuring that all the required data is collected and entered into the eCRF. The site will collect the patient questionnaires and the data will be uploaded according to the data entry procedures.

Study Population

* Adult male or female patients (according to age of majority/adulthood as defined by local regulations) who have given written informed consent as per local regulations.
* The primary cohort will include patients with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed while on or after receiving front-line EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) therapy (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or icotinib).
* Additionally, a secondary cohort of patients will include patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are treatment naive or patients who were diagnosed at an earlier stage but have progressed to metastatic NSCLC during the selection period.

Exposures There are no specific drug exposures or interventions being evaluated, as cohort eligibility (for both cohorts) is not exposure-based, but rather disease-based. All molecular testing and treatments will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Study Measures and Outcomes

* Patient demographic and clinical characteristics
* Molecular testing patterns and outcomes
* Treatment patterns
* Physician-reported clinical outcomes
* Cancer-related health care utilization
* Treatment- and biopsy-related complications
* CNS metastases (brain metastases and leptomeningeal metastases) and treatments associated with CNS (central nervous system) metastases
* HRQoL (Health Related Quality of Life) and symptoms Precision and Sample Size Estimations For the primary cohort the minimum sample size recommended for conducting a country-level analysis is 200 patients per country. This is based on the precision estimation calculation for the categorical study measure (% of patients tested) and will allow a maximum of

  * 8.3% precision (i.e., assuming 50% undergoing molecular testing) around the point estimate for the categorical measure. For the secondary cohort the minimum sample size recommended for conducting a country-level analysis is 300 patients which was determined using precision estimates calculated for a categorical (% of patients tested) and a time-to-event (overall survival) measure. The overall study will include approximately 2800-3300 patients across all participating countries across both primary (1200-1300 patients) and secondary (1600-2000 patients) cohorts. Statistical Analysis No formal hypothesis testing is specified. Study measures including patient demographics and clinical characteristics, molecular testing patterns, treatment sequence patterns, physician-reported outcomes (overall survival) and patient-reported outcomes (HRQoL) will be reported by primary and secondary cohorts, unless indicated otherwise. Continuous study measures (e.g., age, duration of therapy) will be reported descriptively with mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be used to document categorical measures of interest (e.g., number and proportion of patients with a post progression molecular test, number and proportion of patients with a T790M mutation) and will include 95% CIs for key outcome variables. Kaplan-Meier curves and median survival will be estimated, overall and on an exploratory basis by clinical and treatment characteristics of interest (provided there are sufficient events available; e.g., chemotherapy vs. targeted therapy) as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan.
