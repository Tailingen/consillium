Study of Preoperative Weekly Paclitaxel and Carboplatin With Lapatinib (TykerbÂ®) in Patients With ErbB2-Positive Stage I-III Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib, in the neoadjuvant treatment of non-metastatic erbB2-positive breast cancer.

Secondary objectives include:

* To determine the safety and tolerability of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, combined with lapatinib, in an Asian population
* To determine breast conservation rates following neoadjuvant paclitaxel/ carboplatin/ lapatinib
* To determine clinical response rates and relapse-free survival of patients treated with neoadjuvant paclitaxel/ carboplatin/ lapatinib
* To identify predictive tumour biomarkers for pathologic complete response

The investigators hypothesize that pathologic complete response rates will be improved from 15% to 35% with the neoadjuvant regimen of carboplatin/ paclitaxel/ lapatinib compared to standard chemotherapy alone in HER2 positive early stage breast cancers.
ErbB2-Positive Stage I-III Breast Cancer
DRUG: paclitaxel/carboplatin/lapatinib
Rate of pathologic complete response, 12 weeks
Treatment related toxicities, 12 weeks|Breast conservation rates, 16 weeks|Clinical response rates, 1 year|Relapse free survival (RFS), 2 years|Identification of tumor biomarkers that predict pathologic complete response, 16 weeks
* Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent, strong predictor of disease-free and overall survival in operable breast cancer
* The addition of neoadjuvant trastuzumab to chemotherapy results in a 2-3 fold increase in pCR rates in operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer
* Lapatinib is being explored as an alternative to trastuzumab in large clinical trials in operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer
* In a randomised phase III adjuvant trial, BCIRG 006, non-anthracycline chemotherapy (docetaxel and carboplatin) has been shown to be as effective as conventional sequential anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and docetaxel, in combination with trastuzumab, but with improved cardiac safety
* Weekly paclitaxel has been shown in a randomized phase III study to be the optimal adjuvant taxane regimen
* Weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in Phase I/II clinical studies of metastatic breast and ovarian cancer
* The investigators aim to assess the efficacy of a non-anthracycline containing regimen, weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib in inducing pCR in the neoadjuvant treatment of ErbB2-positive non-metastatic breast cancer. The investigators hypothesize that this combination will achieve pCR rates of at least 35%
