Italian Lung Cancer Observational Study
LUCENT is an observational study focused on malignant pulmonary and tracheo-bronchial disease. It involves a large proportion of reference Italian thoracic surgery centers. The relevance of the study is related to the epidemiology of lung cancer in the world - also known as "Big Killer" - and the high mortality rates both in males and females.

The aim of his prospective study is to collect a large bulk of postoperative patients' outcome data and to produce up-to-date descriptive statistics of patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. These results will be pivotal to compare the clinical results of all the relevant specialities involved in the care of lung cancer such as medical oncologists and radiation oncologists.
