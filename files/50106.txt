For the role functioning scale, participant responses to the 2 questions "Q6: Were you limited in doing either your work or daily activities" and "Q7: Were you limited in pursuing your hobbies or other leisure time activities" were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). The scores were linearly transformed on a scale of 0 to 100, with a low score indicating better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement., Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1), Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 & 16; end of treatment/discontinuation (approximately at Day 351); Follow up: Months 3 to 48 (Total duration is up to 5 years); Cycles 1-5= 28 day cycles; Cycles 6-16: 21 day cycles|Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Patient-reported Function (Physical Functioning [Q1-Q5]), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. For the physical functioning scale, participant responses to 5 questions about daily activities (strenuous activities, long walks, short walks, bed/chair rest \& needing help with eating, dressing, washing themselves, or using the toilet) were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). The scores were linearly transformed on a scale of 0 to 100, with a high score indicating worst functioning. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement in functioning., Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1), Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 & 16; end of treatment/discontinuation (approximately at Day 351); Follow up: Months 3 to 48 (Total duration is up to 5 years); Cycles 1-5= 28 day cycles; Cycles 6-16: 21 day cycles|Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status (GHS) [Q29] and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) [Q30] Combined Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant responses to the questions regarding Global Health Status (Q29:GHS; "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?") and Quality of Life (Q30: QoL; "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?") are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better outcome. Negative change from Baseline values indicated deterioration in QOL or functioning and positive values indicated improvement., Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1), Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 & 16; end of treatment/discontinuation (approximately 351 days); Follow up: Months 3 to 48 (Total duration is up to 5 years); Cycles 1-5= 28 day cycles; Cycles 6-16: 21 day cycles|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. AEs are reported based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5.0., Up to 5 years|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, Postdose Day 1 of Cycle 1; Predose Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4; Predose Cycles 6, 10, and 14; Predose Day 2 of Cycle 16; Cycles 1-5= 28-day cycles; Cycles 6-16: 21-day cycles|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Atezolizumab, Baseline evaluable participant= participant with an ADA assay result from a baseline sample(s).
