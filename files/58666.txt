A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of RO7443904 in Combination With Glofitamab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a first-in human, open-label, Phase 1 dose-escalation study in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for intravenous (IV) and/or subcutaneous (SC) dosing schemes of this combination treatment, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of this combination treatment in participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL).
