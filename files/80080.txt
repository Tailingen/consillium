Effect of Surgical Margin Width on Recurrence and Survival in Patients With Hepatic Oligometastasis of Colorectal Cancer
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of surgical margin width on the prognosis of patients with hepatic oligometastasis of colorectal cancer by statistical 1-year intrahepatic recurrence-free survival rate (ihRFSrate). The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of surgical margin width on long-term survival and total recurrence of colorectal cancer in patients with hepatohepatic metastasis by statistical overall survival time (OS) and relapse-free survival time (RFS), and to evaluate the safety of wide margin surgery compared with narrow margin surgery in patients with Cromitis during perioperative period.

This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study to evaluate the effects of surgical margin width on 1-year intrahepatic relapse-free survival, relapse-free survival time, overall survival time, and perioperative safety in patients with hepatic oligometastasis of colorectal cancer. Subjects will undergo radical resection of liver tumors and will be randomly assigned to a wide margin group (≥7mm) or narrow margin group (\<7mm) using stratified randomization, stratified by primary lesion site (right colon vs left colon/rectum). The margin width was the narrowest margin distance measured in fresh specimens. After radical liver tumor resection, subjects were pretreated regularly Follow-up evaluation.
Oncology|Tumor Recurrence and Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Surgery and procedure|PROCEDURE: Surgery and procedure
Intrahepatic recurrence-free survival at 1 year(ihRFS rate), Refers to the percentage of subjects in this group who received intrahepatic imaging diagnosis of recurrence or death from any cause from surgery to 1 year after surgery., From liver tumor resection to 1 year after surgery
Recurrence free survival time(RFS), The earliest date from the date of receipt of liver tumor resection to the date of confirmation of tumor recurrence or the date of death from any cause. Regular follow-up visits were conducted until the end of the study follow-up, 12 months|Overall survival time(OS), Refers to the time from liver tumor resection to death from any cause, if the above criteria were not met, the date of the last evaluation was used for analysis., 24 months|Perioperative safety, In this study, the incidence of perioperative complications was calculated according to Clavien Dindo complication scoring system. At the same time, perioperative death, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion and other surgical safety treatment were counted, Patient 90 days after hepatectomy
