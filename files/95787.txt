Indium In 111 Pentetreotide in Treating Patients With Refractory Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other sources to damage tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of indium In 111 pentetreotide in treating patients who have refractory cancer.

RADIATION: indium In 111 pentetreotide
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxic effects, and the preliminary antitumor activity of indium In 111 pentetreotide.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive indium In III pentetreotide (OctreoScan) IV on day 1. Imaging is conducted on days 3 and 6. Treatment continues weekly for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of OctreoScan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
