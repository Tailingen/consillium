Safety Study of HPV DNA Vaccine to Treat Head and Neck Cancer Patients
This study will test the safety of an HPV DNA vaccine after it is injected into your muscle using an electroporation device (TriGridTM Delivery System made by Ichor Medical Systems), and will test the ability of the vaccine to help your body's immune system to recognize HPV-infected and associated cancer cells. In addition to giving the vaccine using an electroporation device, we are giving the vaccine in combination with an immunomodulatory agent to further enhance immune responses against HPV-infected and associated cancer cells.
