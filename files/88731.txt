Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)
The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate, tolerance and overall survival in patients with stage III, IVa, IVb NPC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TPF regimen) and concurrent chemoradiation.

Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the distant metastases free survival, and disease-free survival of patients with stage III,IVa, IVb NPC treated with this regimen.

The third objective of this study is to evaluate who may benifit from this treatment regimen.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: docetaxel, cisplatin, fluorouracil|RADIATION: 3D-CRT (three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy) or IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy)
overall survival, 3 and 5 years
distant metastases free survival , and disease-free survival, 3 and 5 years
Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced NPC. The survival benefit gained from adding induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation has not been defined yet. In the present clinical study, we hope to assess the tolerance and survival benefits of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation in patients with stage III, IVa and IVb NPC.
