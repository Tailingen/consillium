Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Image-Guided Prostate Biopsy Following Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion image-guided prostate biopsy following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsy may help find and diagnose prostate cancer
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy|PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance imaging
Number of times the first biopsy needle is placed within 3.0 mm of the center lesion, A likelihood ratio test will be used to test for independence among lesions within a prostate (corresponding to a lack of systematic MRI-TRUS image distortion and implying that, overall, 1st biopsies to a lesion within one prostate are as likely to accurate as in another prostate)., One month after last patient enrolled is taken off study|Number of times the second biopsy needle is placed within 3.0 mm of the center lesion, A likelihood ratio test will be used to test for independence among lesions within a prostate (corresponding to a lack of systematic MRI-TRUS image distortion and implying that, overall, 1st biopsies to a lesion within one prostate are as likely to accurate as in another prostate)., One month after last patient enrolled is take off study
Average distance of the first needle to the center of the lesion, A nested (random effects) analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to analyze the distance of the first needle from the center of the lesion. Standard error or 95% confidence interval will be calculated., One month after last patient enrolled is taken off study|Average distance of the second needle from the first needle minus 2.0 mm, A nested (random effects) ANOVA will be used to analyze the distance of the first needle from the center of the lesion., One month after last patient enrolled is taken off study|Average distance of the third needle from the first needle minus 2.0 mm, A nested (random effects) ANOVA will be used to analyze the distance of the first needle from the center of the lesion., One month after last patient enrolled is taken off study
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate accuracy of the new image-guided targeted needle biopsy using the ex-vivo human prostate as obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo robotic radical prostatectomy, followed by 3 MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsies.
