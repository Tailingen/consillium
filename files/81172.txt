A Study of NBL-028 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, single agent study conducted in patients with advanced solid tumor types known to express Claudin 6 (CLDN6) for whom standard of care therapies are not available, are no longer effective, or not tolerated. This study consists two stages: dose-escalating and dose-expansion.

Dose escalation will be guided by the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design including accelerated titration to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NBL-028. Dose expansion - Additional patients (no more than 200) will be enrolled at the recommended dose or multiple doses (if necessary) determined in the dose escalation stage. Sponsor may elect to enroll specific tumor types into four cohorts.
