Study of Preoperative Docetaxel or Cisplatin (CDDP) + Docetaxel for C-stage IB-II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the preoperative docetaxel and docetaxel-cisplatin combination in c-stage IB/II NSCLC, and select the optimal preoperative therapy for phase III trials.

Preoperative chemotherapy has substantial theoretical advantage. Several controlled trials are under way in early stage (clinical stage IB-II) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In each trial, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is employed. Although platinum-based doublet is the treatment of choice for advanced NSCLC, risk/benefit balance might well be different in earlier stages. There have been no prospective randomized trials to choose an optimal preoperative chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC.

Comparison: Preoperative cisplatin-docetaxel combination versus docetaxel monotherapy in clinical stage IB/II NSCLC.
