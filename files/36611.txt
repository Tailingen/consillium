TACE Associated to Systemic Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Refractory Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective, minimally invasive therapy that is widely used for unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRC-LM) treatment. Chemoembolization, however, induces a hypoxic micro-environment, which increases neo-angiogenesis, and may promote early progression. For this reason, efficacy may be improved by associating TACE with an angiogenesis inhibitor, such as bevacizumab.

The use of FOLFIRI associate to Bevacizumab is part of clinical practice and is commonly used for the therapy of patients with CRC-LM both wild type and mutant.

This case-control observational study aim to compare patients treated with TACE using Irinotecan-loaded embolics followed by systemic Bevacizumab versus patients treated with FILFIRI+ Bevacizumab

TACE is indicated for the treatment of unresectable CRC_LM, patients who are refractory to systemic chemotherapy, elderly, or have a poor performance status, and is usually performed using irinotecan (IRI) covalently loaded onto embolics.

Although chemoembolization with irinotecan-loaded embolics results in an objective response, this method creates a hypoxic micro-environment. Hypoxia induces and activates the HIF-1 and HIF 2 hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, which promote high-level VEGF expression and subsequent neo-angiogenesis.

This may provide a mechanism for early relapse and progression following TACE and strongly support a rational for following TACE therapy with a therapeutic inhibitor of angiogenesis, such as bevacizumab.
