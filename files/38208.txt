Study of NIVOLUMAB/IPILIMUMAB Maintenance in Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
Immunotherapy has improved clinical outcomes in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Second-line treatment after progression to platinum-containing chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have antitumor activity in advanced / metastatic UC and provide favorable safety profiles when compared with chemotherapy The study aims to determine if Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab maintenance therapy is effective in delaying disease progression in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that did not progress during or following completion of first-line chemotherapy. Vexillum plans to recruit patients that achieve clinical benefit from first-line chemotherapy and may be candidates for maintenance immunotherapy to consolidate this benefit.

DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment date until the first documentation disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. A subject who has not confirmed progression will be censored at the last known disease evaluation. Patients who have not progressed and start a new line of treatment will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment prior to starting the next line of therapy. Estimated by Kaplan Meier., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|progression-free survival (PFS) in PL-D1 positive patients, subgroup analysis of PFS. Same definition of PFS as Outcome 1 applies., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.
Overall Survival (OS), Time from the first dose of study treatment date to the date of death and the proportion/percentage of patients alive at the end of follow-up. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last known date alive. Estimated by Kaplan Meier, Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Percentage/proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to ORR definition for the trial, or maintained stable disease (SD) as their overall best response throughout the study period, assessed by imaging follow-up (CT scan/MRI) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Stable disease should be maintained for at least 4 months to be considered as a CBR event., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Duration of response (DoR), Time from first confirmed response (CR or PR), according to ORR definition for the trial, to the date of the documented PD as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Post-chemotherapy PFS (cPFS), defined as the time from first dosing date of chemotherapy until the first documentation disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Post-chemotherapy OS (cOS), Time from first dosing of chemotherapy date to the date of death and the proportion/percentage of patients alive at the end of follow-up., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Frequency of adverse events, Number of patients experiencing adverse events from the total of patients exposed to study drug, Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Frequency of treatment-related adverse events, Number of patients experiencing adverse events related to the study treatment from the total of patients exposed to study drug, Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Quality of life (QoL) patient reported outcomes, Patient reported outcomes assessed through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), version 3 and the EuroQoL five-dimensions, 5 level (EQ- 5D-5L) questionnaire. Median scores for both questionnaires will be provided., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.|Objective response rate (ORR), Assessed by the investigator by imaging follow-up (CT scan/MRI) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. This will be considered as the percentage/proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as their overall best response throughout the study period. Objective responses will be assessed by the investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1., Throughout the study period, approximately 12 months per patient from first study dose.
All enrolled patients should have received first-line chemotherapy and not progressed. After a treatment-free interval of 3-12 weeks from chemotherapy, patients will receive maintenance therapy with 4 cycles of Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W)(induction phase) followed by Nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)(consolidation phase) until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression (PD), investigator ́s decision, patient's consent withdrawal or death by any cause, whichever occurs first.

* Induction phase (Total of 4 cycles Q3W)

  * Nivolumab at 1 mg/kg by intravenous (IV) infusion on D1 of each cycle.
  * Ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg by intravenous (IV) infusion on D1 of each cycle.
* Consolidation phase (Cycles Q4W) ○ Nivolumab at a fixed dose of 480 mg by intravenous (IV) infusion on D1 of each cycle. The maximum duration of treatment with nivolumab will be 2 years, and patients will discontinue treatment at any time in case of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression (PD), investigator ́s decision, patient's consent withdrawal or death by any cause, whichever occurs first.
