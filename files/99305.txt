Clinical Observation of Integrated Chinese Medicine With Western Medicine for the Reduction of Chemotherapy-induced Hematologic Toxicity
We conducted an observational study to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Integrated Chinese Medicine With Western Medicine for bone marrow suppression induced by chemotherapy in patients with cancer. The TCM constitution and pulse diagnosis was also observed in the study.
Myelosuppression
PROCEDURE: Chemotherapy and Integrated Chinese Medicine With Western Medicine for cancer treatment
Chemotherapy-induced Hematologic Toxicity, the blood cell count before and after chemotherapy was collected for measurement of severity of myelosuppression, one month
Patients with cancer under chemotherapy and integrated Western and Chinese medicine were enrolled in this observational study. The assessment of radial pressure pulse (RPP) was performed before and after chemotherapy. The correlation between the spectral energy (SE0-10 Hz, SE10-50 Hz, and SE13-50 Hz) of the RPP at six diagnosis positions and the blood cell counts before and after chemotherapy were analyzed.
