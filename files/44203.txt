IRX-2 Regimen Combined With Nivolumab in Recurrent/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is to determine the safety of IRX-2 Regimen combined with Nivolumab in patients with recurrent metastatic solid tumors. Researchers believe that this combination will have a tolerable safety profile and will increase the response rate in comparison to Nivolumab alone.

DRUG: IRX 2|DRUG: Nivolumab
Number of Participants Who Experience Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity which occurs during the DLT evaluation period of 4 weeks (during Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 28) and considered related to study treatment. Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is excluded., Up to Day 28
Objective Response Rate, Objective response determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 and Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) criteria., Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival of combination therapy, Progression free survival defined as the time from Day 1 of treatment to evidence of progression. Progression will be defined by RECIST Version 1.1, Up to 12 months
The first phase of this trial is to establish the safety of IRX-2 Regimen combined with Nivolumab. The IRX-2 Regimen is a 21-day regimen of cyclophosophamide on Day 1 and subcutaneous IRX-2 injections for 10 days between Days 4 and 18. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment, the enrollment will continue in a dose expansion phase. If there is a study treatment related DLT in 1 of 6 patients, the same dose will be investigated at the dose expansion cohorts. If study treatment related DLT is observed in 2 of 6 patients, accrual will be stopped and new dose levels or treatment sequences will be considered.
