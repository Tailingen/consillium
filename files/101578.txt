A Study of Investigational SAR245409 in Patients With Certain Lymphoma or Leukemia
Primary Objective:

- To evaluate the efficacy of SAR245409 as determined by the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with 1 of following relapsed or refractory lymphoma or leukemia subtypes: mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess duration of response, progression free survival (PFS), and proportion of patients with PFS at 6 months (24 weeks) in patients with either MCL, FL, CLL/SLL or DLBCL treated with SAR245409
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 in patients with MCL, FL, CLL/SLL or DLBCL
* To further characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR245409 in patients with MCL, FL, CLL/SLL or DLBCL
Lymphoma
DRUG: SAR245409
Objective response rate (ORR) as defined as the proportion of patients who experience complete response/remission (CR) or partial response/remission (PR), 2 months to 2 years
Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months, 6 months to 2 years
There is a 21 day screening period followed by 28 day cycles. Patients will continue to receive SAR245409 as long as there is clinical benefit or until a study withdrawal criterion is met. The last posttreatment visit will be 30 days after the last dose or until IMP-related toxicities have resolved or are deemed irreversible, whichever is later.
