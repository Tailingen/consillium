Relationship Between Dietary Protein Intake and Fatal and Non-fatal Health Outcomes
The aim of the current study was to clarify the relationship between protein intake and health by using a very large, general population cohort study, UK Biobank, to study the associations between reported protein intake (expressed in g/day, g/kg/day and % of total energy intake) and three health outcomes (all-cause mortality, incidence CVD and cancer).
Cardiovascular Diseases|Cancer|All-cause Mortality
OTHER: None as this is an observational study
All-cause mortality, Date and cause of death were obtained from death certificates, Mean of 7 years|CVD incidence, Date and cause of hospital admissions were identified via record linkage to Health Episode Statistics (HES) records for England and Wales and to the Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) for Scotland, Mean of 6.1 years|cancer incidence, Data on cancer diagnoses for participants resident in England and Wales is provided to UK Biobank by the Medical Research Information Service, based at the National Health Service Information Centre (http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/medical-research-informationservice). The Information Services Division (http://www.isdscotland.org/HealthTopics/Cancer/), which is a part of NHS Scotland, provides UK Biobank with the cancer data records for participants resident in Scotland., Mean of 6.1 years
