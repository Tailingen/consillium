Mecapegfilgrastim(PEG-G-CSF) for Prophylaxis of Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia in Patients With Lymphoma
Neutropenia is one of the most frequent adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the main factor to limit the dosage and the continuation of chemotherapy.A newly pegylated rhG-CSF was independently developed by JIANGSU HENGRUI Medicine Co., Ltd, China. Phase 1a, 1b and phase 2 trials have shown that pegylated rhG-CSF has decreased renal clearance, increased plasma half-life, and prolonged efficacy in compare with ﬁlgrastim.

This study is to evaluate efficacy and safety in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia of once-per-cycle Mecapegfilgrastim Injection(PEG-G-CSF) and daily G-CSF in Patients with lymphoma patients.

This is a randomized, controlled study. A total of 170 lymphoma patients who are eligible are planned to randomized assigned into two groups to receive mecapegfilgrastim fixed dose of 6 mg or filgrastim 5 µg/kg/day during chemotherapy.

The primary endpoint is the duration of grade ≥3 neutropenia in cycle 1. The secondary endpoints include incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (FN) in cycle 1-4, The pharmacoeconomics and safety profile are also evaluated.
