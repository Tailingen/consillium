Treatment Of Newly-diagnosed Follicular Lymphoma With CELMoD Golcadomide, Rituximab +/- Nivolumab.
First line treatment with combination rituximab and golcadomide with, or without nivolumab, in patients in previously untreated Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular Lymphoma Stage II|Follicular Lymphoma Stage III|Follicular Lymphoma Stage IV
DRUG: golcadomide|DRUG: Nivolumab 10 MG/ML|DRUG: Rituximab
Proportion of patients who achieve a complete metabolic response in the absence of prohibitive toxicity with induction rituximab, golcadomide with or without nivolumab comprising 8 cycles of therapy with each cycle delivered every 4 weeks., Metabolic response as assessed by PET/CT and defined by Lugano criteria; toxicities as defined by CTCAE v5, Consent to 8 weeks after last induction treatment (maximum 44 weeks)
To assess overall toxicity, As determined by rate of toxicity grade 3 or higher per CTCAE V5, Day 1 to 30 days after the end of maintenance phase (up to maximum 32 months)|To assess time to treatment failure, Treatment response assessed by PET/CT according to the Lugano classification for Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Day 1 end of follow up period (up to a maximum of 5 years)|Progression free survival, Quantification of progression free survival, Day 1 end of follow up period (up to a maximum of 5 years)|Overall survival, Quantification of OS, From date of enrolment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
This study will involve participants with a condition called Follicular Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (Follicular Lymphoma).

The main purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give an induction schedule of the drug golcadomide, in combination with Rituximab +/- Nivolumab, and to see how effective this combination is in patients who have had no previous drug treatment for their lymphoma. In particular, we will be monitoring for any specific side effects which may be increased by adding golcadomide to Rituximab treatment +/- Nivolumab for 8 cycles (28 days per cycle), with up to 2 years of maintenance treatment of rituximab in eligible patients following induction.

Participants will be reviewed at baseline and prior to each cycle of treatment for toxicity, scans will be performed at baseline, after 2 and 5 cycles of induction treatment, and every 8 weeks during maintenance phase. Following completion of treatment, participants will be followed up for a total of 3 years (every 6 months). In participants with relapsed disease, these will be followed for survival every 3 months.
