Personalized Adoptive Cellular Therapy Targeting MDS Stem Cell Neoantigens (PACTN)
This study will evaluate the safety of autologous T cells that have been immunized ex vivo with patient-specific MDS stem cell neoantigens in patients with MDS.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
BIOLOGICAL: PACTN
Acute and subacute toxicities and AEs, The incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) after PACTN infusion will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Adverse effects (AEs) and in particular cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and potential autoimmune AEs will be monitored., baseline to four weeks after infusion
Persistence, abundance, and activity of PACTN, Determined by quantity of PACTN in the subject's blood sample, assessed by the unique phenotype of PACTN lymphocytes and by functional measurement of PACTN activity (antigen-specific cytotoxicity), Samples will be collected on days 1, 4, 8, 15, 36, and 57, and then 3, 6, and 12 months|Disease Response, Disease response will be assessed by International Working Group (IWG) criteria on bone marrow aspiration, Samples will be collected between day 29 and 43, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months|Overall and progression-free survival of subjects who receive PACTN, Incidence of subjects who are alive, and both alive and disease - free will be assessed at 6 and 12 months, Six and 12 months after PACTN infusion
The duration of hematologic response, if any, Assessed by measurements of blood counts during subject follow-up, employing IWG criteria, Up to 12 months|PACTN persistence or peak abundance and clinical response, The grouped data on the clinical response and the 6 month and 1-year survival will be analyzed to assess if there is an association between PACTN persistence or peak abundance in blood, and either extent or duration of clinical response or subject survival, 6 months and 1 year|Changes in Variant allele frequency (VAF) of somatic mutations targeted by PACTN, VAFs of targeted mutations will be assessed in blood and marrow after PACTN infusion, From 4 days up to 1 year
PACTN is manufactured by a novel method to employ cancer-specific somatic variants (mutations) as a means to immunize autologous T lymphocytes to specifically kill cancer cells bearing the protein products of the mutations.

The PACTN method is based on the premise that somatic DNA mutations that cause cancer often give rise to proteins with an altered amino acid sequence. Peptides derived from these proteins, if expressed in the context of MHC Class I or II may be perceived as "non-self" by the immune system; that is, they may be perceived as neoantigens (aka, neoepitopes). Such neoantigens could therefore serve as immunogenic targets for the development of patient-specific, personalized T cell mediated immunotherapy.
