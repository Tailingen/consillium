Identification of Biomarkers for Prediction of Response or Resistance Against Target Therapy in Gastric Cancer
The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers predicting response or resistance factors of a targeted therapy with trastuzumab in advanced gastric cancer.
Esophageal Neoplasms|Stomach Neoplasms
OTHER: non-interventional
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimension of the target lesion, 12 months
time-to-progression, The period from study entry until disease progression, death, or date of last contact., up to 24 months|overall survival, OS is the duration from enrollment to death., up to 24 months
