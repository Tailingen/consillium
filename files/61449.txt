Evaluate TCRT-ESO-A2 Autologous T Cells Expressing TCR Specific for NY-ESO-1 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous cell therapy comprised of a subject's T cells stimulated ex vivo and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding an affinity enhanced TCR targeting tumor-associated antigen NY-ESO-1.

This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, activity, and pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics of TCRT-ESO-A2 infusion. A maximum tolerated dose study of TCRT-ESO-A2 in subjects with advanced malignancies expressing NY-ESO-1 is considered to be an acceptable risk. Once safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data are available, the activity of TCRT-ESO-A2 in NY-ESO-1-positive tumors may be explored further.

This is a Phase 1 open-label, multi-site, "3+3" dose escalation, study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose, safety and tolerability, of TCRT-ESO-A2 suspension for IV infusion. Approximately 24 HLA-A\*0201-positive subjects with head and neck cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, and triple-negative breast cancer expressing NY-ESO-1 who have received at least first-line therapy for their cancer, or which there is no accepted therapy will be enrolled. Tumor tissue samples will be evaluated and scored using the NY-ESO-1 IHC assay developed specifically to support this study.

Following screening and enrollment (approximately Days -63 to -36) subjects will undergo leukapheresis for T cell collection at approximately Day -35 (Figure 3). Harvested cells will be fractionated, genetically engineered, and expanded ex vivo to produce autologous TCRT-ESO-A2 TCR-T. Following TCRT-ESO-A2 product release, subjects will receive a 3-day, non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide from approximately Days -5 to -3 (recommend Wednesday to Friday) to prime the subject for immune re-population. Subjects will receive their TCRT-ESO-A2 cell product on Day 1 (recommend Monday) as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes. Within 30 minutes after completion of TCRT-ESO-A2 infusion, low dose subcutaneous aldesleukin (rhIL-2) will be administered at 500,000 IU BID daily for 14 days.

Dose escalation will be divided into three dose groups of three subjects each, with doses calculated as the number of TCR Vβ8-positive cells (total TCRT-ESO-A2 dose), with an allowable variance in cell count of ±30%. Escalation to higher doses will be based on the safety and tolerability of the previous cohort evaluated. If dose-limiting toxicity is observed in one subject at a dose level, up to an additional three dose limiting toxicity-evaluable subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. Subjects will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicity up to 28 days post-TCRT-ESO-A2 infusion. Prior to increasing the dose, a cohort management meeting will be held after the final enrolled subject has been followed for up to 28 days. The decision to increase to the next dose level will be a joint decision of the clinical site Investigators and Sponsor. At each cohort, there will be at least 7 days between infusion of each subject in the cohort. Enrollment into a dose level will be suspended if two of no more than six subjects at a dose level experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Three dose groups of subjects will be enrolled:

Cohort 1: 0.3 × 1010 TCRT-ESO-A2 cells\* Cohort 2: 1.0 × 1010 TCRT-ESO-A2 cells\* Cohort 3: 3.0 × 1010 TCRT-ESO-A2 cells\*

\* ±30% Subjects will be monitored daily during in-patient hospitalization for 5 days post dose. Subjects will then visit an out-patient clinic weekly during the Dose Limiting Toxicity Evaluation Period of 4 weeks and followed at approximately Days 60, 90, and every 3 months until confirmation of disease progression. Disease monitoring will be conducted by Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography scan (as appropriate for disease), during screening (if recent scans are not available), during lead-in approximately 7 days prior to TCRT-ESO-A2 infusion, at approximately Days 28, 60, 90, and every 3 months until confirmation of disease progression. If subjects remain clinically stable, confirmation of progression may be assessed 4- to 8-weeks later. Positron emission tomography scanning may be used as appropriate as an adjunct. Tumor biopsies will be taken from non-target lesions, if accessible, at baseline, approximately Days 28, 90, 180, and upon progression. Ascites/pleural fluid may be collected in addition to biopsies for correlative research studies if the subject requires paracentesis or pleuracentesis. At progression, long term follow-up will commence. During long term follow-up, subjects will be followed twice yearly for up to 5 years post-infusion and then annually for up to 15 years.

Timing of tumor and liquid biopsies may be adjusted as may the timing of other procedures or safety studies. In addition, up to 150 additional mL of blood may be collected over a three-month period without amendment of the protocol. Additional safety measures may be included, and tests may be done at any time if clinically indicated. In addition, if objective responses are observed in tumors after the safety of each cohort has been evaluated, up to 12 additional subjects with that tumor type (up to 2 tumor types) may be enrolled to further explore the tumor response rate in that tumor type.
