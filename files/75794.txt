A Study to Evaluate Effectiveness and Safety of Ponatinib in Patients With BCR-ABL Positive ALL in Standard Clinical Practice in Europe - "POSEIDON"
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ponatinib (Iclusig速) in patients with BCR-ABL positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in standard clinical practice in Europe.
