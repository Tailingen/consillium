Bryostatin 1 Plus Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Cancer or Stomach Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 and paclitaxel in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer or stomach cancer.
Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: bryostatin 1|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the complete and partial response rates in patients with unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer or carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction treated with sequential paclitaxel and bryostatin 1.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.
* Determine the survival of patients after treatment with this regimen.
* Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.
* Examine pre- and post-treatment tissue biopsies for markers of apoptosis in selected patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on day 2 weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and then after every 2 courses thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
