Phase II-b Randomized Clinical Trial of Cabazitaxel in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Resistant to Standard Treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel administration in patients with colorectal cancer resistant to standard treatment.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
The efficacy of cabazitaxel measured by estimating the overall response rate (ORR), as the percentage of individuals who achieve a complete tumor response (CR) or partial tumor response (PR) in each arm and between arms., From date of randomization to disease progression or until 24 months from enrolment
Progression-free survival (PFS), From randomisation to either documented disease progression or death from any cause or until 24 months from enrolment (whichever occurs earlier)
Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization to death from any cause or until 24 months from enrolment|Safety and toxicity in the experimental arm. Toxicity is graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, v 4.0)., From the date the informed consent is signed up to 30 days after the last dose
The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel administration in patients with colorectal cancer resistant to standard treatment.
