Revlimid, Endoxan, Prednison Evaluation After Prior Revlimid Treatment (REPEAT)
Study Phase: phase 1 and phase 2

Objective: Evaluation of the effect of lenalidomide, cyclophophamide and prednisone (REP) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma previously treated with lenalidomide

Study design: prospective, multicenter, non-randomized
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide, endoxan, prednisone|DRUG: lenalidomide, endoxan, prednisone
Phase 1 Revlimid, Endoxan, Prednisone Evaluation After prior revlimid Treatment (REPEAT), To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose level (RDL) of lenalidomide administered during 21 days of a 4 weeks cycle, combined with continuous cyclophosphamide and prednisone, 29 days after start of treatment cycle 1
phase 1 part of the study Revlimid, Endoxan, Prednison Evaluation After prior revlimid Treatment (REPEAT), number of participants with adverse events, 29 days after start of treatment cycle 1|phase 2 part of the study Revlimid, Endoxan, Prednison Evaluation After prior revlimid Treatment (REPEAT), - to evaluate progression-free survival, 28 days|phase 2 part of the study Revlimid, Endoxan, Prednison Evaluation After prior revlimid Treatment (REPEAT), - to evaluate overall survival, 28 days|phase 2 part of the study Revlimid, Endoxan, Prednison Evaluation After prior revlimid Treatment (REPEAT), - to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide by using flow cytometric and cytokine analysis, 28 days
The REPEAT-study is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized phase 1 and phase 2 study in which we evaluate the effect of lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide and prednisone (REP-therapy) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, previously treated with lenalidomide and refractory to lenalidomide monotherapy.
