Reliability of Secondary Caries Detection Around Composite Restoration Using Light Induced Fluorescence
A total of 29 volunteer patients will be assigned in this study. Each patient should have one resin composite restoration. The restoration will be evaluated by two diagnostic methods (D), where D1 represents visual-tactile assessment method (modified USPHS) and D2 represents light induced fluorescence intraoral camera
Secondary Caries
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: light induced fluorescence intraoral camera
reliability and reproducibility of intra oral light fluorescence camera using kappa strength, in secondary craies diagnosis around composite restorations, 6 months
Three operators, the researcher and the 2 supervisors, from the Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, will be the examiners in this study. Each examiner will record the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment method and the fluorescent-aided identification method. The visual-tactile assessment method includes the use of mirror, probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence intraoral camera
