Evaluating the Safety and Effectiveness of the Flex Robotic System for the Surgical Removal of Colorectal Lesions
This clinical trial assesses the safety and effectiveness of a new device called the Flex Robotic System in the surgical removal (resection) of colorectal lesions. When an area of abnormal tissue called a lesion is found in the colon or rectum, it is often not known if the lesion is cancerous or non-cancerous. Recommendation to remove the lesion may be made. Current methods of resection can be challenging and time-consuming. The Flex Robotic System is a new device that provides a stable working environment, better ability to grasp and cut lesions, and better tissue handling when performing a resection. The Flex Robotic system may be more effective at removing colorectal lesions than standard resection techniques.

PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Ultrasound|OTHER: Medical Chart Review|OTHER: Medical Device Usage and Evaluation|PROCEDURE: Resection
Rates of complete en bloc resection, Rates of complete en bloc resection, Up to 2 years|Incidence of adverse events, The primary endpoint will be the Incidence of adverse events using the Flex Robotic System for distal colorectal lesions., Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the rates of complete en bloc resection and adverse events of the Flex Robotic System for distal colorectal lesions.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo resection with Flex Robotic System on study. Patients also undergo colonoscopy with or without rectal endoscopic ultrasound at screening.
