CUE-102 in Recurrent Glioblastoma
The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of the experimental drug, CUE-102, and establish the recommended dose of CUE-102 for participants with Recurrent Glioblastoma (GBM).

The name of the study drug involved in this study is:

-CUE-102 (a type of fusion protein)
Recurrent Glioblastoma|Glioblastoma|Glioma, Malignant
BIOLOGICAL: CUE-102
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting-toxicities (DLT), A DLT is defined as any adverse event (AE) considered related to CUE-102 that meets DLT criteria in the 21-day period following the first dose of CUE-102 including pre-treatment laboratory results required for C2D1., 3 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is determined using a 3+3 design as listed in protocol section 1.1, 3 weeks
Safety and tolerability, safety and tolerability as measured by CTCAEv5.0 including clinical, laboratory, EKG and radiographic assessments., Up to 1 year
This is a single center, open-label, Phase Ib trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of CUE-102 monotherapy in adult participants with Glioblastoma (GBM) at first recurrence. CUE-102 is designed to target tumor cells by activating T cells, potentially improving clinical outcomes in recurrent GBM.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved CUE-102 as a treatment for Recurrent Glioblastoma.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, blood and urine tests, and electrocardiograms (ECG).

It is expected that about 18 people will take part in this research study.
