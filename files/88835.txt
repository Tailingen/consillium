A Study of Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This will be a nonrandomized, single arm feasibility study with the primary goal of evaluating the safety profile of the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with advanced/metastatic HCC with Child-Pugh B7 and B8 liver disease who have received no prior systemic therapy.
