A Study of Atezolizumab Plus Carboplatin and Etoposide With or Without Tiragolumab in Patients With Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and carboplatin and etoposide (CE) compared with placebo plus atezolizumab and CE in participants with chemotherapy-naive extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Eligible participants will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (0 vs. 1), LDH (\</= upper limit of normal \[ULN\] vs. \> ULN), and presence or history of brain metastasis (yes vs. no) and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatment regimens during induction phase:

* Arm A: Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus CE
* Arm B: Placebo plus atezolizumab plus CE

Following the induction phase, participants will continue maintenance therapy with either atezolizumab plus tiragolumab (Arm A) or atezolizumab plus placebo (Arm B).

EORTC QLQ-C30: a self-reported measure, consisting of 30 questions that assess 5 aspects of participants functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting and pain), GHS and QoL, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. Functioning items are scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all to 4=Very much, with higher score indicating worse outcome. Symptom items (GHS and QoL) are scored on a 7-point scale: 1=Very poor to 7=Excellent. Scores will be linearly transformed with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 100. Higher score indicates better outcome., From randomization until the first confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration up to 50 months|TTCD Assessed Using EORTC QLQ-C30 Score in the FAS, TTCD using EORTC QLQ-C30 is an initial 10-point decrease in global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) and functioning from baseline that must be held for at least two consecutive assessments or an initial clinically meaningful decrease above baseline followed by death.

There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health state. A single composite score is calculated based on the responses as an indicator of the participant's health status., From baseline up to 50 months
