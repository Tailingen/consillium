Efficacy and Safety of Neo-CRT Followed Surgery Compared With Definitive CRT in Patients With Initial Unresectable ESO
Definitive chemoradiotherapy(CRT) has been regarded as a standard of care for patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal cancer. Patients who are sensitive to CRT can achieve significantly down staging. Whether this part of patients could benefit from further surgical treatment remains unknown. Herein, a single center prospective randomized phase II clinical trial will be carried out to compare efficacy and safety of definitive CRT versus neo-CRT plus radical resection in patients who achieved down staging after neo-CRT for stage T4NxM0 esophageal Cancer.
Unresectable Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: Definitive Radiochemotherapy|PROCEDURE: Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy followed by surgery
Overall survival, Compare overall survival of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, 5 years|Disease-free survival, Compare progression-free survival of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy., 3 years
Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Values and/or Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment, grade 3 or 4 toxicity of leukocytes, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytes, hemoglobin, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, cardiovascular., 5 years
1. Compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of definitive radiochemotherapy versus(VS) neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who down stage from inoperable to operable after neoadjuvant treatment;
2. Compare the toxic and side effects of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete remission after neoadjuvant treatment;
3. Assess impact of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection on quality of life of patients.
