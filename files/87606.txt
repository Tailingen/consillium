Carboplatin, Pemetrexed, and Panitumumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Squamous K-ras Wild Type NSCLC
The purpose of this multicenter, Phase II trial is to examine the role of a well-tolerated novel agent, panitumumab, in combination with a modern platinum doublet regimen using carboplatin and pemetrexed, in patients with advanced non-squamous wild type K-ras non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). If this treatment proves to be well tolerated and associated with efficacy, this would provide rationale for further randomized studies.
