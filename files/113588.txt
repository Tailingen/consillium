Local mEHT + TCM Versus Intraperitoneal Chemoinfusion in Treatment of Malignant Ascites: Phase II RCT
This trial studies efficacy and safety of combination of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis with malignant ascites versus standard chemoinfusion (CDDP+5FU).

DEVICE: Modulated Electro-Hyperthermia (mEHT)|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: TCM Herbal Decoction (Shi Pi)|DRUG: IPCI (CDDP+5FU)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) = Complete Remission (CR) + Partial Remission (PR)

WHO criteria of therapeutic effect evaluation at malignant ascites:

* Complete Remission (CR): complete absorption of ascites with no obvious regeneration for more than 1 month.
* Partial Remission (PR): more than 50% reduction of ascites, with obvious relief of abdominal distention, with maintenance of less than moderate volume of ascites under ultrasound detection for more than 1 month.
* No Change (NC): less than 50% reduction of ascites, or no obvious reduction of ascites under ultrasound detection, or even increase of ascites, with obvious abdominal distention., 8 weeks after start of treatment (4 weeks on completion of treatment)

* Improvement: increase of KPS for ≥10% after treatment.
* Worsening: reduction of KPS for ≥10% after treatment.
* NC: change of KPS for \<10%., 8 weeks after start of treatment (4 weeks on completion of treatment)
Conservative treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis with malignant ascites (PCMA) is based on chemoinfusion with its inherent toxicity. There is a strong demand for a safe and non-toxic method of treatment of PCMA. The new technology of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) has proven efficacy in many advanced cancers with minimal side effects and synergy with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM has a long history of application at advanced cancer as a symptomatic treatment and enhancer of the general resistance of the organism. Shi Pi Decoction is supposed to be the optimum co-treatment of PCMA according to principles of TCM. Intraperitoneal chemoinfusion (IPCI) with cisplatin and fluorouracil is a widespread standard treatment of PCMA in China. This randomized II phase trial studies efficacy and safety of combination of mEHT with TCM in treatment of PCMA versus standard IPCI (CDDP+5FU).
