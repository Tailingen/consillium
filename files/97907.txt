Effect of Diazoxide on the Obesity Secondary to Hypothalamic-pituitary Lesions
In children treated for intracranial lesions, the 2 factors of the obesity are : the location of the lesion (hypothalamic-pituitary region) and craniopharyngiomas
Hypothalamic-pituitary Lesions|Craniopharyngiomas
DRUG: DIAZOXIDE
Relative weight change over two months, Relative weight change over two months, 2 months|(Weight at Day 1 - Weight at Day 60)/Weight at Day 1
Absolute weight change over two months|Decrease of hyperinsulinemia|Decrease of the glucose peak after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)|Evolution of HbA1c
Approximately 80 % of the hypothalamic-pituitary lesions that occur in children are craniopharyngiomas with one or three cases per 1 million children each year.

One major problem remains unsolved : the obesity

This study is performed to optimize the management of the children with hypothalamic-pituitary lesions by reducing the hyperinsulinemia due to the lesion and the surgery
