ASKB589 in Combination With CAPOX and PD-1 Inhibitor in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic GC/GEJ Adenocarcinoma
This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, standard-of-care controlled phase III clinical study conducted in China. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ASKB589 plus CAPOX and PD-1 inhibitor compared with placebo plus CAPOX and PD-1 inhibitor (as first-line treatment) as measured by Progression Free Survival (PFS).
Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: ASKB589|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of radiological progressive disease (per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by Independent Review Committee (IRC)) or death from any cause, whichever is earliest., up to 18 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause., up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) per RECIST 1.1., up to 18 months|Duration Of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the date of the first response (CR/PR) until the date of progressive disease as assessed by IRC per RECIST 1.1 or date of death from any cause, whichever is earliest., up to 18 months|Safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., up to 18 months|Number of participants with laboratory assessments abnormalities and or adverse events, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values., up to 18 months|Number of participants with vital signs abnormalities and or adverse events, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant vital sign values., up to 18 months|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific 30-item questionnaire. Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much." A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change, up to 18 months|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by the Global Pain (GP) questionnaire, The GP instrument is a single assessment of overall pain where 0 equals no pain and 10 equals extreme pain. Low pain scores are considered a better outcome than a high pain score, up to 18 months|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by the EuroQOL Five Dimensions Questionnaire 5L (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples., up to 18 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASKB589, Ctrough will be derived from the PK serum samples collected., up to 18 months|Number of anti-drug antibody (ADA) Positive Participants, Immunogenicity will be measured by the number of participants that are ADA positive., up to 18 months
This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, standard-of-care controlled phase III clinical study conducted in China. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ASKB589 plus CAPOX and PD-1 inhibitor compared with placebo plus CAPOX and PD-1 inhibitor (as first-line treatment) as measured by Progression Free Survival (PFS).

This study will also evaluate efficacy, physical function, safety, and tolerability of ASKB589, as well as its effects on quality of life. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASKB589 and the immunogenicity profile of ASKB589 will be evaluated as well.
