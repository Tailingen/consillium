Study of TQB2450 in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck（R/M SCCHN）
TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.
