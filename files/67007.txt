An Open Label Phase II Study of Biweekly Docetaxel Plus Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients With Previously-Untreated, Metastatic, Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
Study of Biweekly Docetaxel plus Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Patients with Previously-Untreated, Metastatic, Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
Prostatic Neoplasm
DRUG: Docetaxel|OTHER: Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT)
Time-to-CRPC (biochemical or clinical), 24 months
Progression-free survival, 36 months
Although surgical or medical castration is considered standard treatment in hormone-naïve PC patients, some patients with extensive metastatic disease, including visceral or bone involvement beyond axial skeleton, have shorter survival. Based on the recent randomized trials (CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15 and STAMPEDE), hormone-naïve men with metastatic, high-volume PC should be offered docetaxel plus ADT. However, side effects from standard 3-weekly 75 mg/m2 docetaxel can be substantial. In addition, a prospective trial is needed to determine whether early docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with ADT is beneficial in Korean men. Considering our own experiences with docetaxel, a dose intensity of 20 mg/m2/week (equivalent to 60 mg/m2 3-weekly or 40 mg/m2 biweekly) should be tested in the prospective trial.
