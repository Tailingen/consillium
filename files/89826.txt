A Study of STA-4783 in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel for Treatment of Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an experimental study drug (STA-4783) combined with an approved cancer medicine, paclitaxel, in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. Paclitaxel (TaxolÂ®) has been approved and used in the United States since 1992.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: STA-4783
STA-4783 is a taxane potentiator, enhancing the effect of antitumor response of paclitaxel. In an attempt to improve efficacy, paclitaxel is sometimes used in combination with other anticancer agents. When paclitaxel is combined with other anticancer agents, although response rate is usually increased, side effects are usually increased as well. There is an urgent need for agents that can enhance the antitumor effects of paclitaxel without further increasing undesirable side effects.
