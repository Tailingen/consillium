Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the interval from first dose to death from any cause., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause，assessed up to 3 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Determination of the ORR is calculated based on the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR using the RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by investigators., Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks in first year and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed PD, start of new anticancer treatment, death, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, or the end of the study, assessed up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD., Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks in first year and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed PD, start of new anticancer treatment, death, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, or the end of the study, assessed up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose to the earlier event of confirmed PD or death from any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years|Durable Response Rate (DRR), DRR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR using the RECIST/iRECIST assessment with a duration of response of at least 6 months., Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks in first year and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed PD, start of new anticancer treatment, death, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, or the end of the study，assessed up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first recording of remission (CR or PR) to the first recording of disease progression or death (whichever comes first), Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks in first year and every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed PD, start of new anticancer treatment, death, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, or the end of the study，assessed up to 3 years
