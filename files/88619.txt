A Study Comparing Venetoclax and Azacitidine Plus Cusatuzumab to Venetoclax and Azacitidine in Newly Diagnosed AML Ineligible for Intensive Therapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if participants treated with the experimental drug cusatuzumab added to venetoclax and azacitidine works to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to venetoclax and azacitidine. Venetoclax and azacitidine are drugs commonly used to treat AML in patients that are unable to receive chemotherapy to treat AML. The main question the clinical trial aims to answer is does cusatuzumab added to venetoclax and azacitidine prolong the length of time participants live compared to venetoclax and azacitidine?

CR defined per ELN 2022 criteria., From date of randomization to relapse or criteria for refractory disease are met, assessed up to 3 years
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of cusatuzumab in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine compared to venetoclax and azacitidine in persons with newly diagnosed AML who are deemed ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

Potential participants will be considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and, therefore, eligible for the study, if they meet the trial eligibility criteria. Potential participants will undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy and aspirate collected for pathology review, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and other studies for confirmation of a diagnosis of AML and to define whether participants have adverse, intermediate, or favorable AML risk features.

The enrolled trial population will be enriched for participants with adverse risk features by enrolling adverse, intermediate, and favorable risk participants at a ratio of 3:1:1, respectively (i.e., 72 adverse risk, 24 intermediate risk, and 24 favorable risk participants will be enrolled). Enrolled participants will then be randomized 2:1 to either the experimental arm or the active comparator arm.
