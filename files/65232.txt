The aim of this phase II study is to test by feasibility and efficacy of two interprofessional supportive care interventions with different intensities to facilitate resilience in patients and thereby to reduce their unmet supportive care needs.
Solid Tumor, Adult
BEHAVIORAL: RESIL Intervention
Connor Davidson Resilience Scale Score Change, Number of patients expressing a CD-RISK score change of ≥ 5 in arms A and B, week 1 (first intervention application) and week 16
Supportive Care Needs Survey 9 item version score changes, Number of patients expressing a score change in the physical and patient care needs domain and a score change of ≥ 5 in the psychological and informational needs domain of the SCNS 9 in arms A and B, week 1 (first intervention application) and week 16
Intervention A (tested in arm A) includes screening of resilience and supportive care needs as well as direct feed-back of the screening results on a monitoring sheet to nurses and oncologists in charge of the patient. Nurses and oncologists follow three training sessions to be trained in a) resilience facilitation, b) interventions to adress supportive care needs, c) use of the monitoring sheet.

Intervention B (tested in arm B) includes same intervention as arm A supplemented by 5 structured nurse led consultations, two face to face (F2F), three by phone (PC) provided by clinical nurse specialists and based on a consultation manual.
