Absorbed Tumor Dose in Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with Long-acting Somatostatin Analogues - ATSA Trial
According to current guidelines, patients have to withhalt long-acting somatostatin analogues (LA-SSA) for 4-6 weeks prior to every 177Lutetium-DOTATATE administration. The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of LA-SSA on the absorbed dose in tumor lesions during PRRT.

HRQoL assessments, At baseline, on the day of PRRT administration, 3 weeks after PRRT
The study population includes all patients aged over 18 with a neuroendocrine tumor grade I and II and a clinical indication for PRRT. Patients treated for at least three months with LA-SSA are randomized over two interventional arms: one arm where patients discontinue LA-SSA 4-6 weeks before the first PRRT treatment and one arm where patients continue LA-SSA treatment and receive the first PRRT administration within one week after the most recent LA-SSA injection. Patients in the control arm who have not been treated with LA-SSA in the last three months will start PRRT according to standard local protocol.
