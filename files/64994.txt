Alpha/Beta T and B Cell Depletion With Zoledronic Acid for Solid Tumors
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cure patients with blood cancer and other underlying diseases. αβ-T cell and B cell depletion has been introduced to decrease GVHD and PTLD and has demonstrated effectiveness for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant diseases additionally increasing the donor pool as to allow for haploidentical transplant to safely occur.

While solid tumors can be highly chemotherapy sensitive, many remain resistant and require multimodalities of treatment. Immunotherapy has been developed to harness the immune system in fighting solid tumors, though not all have targeted effects. Some solid tumors are treated with autologous transplants; however, they do not always demonstrate an improved event free survival or overall survival. There has been evidence of the use of allogeneic stem cell transplants to provide a graft versus tumor effect, though studies remain limited.

By utilizing αβ-T cell and B cell depletion for stem cell transplants and combining with zoledronic acid, the immune system may potentially be harnessed and enhanced to provide an improved graft versus tumor effect in relapsed/refractory solid tumors and promote an improved event-free survival and overall survival.

This study will investigate the safety of treatment with a stem cell graft depleted of αβ-T cell and CD19+ B cells in combination with zoledronic acid in pediatric and young adult patients with select solid tumors, as well as whether this treatment improves survival rates in these patients.
