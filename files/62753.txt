Surufatinib (HMPL-012, previously named sulfatinib) is a small-molecule inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. A multi-center , opened, Phase II study have identified the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib in advanced medullary thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC) and iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).Toripalimab is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (programmed death-1; PD-1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. In the present study, we design a single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Surufatinib wiht Toripalimab in locally advanced differentiated thyroid cancer as neoadjuvant therapy.
