A Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability of SH3809 Tablet in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of SH3809 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The second objective is to evaluate the PK profile and preliminary efficacy of SH3809 in solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SH3809 tablet
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Incidence and nature of DLTs in the dose escalation phase, Within the first 28 days of consecutive treatment|Maximum tolerated dose(MTD), Within the first 28 days of consecutive treatment
Cmax, Highest observed plasma concentration of SH3809, 4 weeks|Tmax, Time of highest observed plasma concentration of SH3809, 4 weeks]|T1/2, Elimination half-life of SH3809, 4 weeks|Area Under the Curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration time curve of SH3809, 4 weeks|Overall Response Rate(ORR), Overall response rate of SH3809 per RECIST v1.1, up to 12 months|Progression-free survival(PFS), up to 12 months|Disease control rates(DCR), Disease control rates of SH3809 per RECIST v1.1, up to 12 months|Duration of response(DOR), Duration of response of SH3809 per RECIST v1.1, up to 12 months
This is a phase I, open-label study to assess the safety,tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of SH3809 tablet, a small molecule inhibitor of SHP2 receptor , in patients with advanced solid tumors.
