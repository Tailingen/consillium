Trial of Perioperative Endocrine Therapy - Individualising Care
To determine whether perioperative endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) followed by standard adjuvant therapy improves outcome compared with standard adjuvant therapy alone in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

To determine whether the proliferation marker Ki67 as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the excised cancer around 2 weeks after starting AI therapy will predict for time to recurrence (TTR) in the individual patient more effectively than the pre-treatment Ki67 value.

To determine whether molecular profiling 2 weeks after starting endocrine therapy predicts for long-term outcome in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer better than at diagnosis.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Aromatase Inhibitors
Time to recurrence, Time to recurrence (TTR) is defined as time from randomisation to local, regional, or distant tumour recurrence or death from breast cancer without prior notification of relapse. Second primary cancers and intercurrent deaths will be treated as censoring events. Patients who are alive and disease free will be censored at the date last seen alive., 5 years post-randomisation
Relapse free survival, Second primary cancers and deaths from non-breast cancer causes in the absence of breast cancer relapse will be treated as censoring events., 5 years post-randomisation|Time to local recurrence, 5 years post-randomisation|Time to distant recurrence, 5 years post-randomisation|Overall Survival, 5 years post-randomisation|Breast cancer free survival, 5 years post-randomisation|Proliferation rate (Ki67), Comparison of the predictive value of Ki67 at surgery in the perioperative therapy and non perioperative therapy groups will be undertaken using Cox regression, comparing the estimates of the hazard ratios obtained in each treatment group., At time of surgery (around 2 weeks post-randomisation)|Gene expression profile, At time of surgery (around 2 weeks post-randomisation)
