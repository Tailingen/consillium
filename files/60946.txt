A Study of Avutometinib (VS-6766) v. Avutometinib (VS-6766) + Defactinib in Recurrent Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer With and Without a KRAS Mutation
This study will assess the safety and efficacy of avutometinib (VS-6766) monotherapy and in combination with defactinib in subjects with recurrent Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (LGSOC)
Low Grade Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma|Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: avutometinib (VS-6766)|DRUG: avutometinib (VS-6766) and defactinib
Part A: Determine optimal regimen of avutometinib (VS-6766) monotherapy or in combination with defactinib, Confirmed overall response rate per RECIST 1.1, From start of treatment to confirmation of response; 24 weeks|Part B: To determine the efficacy of the optimal regimen identified from Part A, Confirmed overall response rate per RECIST 1.1, From start of treatment to confirmation of response; 24 weeks|Part C: To evaluate additional efficacy parameters for the optimal regimen identified in Part A, Confirmed overall response rate per RECIST 1.1, From start of treatment to confirmation of response; 24 weeks|Part D:To evaluate additional efficacy parameters for a lower dose of avutometinib in combination with defactinib, Confirmed ORR defined according to RECIST 1.1, From start of treatment to confirmation of response; 24 weeks
Overall Response Rate as assessed by Investigator, Proportioned subjects achieving a CR or PR as assess by the investigator, From start of treatment to confirmation of response; 24 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), From time of first response to PD as assessed by the BIRC, Time from the first documentation of response to first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause, greater than or equal to 6 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), CR+PR+stable disease, Greater than or equal to 8 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), From time of first dose of study intervention to PD or death for any cause, Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), From time of first dose of study intervention to death, Up to 5 years
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase 2 study designed to evaluate safety and tolerability and preliminary efficacy of avutometinib (VS-6766) versus avutometinib (VS-6766) in combination with defactinib in subjects with molecularly profiled recurrent LGSOC.
