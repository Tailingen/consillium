Circulating Tumor DNA Enriched, Genomically Directed Post-neoadjuvant Trial for Patients With Residual Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a 3-arm study stratified by plasma ctDNA. Patients with residual TNBC disease after pre-operative therapy will be assigned to 1 of 3 Arms based on plasma ctDNA positivity and genomic marker(s).
Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Talazoparib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Inavolisib
ARM 1c: Disease Free Survival (DFS) at 2 Years, DFS is defined as the duration of time from arm assignment to time of a DFS event, defined as local failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), or death from any cause., 2 years
ARM 2: Disease Free Survival (DFS) at 2 Years, DFS is defined as the duration of time from arm assignment to time of a DFS event, defined as local failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), or death from any cause., 2 years|ARM 3:Disease Free Survival (DFS) at 2 Years, DFS is defined as the duration of time from arm assignment to time of a DFS event, defined as local failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), or death from any cause., 2 years|Overall Disease Free Survival (DFS), Comparison of overall DFS in Arms 1c, 2, 3. DFS is defined as the duration of time from arm assignment to time of a DFS event such as local failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), or death from any cause, Up to 29 months|Overall Distant Disease Free Survival (DDFS), DDFS is defined as the duration of time from arm assignment to time of recurrence of breast cancer outside the breast and/or death from any cause., Up to 29 months|1-year Disease Free Survival (DFS), Compare 1-year DFS in Arms 1c, 2, 3. DFS is defined as the duration of time from arm assignment to time of a DFS event, defined as local failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), or death from any cause, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS) at 5 Year, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of treatment start until death from any cause., 5 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events (regardless of relationship with study drug) will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria v5, Up to 16 months
Participants that are plasma ctDNA positive with a genomic target will be assigned to one of the three groups in Arm 1 and receive genomically directed therapy.

* Arm 1a: DNA Repair pathway = talazoparib + capecitabine (CLOSED)
* Arm 1b: Immunotherapy pathway = pembrolizumab + capecitabine (CLOSED)
* Arm 1c: PI3K Pathway = inavolisib + capecitabine ---\> +/- standard of care pembrolizumab
* Arm 1d: DNA Repair + Immunotherapy = talazoparib + capecitabine +/- standard of care pembrolizumab

Participants that are plasma ctDNA positive without a genomic target will be assigned to Arm 2 and receive capecitabine and pembrolizumab or treatment of physician's choice.

Participants that are plasma ctDNA negative will be assigned to Arm 3 and receive any of the following based on patient and physician decision: no therapy/observation, capecitabine and pembrolizumab or treatment of physician's choice.
