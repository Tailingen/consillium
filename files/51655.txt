Safety and Efficacy Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as Monotherapy in the Adjuvant Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma Post Nephrectomy (MK-3475-564/KEYNOTE-564)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in the adjuvant treatment of adult participants who have undergone nephrectomy and have intermediate-high risk, high risk, or M1 no evidence of disease (M1 NED) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cell component.

The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab is superior to placebo with respect to Disease-free Survival (DFS) as assessed by the Investigator in male and female participants with intermediate-high risk, high risk and M1 NED RCC.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Disease-free Survival (DFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, DFS, as assessed by the investigator, is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, distant kidney cancer metastasis(es), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Cox regression model with Efron's method of tie handling with treatment as a covariate stratified by metastasis status (M0 versus M1 no evidence of disease (NED) by investigator) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 versus 1), United States (US) participant (Yes versus No) within M0 group by investigator was used to report hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., Up to approximately 42 months (database cutoff date 14 Dec 2020)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 72 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study treatment, whether or not considered related to the use of study treatment. Participants are monitored for the occurrence of nonserious AEs for up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment and of serious AEs for up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be assessed., Nonserious AEs: Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (Up to approximately 13 months); Serious AEs: Up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment (Up to approximately 15 months)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study treatment, whether or not considered related to the use of study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be assessed., Up to approximately 12 months|First Local Disease Recurrence-specific Survival (DRSS1) as Assessed by the Investigator, DRSS1 is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence of RCC as assessed by the investigator. For DRSS1, only local recurrence is counted as an event., Up to approximately 72 months|Second Disease Recurrence-Specific Survival (DRSS2) as Assessed by the Investigator, DRSS2 is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence with visceral lesion or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es) with visceral lesion, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 72 months|Event-Free Survival (EFS) as Assessed by the Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), EFS is defined as time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es) among participants which by BICR were considered disease-free at baseline (M0/M1 NED); or disease progression among participants which by BICR were considered to have baseline disease (M1), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 72 months|DFS According to Participant Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression Status (Positive, Negative) as Assessed by the Investigator, DFS, as assessed by the investigator, is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The PD-L1 expression status is based on combined positive score (CPS). If CPS is ≥ 1, PD-L1 expression status is positive and if the CPS is \<1, PD-L1 expression status is negative., Up to approximately 72 months|OS According to Participant PD-L1 Expression Status (Positive, Negative), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The PD-L1 expression status is based on combined positive score (CPS). If CPS is ≥ 1, PD-L1 expression status is positive and if the CPS is \<1, PD-L1 expression status is negative., Up to approximately 72 months|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Total Score, The QLQ-C30 quality of life (QOL) questionnaire contains 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain) and single symptom items (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Items are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3= quite a bit, 4=very much). The QLQC30 also contains 2 global health status scales that use 7-point scale scoring (1=very poor and 7=excellent). The change from baseline in the 2-item global health status/QOL life scale (range: 2-14) will be presented, with a higher score representing a higher QOL., Baseline and Week 52|Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index-Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) Index Score, The FKSI-DRS index consists of a 9-item questionnaire that assesses the extent of participant symptoms from kidney cancer over the previous 7 days. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all to 4=Very much) and summed to generate an index symptom score. These scores can range from 0 to 36, with a higher score indicating more favorable kidney cancer symptom status. The change from baseline in the FKSI-DRS index score will be presented., Baseline and Week 52
Participants will be assigned to receive study treatment until disease recurrence, unacceptable adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, noncompliance with study treatment or procedural requirements, administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment, or until the participant has received 17 cycles of study treatment (approximately 1 year). Each cycle is 3 weeks long.

With Protocol Amendment 02 (dated 04 Sep 2019), the secondary study objectives for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and the presence of pembrolizumab antidrug antibodies (ADA) were reclassified as tertiary study objectives.
