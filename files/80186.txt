Adaptive Radiation Treatment for Head and Neck Cancer
This Phase III trial aims to:

Explore the impact of pre-treatment information and radiation dose redistribution on locoregional control in patients with locally advanced SCCHN.

The dose to the primary tumor with margins, based upon PET and CT information, will be inhomogeneously increased to a tumor dose between 70 and 84 Gy with decreasing dose towards the edges of the irradiated area.

To determine the toxicity of combined modality treatment (cisplatin) with standard dose distribution versus combined modality treatment (cisplatin) with adaptive inhomogeneous radiation dose distribution.
