Pilot Study of Multi-Modality Imaging in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
This is a pilot sub-study of patients receiving myeloablative transplant using total body irradiation (TBI) or total marrow irradiation (TMI) in their preparative regimen. The objective of this stub-study is to estimate the heterogeneity in cellular proliferation (FLT-PET uptake) as well the heterogeneity in marrow composition distribution (measured using whole body water-fat MRI) using positron emission tomography imaging. This will be used to design future trials as well as to determine the feasibility of PET and MRI imaging.
Hematologic Malignancy
RADIATION: FLT PET/CT|DEVICE: MRI
Difference in Percentage of Proliferating Bone Marrow Between Baseline and 100 Days, The difference in percentage of proliferating bone marrow will be calculated for the following sites: skull, proximal humeri, ribs, clavicles, cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, sacrum, pelvis and proximal femur., 100 days|Difference in Water Fat, The difference in the water-fat MRI between baseline and day 100 post transplant in L4 and femoral neck., 100 days|Percentage of Proliferating Bone Marrow in the Femur, The difference in the percentage of proliferating bone marrow between baseline and day 100 post transplant in the femur, 100 days
