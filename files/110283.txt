A Study of AZD3470, a PRMT5 Inhibitor, in Patients With MTAP Deficient Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first time in human (FTiH) Phase I/IIa, open-label, multi-centre study of AZD3470 in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with MTAP deficiency. The study consists of several study modules, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of AZD3470 as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer agents.

PFS (Progression Free Survival), PFS - defined as time from date of first dose (nonrandomized study parts) or date of randomization (randomized study parts) until progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator at local site, or death due to any cause., From date of first dose of AZD3470 up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression (approximately 2 years).|Radiological response assessed by the Investigator evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 - DCR (Disease Control Rate) at 12 weeks, DCR at 12 weeks defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) or who have SD (stable disease) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator at local site and derived from the raw tumor data for at least 11 weeks after date of first dose to allow for an early assessment within the assessment window., From date of first dose of AZD3470 up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression (for each patient this is expected to be measured at 12 weeks).|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) - defined as time from date of first dose (nonrandomized study parts) or date of randomization (randomized study parts) until the date of death due to any cause., From date of first dose of AZD3470 up until the date of death due to any cause (approximately 2 years).|Module 1 Endpoints Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: AUC, Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: Area under the concentration time curve (AUC)., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (for each patient this is expected to be measured up to approximately 4 weeks)|Module 1 Endpoints Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: C-max, Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: Maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug (C-max)., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (for each patient this is expected to be measured up to approximately 4 weeks)|Module 1 Endpoints Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: half life, Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (for each patient this is expected to be measured up to approximately 4 weeks)|Module 1 Endpoints Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: Ae (excreted in urine), Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: amount of AZD3470 excreted in urine (Ae)., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (for each patient this is expected to be measured up to approximately 4 weeks)|Module 1 Endpoints Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: Clr (renal clearance), Part A (Dose escalation) Measurement of PK parameters: renal clearance (Clr)., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (for each patient this is expected to be measured up to approximately 4 weeks)|Module 1 Endpoints Part A drug-drug interaction (DDI) -

This first time in human, open-label, multi-centre study of AZD3470 in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with MTAP deficiency follows a modular design. Module 1 Part A will include the dose escalation cohorts. Part B will include the dose optimization and expansion cohorts. New modules for combination treatments may be added in the future based on emerging data.
