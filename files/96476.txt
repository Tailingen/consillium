Patients will be enrolled in this study at the participating centers when evaluated in gastro-intestinal (GI) clinics and endoscopy suites. Initial evaluation of patients will include collection of data on demographics, assessment of risk factors such as smoking, metabolic syndrome, family history and detailed medication history, and past surgical history. All patients will be complete questionnaires regarding Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) symptoms, GERD related quality of life (QOL) and overall health related QOL. Details of all previous endoscopic and surgical evaluation along with histopathology data will be documented. Patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation at the participating centers will have their endoscopic and histopathology results documented. This will include data collection regarding use of advanced imaging techniques, details regarding tissue acquisition, EET and adverse events. Patients undergoing esophagectomy will have surgical details documented along with complications related to surgery. Similarly, details regarding chemoradiation treatments will be documented .
