Clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety of the TQB2928 Injection Combination Therapy
This study carried out a phase Ib clinical trial of TQB2928 injection combined therapy in patients with hematological malignancies, to explore the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of TQB2928 injection combined with azacitidine for injection in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)/Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) subjects.
