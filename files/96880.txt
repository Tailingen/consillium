Renal Cell Carcinoma, Clear Cell, Somatic
DRUG: Fruquintinib and Everolimus
MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose), the maximum dose in which the proportion of patients who experience dose limited toxicity (DLT) within 28 days after the first dose level is less than or equal to 1/6. When DLT occurs in patients with a dose level greater than 1/6, a dose level lower than this dose level is considered MTD. The MTD dose group requires at least 6 DLT evaluable patients to be confirmed., 6 month|ORR (Objective Response Rate), Based on the evaluable set of tumor efficacy, it is defined as the sum of the proportions of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best overall evaluation per RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors )1.1criteria, 1 year
PFS (Progression Free Survival), The time from when the patient starts receiving the study drug until disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death occurs, whichever occurs first, 1 year|DCR (Decease Control Rate ), The best overall assessment is the sum of the proportions of patients who have confirmed CR, PR, and disease stability (SD) (according to RECIST 1.1), 1 year
This study will assess the efficacy and safety profile of fruquintinib in combination with everolimus as second line therapy of clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients who progressed after immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Patients will receive fruquintinib 4mgQd/5mgQd 21days on/7 days off plus everolimus 5mg Qd as the dose escalation phase indicates.
