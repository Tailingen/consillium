Connect® Lymphoma Disease Registry: A US-Based Prospective Observational Cohort Study
The Connect® Lymphoma Disease Registry is a US-based, multicenter, prospective observational (non-interventional) cohort study designed to collect real-world, participant-level data longitudinally in participants diagnosed with various subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

This Disease Registry is designed to capture the patient characteristics, practice patterns, and therapeutic strategies evaluated in community and academic centers when treating relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and R/R follicular lymphoma (FL). The data collected in this Registry will facilitate the evaluation of the current treatment landscape for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including the clinical effectiveness, safety. No investigational product or drug will be administered as part of this study. Enrolled patients will receive treatment and evaluations for their disease according to the standard of care and routine clinical practice at each study site. All treatments that patients receive for their disease will be recorded, including any previous lymphoma treatments. Clinical outcomes will be documented as part of an objective clinical assessment. In addition, patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes data will be collected from patients using various validated instruments. Social support data will also be collected.
