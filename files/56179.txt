Neoadjuvant Combination Biotherapy With Pembrolizumab and High Dose IFN-alfa2b
This study plans to to estimate the safety profile of the combination biotherapy regimen consisting of standard-dose interferon alpha-2b (HDI) and anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, Pembrolizumab, for the neoadjuvant therapy of locally/regionally advanced/recurrent melanoma. Also, the objectives of this trial include the evaluation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers, radiologic preoperative response rate, pathologic response rate, progression free survival and overall survival. Up to 30 evaluable patients will be accrued.
Melanoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab and high dose interferon alfa-2b (HDI)
The number of participants who experience adverse events., Up to 90 days (per patient); Up to 5 years (for cohort)
Evaluate changes in immunologic biomarkers in the blood and in the tumor tissue and assess their association with resposne to treatment., Up to 5 years
radiologic preoperative response rate, Up to 5 years|pathologic response rate, Up to 5 years|progression free survival, Up to 5 years|overall survival, Up to 5 years
The study has 3 main phases:

Induction Phase:

Pembrolizumab I.V. infusion every 3-4 weeks for 2 doses (starting first week of HDI administration) given concurrently with HDI I.V. x 5 consecutive days out of 7 every week for 4 weeks, followed by S.C. every other day 3 times each week for 2 weeks.

This is followed by definitive surgery (week 6-8).

Maintenance Phase (following recovery from surgery):

Pembrolizumab I.V. infusion every 3 weeks given concurrently with HDI S.C. QOD TIW every week for 46 additional weeks.
