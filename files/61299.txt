MRI Following Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to test whether an additional magnetic resonance image (MRI) sequence can improve the ability to distinguish radiation damage from tumor recurrence in participants with brain metastasis who have previously been treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
Brain Metastases
OTHER: MRI
number of positive MRI sequences along with positive tumor biopsies, true tumor will be detected by delayed MRI as determined by biopsy, baseline|number of negative MRI sequences along with negative tumor biopsies, absence of tumor will be detected by delayed MRI as determined by biopsy, baseline
