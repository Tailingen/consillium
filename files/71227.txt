A Study of Escalating Doses of Polatuzumab Vedotin in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Polatuzumab Vedotin in Combination With Rituximab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma
This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of polatuzumab vedotin administered as a single agent by intravenous (IV) infusion to participants with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. In Phase Ib, participants will receive polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab.
