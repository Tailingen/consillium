Combinations of Cemiplimab (Anti-PD-1 Antibody) and Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy in Patients With Lung Cancer
The primary objectives of this study are:

Part 1: To compare the overall survival (OS) of cemiplimab/chemo-f and cemiplimab/chemo-l/ipi versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous or nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tumors expressing PD-L1 in \<50% of tumor cells.

Part 2: To compare the OS of cemiplimab/chemo-f with placebo/chemo-f in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression.

The key secondary objectives are:

Part 1: To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) of cemiplimab/chemo-f and cemiplimab/chemo-l/ipi versus chemo-f in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous NSCLC and tumors expressing PD-L1 in \<50% of tumor cells.

Part 2: To compare the PFS and ORR of cemiplimab/chemo-f versus placebo/chemo-f in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression.
