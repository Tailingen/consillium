A Confirmatory Clinical Study in NSCLC Patients With MET Exon 14 Mutation (KUNPENG-2)
The goal of this clinical trial is to test if PLB1001 works well and safely in Non-small cell lung cancer patients with MET exon 14 mutation. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* If it is works well in Non-small cell lung cancer patients with MET exon 14 mutation
* If it is safety and tolerant in Non-small cell lung cancer patients with MET exon 14 mutation

Participants will

1. be given PLB1001 200mg BID,oral.
2. be received hematology and urine and ECG examinations every 14 days (First 3 months) or every 28 days (After 3 months)
3. be received Image examination every 8 weeks(First year) or every 12 weeks(After one year)
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: PLB1001
Confirmed Objective Response Rate Evaluated by IRC, Objective response rate will be determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who experienced either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from first administration of trial treatment to first observation of progressive disease (PD). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30 percent (%) reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD, but at least increase 5mm, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., 2 years

Percentages are calculated using total number of subjects per treatment cohort as the denominator., 2 years
Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) of drug and safety-analysis-set.etc, Subjects need collect PK sample within 2 hours prior to morning dose on day 1 (±7 days) of cycles 2, 3, and 5., Within 2 hours prior to morning dose on day 1 (±7) of Cycle 2,Cycle,3,Cycle5 (eash cycle is 28 days )
