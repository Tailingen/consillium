Linvoseltamab in Addition to Lenalidomide (L2) During Maintenance Therapy of NDMM to Deepen Responses or Redrive MRD Negativity After Relapse
The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving linvoseltamab with lenalidomide during maintenance treatment to participants with multiple myeloma will:

1. Get rid of any residual multiple myeloma cells in participants' bodies which is known as minimal residual disease negative (MRD-) status. For participants that start the study with residual multiple myeloma cells in participants' bodies: to determine how long you remain MRD-.
2. Increase the length of time that participants' disease is controlled. For participants with relapsed disease, to determine whether participants can re-attain MRD- status.
3. Increase the length of time that participants' disease responds to treatment.

The researchers also want to find out the effects that linvoseltamab has on participants and participants' condition.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Linvoseltamab|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Minimum Residual Disease Negative Conversion Rate, The number of patients who experience MRD negativity (10\^-5 sensitivity by 12 cycles of linvoseltamab (MRD conversion rate) will be determined by dividing this number of MRD negative responses by the total number of evaluable patients.

MRD negativity rate (\<10\^-5) by 12 cycles of linvoseltamab, 12 months
Minimum Residual Disease Negative Conversion Rate, The number of patients who experience MRD negativity (10\^-5 sensitivity) by 6 months of Linvoseltamab (MRD conversion rate) will be determined by dividing this number of MRD negative responses by the total number of evaluable patients., 6 months|Sustained MRD Negativity Rate, The sustained rate of MRD-negativity, at a sensitivity of \<10\^-5, among participants will be reported. The duration of time in months measured from the first time the participant achieves an MRD-negative bone marrow (BM) biopsy result until the time the participant has relapsed from MRD-negativity objectively documented with an MRD-positive BM result., Up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate, The number of participants achieving stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response or minimal response (MR) to study therapy. Multiple myeloma (MM) response assessments will be made in accordance with modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 response criteria., Up to 12 months|Best Overall Response (BOR), The best overall response is defined as the best response by the percentage of participants recorded from start of study therapy until the completion of 12 cycles of study therapy. Multiple myeloma (MM) response assessments will be made in accordance with modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 response criteria., Up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the elapsed time in months from the time the criteria are met for achieving partial response (PR) or better until the time of progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented. Multiple myeloma (MM) response assessments will be made in accordance with modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 response criteria., Up to 4.5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of study therapy until first documented progressive disease (PD). Multiple myeloma (MM) response assessments will be made in accordance with modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 response criteria., Up to 4.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the elapsed time in months from start of study therapy to death or censoring at last known time point that participant was known to be alive (may be based on clinic visit or phone call, etc.), Up to 4.5 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-related Adverse Events, The number of participants experiencing all Grade and Grade â‰¥3 treatment-related adverse events will be recorded. Adverse events will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 27 months
