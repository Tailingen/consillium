Cancer Activity and Lifestyle Measurement Study
The CALM Study is an observational study to investigate the associations of linoleic acid levels in the blood, diet, activity, and lifestyle factors with measures of muscle strength, muscle function and overall outcomes for postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy.

The CALM Study is a prospective study to determine the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on cardiolipin profiles in relationship to cardiac and skeletal muscle function in breast cancer patients before and after 1 cycle of anthracycline therapy. Patients will undergo blood sampling and imaging of the heart and skeletal muscle at two Clinical Visits. The two visits, Baseline and study completion (Post-1 cycle anthracycline) will occur approximately \~4 weeks apart.

The driving hypothesis is that anthracycline reduces linoleic acid-rich cardiolipin with associated decline of cardiac and skeletal muscle measures. By coupling cardiac and skeletal muscle changes with cardiolipin markers reflective of dietary linoleic acid, this work will advance inexpensive and highly accessible therapies to preserve functional capacity and diminish adverse outcomes in cancer patients. Breast cancer patients (stages I-III) receiving anthracycline will be prospectively evaluated to achieve the following aims:

Aim 1: Measure the baseline relationships between cardiolipin status and magnetic resonance-based measures of cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology in breast cancer patients. Hypothesis 1a: Higher cardiolipin is related to better cardiac structure and function. Hypothesis 1b: Higher cardiolipin is associated with higher skeletal muscle mass and mitochondrial capacity in women with breast cancer prior to starting anthracycline therapy. Hypothesis 1c: Dietary linoleic acid modifies the relationships between cardiolipin and cardiac or skeletal muscle measures.

Aim 2: Assess chemotherapy-induced changes in cardiolipin composition, cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology. Hypothesis 2a: Change in skeletal muscle function and cardiac function together better predict worse functional capacity after completion of a course of anthracycline therapy for breast cancer compared to change of either skeletal or cardiac function alone. Hypothesis 2b: Cardiolipin levels decrease significantly from baseline in women who have completed one cycle of anthracycline therapy for breast cancer. Hypothesis 2c: Dietary linoleic acid modifies the effects of anthracycline on cardiolipin and cardiac or skeletal muscle physiology.
