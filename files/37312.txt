Low-Intensity Oscillatory Magnetic Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) - An Exposure-time Escalation Pilot Trial
The clinical investigation is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, prospective, exposure-time escalation clinical investigation. The clinical investigation is designed to assess the clinical safety and performance of the Oncomagnetic Device.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DEVICE: Oncomagnetic device
To assess the safety of the Oncomagnetic device., • Incidence of device-related adverse events (as per CTCAE v.5) at 6 months following surgery., 6 months
To evaluate the performance of the Oncomagnetic Device in patients with newly diagnosed GBM., Response of Index Lesion:

• Via radiographic assessment (MRI), 6 months|To evaluate the performance of the Oncomagnetic Device in patients with newly diagnosed GBM., Median Progression-Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6) following surgery:

• Changes in tumor volume via radiographic assessment (MRI) analyzed via independent reviewer using mRANO criteria., 6 months|To evaluate the performance of the Oncomagnetic Device in patients with newly diagnosed GBM., Median Overall Survival (OS):

• Measured by the length of time from initial diagnosis until subject expiration., 3 years|To evaluate the performance of the Oncomagnetic Device in patients with newly diagnosed GBM., Quality of Life (QOL):

• Assessed using the validated quality of life scale (QLQ-C30) by the EORTC as well as the module for brain tumors, BN 20., 6 months
To assess imaging data for exploratory analyses and to support potential future research endeavors., • Via radiographic assessment (MRI), 3 years|To identify biomarkers that correlate with outcome., Via blood biomarker collection, 3 years
