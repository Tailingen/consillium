A Phase I Study of FCN-411 in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Chinese Patients With EGFR Positive Mutation
This phase I trial with dose-escalation stage and dose-expansion stage is the first-in-human study of FCN-411, a drug being developed for treatment of advanced cancers. The initial purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FCN-411 monotherapy in EGFR-positive mutation non-small cell lung cancer chinese patients. The study will also provide early information on how the body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) and on the anti-tumor activities of FCN-411.

This is a multicenter, open, single arm phase I clinical trial to explore the dose of FCN-411 in advanced lung cancer patients with disease progression after standard treatment or unsuitable for standard treatment and to expand the dose in advanced NSCLC patients who failed EGFR-TKI treatment. During the screening period, patients need to provide tumor tissue/ blood samples collected after their disease progression for tumor biomarker detection. In this study, the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetic characteristics of FCN-411 were observed by dose escalation study and dose expansion study, and the antitumor activity of FCN-411 was preliminarily evaluated to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The phase I dose escalation study includes two stages: single dose stage and continuous dose stage; phase I dose expansion study is continuous dose administration.

The research cycle is made up of screening period (day-28-day-1), single administration period (7 days), continuous administration period (every 21 days, evaluated every 6 weeks, until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, decision of the investigator or voluntary withdrawal of the patient), end of treatment, EOT) visit, safety follow-up (30 days after the last administration), survival follow-up (survival follow-up every 3 months from the safety follow-up until the end of the study). The end of study is one year after the first administration of the last enrolled patient or the end of treatment (whichever is earlier).
