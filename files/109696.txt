T2007-002 Clofarabine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide in Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
Clofarabine is a drug approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for treating children (age 1-21) with leukemia. This research study will use clofarabine with two other cancer fighting drugs. Clofarabine will be used together with etoposide (VePesid®, VP-16) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®).
Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Clofarabine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Filgrastim|DRUG: Cytarabine
Achievement of Complete Remission (CR) at Reinduction, Disease response assessed after chemotherapy from bone marrow aspirates/biopsies and complete blood count., Between Days 22-36 or on Day 43 and weekly thereafter if peripheral counts haven't recovered|Death, Number of participants who died., From the first dose of study therapy until 30 days after last therapy dose
Clofarabine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide have been used together in a phase I study to find out the highest doses of these drugs that can be safely given to children with relapsed or refractory leukemia. This study is a phase II study which will use the drugs to study how well these drugs work against AML. This study will also examine the safety of this drug combination.
