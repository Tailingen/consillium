Dose-Ranging Study of Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Virus 16/18 Bivalent Vaccine
This is a phase II clinical study of the novel recombinant HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine expressed in E. coli.

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate which dosage of the HPV vaccine can induce higher antibody and at the same time caused less adverse events.

The secondary purpose of this study is to to evaluate the safety and immunopersistence of the study vaccine.

Seroconversion of anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 neutralizing antibody, To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 neutralizing antibody level on day 1 and one month after dose 3., 7 months
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, All the adverse events in one month after each dose would be recorded in the diary card. All the Serious Adverse Events(SAE) occurred during clinical trial time frame would be recorded., 7 months
Totally 1600 healthy women of 18-25 years of age were enrolled. The participants were randomly stratified into 4 groups and receive different dosage of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine or placebo administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule. The women were actively monitored for adverse events for 1 month after each injection. Severe adverse events during the trial were followed up. Serum samples from all the subjects would be collected on day 0, 7m, 24m, 48m and 72m to evaluate the immunogenicity and immuno-persistency.
