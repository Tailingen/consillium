Pilot Trial Of Autologous T Cells Engineered To Express Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CART19)In Combination With Ibrutinib In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory CD19+ Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)Or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
Open-label pilot study to determine safety and efficacy of CART-19 cells in combination with ibrutinib. The target dose will be 1-5x10xE8 CART-19 transduced cells administered via split dosing: 10% on Day 1, 30% on Day 2, 60% on Day 3. 15 evaluable subjects (adults) with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL who have achieved partial response or stable disease on ibrutinib therapy will be eligible to receive CART-19 therapy.
