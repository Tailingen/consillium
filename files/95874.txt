Neutrophil Extracellular Traps as a Biomarker to Predict Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this study was to investigate whether NETs markers can enhance predict portal vein tumor thrombosis in patients with live cirrhosis, so as to establish a novel predictor to guide clinical decision-making.
Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation|Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis
OTHER: test NETs markers
Concentration of NETs markers and anti-β2 glycoprotein I, NETs markers (Myeloperoxidase, Neutrophil elastase, Citrate histone H3) and anti-β2 glycoprotein I were detected in plasma using capture ELISA and specific ELISA kits., 1 year.
Eighty-six patients with patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (China) from September 2020 to January 2021 were recruited for this study, including 14 patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis, 28 patients without portal vein tumor thrombosis and 44 patients without hepatocellular carcinoma. NETs markers (Myeloperoxidase, Neutrophil elastase, Citrate histone H3), and anti-β2 glycoprotein I were detected in plasma using capture ELISA and specific ELISA kits. T-test was performed to analyze whether there was a statistical difference between the two groups, and regression analysis was performed between NETs markers and tissue factor and anti-β2 glycoprotein I to investigate whether there was a correlation. This study without any intervention measures, will not cause harm.
