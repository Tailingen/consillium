Influence of Positive Margins on Tumour Recurrence and Overall Survival After Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
Incidence of positive surgical margins after curative gastrectomy ranges from 1% to 20%. It has been suggested that positive surgical margins is an adverse prognosis factor, with a higher local recurrence and worse overall survival (OS). However, the management of these patients remains unclear.
