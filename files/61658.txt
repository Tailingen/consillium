Efficacy of Panobinostat in Patients With Relapsed and Bortezomib-refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of the combination of Panobinostat plus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and bortezomib refractory Multiple Myeloma.
Relapsed and Bortezomib Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Multiple Myeloma in Relapse
DRUG: panobinostat|DRUG: bortezomib|DRUG: dexamethasone
Overall Response Rate (PR+nCR+CR), Overall response rate=(PR+nCR+CR) CR= \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. No confirmation on bone marrow plasma cell (additional assessment) is needed to document CR except patients with non-secretory myeloma where the bone marrow examination must be repeated after an interval of at least 6 weeks, Absence of M-protein in serum and urine by immunofixation,nCR same as CR without out Absence of M-protein in serum and urine by immunofixation,PR+ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and sofft tissue Plasmacytomas all for more than 6 weeks., after eight cycyles of treatment (24 weeks)
Responders to Treatment, The primary endpoint for this phase II study of patients with bortezomib-refractory MM is response after a maximum of 8 cycles of therapy as defined by the modified EBMT criteria., after eight cycyles of treatment (24 weeks)|Time to Response (Greater Than or Equal to PR) Based on Investigator Assessment, Time to response is defined as the time from the date of first administration of study treatment to the date of first documented evidence of CR or nCR or PR (whichever status is recorded first). Patients who do not have a response of PR or better by the data cut-off date are censored., after eight cycyles of treatment (24 weeks)|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to first occurrence of documented progressive disease /relapse or death. Time from randomization until disease progression or death by Kaplan-Meier estimates, 24 weeks|Time to Progression, Time from randomization until objective tumor progression; does not include deaths-- Kaplan-Meier estimates, 24 weeks|Over All Survival, Kaplan Meier estimates- median time to event, 24 weeks
This is a phase II, two stage, single arm, open label, multi-center study of oral PAN in combination with BTZ/Dex in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who are bortezomib-refractory and have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy. Patients must have been exposed to an iMID (lenalidomide or thalidomide) and progressed on or within 60 days of their last BTZ-containing line of therapy.
