Dual-Tracer Theranostic PET
This study is designed to obtain positron emission tomography with x-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging data with each tracer pair, providing the imaging data needed to develop new simultaneous dual-tracer imaging techniques and processing algorithms for these tracer pairs.
