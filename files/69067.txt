Immunotherapy With TG4010 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary Objective is to assess the efficacy of TG4010 combined to chemotherapy in comparison with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
BIOLOGICAL: MVA-MUC1-IL2|DRUG: 1st line Chemotherapy
Progression free survival at 6 months, 6 months
Response Rate according to WHO criteria, 6 months|Time to progression, 6 months|Overall survival|Quality of life, every 6 weeks
In the experimental arm patients receive subcutaneous injections of TG4010 at the dose of 108 pfu in combination with chemotherapy treatment whereas patients in the control arm receive chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy associates cisplatin and gemcitabine and is given for up to 6 cycles or progressive disease, whichever occurs first.

TG4010 is administered once per week for 6 weeks, then once every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy and thereafter as monotherapy until documentation of progressive disease.

Tumor response will be evaluated every 6 weeks by a CT-scan and results will be available before starting an additional treatment period of 6 weeks. The tumor response taken into account will be for each patient the best overall response obtained during the study.

The endpoint of the study is based on Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 months.
