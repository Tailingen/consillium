Immunomonitoring of Interventional Radiology Procedures in the Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This cohort study compares immune response induced in two groups of small HCC patients treated by ablation (group1 RFA, group 2 MWA). Patients will benefit for tumoral and non tumoral biopsies prior to treatment and stepped peripheral blood samples juste before ablation and during the first month after.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Percutaneous ablation
To compare induced immunomodulation by RFA and MWA in HCC patients, Comparison of modulation of immune cells (frequency, activity, function) between the two groups. Study of immune cells will include T cells with immune checkpoints molecules (PD-1+ CD8+ T, 4-1BB+ CD8+ T, LAG-3+ CD8+ T, Tim-3+ CD8+ T, COS+ CD8+ T) before and after the treatment (day 0, day 2, day 7, day 30), one month
To evaluate early induced immunomodulation after RFA in HCC patients, Differences of frequencies, activities, functions of immune cells before and after the RFA treatment (day 0, day 2, day 7, day 30). Study of immune cells will include T cells with immune checkpoints molecules (PD-1+ CD8+ T, 4-1BB+ CD8+ T, LAG-3+ CD8+ T, Tim-3+ CD8+ T, COS+ CD8+ T), one month|To evaluate early induced immunomodulation after MWA in HCC patients, Differences of frequencies, activities, functions of immune cells before and after the MWA treatment (day 0, day 2, day 7, day 30).
