A Dose-Escalation Study of GDC-0994 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0994 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in one of two stages: a dose-escalation stage (Stage I) or the subsequent expansion stage (Stage II). Stage I will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of GDC-0994 administered daily. Stage II will gather additional data on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the recommended dose of GDC-0994 determined in Stage I.
