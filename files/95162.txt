Classification and Longitudinal Follow-up of Common Melanocytic Nevi With in Vivo Reflectance Confocal Microscopy
Our working hypothesis is that reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) can identify distinct subsets of melanocytic nevi that retain their distinctive pattern over time.
Common Melanocytic Nevi
DEVICE: RCM imaging
Inter-rater agreement on assignment of nevi to RCM patterns (baseline and follow-up images)., 3 YEARS
Description of rates of retention and change in RCM pattern of nevi during follow-up, 3 YEARS
