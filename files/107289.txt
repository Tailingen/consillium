Optimal Margin Evaluation of Online Adaptive Radiotherapy for Postoperative Treatment of Endometrial and Cervical Cancer
Online adaptive radiotherapy has demonstrated to be feasible to reduce inter-fractional radiotherapy errors as it re-optimizes treatment plan every fraction. To investigate the extent and value of margin reduction，we conduct a prospective clinical trial to determine the optimal margin and toxicity of smaller margin.

The dose coverage of target volume as assessed by planing tumor volume V100%, Planing tumor volume V100%, defined as the planing tumor volume receiving at least 100% of the prescribed dose (V100%), is used to evaluate the dose coverage of target volume., Through study completion, total an average of six month|A minimum PTV margin could encompass CTV, Expansions were applied to the pretreatment PTV to assess required minimum margin required to encompass the postreatment CTV., Through study completion, toral an average of six month
Safety for treatment as assessed by organs at risk doses, Safety for treatment was mainly evaluated by the organs at risk doses, including bladder, rectum, bone marrow, etc, Through study completion, total an average of six month|Number of participants with acute toxicity as assessed by CTCAE 5.0, Evaluated with CTCAE 5.0, From the start of treatment to 3 months after treatment|Adaptive time data, For each treatment in each fraction, adaptive time was recorded from first cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to the selection of the preferred plan for the treatment., Through study completion, total an average of six month|Target contouring accuracy, For every target in each fraction, the evaluation of accuracy for target contouring are categorized as follow: no edits, minor edits, moderate edits, major edits and not applicable., Through study completion, total an average of six month|Organs at risk contouring accuracy, For every organs at risk in each fraction, the evaluation of accuracy for organs at risk contouring are categorized as follows: no edits, minor edits, moderate edits, major edits and not applicable., Through study completion, total an average of six month|Late toxicity evaluated with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring scheme, Evaluated every three months with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring scheme, total an average of 2-year
This is a prospective phase II clinical trial with an anticipated total of more than 380 radiotherapy fractions of 15 patients to evaluate optimal margin of iterative cone-beam computed tomography（iCBCT） guided online adaptive radiotherapy （oART） for postoperative treatment of endometrial and cervical cancer. Postoperative endometrial and cervical cancer patients with following characteristics are included in the present study:（a）underwent radical surgery （b）no residual tumor at the resection margin by postoperative pathology（c）pathological findings indicate risk factors but no metastasis (d) adjuvant radiotherapy are prescribe (e)without evidence of para-aortic metastatic lymph nodes. Five patients （almost 125 fractions）treated with oART have the target volume contoured on pre-treatment iCBCTs and end-treatment iCBCTs. Anterior-posterior, lateral, and superior-inferior shifts were calculated and the average shift in all directions was calculated. A clinical target volume (CTV) to planing tumor volume (PTV) expansion is determined and verifies on a validation cohort of 10 patients (almost 250 fractions) treated with oART. Record acute toxicity from the start of treatment to 3 months after treatment.
