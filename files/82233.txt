A Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3234 in Patients With Type I Neurofibromatosis
This study is a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3234 capsules in Chinese subjects associated with neurofibromatosis type I (neurofibroma and peripheral malignant neurilemmoma).

Two study phases were designed, including (1) dose escalation and (2) cohort expansion.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetic characteristics, efficacy and safety of TQ-B3234 capsule, and to explore the therapeutic biomarkers related to this product.
