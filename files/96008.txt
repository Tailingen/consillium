Candida Antigen and Bivalent HPV Vaccine in the Treatment of Multiple Warts
To follow up the efficacy and safety of Candida antigen, bivalent HPV vaccine in treatment of common warts either mono or combined intralesional therapy
Warts|Human Papilloma Virus
BIOLOGICAL: Candida antigen vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Bivalent HPV vaccine
complete response, if there is disappearance of warts and return of the normal skin markings, upto 3 months|partial response, if warts regressed in size by 50-99% (the size will be measured as the summation of size of all lesions in cm), upto 3 months|no response, if there is \< 50% decrease in wart size. (the size will be measured as the summation of size of all lesions in cm), upto 3 months
recurrence rate after recovery, appearance of new lesions or recurrence of previous one, follow up for 6 months after recovery
* Group A: 54 patients will be treated with Candida antigen. All patients will be directly injected with Candida antigen into the largest wart using an insulin syringe. Injections will be done at 2-week intervals until complete clearance will be achieved or for a maximum of five treatment sessions.
* Group B: 54 patients will be treated with bivalent HPV vaccine solution intralesional into the largest wart using an insulin syringe. Injections will be done at 2-week intervals until complete clearance will be achieved or for a maximum of five treatment sessions.
* Group C: 54 patients will be treated with both agents intralesionally into the largest wart using an insulin syringe at 2-week intervals until complete clearance will be achieved or for a maximum of five treatment sessions.

it is thought that candida antigen act through a cell-mediated immune response and bivalent HPV vaccine act mainly through humoral immunity, so we want to study their effect as single or mixed agents
