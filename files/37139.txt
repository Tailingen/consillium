Feasibility Study to Evaluate Outpatient Blinatumomab in Subjects With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) of B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
The study aims to determine the safety and feasibility of complete outpatient blinatumomab administration for subjects with minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) of B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).
B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab|DEVICE: Current Wearable Heatlth Monitoring System (CWHMS)
Number of Participants With Grade 3 and/or 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Neurotoxicity (NT) or Any Adverse Events Resulting in Hospitalization During MDMP, Adverse event were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, (CTCAE) v5.0 grading Scale. Grade 3 events were defined as severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; grade 4 events were defined as life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.

CSR is a heightened T-cell activation and release of pro inflammatory cytokines. NT signs include encephalopathy, delirium, aphasia, lethargy, difficulty concentrating, agitation, tremor, seizures, and, rarely, cerebral edema., Cycle 1: Day 1 to Day 3; Cycle 2: Day 1 and Day 2
Time to Therapeutic Intervention (TTI) During MDMP, TTI was calculated for all the valid alarm triggers which lead to an intervention as duration (in minutes) from time of the device alert (alarm triggered) to the time of initiation of the therapeutic intervention.

Therapeutic intervention was any measurable action taken by the participants or performed on the participants as a result of the onset of fever, hypotension, hypoxia, other grade 3 or 4 vital sign including seizure or neurological change (grade 3-limiting self-care activities of daily living \[ADL\])., Cycle 1: Day 1 to Day 3; Cycle 2: Day 1 and Day 2|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Adverse Events of Interest (EOIs), TEAEs were defined as adverse events starting on or after first dose of blinatumomab. EOIs referred in particular to CRS, infections and neurologic events., Up to a maximum of 193 days|Change From Baseline to Cycle 2 Day 1 in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life of Cancer Patients (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/ Quality of Life Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses the health related quality of life of cancer patients participating in clinical trials. The EORTC QLQ-C30 forms a global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) scale, 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), and 9 symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). All of the scales/items measures get mapped to a common range from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus, a negative change for the global health status/QoL scale represents a lower QoL, a negative change for a functional scale represents a lower level of functioning, a positive change for a symptom scale/item represents a higher level of symptomatology/problems., Baseline and Cycle 2 Day 1|Number of Participants Who Experienced TEAEs That Resulted in Hospitalization, Surgeries, Use of Concomitant Medications or Use of Device/Procedure Intervention, Concomitant therapies are any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for:

Any anti-tumor therapy other than the protocol-specified therapy (ie, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, cytotoxic and/or cytostatic drugs); Chronic systemic (\> 7 days) high-dose corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone \> 24 mg/day or equivalent); any other immunosuppressive therapies (except for transient use of corticosteroids); Any other investigational agent. Intervention is any measurable action taken by the subject or performed on the subject as a result of the onset of a TEAE., Up to a maximum of 193 days
The study aims to determine the safety and feasibility of complete outpatient blinatumomab administration for subjects with minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) of B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).
