Safety and Preliminary Anti-Tumor Activity of TYRA-300 in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With FGFR3 Gene Alterations
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-300 in cancers with FGFR3 activating gene alterations, including locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and urinary tract and other advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: TYRA-300
Phase 1 Part A: To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD)., Initiation of study treatment through 28 days.|Phase 1 Part B: To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (R2PD)., Initiation of study treatment through 28 days (up to approximately 18 months).|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined by RECIST v1.1., Initiation of study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal (up to 2 years).
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability., Initiation of study treatment through 28-days post treatment (up to 2 years).|Frequency in changes in laboratory parameters and physical signs of toxicity., Initiation of study treatment through 28-days post treatment (up to 2 years).|Pharmacokinetics: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)., Initiation of study treatment through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days).|Pharmacokinetics: time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax)., Initiation of study treatment through Cycle 3 Day 1(each cycle is 28 days).|Pharmacokinetics: area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)., Initiation of study treatment through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days).|Pharmacokinetics: half-life of TYRA-300 (t1/2)., Initiation of study treatment through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days).|ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator using RECIST V1.1., From enrollment, every 8 or 12 weeks (up to 2 years).|Duration of response will be defined as the time from the initial CR or PR to the time of relapse or death, whichever occurs first among participant with an objective response., From enrollment, every 8 or 12 weeks (up to 5 years).|Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants having a CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for >12 weeks., From enrollment up to 5 years.|Time to response is defined as time to first CR or PR that is subsequently confirmed according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 5 years.|Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the earliest date of documented disease progression or death., From the date of the first dose of study drug until disease progression or death as assessed up to the last efficacy assessment for disease progression (up to 5 years)].
This is a single arm, multi-part, phase 1/2 global trial studying TYRA-300, a novel, potent fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and urinary tract, that contain activating gene alterations of FGFR3. Phase 1 is a dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TYRA-300 to determine the optimal and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-300 in cancers with FGFR3 activating gene alterations, including locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and urinary tract and other advanced solid tumors.
