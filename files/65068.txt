Study to Compare How the Body Absorbs, Distributes and Excretes the Drug Selitrectinib (BAY2731954) Given as Two Different Tablet Formulations or as Liquid Formulations Including the Effect of Food on the Absorption, Distribution or Excretion of the Different Formulations in Healthy Participants
In this study, the researchers will compare 2 new tablet forms of BAY2731954 with liquid oral forms of BAY2731954. A maximum of 61 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 will be asked to participate.

The study will have 2 parts. In part 1 researchers want to gather information how the body absorbs, distributes and excretes the drug BAY2731954 given as two different tablet formulations. Participants will take the study drugs on 3 days separated by breaks of at least 3 days between each intake. The duration of this study part will be in total of up to 6 weeks from first screening visit to follow-up visit.

In part 2 of the study researchers want to study how the body absorbs, distributes and excretes the drug BAY2731954 given as two different tablet formulations with or without food or as 2 liquid oral formulations. Participants will take the study drugs on 4 days separated by breaks of at least 3 days between each intake. The duration of the second part of study part will be in total of up to 7 weeks from first screening visit to follow-up visit.

During the study, researchers will collect blood and urine samples. In addition, doctors will check the participants' overall health. They will also ask the participants if they have any medical problems.
