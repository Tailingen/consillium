Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer Receiving Total Mesorectal Excision With or Without Stoma
The goal is to evaluate whether the renunciation of a diverting stoma in patients with adjuvant chemotherapy after low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (TME) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy leads to a better quality of life without increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with rectal cancer.

Change in quality of life specific for the gastrointestinal tract, GIQLI Score, at Baseline and up to 12 months after surgery
Change in quality of life, Short Form (SF) 36, at Baseline and up to 12 months after surgery|Change in faecal Incontinence, Vaizey Wexner Score, at Baseline and up to 12 months after surgery
In most cases it is recommended that patients after low anterior resection with TME and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer need a temporarily diverting stoma. Recent evidence suggests that this is not always necessary. The decision for or against a stoma is made by the surgeon in charge and is based on an algorithm of risk factors for anastomotic leakage. Many patients receive an adjuvant chemotherapy postoperative. This may influence the quality of life e.a. due to mucositis and urge incontinency or the stoma itself.The objective of this pilot study is to establish the basis for a randomized controlled trial. The long-term goal is to evaluate whether the renunciation of a diverting stoma in patients with adjuvant chemotherapy after low anterior resection with TME and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy leads to a better quality of life without increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with rectal cancer. All patients scheduled for low anterior resection of the rectum for rectal carcinoma will be invited to participate and prospectively enrolled into the study.
