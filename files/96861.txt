DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Specimen sample
Biospecimen & Clinical Data Collection, The primary objective is to collect 2000 whole blood samples from subjects who are diagnosed with active lung cancer.

The purpose of this study is to collect biospecimen samples (e.g., whole blood) from participants diagnosed with various active lung cancers so that investigations can analyze how the immune response can take place, and aid in understanding active lung cancer biomarkers for future early diagnosis and treatment options., 10 years
