Feasibility and Safety of Acupuncture in the Prevention of Late Irinotecan-related Diarrhea in Pediatric Patients
To evaluate the feasibility of an acupuncture protocol in the prevention of late diarrhea due to irinotecan in pediatric patients with solid tumors, a pre-post pilot study will be conducted.

Pre-post pilot study non-randomized, open label, single arm study. There will be a single study group that will be used at the same time as your own control. The intervention will take place for approximately one year.

Pre-post pilot study non-randomized, open label, single arm study.

The objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate that cancer acupuncture pediatric treatment is a safe and feasible treatment in the prevention of late-onset diarrhea related to with irinotecan.

This pilot study will include patients between 0 and 18 years of age with a solid tumor (nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, central nervous system tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma) receiving their first cycle of irinotecan, in our center, at 50 mg/m2/intravenous dose daily for five days (cumulative dose weekly = 250 mg/m2) and who do not receive concomitant abdominal radiotherapy. Acupuncture will be applied as a complementary treatment along with the usual regimen of prophylaxis and treatment of late diarrhea.
