Outcomes in Lower Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients After Limb Salvage
This study aims to:

1. validate the Finnish version of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scale and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score lower extremity sections and to
2. assess the functional ability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of lower extremity sarcoma patients who have undergone limb salvage surgery.
Limb Salvage
PROCEDURE: Limb salvage
Validity of the lower-limb Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score, The validity is studied, two to five years|Reliability of the lower-limb Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score, The test-retest reliability is studied, two to five years|Health-related quality of life after limb salvage, Assessment of health-related quality of life, two to five years|Assessment of the functional ability after limb salvage, Assessment of functional ability, two to five years
Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30, Health-related quality of life assessment, two to five years|The 15-dimensions health-related quality of life instrument, Health-related quality of life assessment, two to five years|The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score lower extremity section, Functional assessment of the reconstructed limb, two to five years|The Toronto Extremity Salvage Score lower extremity section, Functional assessment of the reconstructed limb, two to five years
The first purpose of this study is to validate the Finnish version of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scale and the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score upper extremity sections. The second purpose is to chart the functional capabilities and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of upper extremity sarcoma patients who have undergone limb salvage surgery with local or free flaps.

Patient hospital records are retrospectively reviewed to chart the demographic and clinical data.

The recruitment of patient takes place at the outpatient clinic of Department of Oncology, Helsinki University Hospital. The study includes a cross-sectional assessment at one year follow-up with five validated questionnaires. A follow-up is conducted three years after surgery in the outpatient clinic.
