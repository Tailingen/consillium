A Phase 2, Open-Label Study of DISC-3405 in Participants With Polycythemia Vera (PV)
This open-label, multicenter, within-participant dose escalation study examining up to 2 dose levels of DISC-3405 will assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of DISC-3405 in participants with polycythemia vera (PV).
