A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Daratumumab in Pediatric and Young Adult Participants Greater Than or Equal to (>=)1 and Less Than or Equal to (<=) 30 Years of Age With Relapsed/Refractory Precursor B-cell or T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of daratumumab in addition to standard chemotherapy in pediatric participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) and T-cell ALL/LL as measured by the complete response (CR) rate.
Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma
DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Doxorubicin|BIOLOGICAL: Peg-asparaginase|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: 6-mercaptopurine|DRUG: Methotrexate
Cohort 1: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Complete response based on the modified National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria was defined as: less than 5 percent (%) blasts in the bone marrow; no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; full recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets greater than (\>)100\*10\^9 cells/liter (L) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1.0\*10\^9 cells/L. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arm only., Up to 2 cycles, that is, up to 56 days (each cycle of 28-days)|Cohort 2: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) for T-cell ALL, Complete response based on the modified NCCN criteria was defined as: less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow; no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; full recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets \>100\*10\^9 cells/L and ANC \>1.0\*10\^9 cells/L. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arms only., End of Cycle 1 (that is, up to 28 days)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), For ALL participants, ORR was defined as percentage of participants who achieved CR or CR with only partial hematological recovery(CRi) as per NCCN criteria. CR for ALL: less than 5% blasts in bone marrow; no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; full recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets \>100\*10\^9 cells/L and ANC \>1.0\*10\^9 cells/L. CRi for ALL: less than 5% blasts in bone marrow; no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; partial recovery of peripheral blood counts not meeting criteria for CR. For LL participants, ORR was defined as percentage of participants who had CR or PR during or after treatment administration but prior to start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant(HSCT). CR for LL: disappearance of all evidence of disease from all sites. PR for LL: decrease of \>=50% in sum of products of diameter of lesions of up to 6 of largest dominant nodes or nodal masses with no new lesions., Up to 4 years 4 months|Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first treatment to the first documented treatment failure (that is \[ie\], disease progression) or date of relapse from CR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per NCCN criteria, relapse from CR is defined as: reappearance of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood or \>5% blasts in the bone marrow; reappearance of extramedullary disease or new extramedullary disease. Progressive disease: increase of at least 25% in the absolute number of circulating peripheral or bone marrow blasts, or development of new extramedullary disease. Kaplan-Meier method was used for the analysis., Up to 4 years 4 months|Relapse-free Survival (RFS), RFS was defined as the time (in months) from CR to relapse from CR, or disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For ALL, as per NCCN criteria, relapse from CR is defined as: reappearance of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood or \>5% blasts in the bone marrow, or reappearance of extramedullary disease or new extramedullary disease. Progressive disease: increase of at least 25% in absolute number of circulating peripheral or bone marrow blasts, or development of new extramedullary disease. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., Up to 4 years 4 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause. Kaplan-Meier method was used for the analysis. Participants who died after consent withdrawal were considered as having an OS event., Up to 4 years 4 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Rate, MRD negative rate was defined as the percentage of participants who were considered MRD negative after MRD testing by bone marrow aspirate at any timepoint after first study treatment administration and before disease progression or starting subsequent anti-cancer therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). MRD negative was defined as less than (\<) 0.01% abnormal population counts to nucleated mononuclear cells when measured by flow cytometry., Up to 4 years 4 months|Percentage of Participants Who Received an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT), Percentage of participants who received an allogeneic HSCT after treatment with daratumumab were reported., Up to 4 years 4 months|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Daratumumab, Cmax was defined as maximum observed serum concentration of daratumumab., Cohort 1: B-cell ALL: End of infusion (EOI) on Day 1 of Cycle 2; Cohort 2: T-cell ALL (1-17 years): EOI on Day 22 of Cycle 2; Cohort 2: T-cell ALL (18-30 years): EOI on Day 1 of Cycle 2; Cohort 2: T-cell LL (1-30 years): EOI on Day 22 of Cycle 2|Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin) of Daratumumab, Cmin was defined as minimum observed serum concentration of daratumumab., Cohort 1: B-cell ALL: Predose on Day 1 of Cycle 2; Cohort 2: T-cell ALL (1-17 years): Predose on Day 22 of Cycle 2; Cohort 2: T-cell ALL (18-30 years): Predose on Day 1 of Cycle 2; Cohort 2: T-cell LL (1-30 years): Predose on Day 22 of Cycle 2|Number of Participants With Anti-daratumumab Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-daratumumab antibodies was reported., Up to 4 years 4 months|Concentration of Daratumumab in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Concentration of daratumumab in CSF was reported. '0' in the number analyzed field signifies that none of the participants were available for the analysis at the specified time points., Pre-dose on Cohort 1: Cycles 1 and 2: Day 1; Cohort 2: Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 2 and Day 15
Screening for eligible participants will be performed within 21 days before administration of the study drug. Participants with B-cell ALL/LL will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or achievement of CR followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Participants with T cell ALL/LL will receive treatment for up to 2 cycles. If disease progression is confirmed, then the participant will discontinue study treatment, complete the End of Treatment Visit, and enter the Posttreatment Period. For those participants who discontinue study drug prior to disease progression, disease evaluations will continue to be performed every 8 weeks until subsequent anticancer therapy is initiated.
