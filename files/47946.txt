A Clinical Study to Assess the Combination of Two Drugs (177Lu-DOTATATE and Nivolumab) in Neuroendocrine Tumours
This is a prospective, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, stratified, exploratory, Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTATATE in combination with nivolumab in adult patients with Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumours (NET) or neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC).

Patients will have unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic, histologically confirmed, well-differentiated Grade 3 NET or poorly-differentiated NEC of the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract lung and unknown primary site. Thirty patients will be included in this trial, of which 15 will not have received prior chemotherapy (Cohort 1) and 15 will have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy (Cohort 2). Patient will receive 240 mg flat dose of nivolumab intravenously as a 30-minutes infusion and 7.4 GBq 177Lu-DOTATATE intravenously as a 4-hours infusion. Nivolumab will be administered at Day 1 and Day 15 of a 28-days cycle, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients will receive the study drugs while it is considered to be in their best interest, 177Lu-DOTATATE being administered at a maximum of 4 injection cycle. Treatment discontinuation criteria include, among others, progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient study withdrawal
