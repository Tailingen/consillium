Improving Fatigue: A Pilot Study of Acupuncture and Patient Education for Breast Cancer Survivors
Based on the investigators clinical experience in patients with chronic disease (Hui, Hui, and Johnston, 2006; Hays et al 2005), a review of the literature (Johnston, Xiao and Hui 2007), and inspired by Vickers and colleagues (PMID: 15117996), the investigators carry out a pilot study that investigates if acupuncture combined with patient education will relieve fatigue in patients who have completed primary treatment for breast cancer.
Fatigue
PROCEDURE: Acupuncture and patient education
Fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory, prior to beginning of treatment and after treatment ends. Up to an average of 44 weeks.
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as measured by the SF36, prior to beginning of treatment and after end of treatment. Up to an average of 44 weeks.|Pain as measured by an analog scale, prior to beginning of treatment and after conclusion of treatment. Up to an average of 44 weeks.|Cognitive complaints as measured by the FACT-COG, prior to the beginning of treatment and after end of treatment. Up to an average of 44 weeks.
Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Our hypothesis is that patients in the acupuncture/education group will experience greater relief of fatigue than those in the standard care group.
