Postoperative Management for HNSCC Based on Pathological Response of Induction Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy
To develop postoperative stratification treatment for patients who have received induction chemotherapy and immunotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancers. Risk stratification is based on clinical characteristics and pathological responses. In order to achieve no inferior survival rate and a lower treatment-related toxicity rate than the standard treatment.
Head and Neck Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody|RADIATION: postoperative radiaotherapy
Disease-free survival, defined as the time from random assignment to documented local or regional relapse, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first after 2 years of treatment., 2 years
Overall survival, defined as the time from random assignment to death from any cause or censored at the date of last follow-up., 2 years|Local-Regional failure survival, defined as the time from random assignment to documented local or regional relapse, whichever occurred first after 2 years of treatment., 2 years|Toxicity Adverse events, Analysis of acute and late adverse events (AEs) are evaluated. Numbers of patients of treatment-related adverse events (acute toxicity) and late radiation toxicities were assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0., 2 years
Induction chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has shown promising efficacy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers. However, how to choose a proper postoperative treatment remains unknown. Eligibility patients were assigned to two arms, each divided into three groups: observation, immunotherapy maintenance, and radiotherapy (50 Gy dose) plus immunotherapy maintenance group for low-risk arm; radiotherapy (50 Gy or 60Gy dose) plus immunotherapy maintenance groups, concurrent chemotherapy plus immunotherapy maintenance group for a high-risk arm. Disease-free survival, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicity would be calculated to evaluate the efficacy of treatments.
