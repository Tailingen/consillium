Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed. To assess accumulation ratio for a dose level based on ANOVA method, it was required that at least 2 participants had derived PK parameter AUC(0- tau) on both Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15. For dose 100mg, 200mg and 400mg, only 1 participant received treatment. For dose 50mg, 2 participants received treatment but there was one participant whose AUC(0- tau) on Cycle 1 Day 15 could not be derived due to discontinuation of treatment before Day 15.
