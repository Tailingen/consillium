Vertebral Augmentation With Kyphoplasty vs Nonsurgical Mgmt for Vertebral Body Compression Fractures
The purpose of this study is to find out how balloon kyphoplasty (surgical repair of the patient's fracture using balloons and bone cement) compares to non-surgical treatment in reducing vertebral compression fractures while providing pain relief and improved function and quality of life.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: Vertebral Augmentation with Balloon Kyphoplasty|OTHER: Non-surgical Treatment
Time to Vertebral Event, Time to vertebral event (composite end point of pain progression, hospitalization for pain, and rescue vertebral augmentation or surgery or radiation therapy as related to an index fracture), Average of 12 months|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression defined as the time to the development of pain severity rated greater than 4 on the visual analog scale (VAS) as related to an index fracture, Average of 12 months
Rate of Vertebral Events, Rate of vertebral events in patients with asymptomatic vertebral compression fracture at 12 months, 12 months|Rate of Hospitalization, Rate of hospitalization for pain control in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic vertebral compression fracture at 12 months, 12 months|Complications of Procedure, Complications of vertebral augmentation, Average of 12 months|Quality of Life Questionnaire Results, Quality of life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment - General (FACT-G) questionnaire in all enrolled patients and Roland Morris disability questionnaire for spine disability, Average of 12 months|Changes in Pulmonary Function, Changes in pulmonary function testing in patients with thoracic spine vertebral compression fracture, Average of 12 months|Change in Kyphosis, Change in kyphosis as measured by the Cobb method and change in vertebral collapse by the method of Genant, Average of 12 months|Prognostic Ability of Bone Biomarkers, Prognostic ability of bone biomarkers for the prediction of vertebral events, Average of 12 months
This is a prospective single center study designed to compare balloon kyphoplasty to non-surgical management (NSM) in the treatment of mildly painful, acute vertebral body compression fractures in multiple myeloma patients. Because of the pilot nature and the small sample size of the study, patient randomization will NOT be stratified. Patients with mildly symptomatic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) will undergo a 1:1 randomization either balloon kyphoplasty or non surgical management. Randomization assignments will be generated by computer and investigator notified once the patient enrolled.

The observational arm will be compared to each of the other two arms; control and intervention arm using the same outcome variables and statistical methods.
