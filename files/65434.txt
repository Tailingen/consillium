Comprehensive Monitoring of Men With Prostate Cancer Cared for by "Active Surveillance
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. However, there is a wide range in prognosis determined by a host of factors. This study will evaluate the feasibility of guiding therapeutic intervention electronically facilitated symptom and disease monitoring in patients being followed on Active Surveillance. Additionally, we will develop a tissue and data resource to support discovery and hypothesis generation to evaluate germline and/or somatic alterations in relation to cancer-specific and overall outcomes..
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Active Surveillance
To estimate the 5-year disease progression rate of patients with low or very low-risk prostate cancer who choose to undergo active surveillance with remote monitoring, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary objectives:

1. Monitor cancer-specific outcomes of men who meet consensus criteria for active surveillance under one of three categories: 1) low or very low-risk prostate cancer, 2) intermediate risk with patient consent, or 3) severe medical comorbidities and high-risk localized prostate cancer or patient desire, despite recommendation

Secondary objectives:

1. Screen for a relationship between cancer-specific and clinical outcomes related to selected comorbidities.
2. Determine the feasibility of electronically facilitated symptoms and disease monitoring to guide therapeutic intervention and prompt therapeutic course correction.
3. Develop a tissue and data resource to support discovery and hypothesis generation focused on germline alterations, somatic alterations, and/or the interaction between the two in determining cancer-specific and overall outcomes
