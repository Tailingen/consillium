Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of IM83 CAR-T Cells for Patients With Advanced Liver Tumors
This is a open-label, single center, cohort study to determine the efficacy and safety of IM83 CAR-T cells in patients with advanced Liver Tumors.
Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: IM83 CAR-T cells|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: The second-line treatment of liver cancer
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory test results as assessed by CTCAE V5.0, Up to 28 days after CAR-T cell infusion
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, At 28 days, 3 months and 6 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) in Stage 1, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, Up to 24 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from CAR-T cell infusion to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) , as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, Up to 24 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), OS , defined as the time from CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause, Up to 24 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion|Plasma levels of Î± fetoprotein (AFP) cells infusion, At 28 days, 3 months and 6 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Persistence of CAR-T cells (cell counts and cell percentage in peripheral blood), The persistence over time of CAR T cells in the peripheral blood as determined by flow cytometry and qPCR., Up to 24 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion
This is a open-label, single center, cohort study to determine the efficacy and safety of IM83 CAR-T cells in patients with advanced Liver Tumors.
