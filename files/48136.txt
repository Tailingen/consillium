Association Between Microbiome and the Efficacy and Safety of PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade in Resectable NSCLC
This study will investigate the relationship between respiratory and gut microbiome and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and immune-related adverse events (irAE) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (Stage IIA-IIIB）
Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Major pathological response (mPR), defined as ≤10% residual live tumor tissue in lung cancer samples resected after neoadjuvant therapy as assessed by the central pathology laboratory., Whithin time from enrollment to surgery
Pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as the absence of live tumour cells in lung cancer specimens resected after neoadjuvant therapy and in all sampled local lymph nodes according to central pathology laboratory assessment. Patients who are not evaluable according to the central pathological assessment (including patients with R2 margins) or who do not have a surgical specimen will not be considered to have achieved a pCR (e.g. remission will be recorded as 'not evaluable' or 'missing', as appropriate)., Whithin time from enrollment to surgery|Disease free survival (DFS), defined as the time from surgery to the first recurrence of disease (local or distant) or all-cause death, whichever occurs first. DFS was captured only for events after surgery., Whithin 1 year after surgery|Overall survival (OS), defined as time from enrolment to all-cause death, Whithin 1 year after enrollment|Immune-related adverse event (irAE), defined as all levels of adverse drug reactions in antitumor immunotherapy that are judged to be related to immune mechanisms, excluding non-specific infusion reactions., Whithin 1 year after enrollment|Changes in microbiomics in respiratory tract and gut, Defined as microbial composition, diversity, and functional activity measured by 16S RNA sequencing, Whithin 1 year after enrollment|Radiological response, Defined as radiographic change assesed by RECIST 1.1., Whithin time from enrollment to surgery|Changes in single-cell immune repertoire, Defined as diversity of immune receptors (e.g. TCR and BCR) for T and B cells in lung tissues, Whithin time from enrollment to surgery
