A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of TAK-901 in Subjects With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TAK-901 in subjects with advanced hematological malignancies, and to further assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-901 at or below the MTD in an expanded cohort of subjects in order to select a dose for future studies.
