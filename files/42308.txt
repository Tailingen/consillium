Effect of Implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery on 3-year Survival After Colorectal Surgery for Cancer
Several recent studies have shown that the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol reduces morbidity and mortality and shortens the length of stay compared to conventional recovery strategy (pre-ERAS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the implementation of this protocol on 3-year overall survival and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer.
