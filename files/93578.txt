The Effects of High-flow Nasal Oxygen on Oxygenation During Rigid Bronchoscopy Under General Anesthesia in Pediatric Patients
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen administration on maintenance of oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide during apnoeic period in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy

DEVICE: Optiflow
Hypoxia occurs the first time, The time taken to reach the point at which peripheral oxygen saturation fell below 90 for the first time immediately after the onset of apnea, The time taken to reach the point at which peripheral oxygen saturation fell below 90% for the first time immediately after the onset of apnea intraoperatively.|the lowest oxygen saturation, the lowest value of oxygen saturation measured percutaneously at extremity., apnea period during the rigidbroscopic procedure/surgery|Occurence of hypoxic event, Occurence of hypoxic event: Presence or absence of hypoxia(peripheral oxygen saturation fell below 90% ) during rigid bronchoscopy, apnea period during the rigidbroscopic procedure/surgery
End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure, end-tidal CO2 partial pressure after 3 consecutive breaths after intubation or insertion of laryngeal mask following end of apnea during intraoperative period.|Arterial oxygen / carbon dioxide partial pressure, shortly before start of apnea (within 30 seconds) and shortly after end of apnea (within 30 seconds)
