Dociparstat Sodium (CX-01) Combined With Standard Induction Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This was an exploratory Phase 2, open label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group study to determine whether there was evidence that the addition of dociparstat (CX-01) at 2 different does levels to standard induction therapy (cytarabine+idarubicin, "7+3") and consolidation therapy had an additive therapeutic effect for subjects newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when compared with subjects receiving standard induction chemotherapy alone.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Dociparstat sodium|DRUG: Idarubicin|DRUG: Cytarabine
Number of Subjects Who Achieved Morphologic Complete Remission, Morphologic complete remission (CR) was evaluated by International Working Group (IWG) criteria and defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1000/microliter; platelet count \>100,000, \<5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate, no blasts with Auer rods, and no evidence of extramedullary disease., During induction and re-induction phases of treatment (up to 60 days after the start of each treatment cycle)
Duration of Event-free Survival, Event-free survival was measured as date of randomization until treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as failure to achieve composite completed morphological remission during the induction and re-induction phase of the study lasting up to 60 days, relapse from complete response, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Randomization up to 30 months|Time to Leukemia-free Survival, Leukemia-free survival was assessed as a secondary endpoint only in subjects who achieved composite complete remission and was measured from randomization until disease relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Assessments were performed every 3 months until death or 18 months after the last subject was randomized, whichever occurred first., Randomization until disease relapse or patient death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 30 months|Number of Subjects Who Achieved Overall Survival, Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization until death from any cause. Assessments were performed every 3 months and continued until death or 18 months after the last patient was randomized, whichever came first., Randomization to end of study (18 months)|Number of Subjects Who Achieved Composite Complete Remission, The composite complete remission (CR) rate included CR, CR without recovery of platelets (CRp), and CR without recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (CRi), as defined by the International Working Group criteria during the induction and re-induction phases of treatment. CR was defined as an Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \>1000/μL, platelet count \>100,000/μL, \<5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate, no blasts with Auer rods, and no evidence of extramedullary disease. CRi was defined as an ANC \<1000/μL and/or platelet count \<100,000/, \<5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate, no blasts with Auer rods, and no evidence of extramedullary disease., Up to 60 days after the start of each treatment cycle|Duration of Morphologic Complete Remission, The duration of morphologic complete remission was assessed only in subjects who had achieved morphologic complete remission and was defined as the time from achievement of complete response to the detection or relapse. Relapse was defined as the reappearance of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood, \>5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to another cause, or appearance/reappearance of extramedullary disease and with a bone marrow blast percentage of \>5% but ≤20%. If the latter, a repeat bone marrow examination was performed at least 7 days after the first marrow examination; documentation of the bone marrow blast percentage of \>5% was necessary to establish relapse. Assessments were performed every 3 months and continued until death or 18 months after the last subject was randomized, whichever occurred first.

Duration of morphologic complete remission (time from the achievement of complete response to the detection of relapse), Randomization to end of study (18 months)|Time to Recovery of Neutrophils, Neutrophil recovery was assessed from randomization to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) recovery (ANC \>500/µL and \>1000/µL) for up to 60 days after the start of each treatment cycle., Randomization to ANC recovery, for up to 60 days after the start of each treatment cycle|Time to Platelet Recovery, Platelet recovery was measured from randomization to platelet recovery (platelet count \>20,000/µL and \>100,000/µL), Randomization to platelet recovery, for up to 60 days after the start of each treatment cycle|Number of Subjects Who Died by Day 30, Mortality (rate of death) of subjects by Day 30, measured from the first day of induction treatment to 30 days post-induction., 30 days (from first day of induction treatment to 30 days after)|Number of Subjects Who Died by Day 60., Mortality (rate of death) of subjects by Day 60, measured from the first day of induction treatment to 60 days post-induction., 60 days (from the first day of induction treatment to 60 days after)|Number of Subjects Who Died by Day 90, Mortality (rate of death) of subjects at Day 90, measured from the first day of induction treatment to 90 days post-induction., 90 days (from the first day of induction treatment to 90 days after)
The primary efficacy endpoint was to assess whether dociparstat in conjunction with standard induction therapy for AML increased the complete remission rate based on the International Working Group AML response criteria.

A total of 75 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups:

* Group 1: cytarabine + idarubicin
* Group 2: cytarabine + idarubicin + dociparstat 0.125 mg/kg/hr
* Group 3: cytarabine + idarubicin + dociparstat 0.25 mg/kg/hr

Subjects received up to 2 induction cycles and up to 2 consolidation cycles and participated in the study for up to 18 months. Clinical laboratory tests were conducted routinely, and bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were performed during the induction cycles. Safety was monitored through adverse events and clinical laboratory results.
