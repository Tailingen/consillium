Safety and Efficacy Study of Denosumab in Patients With Recurrent or Unresectable Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
To determine how safe and effective denosumab is in treating patients with giant cell tumor of bone.
GCT|Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
BIOLOGICAL: Denosumab|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Calcium/Vitamin D
Percentage of Participants With Giant Cell Tumor Response, A treatment response was defined for participants with tissue samples obtained and measured by histopathology as: • at least 90% elimination of giant cells relative to Baseline, or • complete elimination of giant cells in cases where giant cells represent \< 5% of tumor cells. A response was defined for participants who have only radiographs (histopathology not available) as lack of progression of the target lesion at week 25 by radiographic measurements compared with Baseline. For participants with both a core biopsy and resected tissue obtained, the sample closest to week 25 was used in the analysis., From enrollment until 25 weeks
Percent Change From Baseline in Urinary N-telopeptide Corrected for Urine Creatinine, Urinary N-telopeptide (of type 1 collagen) corrected for urine creatinine (uNTX/Cr) is a bone turnover marker used to measure the activity of denosumab. Percent change from Baseline in uNTX/Cr was measured over time., Baseline and Weeks 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, and 81|Percent Change From Baseline in Serum C-terminus Peptide (of Type 1 Collagen), Serum C-terminus peptide (of type 1 collagen; CTX1) is a bone turnover marker used to measure the activity of denosumab. Percent change from Baseline in CTX was measured over time., Baseline and Weeks 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, and 81|Serum Denosumab Trough Concentrations, Serum concentrations of denosumab were measured by a validated conventional sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., Blood samples were collected on Days 1 (baseline), 8, 15 and Weeks 5 (Day 29), 9, 13, 25, and 49.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event is defined as an undesirable medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined by regulatory authorities as one that • is fatal • is life threatening (places the participant at immediate risk of death) • requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • other significant medical hazard. The severity of adverse events was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 3.0) based on the following general guideline: Grade 1: Mild AE Grade 2: Moderate AE Grade 3: Severe AE Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5: Death related to AE. AEs were assessed by the Investigator for relatedness to study drug., From the first dose of study drug until the data cut-off date of April 7 2008; a maximum of 18 months|Number of Participants With Anti-Denosumab Antibodies, Validated immunoassays were used to test for the presence of anti-denosumab antibodies throughout the study., From enrollment until the data cut-off date of April 7 2008; a maximum time of 18 months.
