U01-Biomarkers for Noninvasive and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer
This is an observational, biospecimen collection protocol to develop a bank of pancreatic cancer tissue and normal tissue.
Pancreatic Cancer
Measuring cell-free and exosomal-miRNA biomarkers using small RNA-Seq in matched tissue and plasma from patients with PDAC, PNs, pancreatitis and normal pancreas for early detection., We will perform whole genome small RNA sequencing (small RNA-Seq) analysis on tissue specimens from 60 primary PDACs (30 stage I/II and 30 Stage III/IV), 60 PNs (20 each PanINs, IPMNs and MCNs), and 60 non-neoplastic normal pancreatic tissues (NN) and pancreatitis.

We will perform small RNA-Seq analysis to identify differentially expressed cell-free and exosomal miRNAs (cf-miRNAs and exo-miRNAs) from the same matched plasma specimens., 5 years
This is an observational, biospecimen collection protocol to develop a bank of pancreatic cancer tissue, normal tissue. Biospecimens collected through this protocol will be shared with collaborators in the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium to support projects funded through an NIH U01 grant. Participants will be enrolled when they present for clinically indicated surgical procedures for their possible tumor or pancreas resection or cyst resection, or at a clinically indicated follow-up appointment after their procedure.

This protocol supports this effort by providing investigators with access to a wide variety of pancreatic tissues and biospecimens for translational studies in pancreatic cancer. This protocol covers the collection of clinical data and biospecimens (blood; malignant, benign, or precancerous pancreatic tumor; and adjacent normal tissues) from patients with, or suspected to have, pancreatic cancer. Additionally, saliva and cyst fluid, may be collected in the future from patients with pancreatic cysts. These will be shared with the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium for further analysis.
