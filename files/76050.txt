Establishment and Clinical Validation of New Technologies for Accurate Screening of Colorectal Cancer Based on Multi-omics
Background:

The current screening techniques for colorectal cancer include colonoscopy, fecal occult blood, and high-risk factor questionnaires. However, the colorectal cancer screening technology that has been widely used at present cannot take into account sensitivity and specificity, and the tumor detection rate is low.

The purpose of research:

1. Build a new type of population colorectal cancer precision screening technology program;
2. Improve the detection rate of colorectal cancer in the population by new methods (compared with the existing domestic advanced technology) by ≥20%, and improve the specificity of colorectal cancer screening by ≥15% without significantly reducing the sensitivity.
