Study of Simmitecan Hydrochloride in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumor
RATIONAL: Simmitecan is an anticancer ester prodrug, which involves activation to chimmitecan. Chimmitecan，a novel CPT derivative, exhibited potent antitumor activities both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting topoisomerase I. Also exerted comparable effects on topoisomerase I compared with topotecan and SN38 and possessed improved anticancer potency and pharmacologic profiles, compared with the clinically available CPT analogues.

PURPOSE: to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of Simmitecan.
