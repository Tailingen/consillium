SM-88 Maintenance Therapy for Advanced Ewing's Sarcoma and as Salvage Therapy for Sarcoma
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88, a combination metabolic cancer treatment, in two study cohorts:

* Clinically advanced Ewing's Sarcoma patients who have not progressed at the conclusion of systemic treatment
* Clinically advanced sarcoma patients in the salvage treatment setting

Up to 24 efficacy evaluable patients (up to 12 per cohort) will be enrolled. Study patients will receive oral SM-88, with scheduled safety and efficacy evaluations.
Sarcoma, Ewing|Sarcoma
DRUG: Combination metyrosine-derivative, low-dose methoxsalen, phenytoin and sirolimus (MPS)
Overall Response Rate, Complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) as evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Every 3 months for up to 2 years|Stable Disease for at Least 3 Months, Stable disease (SD) as evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Every 3 months for up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival on Study of at Least 1.5 Times the Duration of PFS for the Last Prior Treatment, From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression, as evaluated using RECIST 1.1, or date of death, whichever occurs first, Every 3 months for up to 2 years
Duration of Response, From date of CR or PR until the date of first documented progression, as evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Every 3 months for up to 2 years|Overall Survival, From date enrollment until the date of death, Every 3 months for up to 2 years|Clinical Benefit Rate, CR+PR+SD as evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Every 3 months for up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE v5, Adverse events will be assessed at each visit and at unscheduled visits as clinically indicated, From date of enrollment until 28 days after last treatment with SM-88
This prospective, open-label, two stage, pilot phase 2 trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of SM-88 in two cohorts of patients: 1) as maintenance therapy following standard primary or palliative treatments for Ewing's sarcoma patients with high risk of relapse or disease progression; and 2) as salvage therapy for patients with clinically advanced sarcomas.

The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88, a combination metabolic cancer treatment, measured as positive efficacy events, including overall response, maintaining stable disease for â‰¥ 3 months, or progression free survival at least 1.5 times longer than the last prior line of treatment.

Eligible patients will receive daily oral treatment with SM-88, which consists of D,L-alpha-metyrosine, used with methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus in continuous treatment cycles of 28 days. Treatment will continue until: 1) Symptomatic, clinical progression with radiographic progressive disease; 2) 48 weeks after documented complete response; or 3) evidence of unacceptable toxicity, or other decision to discontinue treatment
