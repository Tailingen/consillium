Apatinib for Advanced Non-squamous Head and Neck Cancer
In this study, the investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in advanced non-squamous head and neck cancer and to validate the correlative biomarkers.

There is no standard therapy for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous head and neck cancer. Apatinib is a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor is highly expressed in non-squamous head and neck cancer and its expression correlates with stage, tumour size, vascular invasion, recurrence and metastasis. In this study, the investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in advanced non-squamous head and neck cancer and to validate the correlative biomarkers.
