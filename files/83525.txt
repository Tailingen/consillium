Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and PK of HLX55 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With Different cMET Status
A mutilpe-center, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of HLX55 in patients with advanced solid tumors overexpressing/Mutation/Amplification cMET after failure of standard of care.

This study is an open-label and dose escalation study including dose finding stage and expansion stage.

In dosing finding stage, the study will precede in two phases, (i) a modified accelerated titration design 2A (ATD 2A) phase and (ii) a traditional 3+3 dose escalation phase aimed at exploring the safety and MTD of HLX55. Four dose levels are designed for HLX55 in this stage: 2.5, 5, 15, and 25 mg/kg/3 weeks. The 5 mg/kg/3 weeks will serve as the starting dose.

In the dose-expansion stage, three to five cohorts are planned, and different cohorts will evaluate the efficacy of HLX55 for potential indications. Maximum 20 patients will be accrued in each cohort.
