To assess activity of abiraterone-re-challenge in patients with advanced prostate cancer and prior response to abiraterone. CRPC patients with prior response to abiraterone (confirmed PSA Response) and progression can be re-challenged with abiraterone. Patients may have received treatment with docetaxel, enzalutamide and radium-223.
