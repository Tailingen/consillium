Exercise in Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis and Myasthenic Syndromes
A few recent observational studies show that despite the lack of clear recommendations, many individuals with myasthenia participate in exercise. However, no link has been found between exercise and the severity of myasthenia symptoms, measured by the Muscle Myasthenia Score or the Myasthenia Gravis Composite Score. This suggests that there are other factors that may limit or prevent some individuals from being active, or factors which may facilitate participation in exercise.

Studies in other diseases have shown that there are internal (beliefs, motivation, etc.) and external (cost, accessibility, etc.) factors unrelated to the disease which may play a role in exercise participation.

The aim of this study is to identify factors that facilitate or limit exercise in individuals with autoimmune myasthenia gravis, congenital myasthenia syndrome and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
