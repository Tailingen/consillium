Does Notch Regulate Glioma Proliferation ?
The investigators showed in 2015 (Guichet et al) that the Notch1 pathway has an anti-proliferative role on glial brain tumors. In this project, the investigators investigated which genes downstream of Notch1 pathway activation produce the anti-proliferative effect. The investigators hypothesized that the SNAI2 and TAL1 genes act downstream of Notch1
Glioma
Effect of Notch1 activation on Tal1, highthroughput gene analysis (DNA arrays) with cells transduced with activated form of Notch1, 1 day|Snai2 gene and protein expression, western blot for Tal1 and Snai2 in protein extracted from low grade and high gliomas, 1 day
Main objectives:

To examine the expression of TAL1 and SNAI2 in protein extracts and glioma sections of different grades (glioblastomas and diffuse low-grade tumors).

To examine the effect of overexpression of Tal1 and Snai2 in high grade glioma cultures.

To show the expression of Tal1 and SNAI2 by tumor cells by FISH technique. Show that TAL1 and SNAI2 could be regulated by endothelial cells
