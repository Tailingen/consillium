Molecular Mechanisms of Senescence Predisposing to Cancer : Exploratory Analysis on Healthy Tissues (SkinAge).
Epidemiological data show that the incidence of carcinoma, the most common cancer, is strongly linked to the age. Non Melanoma Skin Carcinomas (NMSCs) (the most frequent cancers in the elderly population) derive from keratinocytes of the basal layer of the epidermis, from differentiated keratinocytes of the more superficial layers or from stem cells of hair follicles. Unlike NMSCs, soft-tissue sarcomas, including those deriving from dermal fibroblasts, are very rare (less than 1% of all cancers). Our overall purpose is to decipher the molecular pathways activated during the aging of these tissues that may explain why they have a so different propensity to undergo a malignant transformation. Given that senescent cells accumulate in the dermis and epidermis with age, we will constitute two groups : "young skin" that we arbitrarily limit to the range ≥ 18 and ≤ 40 and "aged skin" ≥ 55.

Thus the main objective of our study is to search within 2 age groups (≥ 18 and ≤ 40 years and ≥ 55 years) the expression of senescence markers on healthy skin tissue.
