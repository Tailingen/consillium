A Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial of Daunoxome Versus Combination Chemotherapy With Adriamycin/Bleomycin/Vincristine (ABV) in the Treatment of HIV-Associated Kaposi's Sarcoma.
To compare the toxicity profiles (severity and time to onset from initiation of therapy) between daunorubicin (liposomal) and combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin/bleomycin/vincristine (ABV), with both regimens administered in combination with antiretroviral therapy. To compare the duration of responses, response rates, and times to response.
