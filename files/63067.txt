Study of Icrucumab (IMC-18F1) or Ramucirumab Drug Product (DP) in Combination With Capecitabine or Capecitabine on Previously Treated Breast Cancer Patients
An open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase 2 trial in which participant with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with anthracycline and taxane therapy receive ramucirumab DP or Icrucumab (IMC-18F1) administered on an every-21-day cycle (in combination with oral capecitabine therapy; capecitabine is administered twice a day on Days 1-14 of each cycle). Approximately 150 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either ramucirumab DP or Icrucumab (IMC-18F1) in combination with capecitabine (Arm A and Arm B, respectively) or capecitabine monotherapy (Arm C). Randomization will be stratified by triple-negative receptor status (estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 \[HER2/neu\]-negative) (yes/no) and receipt of prior antiangiogenic therapy.

Treatment with the study medication(s) will continue until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the participant, or investigator decision. Capecitabine dose reductions in the setting of significant myelosuppression, hand-and-foot syndrome, or diarrhea will be required.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever is first. Disease progression is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study); sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 millimeter (mm) and the appearance of ≥1 new lesions was progression. Participants who did not progress, were lost to follow-up, or had missed 2 or more scheduled tumor assessments were censored at the day of their last adequate tumor assessment., From Date of Randomization until Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 97 weeks)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. If the participant is alive at the end of the follow-up period or is lost to follow-up, OS will be censored on the last date the participant is known to be alive., From Date of Randomization until Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 160 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is the number of all participants with Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) according to RECIST v1.1 from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to \<10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Disease progression is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study); sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm and the appearance of ≥1 new lesions was progression., From Date of Randomization until Disease Progression/Recurrence (Up to 97 weeks)|Duration of Response, Duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the criteria for progressive disease (PD) is met (taking as a reference for PD that smallest measurement recorded since the treatment started), or death, is objectively documented.CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to \<10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.PD defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression., From Date of CR, PR until Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 97 weeks)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse event (AE) will be regarded as treatment-emergent if onset date occurs any time on or after the administration of the first dose of study treatment up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (or up to any time if related to study treatment); or it occurs prior to first dose date and worsens while on therapy or up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (or up to any time if related to study treatment).

A summary of other nonserious AEs, and all SAE's, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Up To 160 Weeks|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

Resulted in death; Was life-threatening; Required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage; Was an important medical event (defined as a medical event that may not have been immediately life-threatening or resulted in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above).
