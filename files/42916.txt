LMY-920 for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Myeloma
Since CAR-T cell treatment of refractory myeloma has shown success, based on preclinical data, we posit that CAR-T cells expressing B-cell activating factor (BAFF) can become another strategy to treat refractory myeloma, even after relapse following BCMA targeting CAR-T cell treatment. This will be phase 1 study of BAFF ligand CAR-T cells in relapsed and refractory myeloma.

In this open label, dose escalation study, up to four dose levels of autologous BAFF ligand CAR-T cells (LMY-920) will be evaluated for treatment relapsed and refractory myeloma. BAFF receptor family includes B-cell activating factor receptor (BR3), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMY-920 will be determined using dose-escalation 3+3 design. The primary goal of this study is to determine recommended phase II dose of human LMY-920 in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.
