Breath Analysis for Evaluation of Radiation Exposure in Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Radiation
Patients treated with radiation therapy for lung tumors can experience inflammation after treatment. This study hopes to evaluate the use of breath analysis to evaluate changes in the composition of exhaled breath in patients undergoing radiotherapy. If changes can be detected, this may ultimately serve as biomarkers for identifying patients at highest risk for radiation-induced lung injury (radiation pneumonitis).
Lung Cancer|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Exhaled Breath Sampling
Pre and post-radiation FeNO (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide) measurements, Every 3 months for 1 year
Pre and post-radiation CO (carbon monoxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), and N2O (nitrous oxide) measurements and feasibility as the fraction of patients unable to give a breath sample. Adverse events are not expected but any that appear related to the breath, 1 yr
