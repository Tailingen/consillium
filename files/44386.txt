Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity and tolerance of carbon ion radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC)
Pancreatic Carcinoma
RADIATION: carbon ion radiotherapy

The carbon dose of 60-67.5GyE in 15 fractions was delivered to clinical target volume (CTV). The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as CTCAE grade 3 or higher of non-hematological toxicity (G3). The acute and late toxicities, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were the endpoints.
