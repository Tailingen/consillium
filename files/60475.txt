Gynecology Beyond Gender: Cervical Cancer Screening in Transgender Men in France
In France, cervical cancer screening is the subject of a national screening programme organized for all asymptomatic individuals aged 25 to 65 years with a cervix. The latter contributes greatly to the prevention and early treatment of this disease, whose public health challenge is recognized worldwide.

One of the objectives of this programme is to reduce inequalities in access. Transgender men, i.e. individuals assigned to the female gender at birth but identifying with the male gender, are concerned by this screening as long as they still have a cervix, according to the same modalities as for cisgender women.

However, they are often excluded from health care, including organized screening programs. Gender change in civil status is one of the obstacles.

The provision of gynaecological care is sometimes inadequate. The lack of knowledge of health professionals and the problems of discrimination that transgender people may face reduce the chances of having equitable access.

This survey aims to explore the perception that transgender men have of cervical cancer screening and to identify the challenges they face, the obstacles and the levers to access this prevention program.
