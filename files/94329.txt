Determination of Safe and Effective Dose of Romiplostim (AMG 531) in Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)Receiving Hypomethylating Agents
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Romiplostim (AMG 531) on the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events (grade 3 or 4 and/or receipt of platelet transfusions) in subjects with low or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) receiving hypomethylating agents. It is hypothesized that Romiplostim administration, at the appropriate dose and schedule, will result in reduction in the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events in low or intermediate risk MDS subjects receiving hypomethylating agents.

DRUG: Placebo|BIOLOGICAL: AMG 531 (Romiplostim)|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Decitabine
Occurrence of a Clinically Significant Thrombocytopenic Event, Occurrence of a clinically significant thrombocytopenic event within the participant, defined as any platelet count obtained from day 15 of cycle 1 through the end of the interim follow-up visit that was less than 50 x 10\^9/L or receipt of platelet transfusions at any time through the interim follow-up visit., Treatment period (up to 20 weeks)
Hypomethylating Agent Dose Reduction and Delay Due to Thrombocytopenia, Occurrence of hypomethylating agent dose reduction and delay due to thrombocytopenia, Treatment period (up to 20 weeks)|Achieving an Overall Response (Complete or Partial Response, CR or PR) at the End of the Treatment Period, CR = decrease in bone marrow blast (≤5%) and improvement in peripheral blood counts (Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL, platelets ≥ 100x10\^9/L, neutrophils ≥ 1x10\^9/L, peripheral blasts=0%). PR = improvement in peripheral blood counts plus a decrease in bone marrow blasts ≥50% but not ≤5, or decrease in International Prognostic Scoring System score., Treatment period (up to 20 weeks)|Platelet Transfusion, Occurrence of one or more platelet transfusions from study day 1 through the interim follow-up visit (16 weeks), Study day 1 through the interim follow-up visit (up to 20 weeks)
