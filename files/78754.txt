Clonal Dynamics of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Treated With Pirtobrutinib After Previous Treatment With Zanubrutinib
This is a multicentre single-arm prospective phase II trial evaluating pirtobrutinib in the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients who have previously received zanubrutinib, and to specifically evaluate Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) mutational status (clonal dynamics) before, during and after treatment with pirtobrutinib.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Pirtobrutinib
Cloncal dynamics of BTK mutations in CLL before, during and after treatment with pirtobrutinib, Before the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease
Overall response rate in CLL with pirtobrutinib after prior immediate zanubrutinib, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|The efficacy as assessed by time to response (TTR), The time from the start of pirtobrutinib to the first objective response observed for patients who achieves a complete remission (CR), complete remission with an incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial remission (nPR), partial remission (PR) or the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. TTR also includes partial remission with lymphocytosis (PR-L) as sensitivity analysis, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|Efficacy as assessed by Duration of Response (DOR), The time from onset of a CR, CRi, nPR, PR to the earlier of the documentation of definitive progressive disease (\[PD\] per iwCLL 2018 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Duration of response and time to response will be evaluated for responders (CR, CRi, nPR, PR) only. DOR including PR-L as a response will be analysed with the same method as DOR, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|Efficacy as assessed by Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of patients who have achieve CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PR-L, or SD, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|Efficacy as assessed by Time to next treatment (TTNT), The time from the date of first pirtobrutinib dose (Day 1 Cycle 1) to the date of the initiation of the next systemic anticancer therapy for CLL or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|Efficacy as assessed by progression free survival, The time from the date of first pirtobrutinib dose (Cycle 1 Day 1) until PD (per iwCLL 2018 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|Efficacy as assessed by overall survival, The time from first pirtobrutinib dose (Day 1 Cycle 1) until death from any cause. If the patient is alive or lost to follow-up at the time of data analysis, OS data will be censored on the last date the patient is known to be alive, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease|Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) measured using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, Safety profile, including SAEs, AEs, deaths, and clinical laboratory abnormalities, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease
Additional elements of clonal dynamics in CLL, Additional genomic profiling and analyses, From the start of treatment till end of study, up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without progressive disease
Following confirmation of eligibility and registration to the study, patients will receive treatment with pirtobrutinib until progressive disease (PD) according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (iwCLL) 2018 criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Following first progression, treatment may continue if in the opinion of the investigator the patient is deriving clinical benefit.

BTK mutational status and analysis of CLL clonal dynamics on peripheral blood will be performed prior to the first dose of treatment, Day 1 of each cycle thereafter while on study treatment, End of Treatment (EoT), and at time of PD.

Response will be assessed by the investigator based on physical examination, CT scan (or MRI), haematology results, and bone marrow examinations according to iwCLL 2018 response criteria.

Patients who discontinue treatment for any reason will have an EoT visit within 7 days after the last dose of treatment or decision to cease treatment. Additionally, they will have a Safety Follow-up visit 28 days + 7 days after the last dose of treatment or decision to discontinue treatment. Following these two visits, patients will move into the Follow-up Phase of the study where they will be assessed every 12 weeks Â± 4 weeks. Patients with PD will be followed for survival and new anti-CLL therapy only. All patients will be followed up until the last registered patient has been on pirtobrutinib for 36 months without PD.
