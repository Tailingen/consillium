INEC Study: Immuno-modulating Enteral Nutrition in Cancer
The aim of this study is to investigate if enteral immunonutrition of head and neck or esophageal cancer patients, using an arginine, omega 3 fatty acid, nucleotides-enhanced diet \[Impact (R), Novartis\] versus a standard enteral nutrition (control, Novartis), could improve clinical outcomes (mucositis frequency, treatment tolerance), nutritional and immune status, and life quality parameters.

Malnutrition is frequent in head and neck (H\&N) and esophageal cancers and alters immune status, anti-infectious and anti-tumoral defenses and the response to the treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Treatment of these 2 types of cancer is often chemoradiotherapy which frequently induces mucositis. Mucositis enhances nutritional risk and could impose a modification or an interruption of the treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate if enteral immunonutrition of head and neck or esophageal cancer patients, using an arginine, omega 3 fatty acid, nucleotides-enhanced diet \[Impact(R), Novartis\] versus a standard enteral nutrition (control, Novartis), could improve clinical outcomes (mucositis frequency, treatment tolerance), nutritional and immune status, and life quality parameters.
