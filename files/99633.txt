The Impact of Anesthesia on High- Grade Glioma Patients
Although bench data and retrospective studies have provided a promising picture of the possible influence of anesthetic technique on the risk of tumor progression and patients mortality, current evidence from RCTs is inadequate to show whether the type of anesthetics might influence tumor progression and patient survival.There are many thousands of patients with a cancer diagnosis undergoing surgery every year, and in the context of biological plausibility, it should lead to the urgent undertaking of RCTs to further evaluate the association between the anesthetic management and patient outcome.
