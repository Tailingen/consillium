Gene Therapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Placing the gene for interleukin-12 into breast cancer cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12
Maximum tolerated dose, Serum antibodies (titer) to adenovirus, up to 1 month|Toxicity and safety, adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, up to 2 months
Tumor response progression), Sequential assessment of tumor on CT or MRI (complete response, partial response, stable disease, or disease), up to 2 months|Immune response, Serum IL12, and IFNÎ³ levels. Serum antibodies (titer) to adenovirus., up to 2 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral injection of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 gene in women with metastatic breast cancer.
* Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients receive a single dose of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 intratumorally via percutaneous needle placement under ultrasound guidance.

Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected periodically for immunological laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed for serum cytokine levels by ELISA; qualitative analysis of immune biomarkers by IHC staining; and immune cell biomarker analysis by FACS.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
