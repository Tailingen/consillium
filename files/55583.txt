Can Hepatic-splenic Elastography Predict the Risk of Hepatocellular Recurrence After Radiofrequency Ablation?
The study aims to assess whether there is an association between hepatic and splenic elastography values and the risk of HCC recurrence after treatment with RFA
HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Association between hepatic and splenic elastography values and the risk of HCC recurrence after treatment with RFA, The primary objective of the study will be to assess whether there is an association between hepatic and splenic elastography values and the risk of HCC recurrence after treatment with RFA, 12 months
The primary objective of the study will be to assess whether there is an association between hepatic and splenic elastography values and the risk of HCC recurrence after treatment with RFA. Secondary objectives, however, will be to test whether hepatic and splenic elastography values have an association with overall and HCC-related survival and with the risk of decompensation after treatment with RFA; further secondary objective will be to evaluate the association between non-invasive biochemical tests and the risk of HCC recurrence after treatment with RFA. The population will consist of hepatopathic patients with HCC who are candidates for treatment with RFA and who are referred to the coordinating center "U.O.C. of Gastroenterology and Digestive Endoscopy" of IRCSS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Policlinico di S.Orsola and the Participating Center "U.O. of Gastroenterology," Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Integrata di Modena.
