Randomized Trial of eOncoNote
Improving Cancer Care Together through eOncoNote is a pragmatic randomized trial involving a secure online eConsultation system (referred to as eOncoNote) that will allow primary care providers and cancer specialist providers to communicate about their patients.

Team/Cross Boundary Continuity subscale of the Nijmegen Continuity Questionnaire, 4-item subscale (scored on a five-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree); calculate the mean of the items in the subscale, Follow-up 2 = Diagnosis: 2 weeks; Treatment: 4 months for prostate cancer patients, 6 months for breast cancer patients; Survivorship: 12 months
Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7); 7 items; 4 response options ("not at all" = 0; "several days" = 1; "more than half the days" = 2; "nearly every day" = 3), (Follow-up 1 = Treatment: 1 month; Survivorship: 6 months); (Follow-up 2 = Diagnosis: 2 weeks; Treatment: 4 months for prostate cancer patients, 6 months for breast cancer patients; Survivorship: 12 months)|Depression, Patient Health Questionnaire on major depression (PHQ-9); 10 items in total; items 1-9: 4 response options ("not at all" = 0; "several days" = 1; "more than half the days" = 2; "nearly every day" = 3); item 10: four-point scale (ranging from "not difficult at all" to "extremely difficult"), (Follow-up 1 = Treatment: 1 month; Survivorship: 6 months); (Follow-up 2 = Diagnosis: 2 weeks; Treatment: 4 months for prostate cancer patients, 6 months for breast cancer patients; Survivorship: 12 months)|Patient experience of the care process, Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire (PPE-15); 15 items; each item scored as dichotomous score indicating presence or absence of a problem (defined as an aspect of health care that could be improved upon from the patient's perspective), (Follow-up 1 = Treatment: 1 month; Survivorship: 6 months); (Follow-up 2 = Diagnosis: 2 weeks; Treatment: 4 months for prostate cancer patients, 6 months for breast cancer patients; Survivorship: 12 months)
Team/Cross Boundary Continuity subscale of the Nijmegen Continuity Questionnaire, 4-item subscale (scored on a five-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree); calculate the mean of the items in the subscale, Follow-up 1 = Treatment: 1 month; Survivorship: 6 months
The overall objectives of this randomized trial are to test an intervention designed to improve coordination/continuity of care between primary care providers (PCPs) and cancer specialist providers (CSPs), and to improve patient experience with regards to patients' perceived continuity of care. Participants will be patients at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre in any one of three phases of the cancer continuum: diagnosis (colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer), active treatment (breast or prostate cancer) or survivorship (breast or colorectal cancer). The intervention involves a secure online eConsultation system that will allow PCPs and CSPs to communicate about their patient. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 1) intervention group whereby their PCP and CSP will use a cancer-specific modification of the eConsultation system (eOncoNote) in addition to usual methods of communication or 2) control group receiving usual care (i.e. usual methods of communication such as telephone, fax, mailed consultation letters and progress notes). Randomization and outcomes will be at the level of the individual patient. The primary outcome is patients' perception of team/cross-boundary continuity. Secondary outcomes include measures of patients' anxiety and depression, and patients' experience of the care process. Qualitative methods including interviews with patients, PCPs, CSPs, and cancer system managers will also be conducted.
