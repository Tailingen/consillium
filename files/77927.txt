LCI-HEM-SPEC-001: Tissue Collection for Genetic Analysis of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to obtain high quality specimens for molecular studies for the identification and characterization of genetic mutations involved in the pathogenesis of familial myeloid malignancies. Specimens obtained will be de-identified, linked to basic clinical data, and sent to Washington University (Division of Oncology, St. Louis, MO) for molecular analyses. Some specimens sent to Washington University may also be used for quality control analyses.

Number of participants with the mutation for acute myelogenous leukemia., 60 months
This is a specimen collection study for patients receiving standard of care treatment for AML. Specimens collected will be 1) bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, 2) peripheral blood, 3) skin punch biopsy, and 4) oral rinse. Collection of these specimens will be at timepoints determined by the patient's standard of care and their physician Investigator.
