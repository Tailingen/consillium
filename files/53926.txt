Fusion Imaging Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound LI-RADS
CEUS LI-RASD apply to lesion visible at precontrast ultrasound but not the lesion invisible. Fusion imaging can use to invisible lesions at precontrast ultrasound in clinical practice. Thus, our aim is to explore the application value of CEUS LI-RADS in contrast-enhanced fusion imaging for focal liver lesions that are not visible on conventional ultrasound in high-risk patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fusion imaging contrast-enhanced ultrasound
Positive predictive value, The positive predictive value = HCC in LR-5 /all lesions in LR-5, 6 months
The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS LR-5, The sensitivity and specificity are calculated., 6 months
