AZD4205 in Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (JACKPOT27)
This is a phase II, open label, multicenter study of AZD4205 administered orally in participants with r/r PTCL to determine its safety, tolerability, PK, and anti-tumor activity. Eligible participants are those who had pathologically confirmed PTCL and have relapsed after or been refractory/intolerant to at least one prior systemic treatment regimen. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of AZD4205 at 150 mg once daily (RP2D) in participants with r/r PTCL. The safety, tolerability, and PK of AZD4205 in r/r PTCL at RP2D will also be investigated.
