Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of FT538, The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FT538 monotherapy when administered via intraperitoneal (IP) catheter and in combination with intravenous (IV) enoblituzumab in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

Monitor the patient for signs of acute infusion related reaction during and after IP infusion. For IV infusion signs of a possible reaction are rigors and chills, rash, urticaria, hypotension, dyspnea, and angioedema., 48 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as number of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy divided by the total number of patients who received treatment., 72 months|Determine progression-free survival (PFS), Number of participants experiencing progression free survival at one year follow up, 72 months|Adverse Events, Number of participants experiencing adverse events with the combination of Enoblituzumab and FT538, 72 months
Tumor biopsies (if feasible) at the time of catheter placement and catheter removal for study related analysis, Tumors will be biopsied to assess tumor microenvironment., 72 months
