An Engineered Sirpα Fused to Anti-Pd-L1 And Tgf-β Fusion Protein (HCB301) in Subjects With Selected Advanced Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out whether IV injection of HCB301 is an effective treatment for different types of advanced solid tumors and relapsed and refractory classical Hodgkin lymphomas and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur in subjects aged 18 years old and above.

CD47 receptor occupancy on circulating red blood cells (RBCs), CD47 receptor occupancy on circulating red blood cells (RBCs) will be measured as an indication of target engagement., 12 months|Concentration of potential PD biomarkers in participants will be assess., Changes in CD47 receptor occupancy on circulating CD3+ T cells and TGFβ1, 2, 3 will be assessed after HCB301 treatment., 12 months|ctDNA detection, ctDNA detection in participants using next-generation sequencing (NGS )., 12 months
This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study. This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), preliminary efficacy, and identification of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HCB301 intravenous injection in adults with advanced solid tumors or relapsed and refractory classical Hodgkin lymphomas.

Eligible subjects must have failed standard therapies, been intolerable, or been considered medically inappropriate by the investigator. Subjects will be treated until unacceptable AEs, radiographic or clinical documented disease progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or termination of the study, whichever occurs first.
