Autoimmune Cytopenia and BcR Inhibitors
Efficacy of BCR Inhibitors in the Treatment of Autoimmune Cytopenias Associated with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): A Retrospective Analysis of the French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO)
Autoimmune Cytopenia Associated With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: ibrutinib ou idelalisib
Efficacy of B-cell receptor inhibitors on autoimmune cytopenia (AIC), Regarding autoimmune cytopenias, the responses to treatments were defined as such:

Complete answer

* hemoglobin level\> 120 g/l without transfusion
* AND platelet count\> 100 G/l
* AND reticulocytes \<100 G/l
* AND normal LDH level Partial answer
* hemoglobin \<120 g/l but with a gain of 2 g/l, without transfusion
* OR hemoglobin\> 120 g/l with reticulocytes\> 100 G/l and or high LDH
* OR hemoglobin\> 120 g/l with reticulocytes and / or LDH levels not available
* AND OR platelet count between 50 and 100 G/l, 1 year
Efficacy of B-cell receptor inhibitors on the Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Regarding CLL, the responses were defined according to the IWCLL 2008 criteria. Due to the absence of a medullary assessment biopsy, patients presenting the complete clinical and biological response criteria will be considered in a complete clinical response., 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS) of the autoimmune cytopenia, Progression Free Survival (PFS) of the autoimmune cytopenia, 1 year|PFS of the Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, PFS of the Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 year|Event Free Survival (EFS), Event Free Survival (EFS), 1 year|Time to next treatment (TTNT), Time to next treatment (TTNT), 1 year|Toxicity profile, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 1 year|Overall survival, Overall survival, 1 year
The investigators of the study propose a card of data collection, validated by the scientific council of the group FILO.

The data to be collected are entered on an e-CRF made available to the investigators on a secure site.

The main data collected are as follows

* anonymized demographic data
* Clinical and Biological Data of CLL at Diagnosis
* Previous treatments of LLC and CAI
* clinical and laboratory data at the time of initiation of BCRi treatment
* response to treatment with BCRi
* tolerance to BCRi treatment
* Progression under treatment with BCRi
* Recent news
