Evaluation of TaiHao Breast Ultrasound Diagnosis Software RN-CES Descartes
A standard of truth "SOT" is determined based on the interpretation results of the case data by interpretation experts, and the SOT is compared with the detection results of this program's function for detecting suspected breast cancer (CADe function). Estimate the detectability of the CADe function by comparing.
