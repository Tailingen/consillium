Impact of Chemotherapy on Ovarian Reserve in Young Women With Breast Cancer
The aim of this protocol is to study the deleterious impact of adjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy on ovarian reserve in young women suffering from breast cancer. A new relevant ovarian reserve marker, serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone, will be used in order to evaluate precisely the impact of chemotherapy on ovaries during chemotherapy administrations and after during follow-up (24 months). This strategy offers 2 main advantages : no modification of the traditional care of patients (treatment, organisation, follow up ...) and use of a non invasive marker (serum). The final objective is to give precise information to patients on their future fertility after remission.
