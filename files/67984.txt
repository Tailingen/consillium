Acceptability of Active Monitoring (AM) as a Treatment Option for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a decision support tool for patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
BEHAVIORAL: Decision Support Tool with Active Monitoring|BEHAVIORAL: Decision Support Tool without Active Monitoring
Number of Participants Who Chose Active Monitoring (AM)., Presented to participants as a categorical item: active monitoring (AM), lumpectomy, lumpectomy with radiation, mastectomy. Recorded for analysis as binary: AM vs non-AM., Up to 1 hour
Number of Participants Who Found the Treatment Option Acceptable., Acceptability was ascertained using 1-5 Likert scale.

Perceived risk was asked for active monitoring only, and was anchored at 1="Not at all risky" and 5="Very risky". The outcome was dichotomized using responses of 4 or 5 to represent "Risky"., Up to 1 hour|Number of Participants Who Chose Mastectomy., Presented to participants as a categorical item: active monitoring, lumpectomy, lumpectomy with radiation, mastectomy.

Single score derived from 4 items, each scored as correct or incorrect. Correct answers are summed for a total "graph literacy score" (0-4)., Up to 1 hour|Medical Maximizer Minimizer Scale (Scherer et al., 2020), Measured post-tool as categorical 6-point Likert scale from "I strongly lean toward waiting and seeing" (1) to "I strongly lean toward taking action" (6); analyzed as continuous variable., Up to 1 hour|Attitude Toward Risk (Zhang et al., 2019), Measured post-tool as an 8-item scale, each item elicited on a 5-point Likert scale from "Strongly disagree" (1) to "Strongly agree" (5)., Up to 1 hour|Pain Tolerance (McCracken et al., 1992; Two Questions From Each Subscale), Measured post-tool as an 4-item scale, each item elicited on a 6-point Likert scale from "Never" (0) to "Always" (5)., Up to 1 hour|Importance of Appearance (Borzekowski et al., 2000), Measured post-tool as a 4-item scale, each item elicited on a 6-point Likert scale from "Not at all important compared to other things in my life" (1) to "The very most important thing in my life" (6)., Up to 1 hour|Cancer Fear (Lerman Worry Scale, 1991), Measured post-tool as a 3-item scale, each item elicited on a 5-point Likert scale from "Not at all" (1) to "Almost all the time" (5), Up to 1 hour|Current Health: Visual Analog Scale (Adapted From EQ-5D-3L, EuroQol Group, 1990), Self-reported health status (visual analog scale, 0-100)., Up to 1 hour
Today, guideline concordant care options for patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are lumpectomy (with or without radiation treatment) and mastectomy, with optional endocrine therapy. Several ongoing trials are evaluating the safety of active monitoring (AM) as an alternative to immediate surgery for select patient groups. Little is known about women's acceptability of AM after a diagnosis with DCIS.

Here the study team seeks to answer the question: if AM is found to be a safe alternative to immediate surgery, how likely are women to choose it as their first course of treatment?

In this study, women are asked to imagine having recently been diagnosed with DCIS. For some in the intervention arm, in-depth information about surgical options and AM are presented with a web-based decision support tool. After exploring the decision support tool, participants are asked to make a hypothetical treatment choice and to answer a series of additional questions about their decision-making process and personal preferences. Women in the control arm receive a reduced version of the decision support tool that only provides in-depth information about the surgical options (AM is mentioned as an experimental approach).

The overarching hypothesis of this study is that patients who are offered AM as a guideline-concordant care option (a potential future scenario if ongoing trials confirm the safety of AM) are more likely to choose it compared to women in current clinical practice (who receive information about surgical options only).

Primary research question: Compared to presenting active monitoring (AM) as an experimental option, does presenting AM as a guideline-concordant care option increase its uptake as treatment choice?

Secondary research questions: Compared to presenting active monitoring (AM) as an experimental option, does presenting active monitoring as a guideline-concordant care option increase AM acceptability, decrease perceived AM riskiness, and decrease uptake of mastectomy as treatment choice?
