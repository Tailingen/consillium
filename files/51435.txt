Evaluate Eribulin ORA in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a nonrandomized, open-label, dosed escalation, safety activity, and PK study to determine the MTD and optimal dosing regimen of Eribulin ORA.
Solid Tumor
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Eribulin ORA
Dose Escalation: Maximum Tolerated Dose, Occurrence of Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in all patients who received at lest one dose of Eribulin ORA., 3 weeks|Dose Expansion: Occurrence of Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse, Evaluate the occurrence of Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events to assess the safety of Eribulin IV or Eribulin ORA., 6 weeks
Dose Escalation: Safety, Occurrence of adverse events in all patients who signed the informed consent ., Up to 24 months|Dose Escalation: Bioavailability, Pharmacokinetic analysis of Area Under the Curve (AUC), Time to Maximum Effect (Tmax), and Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) will be done to determine bioavailability of Eribulin IV or Eribulin Ora in all patients who received at least one dose of Eribulin ORA., Up to 24 months|Dose Escalation: Tumor Response, Evaluate objective tumor response rate for confirmed Partial, Stable, Complete Response, or Progression Disease in all patients who receive at lease one dose of Eribulin IV or Eribulin ORA., up to 24 months
This is a multicenter, open-label safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and activity study. Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid tumors.

Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of Eribulin ORA on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21 day cycle and will be followed for toxicity. If non linearity in PK is observed, additional subjects will be added with study drug administered on Day 1 and 8 once every three weeks cycle. Subjects who tolerate the study drug and have stable disease or better response will be eligible to receive ongoing treatment.
