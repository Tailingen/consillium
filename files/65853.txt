Study of Vismodegib in Combination With Temozolomide Versus Temozolomide Alone in Patients With Medulloblastomas With an Activation of the Sonic Hedgehog Pathway
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of vismodegib in combination with temozolomide (primary objective - phase I) and to estimate the efficacy of vismodegib in combination with temozolomide in adult patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory medulloblastomas to standard therapy measured by the 6-month progression-free rate (phase II).

This study is an open-label Phase I/II, international, randomized.

38 patients will be included in the study.
Histologically Confirmed Medulloblastoma|Activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) Pathway
DRUG: vismodegib|DRUG: Temozolomide
To evaluate the safety of a fixed dose of vismodegib in combination with (phase I)temozolomide in adult patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory to standard therapy medulloblastoma, number of severe toxicities occurring during the first 3 months of follow-up :

* Toxic death
* Grade 4 toxicity
* Any grade 3 AE leading to study treatment interruption for more than 7 days or discontinuation., during the first three months follow up|To estimate the efficacy of vismodegib in combination with temozolomide in adult patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory to standard therapy medulloblastoma (phase II), the 6-month progression-free rate, 6 months after start of treatment
To collect preliminary results on the 6-month progression-free rate of the combination vismodegib + temozolomide (phase I), measurement of progression free rate, 6 months after start of treatment|To estimate in the two study arms the objective response rate after 6 months of treatment (phase II), measure by objective response rate, after 6 months of treatment|To estimate in the two study arms the duration of treatment response (phase II), treatment response, one year|To estimate in the two study arms the best overall response obtained during the study (phase II), one year|To estimate in the two study arms the progression-free survival (PFS)(phase II), measure of progression free rate, one year|To estimate in the two study arms the time to treatment failure (phase II), one year|frequency of adverse events based on the common toxicity criteria (CTC-AE-V4.0) grade, In the combination arm (vismodegib + temozolomide): to further evaluate the safety of the combination, one year
Secondary objectives are :

phase I : to collect preliminary results on the 6-month progression-free rate of the combination vismodegib + temozolomide

PHASE II

To estimate in the two study arms:

* the objective response rate (Complete response + Partial Response according to WHO criteria) after 6 months of treatment
* the duration of treatment response
* the best overall response obtained during the study
* the progression-free survival (PFS)
* the time to progression (TTP)
* the time to treatment failure (TTF)
* In the combination arm (vismodegib + temozolomide): to further evaluate the safety of the combination.
