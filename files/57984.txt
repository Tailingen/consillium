A Phase II Evaluation of Afatinib in Patients With Persistent or Recurrent HER2-positive Uterine Serous Carcinoma
Primary Objective: To assess the activity of Afatinib in patients with persistent or recurrent uterine serous carcinoma overexpressing HER2/neu with the frequency of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating therapy. Secondary Objectives: To assess objective response rate and durable disease control rate. To assess overall survival. To assess the safety profile of Afatinib in uterine serous carcinoma patients.
HER2/Neu+ Uterine Serous Carcinoma
DRUG: Afatinib
Progression free survival, Progression free survival for at least 6 months after initiating therapy, 4 Years
The safety profile of Afatinib in USPC patients by CTCAE v4.0, 4 Years
Exploratory/correlative objectives: To systematically evaluate HER2/neu expression/amplification using standardized scoring criteria for both breast and gastric cancer and correlate clinical response in uterine serous carcinoma patients with HER2/neu scoring results. To correlate objective response rate, PFS and overall survival with the presence/absence of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit and F-box/WD repeat-containing protein mutations by standard Sanger sequencing, and presence/absence of Cyclin E2 overexpression by IHC in endometrial cancer patients overexpressing HER2/neu treated with Afatinib. To study HER2/neu extracellular domain circulating levels in the plasma of uterine serous carcinoma patients overexpressing HER2/neu before and during Afatinib treatment to elucidate whether changes in HER2/neu extracellular domain would predict response to Afatinib and to determine peripheral blood natural killer cell numbers and activity in HER2/neu+ uterine serous carcinoma patients before and during Afatinib treatment to assess the possible therapeutic contributions of immune mechanisms of action of Afatinib.
