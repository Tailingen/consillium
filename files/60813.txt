Study of SOR007 Ointment for Actinic Keratosis
A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, dose rising study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of four concentrations of SOR007 (Uncoated Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel) Ointment (SOR007) compared to SOR007 ointment vehicle applied to actinic keratosis (AK) lesions on the face twice daily for up to 28 days.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: SOR007 (Uncoated Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel) Ointment|OTHER: SOR007 Ointment Vehicle
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment emergent adverse events including all reported adverse events, laboratory assessments, physical examination findings, and vital signs., 56 days
Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of SOR007, Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were taken on Day 1 at 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h post application; on Day 8, Day 15, and Day 21 after the first daily application; and on Day 28 at 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 12h after the first daily application., 28 days|Pharmacokinetics: Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of SOR007, Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were taken on Day 1 at 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h post application; on Day 8, Day 15, and Day 21 after the first daily application; and on Day 28 at 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 12h after the first daily application., 28 days|Pharmacokinetics: Time at Which Peak Plasma Concentration is Observed (Tmax) of SOR007, Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were taken on Day 1 at 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h post application; on Day 8, Day 15, and Day 21 after the first daily application; and on Day 28 at 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 12h after the first daily application., 28 days|Percent Change in Number of AK Lesions, AK lesions in the target test field were photographed and tracings were created at baseline and at subsequent visits to track whether lesions were clear or still present., Baseline and 56 days|Percent Change in Size of AK Lesions, Percent change in size of AK lesions was determined with measurements obtained at Baseline and 56 days. A measurement was also obtained at Day 28, but was not used to calculated percent change for the purposes of this outcome measure., Baseline and 56 days
In this Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, dose rising trial, subjects with actinic keratosis will receive topical application of SOR007 Ointment (in four concentrations) or SOR007 Ointment vehicle to the face twice daily for up to 28 days. Subjects will be enrolled in four dose-escalating cohorts of eight subjects and randomized to SOR0007 or Ointment vehicle in a ratio of 3:1. Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration.

Safety will be assessed in an ongoing manner and formal safety reviews will be conducted four times for each cohort: at Day 8, Day 15, Day 21, and Day 28 for the last subject enrolled in each cohort. The next dose level cohort will enroll upon a finding of safety and tolerability at the previous cohort's second (Day 15) safety review.

The safety and tolerability of SOR007 will be demonstrated by local toxicity, adverse events, laboratory assessments and vital signs. Subjects will be observed for reduction in the number of AK lesions to determine preliminary efficacy. Plasma samples will be taken at various time points throughout the study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of SOR007.
