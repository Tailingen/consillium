A Study of AK104, a PD-1/CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody in Subjects With Recurrent/Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This is a Phase 2, global, multicenter, open label, single arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and immunogenicity of AK104 monotherapy in adult subjects with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical carcinoma.
