Immune Checkpoint Inhibition With Lurbinectedin Relapsed/Recurrent SCLC
This is a single-arm, phase I/II trial to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), and the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab-ipilimumab plus lurbinectedin in patients with relapsed/recurrent small cell lung cancer after progression with first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy

DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Lurbinectedin
Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Lurbinectedin with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab, Maximum tolerated Dose will be determined by testing increasing doses of Lurbinectedin along with fixed doses of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab., Up to 12 weeks per cohort|Phase II: Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as Complete Response (CR) +Partial Response (PR) +Stable Disease (SD). Best response time will be used for this measurement., Up to 12 months
Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate is defined as Complete Response + Partial Response using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from enrollment to date of progression or death, or censor at last clinical follow-up date., Up to 12 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from study enrollment to death from any cause., Up to 12 months
Study was originally designed as a Phase I/II but was terminated during the Phase I portion due to dose limiting toxicities.
