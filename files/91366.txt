Assessment of Tobacco Smoking and Alcohol Drinking and Treatment Outcomes Among Patients With Lung or Head and Neck Cancer
The overarching goal of the proposed study is to provide information which can lead to effective implementation of cessation support in the care of smokers diagnosed with lung or head \& neck cancer.

To achieve these aims, the study propose to conduct a longitudinal cohort study of patients diagnosed with lung or head \& neck cancer at the Hospices Civils de Lyon (SMALLHAN). Briefly, adult patients newly diagnosed with lung or head \& neck cancer will be recruited at the time of diagnosis (announcement of diagnosis and consultation).
