Study Investigating Intravesical HDAC Inhibition to Improve Response to Immuno-Oncology Agents
In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant combination using intravesical romidepsin and durvalumab in cisplatin-ineligible patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Romidepsin|DRUG: Durvalumab
Romidepsin Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD will be estimated using isotonic regression based on observed DLT from all DLT-evaluable patients., Up to 28 days
Pathological Response, Pathologic response is defined as \<pT2N0 disease at the time of RC (e.g. pT0N0, pT1N0, pTaN0, or pTisN0)., Up to 1 year|Pathologic complete response (pCR), Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as achievement of pT0N0 disease at RC., Up to 1 year|Relapse-free survival (RFS), Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as the duration of time from time of RC to time of documented disease relapse or recurrence after RC, or death from any cause., Up to 1 year
