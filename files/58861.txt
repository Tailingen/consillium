Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Followed by NALIRIFOX vs NALIRIFOX for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This multicentric open-label trial will compare the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by NALIRIFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan liposome injection and oxaliplatin) vs NALIRIFOX for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC).
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan liposome injection|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|RADIATION: SBRT
R0 resection rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who have achieved R0 resection., 4 months
Objective Response Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, 3 months|Surgical Conversion Rate (R0 / R1 resection), Defined as the percentage of patients that underwent a R0/R1 resection., 4 months|Tumor regression grade, The classification is mainly based on the proportion of residual tumors and fibrosis in the primary tumor, used to evaluate the patient's response to neoadjuvant therapy and predict prognosis., 4 months|Event-free Survival, Defined as the time between signing the informed consent form to the first documentation of 1) disease progression (local recurrence, new lesions or distant metastasis), 2) a second malignant tumor occurs, or 3) death due to any cause., 1 year|Overall survival, Defined as the time between signing the informed consent form and death due to various causes., 2 years|Incidence of adverse events, Use NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 for classification and grading., 7 months
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy can increase the R0 resection rate and improve survival in BRPC. However, there is no standard treatment regimen. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend FOLFIRINOX (irinotecan + oxaliplatin +5-FU/LV) and FOLFIRINOX+ chemoradiotherapy for PDAC neoadjuvant treatment.

Liposomal irinotecan is a new pharmaceutical form of traditional irinotecan. It adopts a special loading technology to encapsulate traditional irinotecan in liposomes, which can avoid its hydrolysis under physiological conditions, increase the affinity with cancer cells, overcome drug resistance, increase the drug uptake by cancer cells, reduce the drug dose,improve the efficacy and reduce the toxic side effects. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of NALIRIFOX + surgery + NALIRIFOX or surgery + NALIRIFOX in high-risk patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.
