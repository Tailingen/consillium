Short-term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy in Serious Physical Illness
Life-threatening physical illness may powerfully re-activate existential conflict. There is little evidence to date on the effectiveness of relationship-focused therapies in this patient group.The aim of this study is to pilot a psychodynamic treatment for patients with advanced cancer and high psychological distress.

Severely physically ill patients may experience existential distress symptoms including helplessness, hopelessness, death anxiety, perceived burdensomeness and a sense of pointlessness. The latter can significantly interfere with end-of-life care processes and outcomes (receipt of treatment according to preferences, expression of desire for hastened death). So far, empirically tested psychotherapeutic programs in advanced life-threatening illness have predominantly been ultra-short and applied supportive and resource-oriented techniques. Psychodynamic treatment allows to address clinically significant existential distress through its conceptualization from early relational life experiences.

The aim of this study is to pilot a psychodynamic treatment for patients with advanced cancer and high psychological distress.The inverstigators will

1. analyse the feasibility of the treatment, and
2. investigate changes in process- and patient-relevant outcomes over the course of the treatment

The inverstigators will conduct a single-group pre-post study with five assessment points in which 50 adult patients diagnosed with advanced cancer will receive a manualized psychodynamic short-term therapy. Target parameters are assessed by diagnostic interviews, focus interviews, self-assessment questionnaires as well as electronic patient records. For research objective b) the investigators will compare the intervention group with a matched comparison group of a longitudinal cohort sample (NCT04600206). Matching will be based on stress level, demographic, and medical parameters across the 5 assessment points.
