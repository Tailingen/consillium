A Feasibility Study On Continuous Adaptive [18f]Fdg-Pet-Guided Radiotherapy For Head and Neck Cancer
Treatment adaptation to biological and anatomical changes occurring during treatment can increase the chance of cure at minimized radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients. This trial investigates the feasibility of using repetitive per-treatment \[18F\]FDG-PET acquired during treatment in adaptive \[18F\]FDG-PET-voxel intensity-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for head and neck cancer.

OTHER: repetitive per-treatment [18F]FDG-PET for treatment adaptation
To assess volume changes of the targets and organs at risk as detected by repetitive per-treatment [18F]FDG-PET/CT., at time of per-treatment [18F]FDG-PET/CT
