Bronchoscopic Lung Ablation of Small Thoracic Tumors: the Blastt Registry
To aggregate, integrate, and analyze data facilitating the study of MD Anderson patients with a known diagnosis of lung cancer or metastases to the lungs who undergo robotic assisted bronchoscopic ablation of peripheral tumors.
Thoracic Tumors
To aggregate, integrate, and analyze data facilitating the study of MD Anderson patients with a known diagnosis of lung cancer or metastases to the lungs who undergo robotic assisted bronchoscopic ablation of peripheral tumors., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
A. To aggregate, integrate, and analyze data facilitating the study of MD Anderson participants with a known diagnosis of lung cancer or metastases to the lungs who undergo robotic assisted bronchoscopic ablation of peripheral tumors.

B. To assess the intra-operative, peri-operative, and long-term safety outcomes of robotic assisted bronchoscopic ablation of peripheral lung tumors.

C. To evaluate different oncologic outcomes including local tumor progression (LTP) by RECIST criteria, local tumor progression free survival (LTPFS), progression free-survival (PFS), disease (cancer) specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS).

D. To provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of radiographic findings of bronchoscopically ablated lung tumors over time.

E. To evaluate tumor and participant-related risk factors that may be associated with safety (bleeding, pneumothorax, and local infection) and oncologic outcomes (LTPFS, PFS, DSS, and OS).
