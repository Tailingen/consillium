Study of Ipilimumab and Dasatinib Combination Therapy in Patients With Chronic or Accelerated Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of ipilimumab and dasatinib combination therapy in patients with CML
Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic
BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab
To evaluate the safety of ipilimumab in combination with dasatinib in CML patients with a loss of previously achieved major molecular response or a loss of previously achieved cytogenetic response to dasatinib, At weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38
To evaluate the frequency of molecular response, complete cytogenetic response and an overall efficacy signal response rate, At weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38|To explore the immunologic responses to combination therapy with ipilimumab and dasatinib, At weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38|To explore whether molecular responses to combination therapy with ipilimumab and dasatinib correlate with immunologic responses, At weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of ipilimumab and dasatinib combination therapy in patients with CML
