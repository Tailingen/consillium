The Efficacy and Safety of KN046 Combined With Axitinib
Evaluation of the efficacy of KN046 combined with acitinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for resectable NSCLC through primary pathological response rate and surgical resection rate
NSCLC
DRUG: KN046 plus Axitinib
MPR, MPR is defined as the presence of ≤ 10% of active tumor cells in postoperative pathology (primary lesion)., one month within postsurgery|Surgical resection rate, Surgical resection rate: refers to the proportion of subjects who completed the surgery according to the plan, defined as the distance from the last neoadjuvant treatment administration, and the surgical time ≤ 6 weeks., six weeks after last cycle of neoadjuvant therapy
Complication rate, The incidence and severity of AE (classified according to CTCAE v5.0), severity, and their relationship with experimental treatment; Any abnormal results of laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations;, three months within postsurgery|pCR, PCR is defined as postoperative pathology (primary lesion) showing the absence of viable tumor cells, one month within postsurgery|ORR, Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, one month within postsurgery
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of major pathological remission (MPR) with preoperative use of KN046 versus axitinib, and thus to assess the efficacy of KN046 in combination with axitinib in patients with Stage IB-IIIB (Stage IIIB only T3N2M0) NSCLC (according to the 8th edition of the AJCC classification) who are scheduled to undergo surgery. Eligible subjects for this study were candidates for surgery for resectable stage IB-IIIB (stage IIIB only T3N2M0) NSCLC as judged by the investigator, with no evidence of distant metastases as assessed, and no evidence of unresectable local regional tumour extension.
