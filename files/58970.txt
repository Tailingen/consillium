Effect of Genetic Polymorphisms on Platinum Based Chemotherapy in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This Study evaluate the effect of Polymorphism in the Excision repair cross-complementing group 5 (ERCC5) (rs1047768 and rs751402) gene on the clinical outcome of Platinum-based regimens used in the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
Progression-free survival (PFS), It's defined as the time from day 1 of chemotherapy to the day of documented disease progression or death from any cause., From the date of starting the chemotherapy until the date of documented disease progression or date of death from any cause assessed up to 12 months
