Effects of Immunonutrition (Impact Oral®) in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Gastrointestinal Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Impact Oral in Patients undergoing Surgery for Gastrointestinal Cancer, half of the participants will receive Impact Oral nutrition therapy, the other half will receive Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) therapy.

The present protocol describes a randomized, active-controlled, open labelled study in which either IMPACT Oral or Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) will be given to surgical patients for 5 days before surgery and 7 days after surgery. Both of the study products include immunonutrition, but the nutrient proportion is different.

Prealbumin, C-reaction protein (CRP), Albumin，immunology parameters, the results of physical examination, vital signs, relevant nutrition- and safety-related laboratory parameters and the number, severity, seriousness, relatedness and outcome of Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated in this study.
