A Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of GDC-7035 as a Single Agent and in Combination in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human Phase I/II, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of GDC-7035 as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that harbor the KRAS G12D mutation.
