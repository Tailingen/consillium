Intercalated Administration of PamCis With Gefitinib or Placebo as First Line Lung Adenocarcinoma in Never Smokers
Intercalated administration of Iressa® (gefitinib) on days 5-18 of chemotherapy cycle improve the efficacy of Pemetrexed/platinum regimen given as first-line treatment for never-smokers with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma.

Investigators believe this PFS curve crossing-over in both IPASS and First-SIGNAL study is mainly due to early progression of EGFR mutation-negative tumors after gefitinib alone. Taken together with the FASTACT trial results, this PFS curve crossing-over may well be averted if effective chemotherapy is given together with gefitinib in a most optimum timing and sequence. Apparently, timing of EGFR-TKI administration within chemotherapy cycles is very critical, as shown in OSI 9774 trial.

In this placebo-controlled randomized phase II, Investigators propose to give gefitinib on days 5-18 of a 3-weekly chemotherapy cycle of pemetrexed/cisplatin to avoid any potential overlap of EGFR-TKI effects on chemotherapy or vice versa. Investigators would like to generate promising pilot data, which warrants a large phase III trial. Investigators hope to show that intercalated administration of Iressa® (gefitinib) and Pemetrexed/platinum regimen improves the outcome of never-smokers with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma.
