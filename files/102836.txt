Clinical Study of Pan-cancer DNA Methylation Test in Plasma
We intend to establish an efficient method for plasma cfDNA extraction and Bisulfite transformation to facilitate the detection of DNA methylation status using multiplex fluorescence PCR. Meanwhile, we expect to identify several plasma methylation markers that can be highly sensitive for multi-cancer detection. Finally, we will provide a pan-cancer blood test that is easy to operate, low cost, accurate and easy to promote.
