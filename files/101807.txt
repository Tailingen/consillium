Communication About Sexual Health in Gynecologic Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if an educational video and workbook can help gynecologic cancer patients talk to their cancer providers about sexual health concerns.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Do gynecologic cancer patients who take part in the educational program and get a resource booklet talk to their cancer clinicians more about sexual health concerns than patients who get a resource booklet alone?
2. Do gynecologic cancer patients who take part in the educational program and get a resource booklet have better sexual function and less anxiety and depression than patients who get a resource booklet alone?

Researchers will compare those who get the educational program and the resource booklet to those who get the resource booklet alone.

Participants will:

1. Fill out a consent form and survey
2. Have their next clinic visit audio recorded
3. Fill out another survey right after their clinic visit
4. Fill out a final survey 6 months after their clinic visit
