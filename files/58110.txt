Combination Immunotherapy Plus Standard-of-Care Chemotherapy Versus Standard-of-Care Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase 2, three-cohort (2 randomized and 1 single-arm), open-label study to evaluate the comparative efficacy and overall safety of standard-of-care chemotherapy versus standard-of-care chemotherapy in combination with aldoxorubicin HCl, N-803, and PD-L1 t-haNK in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Each treatment setting (ie, first line maintenance, second line, or third line or greater) will be evaluated independently as a separate cohort.
