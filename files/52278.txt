A Single-Arm, Open, Exploratory Clinical Study of Pemigatinib in the Treatment of HER2-negative Advanced Breast Cancer Patients With FGFR Alterations
This study is a prospective single-arm phase II clinical study. HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients with FGFR 1-3 alterations who have failed standard therapy will be enrolled in this study once they have signed the informed consent form (ICF) and been identified as eligible in screening. The patients will receive 13.5 mg of pemigatinib once a day (QD) orally following a 2-week administration/1-week interruption regimen. They will be dosed until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. During treatment, clinical tumor imaging evaluation will be performed according to RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks (± 7 days) and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) after week 48. Safety will be assessed according to NCI-CTCAE 5.0.
