Study of Postoperative Concurrent Chemo-radiation With Capecitabine in Elderly Rectal Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to seek the proper dose of capecitabine in post-operative concurrent chemotherapy for stage II/III elderly rectal cancer patients receiving radical surgery, and evaluate the toleration of this modality in such patients.

For those "younger" locally advanced (stage II/III) rectal cancer patients (usually means patients less than 70), it is suggested that after radical surgery, patients should receive concurrent chemo-radiation. Capecitabine is a widely used chemotherapy medicine under such condition. Based on experience, the investigators think this modality can also be tolerated by patients over 70, and will increase local control rate as which has been proved in younger ones. As the first step to test this hypothesis, we designed this phase I study to seek the proper dose of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapy medicine, in postoperative concurrent chemo-radiation for stage II/III rectal cancer patients over 70, and to evaluate the safety of this modality in this group of patients.
