A Study of APG-1252 in Patients With SCLC or Other Solid Tumors
APG-1252 is a highly potent Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor, a promising drug candidate which shown high binding affinities to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. The preclinical studies have shown that APG-1252 alone achieves complete and persistent tumor regression in multiple tumor xenograft models with a twice weekly or weekly dose-schedule, including SCLC, colon, breast and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cancer xenografts; achieves strong synergy with the chemotherapeutic agents, indicating that APG-1252 may have a broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer as a single agent and in combination with other classes of anticancer drugs. APG-1252 is intended for the treatment of patients with SCLC or other solid tumors.

This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation Phase I study to determine the MTD and DLTs of intravenously administered APG-1252. After dose escalation to 240mg twice weekly, 2 dose cohorts two different dosing schedules including weekly and twice weekly will be assessed to evaluate for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy. Treatment with APG-1252 will be administered to 30-60 patients at approximately 2 investigational sites in US.

DRUG: APG-1252
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determination, Number of participants with APG-1252 treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.03, 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determination, If â‰¥ 2/6 patients develop a DLT at any dose level, then this dose will be declared as the MTD, 18 - 24 months
Pharmacokinetic evaluation, Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed on all participants with APG-1252 treatments, 18 - 24 months|Pharmacokinetic evaluation, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be assessed on all participants with APG-1252 treatments, 18 - 24 months|Pharmacodynamic evaluation, Platelet counts will be measured on the participants with APG-1252 treatments, 18-24 months|Pharmacodynamic evaluation, Bcl-2 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be measured on the participants with APG-1252 treatments, 18-24 months|Pharmacodynamic evaluation, Activation of apoptosis will be measured on the participants with APG-1252 treatments, 18-24 months|Preliminary efficacy assessment, Patients will be evaluated for response every 2 cycles (i.e., 8 weeks), according to the new response evaluation criteria in solid tumors: revised RECIST Guideline, Version 1.1, 18-24 months
In dose cohort 1, patients will be treated in cycles, which are defined by APG-1252 intravenous administration on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 and 22, over a 28-day cycle the start dose is 10mg.

After dose escalation to 240mg twice weekly in dose cohort 1, dose cohort 2 will be performed with dose cohort 1 parallelly, patients will be treated in the same 28-day-cycles, APG-1252 intravenous administration on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, the start dose is 240mg.

In both dose cohorts' patients could continue to receive cycles of APG-1252 until disease progress or unacceptable toxicity.

Study drug will be administered by intravenous infusion for 30 minutes at the investigational site by site staff.
