Microfluidic Device to Diagnose Leptomeningeal Metastasis in Breast Cancer
This study will prospectively enroll 36 evaluable subjects with breast cancer who are undergoing workup for clinical suspicion of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). Neuroimaging consisting of MRI of the brain or total spine (or both, as clinically indicated) will be obtained in all patients. Patients will also undergo a lumbar puncture and standard CSF evaluation, which may consist of intracranial pressure measurement, CSF protein, glucose, white and red cell analysis, infectious cultures, as well as conventional cytopathologic analysis (cytocentrifuge). An additional CSF sample will be obtained for evaluation of CSF CTCs by OncoCEETM technology and cell-free DNA (recommended amount: 1 tube, 10 mL) at the time of lumbar puncture.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a condition in which cancer cells seed the meninges and may go on to invade the brain parenchyma, spinal cord, cranial nerves or peripheral nerves. It is a devastating complication of breast cancer, and is often considered in the differential diagnosis when patients with breast cancer present with new neurologic symptoms. It was previously thought to be a rare occurrence, but autopsy series have shown the true overall incidence to be up to 8%. In fact, while the incidence of meningeal metastasis from other malignancies has decreased, the opposite is true of breast cancer, in which clinical evidence suggests an increasing incidence.
