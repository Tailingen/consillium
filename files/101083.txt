An Observational Study of Epoetin Beta (NeoRecormon) in Participants With Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy
This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of epoetin beta (NeoRecormon) in participants with symptomatic anemia and cancer receiving chemotherapy. Participants receiving NeoRecormon once weekly in accordance with the Summary of Product Characteristics will be followed for 4 months.
Anemia
DRUG: Epoetin beta
Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) Level From Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT), The change in Hb level from Baseline to the EOT visit at Month 4 was averaged among all participants and expressed in grams per liter (g/L)., Baseline, Month 4
Percentage of Participants by Change in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status From Baseline to EOT, ECOG performance status was determined at Baseline and at the EOT visit at Month 4. The assessment used a 3-point scale, including scores of 0 (fully active/able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction), 1 (restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory/able to carry out light or sedentary work), or 2 (ambulatory for more than 50% of waking hours and capable of all self care but unable to carry out any work activities). The traditional 6-point scale was not valid because only participants with a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 were eligible for the study. The percentage of participants by change in ECOG performance status was reported. For example, the percentage of participants with ECOG performance status of 0 at Baseline and 2 at EOT is shown in the table as "Baseline 0, EOT 2". Transition to a lower performance status indicates improved/increased independence., Baseline, Month 4|Percentage of Participants Who Required Blood Transfusions During the Study, The percentage of participants who required blood transfusions was reported at each assessment visit and was based on the 1-month period preceding the respective visit., Baseline to Month 1, Month 1 to 2, Month 2 to 3, Month 3 to 4
This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of epoetin beta (NeoRecormon) in participants with symptomatic anemia and cancer receiving chemotherapy. Participants receiving NeoRecormon once weekly in accordance with the Summary of Product Characteristics will be followed for 4 months.
