The data represents the percentage of patients., At screening and at the end of every other treatment course up to 527 days (= longest treatment exposure)|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death. PFS was assessed by tumour measurement and evaluated according to RECIST, version 1.0., At screening and at the end of every other treatment course up to 527 days (= longest treatment exposure)|Response Duration, The duration of overall response was measured from the time measurement criteria were met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whichever was recorded first, until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease was objectively documented. The duration of overall CR was measured from the time measurement criteria were first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease was objectively documented., From first drug administration up to at 3 month interval after final End of treatment visit until disease progression, death, or lost to follow-up, up to 548 days|Disease Control, The disease control (DC) presented are the percentage of patients with CR, PR or stable disease as best response throughout the study assessed by tumour measurement and evaluated according to RECIST, version 1.0., At screening and at the end of every other treatment course up to 527 days (= longest treatment exposure)|Sum of the Largest Diameters of Target Lesions, The individual time profile of the sum of the largest diameters of target lesions (LD) is presented graphically for each patient in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR) only. No descriptive statistics were planned., At screening and at the end of every other treatment course up to 527 days (= longest treatment exposure)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) AUC0-∞ of Volasertib, The PK of volasertib will be presented for the area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞) for the population attending the D1 schedule, the area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to 168 hours (AUC0-168) for the population attending the D1+ D8 schedule and the maximum measured concentration of volasertib in plasma (Cmax).
