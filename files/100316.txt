Biomarker Monitoring of Prostate Cancer Patients With RSI MRI (ProsRSI)
Adult male patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer and planning to undergo radiation therapy (RT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will undergo an advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination called Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI-MRI) to evaluate whether RSI-MRI can predict treatment response.

Biochemical recurrence (PSA 2 ng/mL greater than nadir) within 3 years of completing RT., To evaluate the performance of the RSI cellularity index before and during therapy as a biomarker to identify participants who will experience biochemical recurrence within 3 years post-radiotherapy., within 3 years of RT completion
PSA nadir within the 18 months after RT ≥0.5 ng/mL., To evaluate the performance of the RSI cellularity index for identifying participants who will fail to reach a PSA nadir \<0.5 ng/mL within 18 months of RT., within 18 months of RT completion
Participants will undergo RSI at three time points: before therapy (MRI #1), after neoadjuvant ADT (MRI #2), and after radiotherapy (MRI #3). Treatment response will be assessed primarily by absence of biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥2 ng/mL greater than nadir) within 3 years of completing radiotherapy. Change in RSI cellularity index from MRI #1 to MRI #2 will be evaluated for prediction of participants who will experience biochemical recurrence within 3 years, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We hypothesize that RSI cellularity index will be an early biomarker for treatment effectiveness in prostate cancer treated with ADT and radiotherapy.
