A Study of Probiotics Administration in the Immunotherapy of Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma
A study of the efficacy and safety of probiotics in immunotherapy of urothelial carcinoma.
Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Live Combined (Bifidobacterium,Lactobacillus and Enterococcus Capsules)
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from randomness to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., up to 3 years
Duration of Response (DOR), The time from the first judgment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the discovery of progressive disease （PD）., up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the number of days from study entry to death. Individuals who are alive at last contact will be censored on the date of last contact., up to 3 years|Serious Adverse Event (SAE), The adverse events that occurred in the study were difficult to manage., up to 3 years|Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy., up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of cases with remission and lesion stability after treatment in the number of evaluable cases., up to 3 years
16s rDNA sequencing, Identify the subgroups that are most likely to benefit from intestinal probiotic therapy., up to 3 years
To evaluate the progression free survival of intestinal probiotics in immunotherapy for urothelial carcinoma. Changes in fecal flora abundance before and after treatment were assessed to identify subjects most likely to benefit from enteric probiotics treatment.
