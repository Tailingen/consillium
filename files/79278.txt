A Novel Multiplex ELISA Assay for Surveilling Patients with History of Bladder Cancer
Voided urinary cytology (VUC) is the most widely used urine-based assay for detecting bladder cancer (BCa); however, it fails to detect approximately 50% of low-grade or early stage BCa when it is most curable. Furthermore, the detection rate of VUC for recurrent BCa is not much better. Because of this severe limitation, all patients who are under surveillance to monitor for recurrent BCa must undergo an invasive examination of the urinary bladder, where a miniature camera is inserted into the bladder and the bladder inspected (cystoscopy). We propose to improve the non-invasive detection of recurrent BCa by further validating a multiplex ELISA assay directed at a BCa-associated diagnostic signature in voided urine samples.
Bladder Cancer
Sensitivity and specificity of multiplex ELISA assay will be confirmed by cystoscopy., To examine the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex ELISA assay directed at a BCa-associated diagnostic signature in voided urine samples to reference standard of cystoscopy in a prospective longitudinal cohort of 300 participants with a history of BCa currently on cancer surveillance., 2 years
Sensitivity and specificity of multiplex ELISA assay will be compared to VUC and NMP22 BladderCheck., To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex ELISA assay to VUC and NMP22Â® BladderChek to reference standard of cystoscopy in this cohort.

To develop a BCa risk calculator from this cohort using cutting edge machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest) incorporating biomarker data and clinical data., 2 years
