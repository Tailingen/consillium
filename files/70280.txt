Learning Curve and Optimization of Robotic Gastrectomy
we explore the learning curve and the impact of technique optimization on surgical outcomes and the first to construct a referenceable learning phase for performing robotic gastric cancer surgery.
Gastric Cancer
The LN dissection rate, The LN dissection rate was defined as the number of the LN station was examined divided by the total number of retrieval LN station., 36 months
LN noncompliance, LN noncompliance was defined as the absence of LNs from more than 1 LN station., 30 days
