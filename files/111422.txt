A Global Phase III Study of Rilvegostomig or Pembrolizumab Monotherapy for First-Line Treatment of PD-L1-high Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of ARTEMIDE-Lung04 is to assess the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy as 1L treatment in participants with mNSCLC and whose tumors express PD-L1.
Carcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung

Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years
Landmark Overall Survival (OS) rates, OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Landmark Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rates, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, using RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression using RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years|Time to second progression or death (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest of the progression event (following the initial investigator-assessed progression event), after the start of the first subsequent therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years|Pharmakokinetics (PK) of rilvegostomig, Concentration of rilvegostomig in serum, Up to approximately 5 years|Immunogenicity of rilvegostomig, Presence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), titer, and neutralizing antibodies for rilvegostomig., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported physical functioning, Proportion of participants with maintained or improved physical functioning as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function - Short Form 8c - 7 day (PROMIS PF-SF 8c - 7 day) at each time point., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL), Time to deterioration (TTD) of GHS/QoL as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Item Library 172 (EORTC IL172).

This is a Phase III, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, global, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig compared to pembrolizumab as a 1L treatment for patients with mNSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1.
