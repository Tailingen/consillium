Safety and tolerability of artesunate ointment applied topically on VIN2/3 lesions as assessed by number of participants experiencing serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities, Number of participants with study-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) criteria, 15 weeks
Effect of artesunate ointment as assessed by number of participants with regression to VIN1 or less at week 15, Number of participants with histologic regression of HSIL/VIN2/3 to VIN1 or less on colposcopically-directed biopsy, at study week 15 after receiving artesunate ointment therapy., 15 weeks
Phase I open-label dose escalation study of topical artesunate, formulated as ointment, in the treatment of adult females with biopsy-confirmed HSIL VIN2/3. Fifteen (15) subjects will undergo up to a total of three cycles of topical artesunate. The first cycle will be initiated on Day 0, the second at Week 2, and the third and final cycle at week 4.

Primary Objective:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of artesunate ointment applied topically on VIN2/3 lesions

To measure the effect of artesunate ointment on histologic regression of HSIL/VIN2/3 to VIN1 or less, confirmed by a colposcopically-directed biopsy, at study week 15.
