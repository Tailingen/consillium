Study of LP002 in Combination With Chemotherapy for Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
LP002 is a highly selected recombinant humanized anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. This is a single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LP002 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with extensive stage samll cell lung cancer.
