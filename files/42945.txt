Initial Evaluation of a Telomerase-based Circulating Tumor Cell Assay in Bladder Cancer Cohorts
Purposes are to determine whether various cohorts of bladder cancer patients have detectable tCTC's, determine it tCTC levels vary with the natural history of bladder cancer and to see if tCTC's provide novel information.Study population are various cohorts of patients diangosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.Procedures include a venous blood draw, up to two times, over a 6 month period for collection of tCTC's. Up to 15 mL's of blood will be collected at each blood draw.
