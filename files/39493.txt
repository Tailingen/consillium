To evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human endostatin /PD-1 mab combined with first-line chemotherapy in the treatment of driver gene negative advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Endostatin
DRUG: Endostatin
Progression Free Survival, The time from the first date of first-line treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death., 1 year
objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate after the given treatment in patients accoeding to the evaluation criteria of RECIST1.1, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the start of first-line treatment to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) at the date of data cut-off., 1 year
This study is planned to enroll 38 eligible patients in China. Patients who fulfill all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive 4-6 cycles of endostatin combined with PD-1 antibody and platinum-containing two-drug chemotherapy.The efficacy of first-line treatment was evaluated every 6 weeks (2 cycles, 42 days). Patients with disease control (CR+ PR+SD) and tolerable adverse reactions were treated for 4-6 cycles,The maintenance treatment phase was continuous treatment with Endu combined with PD-1 antibody, and the efficacy was evaluated every 9 weeks until the end of the study when the investigator considered that the patient was not suitable for continued medication or the efficacy evaluation was disease progression (PD). No other antitumor therapy can be performed during the treatment period. Follow-up of survival was once every 3 months.
