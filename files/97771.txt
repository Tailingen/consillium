Lactobacillus in Preventing Infection in Patients Undergoing a Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Hematologic Cancer or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
RATIONALE: Probiotics, such as Lactobacillus, may be effective in preventing infections in patients with suppressed immune systems.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and how well giving enteral nutrition, including Lactobacillus, works in preventing infections in patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer or myelodysplastic syndrome.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG
Safety as indicated by the lack of infection attributable to probiotic organisms, 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if patients who are treated with a probiotic-containing diet develop infection with one of the probiotic microorganisms while undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy or myelodysplastic syndrome.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral Lactobacillus rhamosus GG (Culturelle DS) once daily beginning when blood counts have recovered without filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) support for 3 consecutive days and continuing for 1 year after transplantation.
