Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) accounts for 0.4%-14.2% of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. As imaging and pathological diagnostic techniques for liver tumors have improved, the detection rate of cHCC-CCA puncture biopsies and surgical procedures has increased. Oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy was previously recommended for the treatment of advanced cHCC-ICC, but its efficacy was not satisfactory. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have made breakthroughs in both advanced HCC and CCA, providing a new direction for exploration in the treatment of advanced cHCC-CCA. Currently, targeted combination immunotherapy has become the preferred first-line treatment strategy for advanced HCC. Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is also the preferred first-line treatment option for advanced CCA. To balance the treatment of HCC and ICC, this study further investigates the efficacy and safety of Gemox chemotherapy combined with anlotinib and Sintilimab(anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) immunotherapy in advanced cHCC-ICC, to provide a new treatment strategy and reference for the clinical treatment of advanced cHCC-CCA patients.
