Multicentral Preventive Antibiotics With Cystectomy Within Enhanced Recovery After Surgery
The current usage of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in radical cystectomy (RC) is aimed to reducing the incidence of surgical site infections and incidence of unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics. There are a huge number of different AP protocols according to Urological Associations. However, there is no convincing evidence to support variations and duration of AP which requires a randomized clinical trial on AP when performing variants of RC with uroderivation.

Research hypothesis: The use of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis (5 days), depending on the glomerular filtration rate, does not affect the incidence of postoperative complications.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Meropenem 1000 mg|DRUG: Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid 1200 mg or Cefuroksim 1500mg
Event rate, Determine the frequency of events of clinical interest in the period 30-90 days after RC in a surgical hospital working according to the protocol for early postoperative recovery of the patient, 90 days after Radical cystectomy|Event-free survival, Estimate the time to development of events of clinical interest in the period 30-90 days after RC in a surgical hospital, 90 days after Radical cystectomy
Emergence of resistant, To assess the probability of occurrence of acquired carbapenemase against the background of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis, 30-90 days after Radical cystectomy|All-cause mortality, Establish the frequency of 30-day, 90-day all-cause mortality after RC in a surgical hospital working according to the protocol for early postoperative patient recovery, 90 days after Radical cystectomy
