A Study of the Safety and Tolerability of ABBV-621 in Participants With Previously-Treated Solid Tumors and Hematologic Malignancies
This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-621 for participants with previously-treated solid tumors or hematologic malignancies.

Only chemotherapy combination (ABBV-621 + FOLFIRI) enrolling participants with RAS-mutant CRC who have received one prior line of therapy is open for enrollment.
