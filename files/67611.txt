Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields in Preventing Physical Deconditioning in Patients Undergoing Prolonged Hospitalization
The goal of this clinical trial is to examine if pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) can prevent or decrease physical deconditioning associated with prolonged hospitalisation and immobility of haematology patients. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer \[is/are\]:

* Does haematology patients undergoing prolonged hospitalisation have no or decreased physical deconditioning when exposed to PEMF?
* What are the changes in muscle secretome at baseline and after exposure to PEMF? Researchers will compare haematology patients who receive PEMF against patients who did not receive the treatment to see if there is a change in physical deconditioning. Healthy volunteers will also be recruited and randomized to either exposure to PEMF or no exposure.

Haematology patients will

* Have their blood taken at baseline, 4 weeks from baseline and 8 weeks from baseline.
* Undergo SPPB test at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks from baseline, and the test comprises of the time up and go test, 4 minute walk test and sit to stand test.
* Either expose to PEMF twice per week for 4 consecutive weeks or no exposure. Healthy volunteers will
* Have their blood taken at baseline, 4 weeks from baseline and 8 weeks from baseline.
* Either expose to PEMF twice per week for 4 consecutive weeks or no exposure.

Change in physical deconditioning in haematology patients after 8 sessions of PEMF, The haematology patients will undergo the SPPB test which comprises of the time up and go (TUG) test, 4 minute walk test and 5 times sit to stand (STS) test. The same test will be repeated 4 and 8 weeks from baseline. Based on the case study report done previously, we anticipate an improvement of TUG mean by 1.9sec, 5-times STS by 2.3sec and 4 min walk test by 0.14meters by the end of the 8 week therapy. We will consider the trend to be significant if 2 out of 3 three parameters in the SPPB are met., Change in SPPB test result 4 and 8 weeks from baseline|Changes in the levels of anti-cancer factors in blood plasma from haematology patients and healthy volunteers, Anti-cancer factors such as HTRA1 and Klotho can be altered with PEMF therapy in humans., Change in anti-cancer biomarkers levels in blood plasma from PEMF-exposed patients at week 4 and week 8 versus their own baseline.
