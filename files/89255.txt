Personalized Translational Platform for Biomarker Discovery in Brain Tumors
The central hypothesis for this proposal is that multimodal (clinical, imaging, tissue) biomarkers will better predict early brain tumor response to treatments and will be more reliable prognostic markers in patients with malignant brain tumors.
