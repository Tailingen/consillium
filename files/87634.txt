Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of PEG-rhG-CSF in Preventing Neutropenia After Chemotherapy in Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The main treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Neutropenia is the most common and serious complication of most chemotherapy. This study is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of jinyouli in preventing neutropenia in patients with non Hodgkin's lymphoma after chemotherapy.
Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: PEG-rhG-CSF
The incidence of grade Ⅲ/Ⅳ neutropenia, Grade Ⅲ neutropenia is defined as ANC≥0.5×10\^9/L, and \<1×10\^9/L; Grade Ⅳ neutropenia is defined as ANC\<0.5×10\^9/L, From date of randomization until the date of the study completion，up to 24 weeks
Incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), A single oral temperature is 38.3℃ or ≥38℃ for more than 1 h, and the absolute value of neutrophils is less than 0.5×10\^9/L or the absolute value of neutrophils is less than 1.0×10\^9/L but it is expected to drop to less than 0.5×10\^9/L within 48 hours, From date of randomization until the date of the study completion，up to 24 weeks|Antibiotic use rate, Antibiotic use rate during the treatment cycle, From date of randomization until the date of the study completion，up to 24 weeks|Incidence of dose adjustment of chemotherapy or delay of chemotherapy, Dose adjustment is defined as the reduction of planned dose of chemotherapy; Chemotherapy delay is defined as the delay in starting the next planned chemotherapy for more than 3 days., From date of randomization until the date of the study completion，up to 24 weeks
