Geriatric Assessments in Elderly Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Patients-2 (GERIAD2)
This study will validate the impact of comprehensive geriatric assessments using activity of daily living (ADL), instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), and Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI) on survival and toxicities in Korean patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP.
Lymphoma, Large B-cell, Diffuse
Event-free survival, Event-free survival was defined as death, relapse from complete remission, progression during or after treatment, and discontinuation or changes of therapy during treatments, 2 years
Overall survival, 5 years|Progression-free survival, 5 years|Cumulative incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events and premature treatment discontinuation, 1 year
Average received ralative dose intensity, The dose intensity of each agent of R-CHOP chemotherapy was calculated by dividing the total received dose of the agent by the number of weeks of treatment. The relative dose intensity of each agents then was calculated by dividing the received dose intensity by the projected dose intensity for the agent. The sum of the relative dose intensities of the individual agents was divided by the number of agents in the R-CHOP to yield the average received relative dose intensity. In this study the average received relative dose intensity is calculated., 6 months
