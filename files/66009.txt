Translational Study of MSS, TP53 Mutation and Chromosome Instability Relationship in Endometrial Carcinoma
The objective is to understand the relationship between TP53 mutation, MSS and chromosome instability in endometrial cancer and the effect on clinical prognosis.We will collect a small amount of tumor tissue samples. NGS panel detection and WGD/AS analysis were performed on the tissue. Paracancer tissue was used as a negative control and relevant information in medical records during the operation. Then we will collect clinical diagnosis and disease information through telephone follow-up after the completion of the operation.

The test is sequenced using Illumina high-throughput sequencers and accompanying kits. Conduct preliminary quality control on the samples, and the tumor cell content of the tissue samples shall not be less than 30%. Tissue DNA was extracted from tumor tissue samples according to the instructions of the QIAGEN DNA extraction kit. Samples qualified for quality control shall be arranged for further library construction. The extracted DNA samples were sequentially purified by fragment purification, terminal repair, splicing, fragment size selection, PCR amplification, product purification, library enrichment, and library product quality control. After qualified quality control, the constructed library was sequenced by Illumina matching kit. Bioinformatics analysis would be conducted.
