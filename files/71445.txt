A Couples Approach to Enhance Breast Cancer Survivorship
The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new couple-based intervention for women with recently diagnosed, early stage breast cancer and their spouses or male partners. This cancer-focused relationship enhancement intervention adapts well-validated cognitive-behavioral interventions to teach patients and partners specific relationship skills, such as problem-solving skills, communication, and maximizing positive interactions, that they can use in addressing breast cancer. This project's major goals are to improve the patient's individual functioning and specific aspects of the couple's relationship affected by breast cancer (e.g., mood, role functioning, sexual functioning, and social support). In the current investigation, cancer-focused relationship enhancement will be compared to (a) a couple-based Cancer Education intervention and (b) a Treatment-as-Usual condition.
