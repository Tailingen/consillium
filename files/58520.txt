FOLFIRINOX for Unresectable Locally Advanced and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This single arm, multi-center phase II clinical trial will assess the safety and efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in the first-line setting in patients with unresectable locally advanced (ULA) and borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRINOX
Median Overall Survival (OS) of FOLFIRINOX in Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced (ULA) Pancreatic Cancer, All patients who receive at least Day 1 of FOLFIRINOX treatment will be evaluable and followed up for up to 3 years for the primary outcome of overall survival (OS)., Up to 3 years
Overall Survival for Borderline Resectable Patients, All patients who receive at least Day 1 of FOLFIRINOX treatment will be evaluable and followed up for up to 3 years for the outcome of overall survival (OS), Up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival will be measured from D1 of treatment until evidence of tumor progression (including clinical deterioration related to the underlying pancreatic cancer, as assessed by the investigator) or death from any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Patients that are lost to follow-up will be censored, the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years|Objective Response Rate, All patients who have received at least one cycle of treatment will be evaluated. Disease will be evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT and/or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.

Patients who drop out of the study prior to disease evaluation will not be evaluable for response unless the patient undergoes radiologic evaluation or their disease progresses clinically., Up to 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate will be measured by the percentage of patients with responses (CR) and partial responses (PR) and stable disease (SD), per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI and/or CT: Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progression of Disease (POD); Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions., Up to 3 years|Rate of Resectability (RR), Rate of resectability will be evaluated by determining the percentage of patients who were initially deemed to have ULA or borderline resectable (BR) disease and, following any period of treatment, were subsequently deemed to have resectable disease and undergo surgical resection. The denominator will reflect all patients with ULA or BR disease., Up to 3 years
Correlation of Tumor Markers (Ca19-9, CEA) With Outcomes (RR, DCR, PFS, and OS)., Tumor markers (Ca19-9, CEA) will be measured at baseline, every eight weeks and at end of treatment, and will be correlated with outcomes resectability response (RR),disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)., Up to 3 years
FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and represents a new standard in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer for selected patients. With improved overall survival (OS) and response rates (RR) in the metastatic setting, we hypothesize that in patients with less tumor burden, this regimen will be safe and well tolerated, improve OS, progression free survival (PFS), and RR, and improve resectability rates, as compared to historical data from standard single agent gemcitabine therapy for unresectable locally advanced (ULA) patients and standard radiation with concurrent 5 fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy for borderline resectable (BR) patients. While both ULA and BR patients will be eligible for the present study, our primary objective concerns ULA patients, and we plan to enroll 45 patients in this group.

Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be consented and treated with FOLFIRINOX every 2 weeks (1 cycle = 4 weeks = 2 treatments). Patients will undergo repeat imaging (CT or MRI) every 2 cycles and reassessed for resectability of the tumor. All patients that are not able to undergo surgical resection, due to insufficient down-staging or patient preference, will continue on protocol-based therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death.
