Evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of ZL-1310 as a single agent in Phase Ib, 1. BICR-determined confirmed ORR in Phase Ib
2. Investigator-determined confirmed ORR in Phase Ib, up to 24 months|Evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of ZL-1310 as a single agent in Phase II, Investigator-determined confirmed ORR in Phase II, up to 24 months|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse-Events in Phase II, Number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), up to 24 months|Incidence of Serious Adverse Events in Phase II, Number of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs), up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of Total Antibody in all phases, Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that refers to the time it takes for a drug or substance to reach its highest concentration in the bloodstream or a specific body compartment after administration, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): maximum concentration (Cmax) of Total Antibody in all phases, Maximum concentration (Cmax) is a key pharmacokinetic parameter. It represents the highest concentration of a drug or substance that is achieved in the bloodstream or a specific biological fluid or tissue after administration, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of Total Antibody in all phases, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that quantitatively describes the total exposure of a drug in the body over a specific period of time, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): apparent clearance (CL) of Total Antibody in all phases, Apparent clearance (CL) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that describes the rate at which a drug is removed from the body relative to the drug's concentration in the bloodstream or a specific body fluid, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) of Total Antibody in all phases, Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that characterizes the time it takes for the concentration of a drug in the body to decrease by half during the terminal phase of drug elimination, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of Unconjugated payloads in all phases, Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that refers to the time it takes for a drug or substance to reach its highest concentration in the bloodstream or a specific body compartment after administration, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): maximum concentration (Cmax) of Unconjugated payloads in all phases, Maximum concentration (Cmax) is a key pharmacokinetic parameter. It represents the highest concentration of a drug or substance that is achieved in the bloodstream or a specific biological fluid or tissue after administration, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of Unconjugated payloads in all phases, The area under the concentration - time curve (AUC) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that quantitatively describes the total exposure of a drug in the body over a specific period of time, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): apparent clearance (CL) of Unconjugated payloads in all phases, Apparent clearance (CL) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that describes the rate at which a drug is removed from the body relative to the drug's concentration in the bloodstream or a specific body fluid, up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) of unconjugated payloads in all phases, Terminal elimination half - life (T1/2) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that characterizes the time it takes for the concentration of a drug in the body to decrease by half during the terminal phase of drug elimination, up to 24 months|Assess immunogenicity of ZL-1310 in all phases, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to ZL-1310 in all phases, up to 24 months|Evaluate stability and control of disease in all phases, BICR- and investigator-determined disease control rate (DCR) in all phases, up to 24 months|Evaluate durability of response in all phases, BICR- and investigator-determined duration of response (DOR) in all phases, up to 24 months|Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in all phases, BICR- and investigator-determined PFS in all phases, up to 24 months|Evaluate survival in all phases, Overall survival (OS) in all phases, up to 24 months
This is an open-label, multiple-center, phase Ib/II study of ZL-1310 in selected solid tumors.
