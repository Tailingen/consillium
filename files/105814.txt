Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With HER2-overexpressing Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in participants with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: DS-8201a 5.4 mg/kg Q3W|DRUG: DS-8201a 6.4 mg/kg Q3W
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review Following IV Administration of T-DXd in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-overexpressing Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as the number (percentage) of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., 6 months post-dose administration to data cut off, up to 20 months

This 2-stage study will evaluate participants with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2-overexpressing colorectal cancer (CRC) (immunohistochemistry \[IHC\] 3+ or IHC 2+/ in situ hybridization \[ISH\]+) of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) wild-type and either rat sarcoma viral oncogenes homologue (RAS) wild-type or mutant tumor type, previously treated with standard therapy. In the first stage, participants will be randomized 1:1 with 2 doses of T-DXd. After Stage 1 enrollment is complete, all further eligible participants will be registered to T-DXd administered IV in Stage 2. Participants will receive the assigned dose of T-DXd until progression of disease or the participant meets one of the discontinuation criteria.
