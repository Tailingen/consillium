A Study to Evaluate the Diagnostic Efficacy of 68Ga- MY6349 PET/CT in Patients With Tumours
This is a study using an autocontrol approach, enrolling 40 patients with tumours of epithelial origin, who underwent 68Ga- MY6349 and 68Ga-PSMA/18F-FDG PET/CT imaging of patients with tumours of epithelial origin to compare the ability to diagnose, stage and monitor recurrence of tumours of epithelial origin using the pathological findings as the gold standard.
