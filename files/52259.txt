A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat for the Treatment of Anemia in Participants Receiving Chemotherapy Treatment for Non-Myeloid Malignancies
The main goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of roxadustat for treatment of anemia in participants with non-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle treatments of myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy Induced Anemia

Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) Level From Baseline to the Level Averaged Over Weeks 9-13, Hb levels measured from Weeks 9 through 13 will be averaged in order to provide a single measure for comparison to the baseline Hb levels., Baseline, Weeks 9 through 13

Participants who are eligible for participation will be randomized to roxadustat and SEPO® (recombinant human erythropoietin-α \[rHuEPO-α\]), and undergo a 12-week treatment period followed by a 4-week follow-up period.
