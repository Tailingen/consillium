Cardiovascular Manifestations in Ph-negative MPN
The primary aim of this research is to investigate the clinical and subclinical cardiovascular complications and its relationship with myeloproliferative neoplasms seeking to assess incidence, prevalence and severity in comparison to healthy group and analyze potential risk factors including genetic mutations, inflammatory markers and hematological parameters
Philadelphia Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
OTHER: participants are not assigned an intervention as part of the study
Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease and cardiovascular Risk Factors, Assessment of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) through patient history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG, echocardiography) and Measurement of risk factors such as:

* Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
* Lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides)
* Body mass index (BMI) kg/m\^2, through study completion, an average of 4 years
Subclinical Cardiovascular Manifestations and Comparison with the healthy control group, Subclinical cardiovascular manifestations will be detected by using of imaging techniques such as:

* Carotid artery doppler ultrasound
* limb doppler ultrasound, through study completion, an average of 4 years
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of hematological disorders characterized by clonal proliferation of stem cells leading to excessive production of blood cells. The primary types include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. They share a common characteristic in that they lack the Philadelphia chromosome.

Patients with MPN face an elevated risk of various clinical cardiovascular complications including arterial and venous thromboembolism, hypertension and heart failure. This increased risk can be attributed to several factors including, chronic inflammation, hyperviscosity due to increased blood cells count and genetic mutation like JAK2 V617F which plays a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis.

While clinical cardiovascular events in MPN patients are well-documented, subclinical manifestations such as subclinical atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, left ventriclar hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmia are often overlooked. These subclinical changes may significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality but are not routinely assessed in clinical practice. Non invasive modalities such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, carotid doppler ultrasound and limb doppler ultrasound can provide vulnerable tools for early detection of these cardiovascular manifestations.

So understanding the relationship between myloproliferative neoplasms and incidence and severity of cardiovascular complications is crucial. This knowledge can enhance risk assessment, improve patient care and outcomes and facilitate targeted interventions.
