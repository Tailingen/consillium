A Phase II Study of Daratumumab, Clarithromycin, Pomalidomide And Dexamethasone (D-ClaPd) In Multiple Myeloma Patients Previously Exposed to Daratumumab
This is a single-center, non-randomized, phase 2 study in which patients will receive daratumumab (subcutaneous, SC) in combination with clarithromycin/pomalidomide/dexamethasone (D-ClaPd) until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. This study will test the hypothesis that in patients with previous daratumumab exposure, combination therapy of clarithromycin/pomalidomide/dexamethasone with daratumumab SC (D-ClaPd) will yield higher Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) rates in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients than historical pomalidomide/dexamethasone treatment.
Multiple Myeloma|Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Relapse Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Daratumumab SC|DRUG: Clarithromycin|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Very Good Partial Response Rate or better within 8 cycles of induction therapy, Very Good Partial Response or better defined as the proportion of participants with a documented Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better as best response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, measured from date of enrollment through the end of the 8th induction cycle., 8 months
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is measured in months from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression and/or death. Median estimate is calculated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology., Approximately 3 years|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is measured in months from the date of enrollment to the date of the participant's death. Greenwood's formula will be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates., Approximately 5 years|Complete Response Rate or Better, The proportion of participants with a documented Complete Response (CR) or better, per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Approximately 1 year|Time to Progression, Measured in months between the date of enrollment and the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant has met the criteria for Progressive Disease, Approximately 3 years|Time to Next Therapy, Measured in months from the date of enrollment to the start date of subsequent treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, Approximately 3 years|Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time between the date of initial documentation of best response to the date of first documented evidence of disease progression., Approximately 3 years|Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, Defined as a percentage of MRD negative participants, Approximately 8 months|Rate of improvement in response during maintenance therapy, Percentage of patients that achieved an improved response during maintenance compared to end of induction., Approximately 3 years|Time to Best Response, Measured in months between the date of enrollment and the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant has met criteria for best response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Approximately 8 months|Overall Response Rate, The proportion of participants with a documented Overall Response (Partial Response or better), per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Approximately 1 year|Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) Rate or better, The proportion of participants with a documented Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) Rate or better, per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Approximately 1 year
