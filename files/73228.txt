Intra-SURGerY High-resolution Specimen PET/CT Imager for Margin Assessment in Early-stage Breast Cancer
This study is a diagnostic open-label, prospective, single-arm non-inferiority clinical trial.

The primary endpoint is the accuracy to detect positive invasive margins in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients by high-resolution specimen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging.
Breast Cancer|Breast-conserving Surgery
DEVICE: AURA 10 PET/CT
Evaluation of the accuracy to detect positive invasive margins in IDC patients, Evaluation of intraoperative high-resolution specimen PET/CT imaging for the identification of all invasive positive margins during primary breast-conserving surgery (BCS) of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), as compared to perioperative gross pathology evaluation. Permanent pathology is used as the gold standard for margin assessment., 1 month
Evaluation of diagnostic performance of PET/CT in the detection of positive margins respect to gross pathology, determining the diagnostic performance of intraoperative high-resolution specimen PET/CT imaging and gross pathology to detect all positive margin;, 1 month|Detection of malignant cells in resected lymph nodes and cavity shaves, exploring the ability of intraoperative high-resolution specimen PET/CT imaging to detect the presence of malignant cells in resected lymph nodes and cavity shaves;, 1 month|Definition of optimal SUVmax cut-off, determining the optimal SUVmax cut-off in intraoperative high-resolution specimen PET/CT imaging for the correct detection of malignant vs. non-malignant tissues, using pathology results as standard-of-reference, 1 months
The rationale of this study is to examine the non-inferiority of intraoperative high-resolution specimen PET/CT imaging in early-stage breast cancer for the identification of all positive margins of the invasive component during Breast Cancer Surgery (BCS) as compared to standard-of-care gross pathology evaluation.

The PET/CT specimen imager is used to intraoperatively assess resection margins and histopathological findings of the breast tumor specimen are applied as the gold standard.
