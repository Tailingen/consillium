EUS-guided Choledochoduodenostomy vs ERCP as First Line in Malignant Distal Obstruction in Resectable Disease (CARPEDIEM-1 Trial)
The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate temporal delay (days) between biliary drainage (EUS-CDS vs ERCP as first line therapy) and surgery in patients with resectable distal malignant biliary obstruction.
Malignant Biliary Obstruction|Pancreatic Cancer Resectable|Biliary Tract Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic biliary drainage|DEVICE: Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS)|DEVICE: Lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) and double-pigtail plastic stent (DPPS)
Delay in days between endoscopic biliary drainage and cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP), Number of days between intervention (T1-biliary drainage) and surgery., 1 day to 12 months
Technical success, ERCP group: cannulation, cholangiogram, correct deployment of SEMS. EUS-CDS group: Correct deployment of both flaps of LAMS (and pigtail) in place, checked by ecoendoscopy/endoscopic image/floroscopy., day 0|Clinical success, In jaundice: decreasing \> 50% of bilirrubin or normalization of bilirrubin levels 14 days after endoscopic procedure.

In cholangitis: stop of antibiotics without clinical recurrence or decreasing \> 50% of acute phase reactants 14 days after the endoscopic procedure., 14 days after BD|AE - biliary drainage, Adverse events rate related to biliary drainage according to the AGREE classification, 0 to 30 days after BD|AE - surgery, Adverse events rate related to surgery according to the Claiven and Dindo classification., 0 to 90 days after surgery
Ecoendoscopy-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS) has been extended as a second line treatment in cases of ERCP failure in malignant distal biliary obstruction (MDBO). However, there are clinical trials which have compared it with ERCP as a first line treatment for MDBO in palliative patients, showing similar clinical and technical success and adverse events (AEs) rate between both techniques. Data about the benefit of this techique in resectable patients is still limited.

A recent retrospective study (Janet J et al, Ann Surg Oncol 2023) which included resectable patients, found that EUS-CDS group had significantly less delay (days) between biliary drainage and surgery than the ERCP group, with fewer endoscopy and surgery AEs.

Thus, our hypothesis is that EUS-CDS has benefits in terms of decreasing delay between biliary drainage when compared to ERCP in MDBO in resectable patients.
