Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, PK Characteristics and Anti-tumor Activity of FCN-159 in Adult and Pediatric Participants With Neurofibromatosis Type 1
FCN-159 is a highly active MEK1/2 inhibitor that was designed, synthesized and screened on the basis of the structure of trametinib. FCN-159 is an orally available and highly potent selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, which is expected to be a targeted therapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and neurofibromatosis type 1.
Neurofibromatosis 1|Plexiform Neurofibroma|NF1
DRUG: FCN-159
Phase I: Safety: Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) incidence rate., 28 days after the dose of FCN-159 for DLT|Phase I: Safety: MTD and RP2D., Approximately 6-9 months for MTD and RP2D (phase I duration)|Phase II: Objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Phase I Other safety: - The type and frequency of adverse events (AE) - Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAE) - The frequency and causes of death events - Laboratory safety test results - Changes in vital signs, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase I Efficacy: objective response rate (ORR) by investigator /BIRC assessment, clinical benefit rate (CBR) per investigator/BIRC assessment including CR, PR, and SD lasting more than 6 months;, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase I: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) After Single Dose and Multiple Dose of FCN-159, Pre-dose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 24 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (1 cycle = 28 days) for single dose, Pre-dose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 24 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 28 for multiple dose|Phase I: AUC From Time Zero to Last Measurable Concentration (AUClast) After Single Dose and Multiple Dose of FCN-159, Pre-dose (0 hour), 0.5~1, 1.5~3, 4~6, 24 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 2, Pre-dose (0 hour) on Cycle 5 and every 4 cycles thereafter (assessed up to 104 weeks) (1 cycle = 28 days)|Phase I PD marker: ERK phosphorylation inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), During Cycle 1 (cycle is 28 days): Day 1, Day 8 and Day 28|Phase I Changes in NF1-related symptoms., Each participant will undergo standardized functional evaluations according to the relevant category or categories of PN-related complications. The incidence of patients with improved function or quality of life will be measured. Key measurements are chosen from each complication category to assess for change over time., Through study completion, an average of 2 years]|Phase II: Critical secondary endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) by BIRC assessment, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II: Other efficacy endpoints: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Per investigator/BIRC assessment including CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), and SD (Stable Disease) lasting more than 6 months;, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II: Other efficacy endpoints: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of cases with best response (PR or CR or stable disease (SD) after treatment in evaluable cases., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II: Other efficacy endpoints: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from participant enrollment to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Participants without an event (no progression or death) were censored at the date of last tumor evaluation., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II: Other efficacy endpoints: Time To Progression (TTP), Defined as the time from participant enrollment to disease progression, and participants without events (without progression or death) were censored at the date of tumor evaluation., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II: Other efficacy endpoints: Time To Response (TTR), Defined as the time from participant enrollment to the first observation of tumor response among participants with an objective response, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II: Other efficacy endpoints: Duration Of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first observation of tumor response to tumor progression or death from any cause in participants with an objective response, (whichever occurs first)., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II Other safety endpoints: - The type and frequency of adverse events (AE) - Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAE) - The frequency and causes of death events - Laboratory safety test results; - Changes in vital signs;, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II Dose intensity, Dose intensity, planned dose intensity and relative dose intensity will be measured.

Dose Intensity (mg/day) = Actual Cumulative Dose (mg)/ Total Duration of Exposure (Days).

Plan Dose Intensity (mg/day) = Plan Cumulative Dose (mg) / Total Duration of Exposure (Days).

Relative Dose Intensity (%) = Dose Intensity / Plan Dose Intensity., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II Ctrough After Multiple Dose of FCN-159, Pre-dose (0 hour), 0.5~1, 1.5~3, 4~6, 24 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 2, Pre-dose (0 hour) on Cycle 5 and every 4 cycles thereafter (assessed up to 104 weeks) (1 cycle = 28 days)|Phase II Clinical outcome variables: Changes in pain intensity., Each participant will undergo standardized assessments to evaluate changes in pain intensity, using validated pain scales and questionnaires. The incidence of patients experiencing a decrease in pain intensity, as well as the reduction in pain intensity scores, will be evaluated., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Phase II Other clinical outcome variables: Changes in COA variables other than pain intensity., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
