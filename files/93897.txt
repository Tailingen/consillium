Dose Escalation Study With 99mTC - or 186 Re-labelled Humanised Monoclonal Antibody (hMAb) BIWA 4 in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The general aim of the present study was to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenously administered Technetium 99m (99mTc) and Rhenium-186 radionuclide (186 Re) -labelled hMAb BIWA 4, to confirm preferential accumulation in the tumour of 99mTc - labelled hMAb BIWA 4, to determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose of 186 Re-labelled hMAb BIWA 4 and to propose a safety dose for phase II development.
