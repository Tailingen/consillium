An Open-Label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of HALAVEN in Subjects With Cancer Who Also Have Impaired Renal Function
This is an open-label non-randomized study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who are no longer responding to available therapy. HALAVEN will be administered to subjects on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: E7389|DRUG: E7389|DRUG: E7389
To study the influence of moderate and severe renal impairment on the Composite of Pharmacokinetics of HALAVEN following a single intravenous administration to subjects with cancer., The primary analysis will be conducted using the dose-normalized primary PK parameters (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, and Cmax) respectively. Relationships between each individual PK parameter and renal function (creatinine clearance) will be analyzed by linear regression models using the PK parameter as the dependent variable and renal function as the independent variable., Halaven will be measured on Day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle.
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of HALAVEN in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, as well as in those with normal renal function., Safety data that will be evaluated include adverse events, clinical laboratory results, physical examination results, ECG, and vital signs, Halaven will be measured on Day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle.
