Trial of Tremelimumab in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
This is a phase II trial designed to estimate the activity of single agent tremelimumab in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer with disease progression despite prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The primary endpoint is objective response rate and the study will employ a Simon's 2-stage design.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Tremelimumab
Objective Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

ORR is defined as the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1., Up to a maximum of 12 months
Adverse Events, Number of participants with adverse events are reported according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) version 4., AE had been recorded from time of consent until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first; up to a maximum of 13 months|Disease Control Rate, The disease control rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease by RECIST 1.1, Up to a maximum of 12 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response., Up to a maximum of 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

PFS is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death. Up to a maximum of 24 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death or date of last contact., Time of treatment start until death or date of last contact, up to a maximum of 42 months.
