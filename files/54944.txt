LOTCOL Study: Local Treatment of Colo-rectal Liver Met
In this study the investigators will include colo-rectal cancer (CRC) patients starting last line of standard palliative chemotherapy. Eligible patients include patients with KRAS mutation starting line or KRAS wild type starting line treatment. Standard treatment today for these patients is chemotherapy only and median overall survival (OS) is about 10 months. The hypothesis is that local treatment in addition to systemic treatment will increase time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival compared to patients who receive systemic chemotherapy only. The investigators experience with local treatment of liver metastases in CRC patients is that side-effects of treatment in general are minor, although gastric bleeding have been observed after stereotactic body radiation therapy.
