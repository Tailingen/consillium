A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Polatuzumab in Real World Clinical Practice Among Adult Chinese Participants With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the progression free survival (PFS) in the real-world settings of polatuzumab among Chinese diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) participants.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Polatuzumab Vedotin
Cohorts 1 and 2: Progression Free Survival at 24 months (PFS24) Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, At 24 months|Cohort 3: PFS Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, Baseline up to end of study (EOS) (approximately 38 months)
Cohort 3: PFS24 Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, At 24 months|Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), From the start of polatuzumab treatment to the initiation of next-line treatment (up to approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Complete Response Rate (CRR) Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, Baseline up to EOS (approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Overall Response Rate (ORR) Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, Baseline up to EOS (approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1 and 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR) Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, Baseline up to EOS (approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Duration of Response (DoR), From the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or partial response (PR) to the date of progression, relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1 and 2: Disease Free Survival (DFS), From the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR, to the date of relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1 and 2: Event Free Survival (EFS) Assessed by Investigator per Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, From the start of polatuzumab treatment to any treatment failure including disease progression, relapse, initiation of new antilymphoma therapy (NALT), or death from any cause, which occurs first (up to approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Overall Survival (OS), From the start of polatuzumab treatment until the date of death from any cause (up to approximately 38 months)|Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), AEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to EOS (approximately 38 months)
