Building Evidence for Ablative Internal Radiation Therapy in Localized HCC Beyond the Up-To-7 Criteria
At four major centers in Korea, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that exceed the up-to-7 criteria yet remain locally confined will undergo ablative radioembolization using Yttrium-90 glass microspheres, guided by a standardized dosimetry method. Their treatment response, survival outcomes, and adverse events will be monitored for two years following the procedure.

Objective response rate (ORR) according to the mRECIST, The number of patients with partial or complete response accroding to the mRECIST as the best response, divided by the total number of participants (%), Time of treatment up to subsequent anti-cancer therapy, participant's death, opposition to data collection, lost to follow-up, or study termination (24 months after the last patient is enrolled)
ORR according to the RECIST 1.1, The number of patients with partial or complete response according to the RECIST 1.1 as the best response, divided by the total number of participants (%), Time of treatment up to subsequent anti-cancer therapy, participant's death, opposition to data collection, lost to follow-up, or study termination (24 months after the last patient is enrolled)|ORR according to localized mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, The number of patients with partial or complete response as the best response, divided by the total number of participants (%).

This prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ablative radioembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that exceeds the up-to-seven (UT7) criteria but is confined to up to five geographically adjacent Couinaud segments. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate, assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST).

All patients will receive ablative radioembolization using Yttrium-90 glass microspheres with a personalized dosimetry approach targeting a tumor dose of 700 Gy (±50%). In cases of high tumor burden, a second radioembolization within 180 days of the initial procedure will be permitted at the operators' discretion, provided the cumulative lung dose remains below 50 Gy. Follow-up evaluations, including laboratory tests and dynamic imaging, will be performed at 4 weeks post-treatment and every 3 months thereafter for a total of 2 years. Efficacy data-including tumor response and survival-will be collected, with tumor responses evaluated by both site investigators and a blinded independent central review. Adverse events will be documented and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. In addition, the incidence of radioembolization-induced liver disease and radiation pneumonitis will be monitored for 6 months following the procedure.
