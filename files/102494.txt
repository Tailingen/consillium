Safety and Efficacy Study of Vintafolide and Vintafolide Plus Paclitaxel Compared to Paclitaxel Alone in Participants With Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) (MK-8109-004)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of vintafolide alone compared to vintafolide plus paclitaxel and paclitaxel alone in participants with with 100% positive folate receptor (FR) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

The primary hypothesis of this study is the vintafolide alone and/or vintafolide + paclitaxel will improve progression free survival (PFS) in participants with FR (100%) TNBC compared to paclitaxel alone.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Vintafolide 2.5 mg|DRUG: Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2|DRUG: Etarfolatide|DRUG: Folic acid|DRUG: Premedication for Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Up to 60 months
Objective Response Rate (Complete Response [CR] + Partial Response [PR]), Up to 60 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CR + PR + Stable Disease [SD] for >=6 months), Up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), Up to 60 months
During the screening stage, participants will be required to have a diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scan with etarfolatide (EC20) to identify target lesions and determine eligibility for treatment. After successful screening, during the treatment stage, participants will receive study drug (vintafolide, vintafolide + paclitaxel, or paclitaxel) for approximately four 28-day cycles.
