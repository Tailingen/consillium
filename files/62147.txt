Phase II Study of TAEST16001 in Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAEST16001 cells in the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma patients with HLA-A\*02:01 tissue genotype and positive tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 expression.

Objective response rate, The objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by an independent imaging evaluation committee (IRC), was used as the endpoint (response evaluation criteria based on solid tumors, version 1.1 \[RECIST1.1\]) to evaluate the TAEST16001 cell therapy tissue genotype as HLA-A\*02:01 and tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 Efficacy of positive expression in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma., 270 days
Disease control rate (DCR), Assessed by in all patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received TAEST16001 cell reinfusion, according to RECIST., 270 days|Progression-free survival (PFS), Assessed by in all patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received TAEST16001 cell reinfusion., 270 days|Duration of response (DOR), Assessed by in all patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received TAEST16001 cell reinfusion, according to RECIST., 270 days|Time to tumor response (TTR), Assessed by in all patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received TAEST16001 cell reinfusion, according to RECIST., 270 days|Overall survival (OS), Assessed by IRC and investigator in all patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received TAEST16001 cell reinfusion., 270 days|Number of participants with other abnormal laboratory values and/or adverse events that are related to treatment, According to CTCAE 5.0 criteria., 270 days|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To observe the proliferation and persistence of TAEST16001 cells in vivo., 270 days|Maximum time to peak (Tmax), To observe the proliferation and persistence of TAEST16001 cells in vivo., 270 days|Activity of T lymphocyte subsets, To observe the influence of TAEST16001 cells on human immunological activity., 270 days|Activity of peripheral blood antigen specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL), To observe the influence of TAEST16001 cells on human immunological activity., 270 days|Activity of effector T cells, To observe the influence of TAEST16001 cells on human immunological activity., 270 days|Life quality scale, According to European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 life quality scale, 30 items were divided into 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functions), 3 symptom domains (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), 1 general health/quality of life domain and 6 single domains. The score for each domain is obtained by summing the scores of items included in each domain and dividing by the number of items included. The final total scores range from 0 to 100 by standardizing the conversion of the raw scores. Higher scores in the functional and general health domains indicate better functioning and quality of life, and higher scores in the symptom domain indicate more symptoms or problems (worse quality of life)., 270 days
This is a single-arm, open label, multi-center, phase II study. The investigators include advanced soft tissue sarcoma with failure in standard treatment or no recommended standard therapy.

TCR-T cell therapy has made a breakthrough for tumors in recent years. Phase I/II trial of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and melanoma, conducted by the Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute, showed that 61% Synovial cell sarcoma patients and 55% melanoma patients benefit from this treatment, without severe side effects found in T cell receptor (TCR) transduced T-Cell Immunotherapy.

This clinical trial is mainly focused on cancer-testis antigen, because it is not expressed in normal cells. NY-ESO-1 antigen as one member of cancer-testis antigen, is commonly expressed in 10-50% of melanoma, lung, liver, esophageal, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid and ovarian cancer cases, 60% of multiple myeloma cases, and 70-80% of synovial sarcoma. NY-ESO-1 expression was also found in 88.2% of myxoid liposarcomas, 61.1% of synovial sarcomas, 31.3% of osteosarcomas, 21.4% of pleomorphic liposarcomas, 16.7% of desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and 14.3% of chondrosarcomas. Although the NY-ESO-1 TCR cell therapy for synovial sarcoma and melanoma has benefited many patients and the phase I trial has been performed, its effect and safety on advanced soft tissue sarcoma is still unknown.

The patients must meet the two criteria: HLA-A\*0201positive and NY-ESO-1 positive cellsâ‰¥20% by immunohistochemistry.
