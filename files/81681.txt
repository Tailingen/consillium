High- and Low-dose Radiotherapy Combined With Envafolimab for Metastatic Solid Tumor
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of high- and low-dose radiotherapy (HD-RT/LD-RT) combined with envafolimab (I) in the treatment of metastatic solid tumors that have failed first-line immunotherapy or above.
