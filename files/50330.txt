A Research Study for Latina Women With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a psychosocial eHealth intervention designed to improve hormone therapy adherence among Hispanic/Latinx women with breast cancer. Our proposed secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life and self-efficacy in managing hormone therapy side effects.

The intervention components include breast cancer knowledge, hormone/endocrine therapy knowledge, stress awareness and management, social support, and enhanced communication and intimacy skills. The intervention will be delivered via a Smartphone application over a 12-week period.

All participants will receive the intervention application (described below). Aside from using the Smartphone application for the recommended 12 weeks, participation in this study includes three assessments: baseline (at the beginning of the research study), 6-week follow-up, and 12-week follow-up.

BEHAVIORAL: "My Guide" (psychoeducation & self-management program)
Acceptability of My Guide: Usefulness, To assess acceptability, all participants are asked to complete an exit interview on My Guide. This interview assesses usefulness, satisfaction, learnability and usability of the application. This exit interview was synthesized from validated measures assessing eHealth intervention acceptability, and was adapted for our study to better fit our target population and our application design. Above average scores on the questionnaire are considered acceptable. The questionnaire is administered over the phone immediately following the 12 week intervention., T3 (immediately following 12 week intervention)|Acceptability of My Guide: Satisfaction, To assess acceptability, all participants are asked to complete an exit interview on My Guide.

Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, an 70% recruitment rate is considered an adequate level of demand., 12 weeks|Demand of My Guide: Retention Rate, Another way we assess demand of the My Guide application is through participant retention. Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, an 70% retention rate is considered an adequate level of demand., 12 weeks|Participant use of My Guide: Number of Login's, We assess participant use of the My Guide application by examining the number of participant logins to the web-based application., 12 weeks|Participant use of My Guide: Duration of Usage, We assess participant use of the My Guide application by examining the duration participant time spent on the website. Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, an average of 8 hours of use is considered an adequate level of engagement., 12 weeks|Participant use of My Guide: Content Accessed, We assess participant use of the My Guide application by examining the type of content accessed by participants on the website., 12 weeks|Change in Medication adherence will be assessed primarily with the Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS)., The ARMS (Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale) survey is a previously validated patient-report measure of barriers to medication adherence and adherence-related behavior., T1 (prior to starting intervention), T2 (6 weeks into intervention), T3 (immediately following 12 week intervention)
Change in Health Related Quality of Life will be evaluated with The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G7), The FACT-G7 is a validated questionnaire that assesses top-rated symptoms and concerns for a broad spectrum of advanced cancers and serves as a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure., T1 (prior to starting intervention), T2 (6 weeks into intervention), T3 (immediately following 12 week intervention)|Change in Patient Self-Efficacy in managing side effects is measured using the PROMIS Self Efficacy for Managing Symptoms, The PROMIS Self Efficacy for Managing Symptoms survey is a validated, computer adaptive survey to assess how confident participants are in their ability to manage their symptoms and side effects., T1 (prior to starting intervention), T2 (6 weeks into intervention), T3 (immediately following 12 week intervention)
