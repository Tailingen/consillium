NT-I7 (Efineptakin Alfa) in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Participants with Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purposes of Phase 1b of this study are to determine the following in participants with advanced solid tumors:

* Safety and tolerability of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab
* Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)

The main purpose of Phase 2a of this study is to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treated and naïve relapsed and refractory (R/R) tumors.

The main purpose of the Biomarker Cohort is to assess a potential correlation between tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and clinical benefits in participants with CPI-naïve R/R ovarian cancer (OC).

This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2a study of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1b) followed by a dose expansion phase (Phase 2a) and a Biomarker Cohort.

The Phase 1b is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, including determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NT-I7.

The main purpose of Phase 2a of this study is to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with relapsed/refractory

* checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-treated Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
* checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-naïve Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC), and Pancreatic Cancer (PC) The Biomarker Cohort is designed to assess the correlation between tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and clinical benefits of NT-I7 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with CPI naïve R/R Ovarian Cancer (OC).
