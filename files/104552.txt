Expression Levels of Nicotinamide Metabolism-related Protein (NMAP) in Newly Diagnosed Renal Cancer and Non-renal Cancer Populations
This study aims to observe the difference between NMAP (nicotinamide metabolism associated protein) serum levels in primary diagnosed renal cancer patients and non-renal cancer patient controls, plot the ROC curve and establish appropriate cut-off values.

NMAP level study, To observe the difference in the expression level of nicotinamide metabolism related protein (NMAP) in the serum of newly diagnosed renal cancer and non-renal cancer patients. Draw the NMAP ROC curve and establish the appropriate Cut-off value to analyze its sensitivity and specificity., September 2019-September 2021
NMAP plus other tumor biomarkers study, According to NMAP and combined with other tumor biomarkers data such as AFP, multiple regression analysis was used to map the ROC curve and establish the appropriate Cut-off value to determine whether it is capable of distinguishing kidney cancer and liver cancer., September 2019-September 2021
