A Phase II Trial of Ofatumumab in Subjects With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
Given the tolerability and efficacy of ofatumumab in follicular lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and the need to improve therapy for patients with WM utilizing a non-myelosuppressive agent this phase II trial of ofatumumab is being initiated in patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).
