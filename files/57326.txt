Immunotherapy in Lung Cancer: Treatment After IO Cessation.
Immunotherapy is now a standard of care for first-line and eventually salvage therapy in patients with stage IV NSCLC and as adjuvant after RT-CT for stage III NSCLC.

The aim of the study is determining the therapeutic landscape and the reason for immunotherapy cessation.

Patients with stage IV or unresectable not irradiable stage III NSCLC will be registered at the time receiving immunotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

When IO is stopped, reason for cessation and further treatment will be recorded.

Secondary endpoints are survival after IO cessation, activity of first salvage therapy, disease-free survival after IO cessation in patients receiving no further treatment.

Patients will be centrally registered at the ELCWP headquarter (Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium).
