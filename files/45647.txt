Combination High Dose Melphalan and Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Transplant With Bortezomib for Multiple Myeloma: A Dose and Schedule Finding Study
The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of melphalan and autologous PBSCT (peripheral blood stem cell transplantation - stem cells that come from your own body) in combination with bortezomib, a new FDA approved drug used to treat myeloma.
Cancer|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Autologous PBSC Transplant
Safety and Engraftment, Peripheral blood progenitor cells were collected with either chemo-mobilization (27 of 39, 69%) or growth factor mobilization (12 of 39, 31%). Patients received an average of 9.0 Ã— 10\^6/kg CD34+ cells (range, 2.3-65) as their transplant graft., Day 30 after transplant
Response Rate Using EBMT(European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplan) Criteria at Day +100 After Transplant., CR :Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<=5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg per 24 hour.

Partial Response:\>=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200mg per 24 hour., 100 days after transplant
