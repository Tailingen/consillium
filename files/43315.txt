This is a two-stage study design. The first stage consists of focus groups interviews. Three focus groups with 6-8 patients (colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at least one year ago) in each group, will be invited. The focus group interviews will be moderated by one researcher, but accompanied with a second observing researcher. The participants will be identified using the regional Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry in Västra Götaland. The participants will be contacted by a short letter (appendix) indicating that we will call them with more information. The participants will by phone be asked to participate in the study and then invited to the focus groups.

The second phase of the project includes a questionnaire, which will be sent to 200 patients from the same population. The questionnaires will be delivered by using the Sunet Survey system, which is a system approved by University of Gothenburg. If the participants prefers a paper copy, or lack the possibility to reply online, a paper copy will be send via mail instead.

At this moment the investigators have developed a questionnaire, which may be refined due to the understating achieved from the focus group interviews.
