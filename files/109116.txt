Adebrelimab + Apatinib in SCLC Maintenance Therapy
This prospective clinical study aims to evaluate and observe the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab combined with Apatinib in maintenance therapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer using a single-arm trial design.

The study is planned to be conducted in Shaanxi Province, China, with an initial target enrollment of 60 patients. The study commenced in February 2024, and recruitment is expected to conclude around December 2025, with the trial anticipated to end by December 2026. Assuming no occurrences such as withdrawal of informed consent by subjects, intolerable adverse drug reactions, or investigator-assessed unsuitability for further participation, each participant's estimated duration of study treatment will continue until radiographically confirmed tumor progression.
