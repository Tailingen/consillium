Low-Literacy Physician-Patient Intervention Promoting Colorectal Cancer Screening
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a low literacy, physician and patient-directed intervention to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among the medically underserved.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Physician Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Physician and Patient Intervention
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening Completion, CRC screening completion via Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) or Colonoscopy, within 6 months of provider recommendation|Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening Completion, CRC screening completion via FOBT, FIT or Colonoscopy, within 6 months of provider recommendation
Provider Recommendation of CRC Screening, Provider recommendation of CRC Screening based on chart review, 6 months following patient enrollment into study
This study will test the separate and combined effect of two of these interventions: 1) a provider communication skills training using a continuous quality improvement (CQI) framework, and 2) a brief, multimedia Patient Education Program (PEP) that incorporates plain language, graphic design, and audio voice-over to overcome literacy limitations. Our provider intervention has demonstrated efficacy to significantly improve CRC screening recommendation rates. Our multimedia program has also been field tested among patients with limited literacy and was able to improve patient knowledge and intention to receive screening.

We will implement both provider-only and combined provider-patient strategies within a federally qualified health center network to determine the most effective and efficient approach to promote CRC screening in these settings. Results from the study, supplemented by cost analyses and the process evaluation will directly inform translational strategies for cancer prevention within difficult community-based healthcare settings.
