Behavioral Economics for Activity Motivation in Adolescents (BEAM)
There is an urgent need to engineer targeted physical activity interventions that are effective and scalable for obese adolescents and young adults (AYA) with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who often have very low levels of physical activity. The BEAM Trial is a proposed mobile health (mHealth) intervention that uses behavioral economic-informed financial incentives and text messaging to promote physical activity in AYA with T2D and prediabetes.

Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA), Effects of time spent in MVPA will be measured by assessing the weekly mean minutes in MVPA per day, 12 weeks
Daily Step Count, Daily step count will be measured by assessing the daily mean steps, 12 weeks
