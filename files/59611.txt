Effects of Fluconazole and Itraconazole CYP3A-Mediated Inhibition on the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of MLN4924 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple-dose administration of fluconazole on the single-dose intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetics (PK) of MLN4924; and to assess the effect of multiple-dose administration of itraconazole on the single-dose IV PK of MLN4924.

Part A: Plasma Clearance (CLp) for MLN4924, Days 1 and 8: predose and at multiple time-points (up to 72 hours) postdose for Part A|Part A Tmax: Time to Reach the Cmax for MLN4924, Days 1 and 8: predose and at multiple time-points (up to 72 hours) postdose for Part A|Part A: Volume of Distribution (Vz) for MLN4924, Days 1 and 8: predose and at multiple time-points (up to 72 hours) postdose for Part A|Part A: Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (T1/2) for MLN4924, Days 1 and 8: predose and at multiple time-points (up to 72 hours) postdose for Part A|Part A: Blood to Plasma (B/P) Concentration Ratio for MLN4924, Day 1 up to 24 hours post infusion|Number of Participants Who Experience at Least 1 Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 40 for Part A; approximately Cycle 29 for Part B)|Number of Participants With TEAEs Related to Clinically Significant Laboratory Evaluation Findings, Part A: Baseline up to Day 40; Part B: Baseline up to approximately Cycle 29 Day 35|Number of Participants With TEAEs Related to Clinically Significant Vital Sign Findings, Part A: Baseline up to Day 40; Part B: Baseline up to approximately Cycle 29 Day 35|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Body Weight Measurements, Part A: Baseline up to Day 40; Part B: Baseline up to approximately Cycle 29|Part B: Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than \[\<\]10 millimeter \[mm\]). PR was defined as at least 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions., Baseline up to symptomatic deterioration, progressive disease (PD), treatment discontinuation, or until the study is stopped (approximately Cycle 29)|Part B: Duration of Response, The duration of response was defined in participants with disease response (CR or PR) as the time between the first documentation of response and progressive disease (PD). Responders without PD will be censored at the last clinical assessment of response. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). PR was defined as at least 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., Time from the date of first documentation of a response and PD (approximately up Cycle 29)
The drug being tested in this study is MLN4924. MLN4924 is being evaluated to assess drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with the moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors, fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively, in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the blood concentrations of MLN4924 as it relates to treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole.

The study will enroll approximately 52 participants. In Part A, participants will be administered MLN4924 via a 1-hour (+- 5 minutes) intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with either fluconazole or itraconazole administered orally. After participants complete Part A, they will have the opportunity to begin treatment in Part B. In Part B, participants will be administered MLN4924 via a 1-hour (+- 5 minutes) IV infusion in combination with either docetaxel or carboplatin + paclitaxel, the three of which would also be administered intravenously.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participation in Part A of this study will include a screening visit and two weeks of treatment; participation in Part B of this study will include up to an 8-week drug washout period (from last dosing in Part A) and treatment until participants experience symptomatic deterioration, progressive disease, until treatment is discontinued for another reason, or until the study is stopped.
