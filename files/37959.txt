A Study of of HOT1030 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase 1, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of HOT-1030 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: HOT-1030
Safety and tolerability as measured by incidence of AEs (Adverse Events), Incidence and severity of AEs, Adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., through study completion， an average of 1 year
Area Under Curve (AUC) of HOT-1030, Area under the concentration-time curve of HOT-1030 in plasma over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity, 42 days|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of HOT-1030, Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) in plasma, 42 days|Antitumor Activity of HOT-1030 in Patients With advanced Solid Tumors, Response is defined as a Complete Response + Partial Response and was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., through study completion， an average of 1 year
This study is an open-label, Phase 1, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD profiles of HOT-1030 as a monotherapy to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
