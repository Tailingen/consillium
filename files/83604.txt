Peptide Vaccination in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer (STF-II)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate overall survival and immunological monitoring for peptide vaccination therapy using novel cancer testis antigens (STF-II) for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Esophageal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: vaccination
overall survival, death from start of treatment
CTL response, CTL response after 5 round vaccination|DTH response, Skin reaction after 5 round vaccination|Progression free survival, time from start of vaccination until disease progreesion
The phase II multicenter trial of vaccination study using peptides derived from URLC10, CDCA1, and KOC1 for locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who had failed for the standard therapy are performed to evaluate the survival benefit of the cancer vaccination.
