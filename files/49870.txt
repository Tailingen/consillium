Development of a Tumor Molecular Analyses Program and Its Use to Support Treatment Decisions
The primary objective of this specimen correlative study is two-fold: to provide a mechanism for the association of known molecular alterations with clinical outcomes, and to provide rapid genetic profiling of alterations with known clinical utility using tumor and germline specimens to support treatment decisions.
Neoplasm
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Tumor Genetic Sequencing
Proportion of Patients With a Reportable Genetic Variant, To estimate the proportion of patients enrolled on the study who have undergone successful sequencing and have a reportable genetic variant identified, 1 year|Progression Free Survival, Estimate Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 2 years in cancer patients with active disease with a reportable genetic variant and those without a reportable genetic variant, 2 Year
Collect and Describe Clinical Data, To collect and describe clinical data including treatment outcomes after availability of results in patients, 1 Year|Progression Free Survival, To compare progression free survival ratios between cancer patients with active disease with reportable genetic variant who were treated based on variant and those who were not treated based on a variant, 1 Year
