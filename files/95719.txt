Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease without sufficient clinical data supporting the management and treatment. The treatment of MBC arises from data extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC). MBC has higher mortality than FBC. Previous studies have suggested differences between MBC and FBC; however, treatments remain the same for both. Larger studies in MBC are needed to provide more clinical data to help guide treatment.
