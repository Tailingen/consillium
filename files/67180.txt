A Recurrence Nomogram for Hepatoid Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach
This study aims to develop a nomogram to predict postoperative recurrence of HAS and guide individually tailored surveillance strategies.
Gastric Cancer
Reurrence-free survival, Reurrence-free survival was defined as the time interval from the date of the operation to the date of first recurrence or death from any cause., 3 year
Patients were included from the China Hepatoid Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach Study Group (China-HASSG) database, which comprises 14 tertiary referral centers. All the patients who had undergone complete resection of a primary HAS between April 2004 and December 2019 were included. First, univariate analysis was performed in Cox regression to identify the risk factors associated with RFS. Next, variables with P\< 0.05 in univariable analysis were included in the multivariable model, and the forward likelihood ratio method was used for analysis to confirm the independent prognostic factors associated with RFS. Finally, based on the results of multivariable analysis, variables that achieved significance at P\< 0.05 were selected to formulate a nomogram.
