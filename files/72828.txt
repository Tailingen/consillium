A Study of Rozanolixizumab in Pediatric Study Participants With Moderate to Severe Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (sc) administration of rozanolixizumab in pediatric participants aged ≥2 to \<18 years with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG).
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: rozanolixizumab
Occurrence of serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) up to the End of Study (EOS) Visit, Serious TEAEs are any untoward medical incidence in a subject during administered study treatment, whether or not these events are related to study treatment and additionally are emergent untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

* Results in death
* Is life-threatening
* Requires in patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
* Results in persistent disability/incapacity
* Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
* Important medical events, From Baseline up to the EOS Visit (up to 18 weeks)|Occurrence of TEAEs leading to permanent withdrawal of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) up to the EOS Visit, An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product., From Baseline up to the EOS Visit (up to 18 weeks)|Occurrence of Adverse Event(s) of Special Monitoring (AESM) up to the EOS Visit (up to 18 weeks), AESMs are: Severe and/or serious headache, suspected aseptic meningitis, severe Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and opportunistic infection., From Baseline up to the EOS Visit (up to 18 weeks)
Percent change in total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from Baseline at the end of Week 6, Plasma concentration analyses of total IgG will be done for all study participants on an ongoing basis throughout the study., From Baseline to the end of Week 6|Absolute change in total IgG from Baseline at the end of Week 6, Plasma concentration analyses of total IgG will be done for all study participants on an ongoing basis throughout the study., From Baseline to the end of Week 6|Percent change from Baseline in myasthenia gravis (MG) autoantibody levels at the end of Week 6, Plasma concentration analyses of MG specific anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) autoantibodies will be done for all study participants on an ongoing basis throughout the study., From Baseline to the end of Week 6|Absolute change from Baseline in MG-specific autoantibody levels at the end of Week 6, Plasma concentration analyses of anti-AChR or anti-MuSK autoantibodies will be done for all study participants on an ongoing basis throughout the study., From Baseline to the end of Week 6|Change from Baseline in Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score at the end of Week 6, The MG-ADL score is an 8-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument. The MG-ADL targets symptoms and disability across ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and axial symptoms. The item responses are scored from 0 to 3, and the total score of MG-ADL is the sum of the 8 items and ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating more disability., From Baseline to the end of Week 6|Change from Baseline in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score at the end of Week 6, QMG score is a standardized and validated quantitative strength scoring system that was developed specifically for MG. The QMG total score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (13 items; Responses: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3). The score ranges from 0 to 39, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity., From Baseline to the end of Week 6|Occurrence of other TEAEs (including headache, nausea, and infusion site reactions) during Treatment Period 1 (TP1) and Observation Period 1 (OP1), An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product., During TP1 and OP1 (up to 14 weeks)|Evaluation of local tolerability at each scheduled assessment during TP1, Local tolerability will be evaluated at each scheduled assessment for all study participants during TP1., At each scheduled assessment during TP1 (Baseline, week 2, 3, 4, 5, up to 6 weeks)|Plasma concentration of rozanolixizumab at the 6-week treatment cycle, Plasma concentration analyses of rozanolixizumab will be done for all study participants on an ongoing basis throughout the study., At the 6-week treatment cycle|Incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) at the end of Week 6, Plasma concentration analyses of ADAs will be done for all study participants on an ongoing basis throughout the study., At the end of Week 6
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (sc) administration of rozanolixizumab in pediatric participants aged ≥2 to \<18 years with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG).
