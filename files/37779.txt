Pan-genome Analysis of Neuroblastoma by Comparative Genomic Hybridization and Correlation With Pathology for the Diagnostic and the Prognostic Classification
Neuroblastoma (NB) is characterized by its wide heterogeneity in clinical presentation and evolution. Recent retrospective studies have revealed by CGH-array that the overall genomic pattern is an important prognostic marker which might be taken into account for treatment stratification.

This protocol deals with a prospective analysis of the genomic profile established by CGH-array on the tumor samples obtained at the diagnosis of all the patients with NB in France, to obtain genomic profiles and being able to determine their prognostic impact in the various protocols of treatment. The objective of this study will be a better therapeutic stratification in the future trials, studies or protocols of treatment.
Neuroblastoma
PROCEDURE: Blood sampling
Progression-Free survival, Time between patient diagnosis and tumoral progression or relapse or death. Correlation with the genomic profile established by CGH-array., 3 years
Progression at metastatic location-Free survival, Time between patient diagnosis and progression/ relapse at metastatic location or death.

Correlation with the genomic profile established by CGH-array., 3 years|Overall-Free survival, Time between patient diagnosis and death.Correlation with the genomic profile established by CGH-array., 3 years
After diagnosis of Neuroblastoma (NB) or Ganglioneuroblastoma :

* Frozen tumor sample (cell content â‰¥60%) must be sent for genomic profile determination by CGH-array,
* Blood sample at diagnosis must be sent to evaluate MYCN amplification in plasma,
* In case of NB with a MYCN amplification, blood sample during treatment and follow-up must be sent.
