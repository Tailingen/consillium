Effect of Artificial Tears on Radioiodine Levels in the Nasolacrimal Duct System
The purpose of this study is to explore whether administration of preservative free artificial tears will decrease the level of detectable radioiodine in the tears and nasolacrimal duct system of patients undergoing radioiodine therapy for thyroid carcinoma and thus decrease the risk of developing radioactive iodine associated nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
Thyroid Carcinoma|Radioactive Iodine Level
DRUG: Artificial Tears
Change in Level of Radioactive Iodine in Tears, The radioactive iodine activity level in the tears will be measured, as collected via contact lenses. Each patient will have a control eye and an experimental eye that received artificial tears. The control eye has no intervention. The radioactive iodine activity level will be measured over four days, with Day 1 occurring on the Day of systemic radioactive iodine therapy. On each of the four days, the level of radioactive iodine will be compared between the control and experimental eyes to see if there is a statistical difference between the control and experimental eyes., Over a 4 day period
Primary Objective:

- To assess whether use of preservative free artificial tears following radioactive iodine administration will lower the level of radioactive iodine in the tears of patients treated with radioactive iodine for thyroid carcinoma.

Secondary Objective:

- To evaluate whether artificial tears would be an effective preventative intervention to decrease the risk of developing nasolacrimal duct stenosis, which has been associated with radioactive iodine administration.
