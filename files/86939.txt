Connect® Myeloid Disease Registry
The purpose of the Connect® Myeloid disease registry is to provide unique insights into treatment decisions and treatment patterns as they relate to clinical outcomes of patients with myeloid diseases in routine clinical practice. This disease registry will also evaluate molecular and cellular markers that may provide further prognostic classification which may or may not be predictive of therapy and clinical outcomes.

This Disease Registry will collect data on patient characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes. The objective is to describe how patients with myeloid diseases are treated; and to build a knowledge base regarding the effectiveness and safety of first line and subsequent treatment regimens in both community and academic settings. Enrolled patients will receive treatment and evaluations for their disease according to the standard of care and routine clinical practice at each study site. All treatments that patients receive for their disease will be recorded, including initial treatment and any subsequent therapy. Data on treatment outcomes, including response rates as measured by the treating physician, evidence of progression, survival, and patient-reported outcomes will be collected quarterly on the electronic CRF.
