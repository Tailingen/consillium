A Study of RC48-ADC Combined With Toripalimab For First-line Treatment of Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a Phase 3, Open-Label, Multicenter, Randomised, Controlled Study designed to compare RC48-ADC in Combination With JS001 to Chemotherapy Alone in Previously Untreated HER2-Expressing Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma.

Progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by independent review committee, Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by independent review committee according to the RECIST 1.1 standard., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the date of death of the subject., Up to approximately 3 years
Objective remission rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by the independent efficacy evaluation committee according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation (the evaluation by the investigator will also be performed)., Up to approximately 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by the investigator, Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of relief (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, Up to approximately 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as cases where objective remission (assessed as complete remission or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study., Up to approximately 3 years
This is a Phase 3, Open-Label, Multicenter, Randomised, Controlled Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RC48-ADC,a recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate, in Combination With JS001,a PD-1 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of Previously Untreated HER2-Expressing Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma.
