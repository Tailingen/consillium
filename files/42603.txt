Retrospective Evaluation of the Clinical Results Obtained in Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated at the San Giovanni Battista Hospital.
This study provides for the collection of a series composed by patients with newly diagnosed of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the period 1999-2011. This collection is carried out with retrospective investigation, through the review of paper and electronic records and data cards in large part already collected as part of study protocols "GIMEMA" or "BFM" or "NILG" approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital. The purpose of data collection is to check with retrospective predictability of classical risk factors in relation to disease response, and overall survival of the event-free survival, to estimate the cumulative incidence of competitive events such as the emergence of disease, acute and chronic transplant, the transplant-related mortality and relapse of disease.
