Tislelizumab Combined with Nab-Paclitaxel for First-Line Treatment of Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer with Bone Metastasisï¼Œan Exploratory, Single-Arm, Multicenter Phase II Clinical Study
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if Tislelizumab Combined with Nab-Paclitaxel works to treat patients of TNBC with bone metastasis as first line treatment. It will also learn about the safety of the combination. The main questions it aims to answer are:

How effective is the combination therapy of tislelizumab and nab-paclitaxel in treating advanced first-line triple-negative breast cancer with bone metastasis? And is it safe?

Participants will:

* Receive the treatment as follows: Tislelizumab, 200mg, intravenous, every 3 weeks; nab-paclitaxel, 125mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8, followed by once every three weeks; RANKL inhibitor chosen by investigator is administered at a dose of 120 mg every 4 weeks, with dosing on Days 1, 8, and 15 during the first cycle.
* Visit the clinic once every 3 weeks for checkups and tests
* Keep a diary of their symptoms and the number of times they use a rescue inhaler
