Open Label Phase I/Randomised,Double Blind Phase II Study in mCRPC of AZD5363 In Combination With DP Chemotherapy
The aim of the ProCAID study is to determine if the addition of the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 to docetaxel and prednisolone (DP) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) in Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to a degree worthy of further investigation
