An Efficacy and Safety Study Of Pracinostat In Combination With Azacitidine In Adults With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study of pracinostat vs. placebo with azacitidine (AZA) as background therapy in patients ≥ 18 years of age with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia and cytogenetic low-risk AML, who are unfit to receive intensive remission induction chemotherapy due to age ≥ 75 years or comorbidities. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: Group A (experimental group) to receive pracinostat plus AZA and Group B (control group) to receive placebo plus AZA. Randomization will be stratified by cytogenetic risk category (intermediate vs. unfavorable-risk, according to SWOG Cytogenetic Risk Category Definitions) and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2). Treatments will be administered based on 28-day cycles, with pracinostat/placebo administered orally once every other day, 3 times a week for 3 weeks, followed by one week of no treatment and AZA administered for 7 days of each cycle. Study treatment should continue until there is documented disease progression, relapse from complete remission (CR), or non-manageable toxicity. A minimum of 6 cycles may be required to achieve a complete remission. Once permanently discontinued from study treatment, patients will enter the Long-term Follow-up phase of the study and will be followed for assessment of disease progression, if applicable, and survival every 3 months (±1 month) until death. The end of this study is defined when 390 events (deaths) have occurred and the study is unblinded for final overall survival analysis. Patients who are receiving study treatment at the end of the study may have the opportunity to continue to receive the study drugs to which they were randomized to (Post- Study Observation Period), until the Sponsor informs the Investigators of the appropriate course of action based on the study results. The Post-Study Observation Period is defined as the period starting from the end of the study for a maximum of 12 months.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Pracinostat|DRUG: Placebos|DRUG: Azacitidine
Overall Survival, OS measures the time from randomization to death due to any cause., 826 days
Morphologic Complete Remission (CR) Rate, The CR rate is the proportion of patients who achieve a morphologic CR according to the response criteria

* \<5% blasts in a bone marrow aspirate sample with spicules
* There should be no blasts with Auer rods
* No EMD
* Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1,000/μL
* Platelet count of ≥100,000/μL
* Patient must be independent of transfusions (for at least 1week before each assessment), 744 days|Complete Remission Without Minimal Residual Disease (CRmrd) Rate, proportion of patients who achieve a CR without minimal residual disease by multicolor flow cytometry according to the following criteria

* Morphologic CR
* Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by MFC negative, 826 days|Cytogenetic Complete Remission (CRc) Rate, The CRc rate is the proportion of patients who achieve a reversion to a normal karyotype at CR within the study period. This endpoint applies only to patients with abnormal cytogenetic at enrollment according to the following criterion

Morphologic CR plus reversion to a normal karyotype (defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells), 826 days|Transfusion Independence (TI), Transfusion independence rate is defined as the proportion of patients who show eight weeks or over without red blood cell (RBC-TI) and/or platelet (PLT-TI) transfusion during study period, 826 days
Composite Complete Remission (cCR) Rate, Composite complete remission (cCR) rate is the proportion of patients who achieve either a disease response of CR, CRi or MLFS (i.e., cCR = CR + CRi + MLFS) within the study period, according to the response criteria, 744 days|Duration of Composite Complete Remission, Duration of cCR response is the time from first cCR until documented relapse (the definition of relapse from CR will be applied) or death. Duration of cCR is only defined for patients who achieve a cCR, 744 days|Change in Quality of Life From Baseline (EORTC QLQ-C30 - European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30), QLQ-C30 is made of multi-item scales and single-item measures (functional and symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale and single items). Item range is the difference between possible max and min response to individual items of the scale; most items take values from 1 to 4 (range=3). Global health status takes values from 1 to 7 (range = 6). For statistical analysis purpose, single-item and scale values were all standardized (according to linear transformation described in Scoring Manual) to obtain scores ranging 0-100. An high scale score represents an higher response level. Thus an high score for a functional scale represents an high/healthy level of functioning, an high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL, an high score for a symptom scale/item represents an high level of symptomatology/problems., from baseline up to 660 days|Relapse Free Survival, the time from the date of achievement of CR or CRi until the date of relapse or death from any cause, 744 days|Progressive Free Survival Rate (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of relapse (progression), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 800 days|Duration of Morphologic CR, Duration of morphologic CR is defined as the time from the date of achievement of CR until the date of relapse (progression)., 744 days|Time to CR, Time to CR is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of CR in the absence of interceding therapies. The analysis set was the ITT set., 616 days|Morphologic CR Within 6 Cycles Rate, Morphologic CR within 6 cycles rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved CR in the absence of interceding therapies within 6 treatment cycles (i.e., during treatment phase up to Day 1 of Cycle 7 included). Analysis was performed in the ITT set., within 6 cycles
