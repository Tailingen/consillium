Clinico-biological Characterization and Survival of Patients With Adult T-cell Leukemia / Lymphoma (ATL) and Patients Chronically Infected With the HTLV-1 Virus (HTLV-OBS)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome (survival) of Adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma (ATL) patients who receive or not specific treatment for their hemopathy (cohort 1) and the outcome (survival) of HTLV-1 chronically infected patients with / without extra-haematological disorders (cohort 2).
