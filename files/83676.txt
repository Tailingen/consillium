Long-term Follow-up Study for Patients Previously Treated With a Juno CAR T-Cell Product
This study will provide long-term follow-up for patients who have received treatment with a Juno CAR T-cell product in a Juno-sponsored clinical trial. In this study, patients will be followed for up to 15 years after their last dose of Juno CAR T cells for evaluation of delayed adverse events, presence of persisting CAR T-cell vector sequences, presence of replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) or lentivirus (RCL), and survival.
