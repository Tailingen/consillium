Randomized Trial of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin Versus S-1/Cisplatin in Advanced Biliary Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy between gemcitabine/cisplatin and S-1/cisplatin in the first-line treatment in advanced biliary tract cancer.
Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer|Locally Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine, Cisplatin|DRUG: S-1, Cisplatin
Time to progression, From the assigned day to the disease progression or the last day of follow-up without progression. Clinically assessment would be done every cycle (month) and radiologically assessed every 6 weeks with CT scan
Response rate Overall survival Safety profile, Overall survival is measured from the first day of assignment until death or the last day of the follow-up.Clinically assessment would be done every cycle (month) and radiologically assessed every 2 cycles (6 weeks) with CT scan
Standard chemotherapy regimen for biliary tract cancer(BTC) has not been established due to the difficulty associated with performing clinical trials in this field.

Gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil and S-1, are routinely used for BTC chemotherapy. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines published in 2009 recommend either gemcitabine-based or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy or clinical trials for first-line treatment.
