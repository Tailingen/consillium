A Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Effectiveness of EZM0414 (IPN60210) Investigative Product in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
This study will include participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Multiple Myeloma (MM). MM is a type of cancer of the blood. This study will also include participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

DLBCL is also a type of cancer of the blood. They are referred to as 'relapsed' when the disease has come back after treatment and 'refractory' when treatment no longer works. The study has 2 main parts, called phase 1 and phase 1b. The main objective of both parts will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug, called EZM0414.

The main objective of phase 1b will also be to determine the effectiveness of EZM0414. During phase 1 six dose levels will be tested to obtain the most tolerated dose. Participants will receive study drug at the assigned dose level every 28 days. During phase 1b participants will receive study drug at the maximum tolerated dose in 28-day cycles.

Part 1: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose, resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-subject hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or resulted in a congenital abnormality or birth defect, was an important medical event. A TEAE was an AE that started or worsened in severity on or after the date of the first dose of the study treatment through 30 days after the end of treatment., From first dose of study treatment (Day 1) up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (Day 57), up to approximately 87 days|Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), According to National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, DLT was defined as any of following AE that occurred in Part 1 during first cycle of study treatment: grade (G)4 neutropenia lasting \>5 days; G3 febrile neutropenia; G3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; G4 thrombocytopenia; G4 anemia unexplained by underlying disease; any other non-hematological toxicity ≥3 except: alopecia, G3 nausea/vomiting or diarrhea for \<3 days with supportive care, G3 fatigue for \<1 week, G3 or higher isolated electrolyte abnormalities for up to 3 days, not clinically complicated, and resolved spontaneously, or responded to conventional medical interventions; G3 or higher amylase/lipase elevation without symptoms of pancreatitis; G3 tumor lysis syndrome for up to 3 days, not clinically complicated, and resolved spontaneously, or responded to conventional medical interventions; and any participant meeting Hy's law criteria., From first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) up to end of the Cycle 1 (Cycle 1 Day 28), maximum of 28 days|Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was planned to be assessed in Part 2. ORR was defined as percentage of responders as assessed by Investigator per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 guidelines for MM (complete response \[CR\], stringent CR \[sCR\], partial response \[PR\], very good PR \[VGPR\]) or Lugano 2014 guidelines for DLBCL (CR+PR). Per IMWG response criteria, CR: negative immunofixation on serum and urine; disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas; \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow(BM); sCR: CR + normal free light chain (FLC) ratio; absence of BM clonal cells by immunohistochemistry; VGPR: serum and urine M-protein (MP) detected by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum MP + urine MP\<100 mg/24 hours (h) or ≥90% decrease in sum of maximal perpendicular diameter (SPD) compared to baseline in soft tissue plasmacytoma; PR: ≥50% reduction of serum MP and reduction in 24 h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200 mg/24 h; ≥50% reduction in size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas., Tumour assessments were planned to be performed at Screening (within 28 days before start of study treatment) or Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre-dose) up to end of the study, approximately 23 months
Part 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was planned to be assessed in Part 2. PFS was defined as the time from start of treatment until the first documented progressive disease (PD), as assessed by Investigator per IMWG 2016 guidelines for MM or Lugano 2014 guidelines for DLBCL or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per IMWG response criteria, PD was defined as any 1 or more of the following criteria: a) increase of ≥25% from lowest confirmed value in either serum MP, serum MP increase ≥1 gram/deciliter (g/dL) if the lowest M-component was ≥5 g/dL or urine M-component, b) appearance of new lesion(s), ≥50% increase from nadir in SPD of \>1 lesion, or ≥50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion \>1 centimeter (cm) in short axis., Tumour assessments were planned to be performed at Screening (within 28 days before start of study treatment) or Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre-dose) up to end of the study, approximately 23 months|Part 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was planned to be assessed in Part 2.DCR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed CR,sCR,PR,VGPR,minimal response(MR) or stable disease(SD) per IMWG 2016 guidelines for MM/CR,PR, or SD per Lugano 2014 guidelines for DLBCL.Per IMWG response criteria,CR:negative immunofixation on serum and urine;disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas;\<5% plasma cells in BM; sCR:CR+normal FLC ratio;absence of BM clonal cells by immunohistochemistry; VGPR:serum and urine MP detected by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum MP+urine MP\<100 mg/24h or ≥90% decrease in SPD in soft tissue plasmacytoma; PR:≥50% reduction of serum MP and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg/24h;≥50% reduction in size(SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas. MR:≥25% but ≤49% reduction in serum MP and reduction in 24h urine MP by 50-89%, which exceed 200 mg/24h; ≥50% reduction in size(SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas.SD:Not meeting criteria for CR,VGPR,PR,MR, or PD., Tumour assessments were planned to be performed at Screening (within 28 days before start of study treatment) or Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre-dose) up to end of the study, approximately 23 months|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was planned to be assessed in Part 2. DOR was defined as the time from initial CR or PR to documented progression or death, whichever came first, as assessed by Investigator per IMWG 2016 guidelines for MM or Lugano 2014 guidelines for DLBCL. Per IMWG response criteria, CR: negative immunofixation on serum and urine; disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas; \<5% plasma cells in BM. PR: ≥50% reduction of serum MP and reduction in 24 h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200 mg/24 h; ≥50% reduction in the size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas. PD: any 1 or more of the following criteria: a) increase of ≥25% from lowest confirmed value in either serum MP, serum MP increase ≥1 g/dL if the lowest M-component was ≥5 g/dL or urine M-component, b) appearance of new lesion(s), ≥50% increase from nadir in SPD of \>1 lesion, or ≥50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion \>1 cm in short axis., Tumour assessments were planned to be performed at Screening (within 28 days before start of study treatment) or Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre-dose) up to end of the study, approximately 23 months
The first part of the study will be a Phase 1 dose-escalation designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of EZM0414 in subjects with R/R MM and R/R DLBCL.

Six dose levels starting at 100 mg, then 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg as well as an optional step-down dose of 75 mg (if needed) will be tested. The second part of the study is the Phase 1b dose expansion at the MTD designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in subjects with R/R DLBCL and R/R MM with or without select genetic translocation.

Dose expansion will enroll subjects in 3 cohorts: Cohort 1 for R/R MM subjects with t(4;14), Cohort 2 for R/R MM subjects without t(4;14), and Cohort 3 for subjects with R/R DLBCL.
