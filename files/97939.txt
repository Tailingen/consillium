Optical Biopsy in Gynecological Surgery
Optical biopsy is a new technology that generates a real-time, cell-based, high-resolution view and analysis of tissues. Observation is instantaneous and non-invasive. This allows reliable and fast diagnosis which facilitates decision making as well as patient management.

The investigator have already conducted a feasibility study on the use of this new technology to evaluate ovarian and tubal pre-cancerous lesions in laparoscopy. In this new study, he wants to continue investigations, expand its use to other gynecological pathologies, and demonstrate the benefit of such a non-invasive technology in gynecology on the one hand in the diagnosis of lesions but also to appreciate the margins as accurately as possible surgical excision of tumors and / or endometriosis lesions.

The investigator have set up a prospective monocentric descriptive study. The hypothesis is that optical biopsy by Cellvizio® allows to observe in real time microscopically tissues and to characterize them in the field of gynecological surgery
