A Study of Vismodegib in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Relapsed Refractory High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This study will assess the safety and efficacy of vismodegib in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and relapsed/refractory high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients in Cohort 1 will receive single-agent vismodegib 150 mg orally daily. In Cohort 2, patients will receive vismodegib 150 mg orally daily in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously for 10 days.

Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent.

DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: vismodegib
Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or CR With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi) or Morphologic Leukemia Free State (MLFS) or Partial Response (PR) at Week 8, CR was defined as achieved if the neutrophils count was greater than (\>) 1000 cells per microliter (µL), platelets count \>100000/µL, bone marrow blasts percentage (%) less than (\<) 5, no Auer rods (clumps of azurophilic granular material that form elongated needles seen in the cytoplasm of leukemic blasts), no transfusion requirements and no signs of extra medullary disease (EMD). CRi was defined if either of the cell (neutrophil or platelet) lineage was not recovered (neutrophils \>1000 cells/µL or Not applicable \[NA\] or platelets count \>100000/µL or NA), bone marrow blasts \<5% with no Auer rods and confirmed by flow cytometry with no signs of EMD. MLFS (neutrophil and platelet criteria were NA) was defined as bone marrow blasts \<5% with no Auer rods and confirmed by flow cytometry with no signs of EMD. PR was defined as neutrophils count \>1000 cells/µL, platelets count \>100000/µL, and \>50% decrease from baseline to a range of 5-25% of bone marrow blasts or blasts \<5% with Auer rods., Week 8
Percentage of Participants With CR, CRi, MLFS or PR at Anytime During Study Treatment, CR was defined as achieved if the neutrophils count \>1000 cells/µL, platelets count \>100000/µL, bone marrow blasts \<5%, no Auer rods (clumps of azurophilic granular material that form elongated needles seen in the cytoplasm of leukemic blasts), no transfusion requirements and no signs of EMD. CRi was defined if either of the cell (neutrophil or platelet) lineage was not recovered (neutrophils \> 1000 cells/µL or NA or platelets count \>100000/µL or NA, bone marrow blasts \<5% with no Auer rods and confirmed by flow cytometry with no signs of EMD. MLFS (neutrophil and platelet criteria were NA) was defined as bone marrow blasts \<5% with no Auer rods and confirmed by flow cytometry with no signs of EMD. PR was defined as neutrophils count \>1000 cells/µL, platelets count \>100000/µL, and \>50% decrease from baseline to a range of 5-25% of bone marrow blasts or blasts \<5% with Auer rods. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed using Blyth-Still-Cassella method., Up to 30 days of last dose of study drug (maximum treatment duration = 225 days)|Duration of Overall Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented overall response to the time of relapse, as determined by the investigator using International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Participants not falling under any of the response criteria \[CR or CRi or MLFS or PR\] described under outcome measure 1 were considered as non-responders) or death from any cause during the study (defined as death within 30 days after the last dose of study drug)., Up to 30 days of last dose of study drug (maximum treatment duration = 225 days)|Median Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS was defined as the time from start of study drug to death from any cause. OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Participants alive at the last date known to be alive were censored for the analysis., Up to death or 30 days of last dose of study drug (maximum treatment duration = 225 days)|Percentage of Participants With an Event of Death During the Study, Up to death or 30 days of last dose of study drug (maximum treatment duration = 225 days)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Steady-state Plasma Concentration of Vismodegib, PK data was planned to be reported only if the results of Cohort 2 are available., Predose on Days 8, 29 and 57|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of Cytarabine, PK data was planned to be reported only if the results of Cohort 2 are available., Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 hours post-dose on Days 1, 8 and 29
