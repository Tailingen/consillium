TAHP for Patients With HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer and Subsequent AHP Adjuvant tHerapy After Surgery
This study was phase IB-II clinical trial that designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel + atezolizumab + Herceptin sc plus pertuzumab(TAHP) plus adjuvant therapy of atezolizumab + trastuzumab + pertuzumab(AHP) after surgery in female patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.

Adjuvant AHP (atezolizumab + Herceptin SC + pertuzumab) will be continued for remaining 1 year.

For non-p CR patients, they are going to treat with 4 cycles of AC rather than Taxane only before AHP adjuvant therapy.
