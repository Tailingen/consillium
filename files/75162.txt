Incidence of Expression of Tumor Antigens in Cancer Tissue From Patients With Pathologically Demonstrated Bladder Cancer
This study aims to analyze the incidence of expression of MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, WT1 and PRAME tumor antigens in cancer tissue from patients with pathologically demonstrated bladder cancer.
Neoplasms, Urinary Bladder
OTHER: Data acquisition and analysis
To determine the gene expression of MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, WT1 and PRAME antigens in pathologically demonstrated bladder cancer., Up to 1 year
There will be no procedure(s) or treatment(s) carried out on patients. All data and samples will be taken from those already stored at the investigation sites. Clinical data collected will include patient demographics (age, gender), Tumor, Node, Metastasis (staging system) \[TNM stage\], and histopathologic description only. Strict anonymity of patient data will be maintained.

This retrospective study is based upon the analysis of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples and patient-related data already available at the investigational site.
