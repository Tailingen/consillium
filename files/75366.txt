Olanzapine for Cancer Related Anorexia-cachexia Syndrome
Cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome is one of the common conditions in cancer patients. Olanzapine has been demonstrated to reduce chemotherapy-induced anorexia. However, there is scarce information regarding olanzapine as a treatment of cancer anorexia among patients who does not receive chemotherapy. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of olanzapine to lessen cancer cachexia-anorexia syndrome.
