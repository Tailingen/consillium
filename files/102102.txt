Phase 2 Study of PI3K Inhibitor Copanlisib in Combination With Fulvestrant in Selected ER+ and/or PR+ Cancers With PI3K (PIK3CA, PIK3R1) and/or PTEN Alterations
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant in advanced hormone receptor-positive (HR+) solid tumors harboring alterations that activate the Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway.

To establish the use of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant administered to subjects with selected estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Part 1: Dose confirmation:

Primary Objective:

• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of copanlisib 60 mg administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1, 8 and 15 in combination with fulvestrant 500 mg administered intramuscularly (IM) on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle to confirm the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination therapy.

Secondary objective:

* To assess the efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with fulvestrant as outlined in Part 2 by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR).
* To evaluate additional efficacy measures such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant.

Exploratory Objectives:

• To investigate target engagement, clonal evolution, and mechanisms of resistance using tissue and liquid biopsies utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as outlined in Part 2.

Part 2: Dose expansion:

Primary objectives:

• To assess the efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with fulvestrant as outlined above by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR). Patients enrolled for Part 1 will be included in this efficacy analysis.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate additional efficacy measures such as PFS and OS of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant.

Exploratory Objectives:

• To investigate target engagement, clonal evolution, and mechanisms of resistance using tissue and liquid biopsies utilizing ctDNA.
