Does Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Lead to Barrett's Esophagus, 5-year Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Findings: A Retrospective Cohort Study
Introduction Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most prevalent approaches to tackle obesity and its co-morbidities. The main complication following the LSG is Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), with most patients developing worsening symptoms of GERD, and a small number progressing to Barrett's esophagus. This retrospective analysis aims to assess the rate of GERD pre- and post- LSG as well as the rate of progression to Barrett's.

Methods Data was collected from 1639 patients. 92 patients fit our inclusion criteria. Data was then analyzed and summarized against similar literature

endoscopy performed on patients, endoscopy will be performed on patients 5 years after undergoing sleeve gastrectomy due to the fact that sleeve tends to lead to reflux which causes dysplasia of esophageal cells, which eventually can lead to barrett's esophagus and cancer., 5 years
