Radiotherapy Alternates Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (Her2) Expression in Human Breast Cancer
Based on fundamental study （in Vitro and in Vivo, Pro. Jianjian Li）， Her2 expression would be changed from negative to positive by cancer irradiation with liner-accelerator at dose 6GY or up. The propose of this study is to reveal the irradiation result on Her2 expression in human breast cancer.
Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 Negative Carcinoma of Breast
Her2 changes during radiotherapy, biopsy is obtained by fine needle biopsy，Her2 is checked by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)., every week up to 6 weeks
