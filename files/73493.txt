Pheochromocytoma and Hemodynamic Instability
The aims of our study were to define perioperative HI during laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma, assess the incidence of perioperative HI, and identify predictive factors of perioperative HI in our group of patients.
Pheochromocytoma|Hypertension|Surgery
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy
Number of Participants with Hemodynamic Instability (n, %), Hemodynamic instability was defined as an occurrence of both intraoperative episodes of systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg and vasoactive (vasodilators or vasoconstrictors) drugs administration. Patients were divided into two groups: one which met both above criteria, and another one without hemodynamic instability., intraoperative
Number of Complications in Patients (n, %), Data on morbidity were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification., Within 30 days after surgery|Number of Cardiovascular Complications in Patients (n, %), Cardiovascular morbidity was defined as postoperative morbidity related to the cardiovascular system: postoperative hypotensive or hypertensive episodes requiring pharmacologic treatment, need for blood transfusion, myocardial or digestive ischemia, stroke, and postoperative hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac-related causes., Within 30 days after surgery

The study was a retrospective observation of consecutive patients with histologically confirmed pheochromocytoma undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy between years 2003 and 2019.
