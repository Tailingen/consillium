Study of Temozolomide to Treat Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to determine if administering temozolomide after completion of stereotactic radiosurgery helps control existing brain metastases and prevents the developement of new brain metastases.
Brain Metastases
DRUG: Temozolomide
Number of Participants Who Developed Distant Brain Failure at One Year., 1 Year
Brain metastases represent a heterogenous group of system tumors whose presence in the central nervous system result in profound neurological devastation. Existing therapies for brain metastases are focused on improving both neurologic function and survival. Therapies aimed at controlling the tumor both at the site of the brain metastases and the rest of the brain have the potential to improve outcomes and quality of life. The combined use of stereotactic radiosurgery followed by temozolomide may represent such a strategy.
