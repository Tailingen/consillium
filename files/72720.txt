The main objective of the study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of Tomosynthesis in detecting the multicentricity of mammary tumor.
Mammary Tumor
OTHER: Evaluation of the Tomosynthesis|OTHER: Avaluation of a medical device: the tomosynthesis
To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of both types of imaging (mammography and Tomosynthesis) with respect to number of tumors multicentric and multifocal identified through MRI., To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of both types of imaging (mammography and Tomosynthesis) with respect to number of tumors multicentric and multifocal identified through MRI. The other parameters VPN, VPP will also be calculated and discussed., January 2013
The secondaries objectives of the study are:
