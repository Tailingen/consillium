Surufatinib and Envafolimab as Second or More-line Therapy in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients
In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safty of surufatinib combined with envafolimab followed by surufatinib as second or more - line therapy in advanced soft tissue sarcoma patients. Patients who have failed at least the first-line therapy and have progressive disease or cannot tolerate within 6 months before enrollment will be treated with surufatinib combined with envafolimab.
Efficacy and Safety of Surufatinib Combined With Envafolimab as Second or More-line Therapy in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients
DRUG: Surufatinib + envafolimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assess ORR, defined as Investigator-assessed CR+PR, per RECIST 1.1., It will be evaluated at about 18 weeks
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD (whichever occurs first). PFS will be determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on investigator response assessment., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of patients with CR/PR/SD in the number of patients that whose tumour can be evaluated., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject's death., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months|Number of Subjects With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0, TEAEs will be defined as the adverse events (AEs) that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 28 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months
