The Adjuvant Effect of HPV Vaccination on Recurrence of Cervical Precancer or Carcinoma in Women Undergoing Conization
Assessment of the association between human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) and recurrences of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in women undergoing conization.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2/3|Recurrence
BIOLOGICAL: vaccination against human papillomavirus infection (HPV vaccination)
CIN2+ recurrence rate, CIN2+ recurrence rate - obtained from the number of women with this find-ing related the number of women with no finding within the time period since the conization; The recurrence rate of CIN2+ will be assessed in relation to vaccination, vaccine type, vaccination completeness, etc., using specific uni-variate analysis (incidence rate ratio) and multivariate analysis (incidence rate ratio or hazard ratio, as appropriate), 2010-2024
CIN2+ recurrence frequency, CIN2+ recurrence frequency - percentage proportion of women with this finding related to all women in follow-up; The recurrence frequency of CIN2+ will be assessed in relation to vaccination, vaccine type, vaccination completeness, etc., using specific univariate analysis (odds ratio, relative risk) and multivariate analysis (odds ratio, relative risk, as appropriate), 2010-2024
The implementation of vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) in the national immunization program for the young age cohort was subsequently extended to previously unvaccinated adult women who underwent conization due to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+).

These women are offered HPV vaccination, often completed post-excision. Observational and clinical studies conducted between 2010 and 2023 have demonstrated that HPV vaccination contributes to a \>70% reduction in CIN2+ recurrence in women after conization. However, the outcomes of these studies have not conclusively shown whether the adjuvant effect of HPV vaccination depends on the vaccine type (bi-, quadri-, or nona-valent), the timing and completeness of vaccination, and other factors.

This study aims to assess the mentioned factors and potentially reveal new ones, such as age, health status, etc. It is planned to be conducted using the laboratory records of women who underwent conization between 2010 and 2024, with their cervical screening examinations performed at the central laboratory UNILABS in Prague
