The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects and side effects of inactive COVID-19 vaccine in patients with cancer. Patients followed up in medical oncology clinic and healthy volunteers will be enrolled in the study. Blood samples of participants will be taken 4 weeks after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After blood samples are centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes, the separated serum will be backed up in two different eppendorf tubes and stored at -80 or -20 degrees. The samples will be delivered to the working center in a manner suitable for cold chain transport. COVID-19 antibody test will be performed on the blood samples. In addition, volunteers will be questioned in terms of side effects that may develop after vaccination and the information obtained will be recorded in the database together with the clinical data of the patients.
