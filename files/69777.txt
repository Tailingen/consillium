Investigating the Use of Fluorescent Lectins to Identify Dysplasia and Cancer During Endoscopy and Surgery
This is a feasibility study investigating the use of a fluorescently conjugated lectin to identify colorectal dysplasia and cancer during colonoscopy and surgery.
Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Neoplasms|Colorectal Polyp
DRUG: Fluorescent Lectin Application
Signal to background ratios of identified colonic lesions under white light and under fluorescence, This outcome measure compares the fluorescence signal of lesions identified during colonoscopy., During procedure|Number of dysplastic and cancerous lesions identified under white light and under fluorescence, Number of lesions identified under white light colonoscopy will be compared to the number of lesions identified under fluorescence., During procedure
Number of dysplastic and cancerous lesions identified under white light and fluorescence in different subgroups, Assessment of subgroups including ulcerative colitis, lesions suspicious of sessile serrated adenomas / traditional serrated adenomas, 12 months|Resection margin of of lesions undergoing TEMS resection under white light and under fluorescence., Planned resection margins will be compared under white light and under fluorescence. R0/R1 resection rates will be assessed post operatively., 12 months
