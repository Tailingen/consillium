Talimogene Laherparepvec With Pembrolizumab in Melanoma Following Progression on Prior Anti-PD-1 Based Therapy (MASTERKEY-115) (Mk-3475-A07/KEYNOTE-A07).
This is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with pembrolizumab following disease progression on prior anti-programmed cell death protein (anti-PD-1) therapy in unresectable/metastatic melanoma (stage IIIB-IVM1d) or prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant setting.
