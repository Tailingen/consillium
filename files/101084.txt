Regorafenib Versus Placebo to Treat Cholangiocarcinoma
The study is a multicenter randomized (1:1) placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase II trial aiming to demonstrate an improvement of median PFS when treating locally advanced unresectable or metastatic patients suffering from an intra-hepatic or hilum (mass-forming) cholangiocarcinoma with Regorafenib as compared to placebo, and after progression after GEM-CDDP (or GEM-OX), or gemcitabine alone followed or preceded by platinum (CDDP or oxaliplatin)-based chemotherapy.

The principal objective is to investigate Regorafenib efficacy by prospectively evaluating the PFS after the administration of Regorafenib combined with BSC as compared to placebo with BSC. Hypothesis is a 50% improvement in median PFS (from 6 weeks to 12 weeks in Regorafenib group).
Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Regorafenib/active|DRUG: Regorafenib/placebo
Improve median PFS, The primary endpoint is to improve median PFS from 6 weeks to 12 weeks in Regorafenib group., 6 to 12 weeks
Evaluation of response rate, -Evaluation of tumor response will be done based on radiological RECIST criteria version 1.1 evaluation (thoraco-abdominal CT scan);, At pretreatment visit (14 to 1 days before treatment initiation), every 6 weeks for 3 times then every 8 weeks until progression|Correlation between radiological response and metabolic response, Correlation between radiological response (using RECIST criteria version 1.1) and metabolic response using PET imaging (SUV max modifications). This will only be done if SUV max of the tumor inside the liver at pre-treatment visit is â‰¥ 175% of the SUV max of the normal liver., At pretreatment visit (14 to 1 days before treatment initiation)|Correlation between radiologic response rate and "Dynamic tumor response rate", Correlation between radiologic response rate (RECIST criteria version 1.1) and "Dynamic tumor response rate". Dynamic response rate is defined by a 20% modification of tumoral perfusion status determined by quantitative DCE-MRI after 14 days of treatment (D1 compared to D15 values);, At day 1 (pre-treatment) and day 15 of cycle 1|Correlation between dynamic tumor response rate and metabolic response rate, Correlation between dynamic tumor response rate and metabolic response rate (Pet CT) when first Pet CT is positive, At cycle 1 day 15|Evaluation of Overall Survival (OS), Evaluation of OS at one year., After 1 year (March 2015)
