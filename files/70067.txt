Androgen Deprivation Therapy or Androgen Deprivation Therapy Plus Definitive Treatment (Radiation or Surgery)
The goal of this clinical research is to learn if treatment with androgen deprivation therapy in combination with surgery or radiation therapy can prolong the progression-free survival of oligometastatic prostate cancer than androgen deprivation therapy alone. The safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.

Today androgen deprivation therapy has been a standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, but as to the special type of prostate cancer-oligometastatic prostate cancer, except for androgen deprivation therapy, whether local treatment can be the part of treatment for it? The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether local treatment combined with androgen deprivation therapy can extend progression-free survival, as well as overall survival and life quality of patients of oligometastatic prostate cancer compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone.
