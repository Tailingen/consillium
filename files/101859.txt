The SERPENTINE trial (ESR 21-21165) is a phase II clinical study aiming to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab and tremelimumab, alone or in combination, in patients with colorectal or endometrial cancer. The trial targets patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors and those with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors.

Colorectal and endometrial cancers present significant challenges due to their heterogeneity and variable responses to treatment. Immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors like durvalumab and tremelimumab, has shown promise in some patients, but predicting response remains elusive. The SERPENTINE trial aims to address this gap by investigating the effectiveness of these immunotherapies in a carefully selected patient population.
Colorectal Cancer|Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Evaluation of Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assess the objective response rate (ORR) of Durvalumab or Tremelimumab 300 mg single dose followed by Durvalumab in patients with microsatellite instable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC) or endometrial cancer (EC) and Tremelimumab 300 mg single dose followed by Durvalumab in refractory microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC and EC according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., From treatment initiation until objective response confirmation or progression of disease (24 months).
Antitumor Activity Assessment (PFS), Evaluate the antitumor activity of Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC based on progression-free survival (PFS)., Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Antitumor Activity Assessment (OS), Evaluate the antitumor activity of Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC based on overall survival (OS)., Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Antitumor Activity Assessment (DoR), Evaluate the antitumor activity of Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC based on duration of response (DoR)., Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Antitumor Activity Assessment (TTMR), Evaluate the antitumor activity of Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC based on time to maximum response (TTMR)., Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Antitumor Activity Assessment (irRR), Evaluate the antitumor activity of Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC based on immune-related response rate (irRR), Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Antitumor Activity Assessment (biomarkers), Evaluate the antitumor activity of Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC based on genomic and immune biomarkers., Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Single-Cell Characterization of Persistent Cells, Characterize persistent cells upon treatment with Durvalumab in MSI CRC/EC and Durvalumab + Tremelimumab in MSS CRC/EC and MSI CRC/EC at a single-cell level., At baseline, at the time of maximal response, and at progression (48 months).|Correlation of Antitumor Activity with Biomarkers, Examine the correlation between the anti-tumor effects of Durvalumab and Durvalumab + Tremelimumab with additional biomarkers found in tumor tissue and blood samples., Throughout the study duration (24 months).|Exploration of Immunotoxicity Biomarkers, Explore biomarkers of immunotoxicity associated with Durvalumab and Durvalumab + Tremelimumab treatment., Throughout the study duration (24 months).
The trial is a single-center, open-label study with two cohorts: one for patients with MSI-H tumors and another for those with MSS tumors. Patients will be randomized to receive either durvalumab alone or in combination with tremelimumab. Tumor assessments will be conducted every 8 weeks using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Statistical analysis will employ descriptive statistics, and safety and efficacy data will be analyzed based on intention-to-treat principles.
