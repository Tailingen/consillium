A Study Comparing MB02 and Avastin速 in Subjects With Stage IIIB/IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, 1:1 randomized, parallel-group, equivalence Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of MB02 plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus Avastin速 plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) in subjects with Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: MB02 (Bevacizumab Biosimilar Drug)|DRUG: EU-approved Avastin速|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate (ORR) at Week 18, Objective response rate was assigned for a subject if the subject displayed either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST version 1.1 at Week 18, as assessed by independent radiological review committee (IRC).

Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 weeks from randomisation
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent confirmed progression per RECIST version 1.1, or death (whichever occurred first), measured in weeks and months. For PFS assessment clinical progression (i.e., treatment discontinuation due to progression of disease) was also considered as an event., At Week 52 from randomisation|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent death, measured in weeks and months., At Week 52 from randomisation|Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Comparison of Safety profile. Safety was monitored by incidence of adverse events (AEs). AEs were coded as per MedDRA (version 20.1) and severity was graded according to NCI-CTCAE (version 4.03);, Week 1 to week 52|Immunogenicity Assessments (Anti-drug Antibodies [ADA] and Neutralizing Antibodies [NAb]), Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing ADAs (NAb). Analyses of ADA incidence rate, antibody titer, and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) (following the recommended 3-tier approach) were performed., At Weeks 1, 4, 10, 19, 34 and 52 from randomization and, at the End of Treatment Visit if, an ADA sample has not been collected within the previous 3 weeks
Efficacy parameters, safety profiles and immunogenicity will be compared between MB02 (Bevacizumab Biosimilar Drug) and European (EU)-approved Avastin速
