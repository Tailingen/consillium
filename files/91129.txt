Two Dimensional (2D) Silicon Transducer-Compression Plates for Breast Ultrasound
The study purpose is to help in the developement of 3 dimensional breast ultrasound imaging.
Breast Tumor|Breast Cysts
PROCEDURE: Experimental 3D Breast Ultrasound imaging|PROCEDURE: Experimental Photoacoustic Imaging
To prove the significance/capability of 3D Ultrasound imaging in comparison to current mammographic imaging., Assess the quality of 3 D ultrasound in comparison to conventional mammography, 1 year
To assist in the developement of 3 dimensional breast ultrasound imaging and when possible compare the ultrasound results with 3D mammography (digital tomosynthesis mammography)or clinical mammography and ultrasound. Hopefully that this new, 3D ultrasound imaging can provide important information not found on mammograms or routine breast ultrasound.
