Capivasertib+Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients With Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer and PTEN Deficiency
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of capivasertib plus abiraterone (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo plus abiraterone (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus ADT in participants with mHSPC whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency. The intention of the study is to demonstrate that in participants with mHSPC, the combination of capivasertib plus abiraterone (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus ADT is superior to placebo plus abiraterone (+prednisone/prednisolone) plus ADT in participants with mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency with respect to radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per 1) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue and/or Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG3) for bone as assessed by the investigator 2) death due to any cause.
