Study on the Peristaltic Direction of GI Anastomosis in Roux-en-Y Reconstruction
The aim of this study is intending to provide the optimal procedures of the peristaltic direction of gastrointestinal anastomosis in Roux-en-Y reconstruction after distal curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer, which can provide the best operation mode of Roux-en-Y anastomosis in digestive tract reconstruction during distal gastrectomy for reducing postoperative complications and improving quality of life for patients.
Peristaltic Direction|Roux-en-Y Gastrointestinal Anastomosis|Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Direction procedure of gastrointestinal anastomosis in Roux-en-Y reconstruction
Early postoperative recovery results, Differences of effects of early recovery postoperatively (exhaust, defecation, eating, residual stomach peristalsis, length of hospital stay, etc.), Within 1 month after surgery|Late postoperative recovery results, Differences of late gastrointestinal effects (bile reflux, residual gastritis, gastric emptying function, etc.), 1 year after surgery
Postoperative complications, Postoperative incision infection, anastomotic leakage, intestinal obstruction, reoperation and readmission, etc, Within 1 month after surgery
In this study, all 148 the included patients will underwent the distal curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer and will be performed the Roux-en-Y reconstruction for gastrointestinal anastomosis. Of them, 74 patients will be randomized in the group undergoing with the isoperistaltic anastomosis in the Roux-en-Y reconstruction procedure. Meanwhile, the other 74 cases will be randomized in the group undergoing with the antiperistaltic anastomosis in the Roux-en-Y reconstruction procedure. Then, we will evaluate the differencies of effects of early recovery postoperatively (exhaust, defecation, eating, residual stomach peristalsis, length of hospital stay, etc.) and late gastrointestinal effects (bile reflux, residual gastritis, gastric emptying function, etc.) between above two group of patients, which will make an important contribution to reduce medical costs and potential improvements of the prognosis after distal curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
