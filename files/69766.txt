Cardiotoxicity in Locally Advanced Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Chemoradiation Therapy
This observational cohort will evaluate the cardiovascular effects of chemoradiation used to treat locally advanced, non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be enrolled prior to the start of therapy and followed during and for at least 2 years after therapy with echocardiograms, nuclear stress tests, blood sampling, and quality of life surveys.

Lung cancer is both the most common malignancy worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death in the US. While radiation therapy is highly effective for many solid tumors, thoracic radiation therapy carries a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that limits critical gains in cancer control and survival. The investigators will perform detailed cardiovascular phenotyping using biologic and imaging markers to define functional and physiologic perturbations that occur with radiation therapy. The study will provide insights into how cardiovascular risk factors and disease impact these biologic and functional changes. The investigators will also determine which radiotherapy dose-volume metrics are indicative of subclinical cardiotoxicity.
