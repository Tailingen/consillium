This Study in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia is Done to Determine a Safe and Effective Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Venetoclax
The main objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836826 in combination with venetoclax on the basis of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs incidence rate during the MTD evaluation period of the combination treatment and to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination.

Other objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BI 836826 in combination with venetoclax and to further determine the safety, as well as to evaluate the efficacy of the combination by means of the Complete Response (CR) rate and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity rate.
