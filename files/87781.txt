Trans-catheter Chemo-embolization Combined With rAd-p53 Gene Injection in Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited due to patients' poor condition, advanced tumor, concomitant intra- and extra-liver diseases, and resistance to both chemo- and radio-therapy. Trans-catheter embolization (TAE) or Trans-catheter chemo-embolization (TACE) is the most widely used locoregional treatment for advanced HCC. But no solid evidences support the beneficial effect of the chemotherapy in TACE. Many advanced HCC patients also can't tolerate the locoregional chemotherapy. The p53 gene has multiple anticancer functions and does not have any of the immune-inhibitory effects of chemo- or radio-therapy. The objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy and safety usingTAE plus recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene (rAd-p53) in treatment of advanced HCC.
Advanced Adult Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: TACE plus rAd-p53 artery injection|DRUG: TACE
overall survival, overall survival, tumor assessment will be performed every 6 weeks from starting study treatment to death or 2 years later
safety as assessed by adverse events, vital sign, lab tests, ECG and physical examination, safety variables: adverse events, vital sign, lab tests, ECG and physical examination, from the first study treatment to the 30 days after the last treatment (on an average of 6 months from the start treatment)|progression-free survival, time to disease progression (death or progression), or censored, tumor assessment will be performed every 6 weeks from starting study treatment to disease progression or 2 years later
Study design: multicenter, open-labeled, active-controlled phase II study

Study treatments: TACE combined with rAd-p53 injection vs.TACE. The treatments are given once per 21 days until the disease progression. For the experiment group, 2 X 1000,000,000,000 viral particles of rAd-p53 will be injected into the embolization artery.

Study objectives: efficacy and safety of the study treatments

Study endpoints: safety (adverse events, vital signs, lab tests, ECG and physical examination) and efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival, and ECOG PS)
