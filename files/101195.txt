Gliadel Wafer and Fluorescence-Guided Surgery With 5-ALA Followed by Radiation Therapy And Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Primary Glioblastoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as Gliadel wafer and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy and temozolomide after surgery and Gliadel wafer may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-ALA given together with Gliadel wafer, followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide, in treating patients with primary glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: 5-ALA|DRUG: Gliadel wafers|RADIATION: Radiotherapy as normal based on standard clinical protocols determined by the neuro-oncologist|DRUG: Concomitant chemotherapy as normal based on standard clinical protocols determined by the neuro-oncologist|DRUG: Adjuvant chemotherapy as normal based on standard clinical protocols determined by the neuro-oncologist
Safety, Tolerability, and Feasibility of Combination Intra-operative 5-ALA and Gliadel Wafers Prior to Adjuvant Radiotherapy Plus Temozolomide, Procedure compliance: Proportion of 5-ALA resected patients who received Carmustine wafer implants (e.g to take into account rates of patients who did not receive Carmustine wafer implants due to 1) ventricular breach, 2) inaccurate peri-operative diagnosis, 3) intra-operative surgical decision)

* Post-operative complication rate: Proportion of patients with a new post-operative deficit or surgical complication (wound infection, CSF leakage, intracranial hypertension)
* No. of patients with chemoRT delay (i.e number who do not begin chemoRT 6 weeks after surgery) due to surgical complications\*
* No. of patients failing to start chemoRT due to surgical complications rather than tumour progression
* No. of patients failing to complete chemoRT without interruption (RT with concomitant chemotherapy, and RT with concomitant plus adjuvant chemotherapy)
* Proportion of patients with a lower WHO performance status after surgery with Carmustine wafers (at first post-operative clinic visit), Date of surgery to end of temozolomide and radiotherapy treatment (up to 34 weeks)
Time to Clinical Progression, from the date of surgery to the date of the first MRI scan fitting the criteria for progression, or the date the clinical detrioration or death was first reported|Survival at 24 Months, from the date of surgery to 24 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To establish that the combined use of 5-ALA and Gliadel wafers during fluorescence-guided radical brain tumor resection is safe and does not compromise patients with primary glioblastoma from receiving or completing adjuvant standard radiotherapy plus temozolomide.

Secondary

* To gather preliminary evidence that the combined use of 5-ALA and Gliadel wafers at surgery has the potential to improve clinical outcome, via measurement of time to clinical progression.
* To gather preliminary evidence that this regimen at surgery has the potential to improve clinical outcome via measurement of survival at 24 months.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Gliadel wafers are applied to resection cavity immediately after 5-ALA fluorescence-guided radical brain tumor resection. After recovery from surgery (within 6 weeks of surgery when possible ), patients receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising standard radiotherapy and temozolomide.

Tumor biopsy and blood sample may be collected at time of surgery for retrospective MGMT status analysis.

After surgery, patients are followed up at post-surgical visits, during subsequent therapy at routine clinic visits, and at 12, 18, and 24 months.
