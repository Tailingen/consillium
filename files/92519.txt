Bortezomib and Low Dose Cytarabine in the Treatment of High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
We are evaluating the efficacy of the association of Low dose Cytarabine in association with Bortezomib in the treatment of patients diagnosed with high risk Myelodysplastic syndromes. Our aim is to decrease transfusion requirements and if possible induce a complete or at least a partial remission.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Bortezomib
Complete Response|Partial Response|Efficacy and safety evaluation, A total of 138 cycles were administered. The median number of cycles administered was 3·2 (range 0·5-8). Thirty-six patients (84%) received at least two cycles and 17 (40%) received the planned four cycles, six responding patients received 1-4 additional cycles. Treatment was dis- continued in the responding patients at progression to AML or for toxicity.

The most common treatment-related adverse events were related to myelosuppression . Neutropenia (Grade 4) and thrombocytopenia (Grade 4) were seen during treatment in 51% and 46% of the patients, respectively. Three of the patients with pre-treatment Grade 0-2 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed Grade 3-4 toxicity complicated by infection and bleeding. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was responsible for infection in six patients. Grade 3-4, 18 mois
Hematological Improvement
Four cycles of treatment are proposed at 28 day intervals in an ambulatory setting

Cycle 1 :

* Cytarabine 10 mg /m2/day subcutaneous injection for 14 days
* Bortézomib 1,5mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11

Cycles 2, 3, 4 :

* Cytarabine 20 mg /m2/j subcutaneous injections for 14 days
* Bortézomib 1,5mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11

Bone marrow aspirates are evaluated just before the first cycle, after the second and after the fourth cycles

Responding patients may continue the treatment for 2 further cycles
