Isatuximab With or Without Lenalidomide in Patients With High Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (ISAMAR)
This is a multi-center, open label, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy of isatuximab with or without lenalidomide when given to patients with high risk smoldering multiple myeloma.
Smoldering Plasma Cell Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Isatuximab|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Overall response (>= partial response), The trial will be conducted by the Simon's optimal two-stage design and the response rate will be estimated accordingly. Summary statistics will be provided for continuous variables. Frequency tables will be used to summarize categorical variables. Logistic regression will be utilized to assess the effect of patient prognostic factors on the response rate and the adverse event rate., 6 months
Progression free survival, Will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Comparison of time-to-event endpoints by important subgroups will be made using the log-rank test., 2 years|Overall survival, Will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Comparison of time-to-event endpoints by important subgroups will be made using the log-rank test., Up to 5 years|Incidence of adverse events, Adverse events will be summarized by frequency tables for all patients. For the safety endpoint, per-treated analysis will be performed to include any patient who received the treatment regardless of the eligibility nor the duration or dose of the treatment received., Up to 5 years
Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at complete remission assessed by flow cytometry and next generation sequencing, MRD assessed will be based on bone marrow aspirates. Will use 8-color flow cytometry as well as next generation sequencing of the variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) segment., Up to 2 years|Molecular profiling, Will include whole exome sequencing and gene expression profiling and cellular (including flow cytometry) profiling using bone marrow aspirate samples., Baseline up to progression of disease, assessed up to 5 years|Immune characterization, Cell surface and functional studies of dendritic, T-, B-, natural killer (NK)- and NKT-cells using bone marrow aspirate samples and peripheral blood samples., Baseline up to 2 years|Mechanisms of resistance to isatuximab, Will include generation of isatuximab resistant myeloma cells, gene expression profiling in drug-naive and resistant myeloma cells, identification of molecular pathways involved in the generation of the resistant phenotype and mechanisms of dual resistance to isatuximab and other myeloma drugs., Up to 5 years|Genetic polymorphisms, Will include FcGR genetic variations assessed using peripheral blood samples., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

- To determine the rate of response according to the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To determine progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years.
* To determine overall survival (OS).
* To determine duration of response (DOR).
* To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR).
* To evaluate safety of single agent treatment in this population
* To evaluate safety of single agent treatment in this population.
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.

OUTLINE:

Patients on single agent cohort receive isatuximab intravenously (IV) over 5 hours on day 1 of cycle 1, and over 3 hours thereafter on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, on days 1 and 15 of cycles 2-6, and on day 1 of subsequent cycles.

Patients on Combination Cohort with Lenalidomide receive isatuximab as in single agent cohort plus Lenalidomide po 21/28 days during cycles 1-6 only. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 30 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 30 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
