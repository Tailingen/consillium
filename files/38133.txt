Pencil Beam Proton Therapy for Recurrences in Anal Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Radiotherapy (DACG 5)
This protocol aims to determine toxicity and efficacy of re-irradiation for patients with recurrences from anal cancers with dose-escalated pencil beam proton therapy either pre-operative for marginally resectable recurrences or as a definitive treatment strategy (un-resectable, operation declined etc.). The over-all aim is to improve local tumor control with acceptable side effects.
