Palonosetron Hydrochloride in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Radiation Therapy in Patients With Primary Abdominal Cancer
RATIONALE: Palonosetron hydrochloride may prevent nausea and vomiting caused by radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether palonosetron hydrochloride is more effective than a placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of palonosetron hydrochloride and to see how well it works in preventing nausea and vomiting caused by radiation therapy in patients with primary abdominal cancer.

DRUG: palonosetron hydrochloride|OTHER: placebo
Complete Response (no Episodes of Nausea or Vomiting), Up to 2 years
Time to Treatment Failure, Defined as a Single Episode of Vomiting, Daily Nausea Score of Moderate or Greater, or Taking ≥ 3 Prochlorperazine or Haloperidol Tablets Per Day, Up to 2 years|Proportion of Patients Reporting Treatment Failure, Up to 2 years|Tolerability and Adverse Events as Assessed by NCI CTC v 3.0, Up to 2 years|Average Level of Nausea Reported and the Proportion of Patients Experiencing a Complete Response Independent of Treatment Arm, Up to 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Evaluate the rate of complete responses, defined as no vomiting and no nausea, in patients with primary gastrointestinal and/or retroperitoneal sarcomas treated with two different dosing schedules of palonosetron hydrochloride during abdominal radiotherapy as part of their cancer treatment.
* Determine the tolerability of palonosetron hydrochloride vs placebo in these patients.
* Validate patient diaries for assessing nausea and vomiting by comparing with alternative methods for measuring nausea and vomiting in order to determine the optimal approach for future studies.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to planned radiotherapy duration (\< 5 weeks vs ≥ 5 weeks), planned concurrent fluorouracil ( yes vs no), and gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride IV on day 1.
* Arm II: Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 4.
* Arm III: Patients receive placebo IV on day 1.
* Arm IV: Patients receive placebo IV on days 1 and 4. In all arms, courses repeat weekly during radiotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients complete nausea and vomiting questionnaires and diaries at baseline and daily during radiotherapy. Patients also complete symptom experience diaries weekly during radiotherapy.
