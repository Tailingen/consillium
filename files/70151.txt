Specimen Banking From Patients With Lung Cancer
The primary objective of the protocol is to develop a comprehensive specimen banking program from patients with lung cancer for future translation research, which will enable the investigators to detect lung cancer earlier, develop better therapies and explore screening and prevention strategies.
Lung Neoplasms
Development of a comprehensive specimen banking program from patients with lung cancer for future translational research., No statistical analysis will be applied to the overall collection of samples. Rather, each project that utilized tissue bank resources will require an appropriate statistical plan to be submitted along with the initial tissue request., 6 years
The aims of the study are as follows: 1) to continue to unravel the complex biology of lung cancer 2) to identify early detection and prognostic markers to guide therapeutic decision 3) to define markers of response and/or resistance to drug therapy, and 4) to identify new therapeutic and prevention targets.
