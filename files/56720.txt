A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Belzutifan (MK-6482) and Lenvatinib (MK-7902), or Pembrolizumab/Quavonlimab (MK-1308A) in Combination With Lenvatinib, Versus Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib, for Treatment of Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-6482-012)
The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus belzutifan plus lenvatinib or pembrolizumab/quavonlimab plus lenvatinib versus pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib as first-line treatment in participants with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

The primary hypotheses are (1) pembrolizumab plus belzutifan plus lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in advanced ccRCC participants; and (2) pembrolizumab/quavonlimab plus lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib with respect to PFS and OS, in advanced ccRCC participants.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by BICR based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented., Up to approximately 46 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 66 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by BICR based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented., Up to approximately 46 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The DOR as assessed by BICR based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented., Up to approximately 66 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced At least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to approximately 66 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 66 months
