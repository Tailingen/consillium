A Research for Combination of Prostate Health Index (Phi) and mpMRI PI-RADS in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer
Before prostate puncture, the patient's serum was collected for PHI detection, and multi-parameter MRI was performed to obtain the PI-RADS score. The sensitivity and specificity of PHI combined with PI-RADS score in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer were explored.
Prostate Cancer
Prostate Health Index, PHI is a simple, FDA-approved blood test that helps determine the probability of detecting prostate cancer with a biopsy. This test uses an algorithm to assess total PSA, free PSA, and p2PSA,, 1 year|PI-RADS score, In PI-RADS, based on the comprehensive manifestations of prostate T2WI, DWI and DCE, a scoring method is given for the possibility of clinically significant prostate cancer. Specifically: 1 point: very low, extremely unlikely to exist; 2 points: low, impossible to exist; 3 points: moderate, suspicious existence; 4 points: high, may exist; 5 points: very high, extremely likely to exist., 1 year|Prostate biospy pathology, The pathological results of prostate puncture are used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, indicating whether the patient is really suffering from prostate cancer, 1 year
This study is a multi-center prospective study. Patients who meet the indications for prostate puncture and whose PSA is in the gray area (4.0\~10.0 ng/mL) undergo standard prostate biopsy. The patient's serum was collected for PHI detection before puncture, and multi-parameter MRI was performed before puncture. To explore the sensitivity and specificity of PHI combined with PI-RADS score in the diagnosis of clinically meaningful prostate cancer. Assess the benefit of combining PHI and mpMRI before biopsy compared with phi or mpMRI alone. Formulate clinical recommendations for PHI and mpMRI.
