A Study of PF-04217903 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
PF-04217903 may work in cancer by blocking the cell growth, migration and invasion of tumor cells. PF-04217903 is a new member in a class of drugs called c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This research study is the first time PF-04217903 will be given to patients. PF-04217903 is taken by mouth daily.

Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. Participants did not receive 200 mg twice a day dose of study treatment for this specific measure., 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hrs (just prior to evening dosing) post dose on C2 D1|Change From Baseline in Tumor Proliferation Using F-Fluoro-3'-Deoxy-3'-L-Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT-PET) Imaging at Day 1 of Cycle 2, F-fluoro-3'-deoxy-3'-L-fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) imaging was used to assess the tumor proliferation in RP2D cohorts. Results of the FLT-PET were scored according to the methods developed by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN)., Cycle 2 Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), Percentage of participants with OR based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed response were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non target). PR were those with at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions, with non target lesions not increased or absent., Baseline until disease progression up to C2 D1
The study was prematurely discontinued due to a strategic development decision by Pfizer on 10FEB2012. The decision to terminate was not based on any safety concerns.
