Immune Induction Strategies to Improve Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Patients
This is a single center non-blinded randomized multi-cohort non-comparative phase II trial with a Simon's two-stage design.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Low dose doxorubicin
Progression free survival, Time from randomization to date of first tumor progression, assessed monthly until progression or date of death; median 12 months
Overall response rate, complete response or partial response according to iRECIST and RECIST1.1, assessed at week 6, 12 and 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter; assessed up to 120 months|Clinical benefit rate, Beneficial response (complete response, partial response or stable disease) according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, assessed at week 6, 12 and 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter; assessed up to 120 months|Overall survival, time from nivolumab initiation to death from any cause, assessed monthly until date of death; median 12 months|Toxicity of all study regimens, adverse events will be graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria v 5.0, assessed until 100 days after of treatment end|Progression Free Survival after 6 cycles, the number of patients free of progression after 6 cycles of nivolumab, time from nivolumab initiation to tumor progression or death from any cause; assessed up to 120 months
In the first stage, 13 evaluable patients will be accrued per cohort. Evaluable is defined as: at least one administration of nivolumab and availability of paired biopsies for immunohistochemistry (for induction treatment cohorts pre-induction and pre-nivolumab biopsies).

If there are 1 or no responses observed in these 13 patients, the cohort will be stopped. Otherwise, 21 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 34.
