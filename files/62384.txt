Proton SBRT for Spinal Metastasis
This is a single-arm pilot study of proton stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for nonhematologic spinal metastasis in patients with complex lesions that are unable to be effectively treated with standard of care photon SBRT defined as inability to develop a photon SBRT plan that achieves adequate coverage (≥80% planning treatment volume (PTV) coverage)) with a prescription dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions.

Rate of successful delivery of at least one fraction for 8 of 12 patients with spine metastases, To assess the feasibility of proton SBRT in patients with nonhematologic spine metastases that are unable to be effectively treated with photon SBRT. Feasibility will be determined by a successful delivery of at least one fraction for 8 of 12 patients with spine metastases., Completion of SBRT treatment, approximately 3 weeks
Rate of neurologic toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, To estimate the rate of neurologic toxicity, defined as CTCAE v5.0 ≥ grade 3, within 12 months after completion of SBRT., Within 12 months post completion of SBRT treatment|Interfraction and intrafraction setup and positioning as assessed by motion monitoring, To verify inter- and intrafraction patient setup and motion uncertainty as assessed by motion monitoring within 2 millimeters (mm) of patient setup used for radiation planning, Completion of SBRT treatment, approximately 3 weeks|Actual spinal cord dose meets dose constraints as recommended by AAPM TG101, To determine whether the actual relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) weighted dose delivered to the spinal cord during proton spinal SBRT meets dose constraints as recommended by American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 101 (AAPM TG101)., Completion of SBRT treatment, approximately 3 weeks|Local control rate post-SBRT, To estimate the local control rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following proton spinal SBRT. Assessed using standard of care imaging obtained every 3 months- comparing imaging studies before SBRT with progressive disease on CT and/or MRI in the treatment volume or at the margin of the treatment field., 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-SBRT treatment|Incidence of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) post-SBRT, To estimate the incidence of VCF within or one vertebra adjacent to the radiation field at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following proton spinal SBRT. Assessed using standard of care imaging obtained every 3 months up to 12 months- comparing new vertebral body height loss or progression of existing fracture prior to local progression on CT and/or MRI., 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-SBRT treatment|Brief Pain Index (BPI) patient-reported outcome pre-SBRT and post-SBRT, To describe patient-reported pain assessments before SBRT and at follow-up evaluations after proton spinal SBRT. Patient-reported pain will be measured using BPI. The score range for BPI is 0-10; a lower score suggests less pain and/or less interference with daily activities., Prior to SBRT treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-SBRT treatment|EORTC Quality of Life (QLQ) BM22 patient-reported outcome pre-SBRT and post-SBRT, To describe patient-reported quality of life (QoL) assessments before SBRT and at follow-up evaluations after proton spinal SBRT. Patient-reported quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22). The score range for EORTC QLQ-BM22 is 0-100; a lower score generally indicates a better QoL., Prior to SBRT treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-SBRT treatment
Spine metastases are common with a prevalence of up to 30-50% among patients with a cancer diagnosis. As cancer survivorship improves, durable local control is essential to decrease the risk of pain and neurologic deficits that are associated with spinal metastasis. SBRT for these tumors has demonstrated overall local control rates of approximately 80-90% in the largest published series.

Emerging data highlight the importance of dose escalation for local control in SBRT for spinal metastases. The spinal cord is often the dose limiting structure in patients with spinal metastasis; however, achieving sufficiently high dose and acceptable target coverage while meeting dose constraints of other organs at risk (OARs) such as the small bowel or kidneys also poses a significant technical challenge when using current SBRT modalities for complex cases (e.g., extensive paraspinal disease, epidural disease, disease abutting the kidneys, re-irradiation setting). Maintaining safety is the first priority such that complex cases in current practice often require significant target volume under-coverage in order to meet organ at risk dose constraints, increasing the risk of progression and its associated neurologic morbidity and mortality.

To attempt to improve OAR sparing, proton SBRT has been utilized in other disease sites including prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, and liver. The unique qualities of proton beam therapy may improve target coverage while maintaining OAR sparing in cases where current practice with photon SBRT would require a limited dose and/or under-coverage of the target, both of which are associated with an increased risk of tumor progression.
