Dose Escalation, Multi-arm Study of MLN4924 Plus Docetaxel, Gemcitabine, or Combination of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Participants With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the safety and tolerability of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel and carboplatin, and gemcitabine in participants with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: MLN4924|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Number of Participants Who Experience at Least 1 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 5 years)|Number of Participants With TEAEs Related to Clinically Significant Laboratory Evaluation Findings, Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 5 years)|Number of Participants With TEAEs Related to Clinically Significant Vital Sign Findings, Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 5 years)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with exception of nodal disease; all nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than \[\<\] 10 millimeter \[mm\]); no new lesions. PR: greater than or equal to (\>=) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions; short axis was used in sum for target nodes, while longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-target disease; no new lesions., Screening, Cycle 2 Days 15 (Arm 1, 2a, and 2) and 22 (Arm 3) then every other Cycle thereafter up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 5 years) (Cycle Length = 21 days [Arm 1, 2a, and 2] and 28 days [Arm 3])|Duration of Response, Duration of response: time from the date of first documented response per the investigator response assessment (CR or PR) to the date of PD or the date of last disease assessment if the participant discontinued the study before PD using RECIST 1.1 CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with exception of nodal disease; all nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm); no new lesions. PR: \>=30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions; short axis was used in sum for target nodes, while longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-target disease; no new lesions. PD: at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented PD or the date of last disease assessment if the participants discontinued the study before PD (up to 5 years)|Dose-escalation Phase: Plasma Concentrations-time Data of MLN4924, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 20 hours) post-dose (Cycle Length=21 days [Arm 1 and 2] and 28 days [Arm 3])|MTD Expansion Phase: Plasma Concentrations-time Data of MLN4924, The number of participants analyzed includes only those participants who had data available for this measure., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 5 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 20 hours) post-dose (Cycle Length=21 days [Arm 1 and 2])
