Risk Communication in African American Smokers
The study aims to understand the effects of learning about one's genetic risk for lung cancer that is specific to their ancestry. Participants will be given hypothetical personalized genetic risk results and ask to think about how they might respond to such information if they actually received such results.

The study aims to understand the effects of learning about one's genetic risk for lung cancer that is specific to their ancestry. Smokers will be randomized to receive hypothetical information about their genetic status and consider how they think they would respond if such results were actually presented to them. They will be randomly assigned to receive one of four sets of hypothetical genetic results: 1) High risk of lung cancer and high genetic African ancestry, 2) High risk of lung cancer and low genetic African ancestry, 3) Low risk of lung cancer and high genetic African ancestry, or 4) Low risk of lung cancer and low genetic African ancestry. After being given this hypothetical information, participants will complete brief questionnaires assessing perceived risk of lung cancer, worry about cancer, psychological distress, and motivation to quit smoking.
