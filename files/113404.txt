Study of Denosumab in the Treatment of Hypercalcemia of Malignancy in Subjects With Elevated Serum Calcium
The purpose of this study is to determine the potential of denosumab to treat Hypercalcemia of Malignancy in patients with elevated serum calcium who do not respond to recent treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates by lowering corrected serum calcium \</= 11.5 mg/dL (2.9 millimoles /L) by day 10.

DRUG: denosumab
Percentage of Participants With a Response Within 10 Days of First Dose of Denosumab, Response is defined as corrected serum calcium (CSC) ≤ 11.5 mg/dL, within 10 days after the first dose of denosumab. For all CSC values, if albumin was \< 4 g/dL, the following formula was used to calculate CSC: CSC = Total serum calcium \[mg/dL\] + (0.8 x (4 - serum albumin \[g/dL\])), 10 days
Percentage of Participants With a Response by Visit, Response is defined as corrected serum calcium (CSC) ≤ 11.5 mg/dL, within 10 days after the first dose of denosumab. For all CSC values, if albumin was \< 4 g/dL, the following formula was used to calculate CSC: CSC = Total serum calcium \[mg/dL\] + (0.8 x (4 - serum albumin \[g/dL\])), Days 2, 4, 8, 10, 15, 19, 23, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57|Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response by Visit, Response is defined as corrected serum calcium (CSC) ≤ 10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L). For all CSC values, if albumin was \< 4 g/dL, the following formula was used to calculate CSC: CSC = Total serum calcium \[mg/dL\] + (0.8 x (4 - serum albumin \[g/dL\]))., Days 2, 4, 8, 10, 15, 19, 23, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57|Time to Response, Time to Response was defined as the time period from study Day 1 to the first time post-baseline corrected serum calcium (CSC) ≤ 11.5 mg/dL. Participants were censored on the last CSC assessment day if no response was observed. If there was no post-baseline CSC assessment, time to response was censored on study Day 1.

Time to response was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods., From Day 1 until the end of study date or primary data cutoff date (13 September 2012), whichever occured first; median time on study was 1.8 months.|Time to Complete Response, Time to complete response was defined as the time period from study Day 1 to the first time post-baseline corrected serum calcium (CSC) was ≤ 10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L). Participants were censored on the last CSC assessment day if no complete response was observed. If there was no post-baseline CSC assessment, time to complete response was censored on study Day 1. Time to complete response was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods., From Day 1 until the end of study date or primary data cutoff date (13 September 2012), whichever occured first; median time on study was 1.8 months.|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the number of days from the first day of corrected serum calcium ≤ 11.5 mg/dL (2.9 millimoles/L) to the last day of corrected serum calcium ≤ 11.5 mg/dL. Participants were censored on the last CSC assessment day if their CSC level never reached \> 11.5 mg/dL after the first response. If a participant had no CSC assessment after the first response, duration of response was set to zero and censored. Duration of response was summarized for participants who achieved a response using the Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 until the end of study date or primary data cutoff date (13 September 2012), whichever occured first; median time on study was 1.8 months.|Duration of Complete Response, Duration of complete response is defined as the number of days from the first day of of corrected serum calcium ≤ 10.8 mg/dL (2.7 millimoles/L) to the last day of corrected serum calcium ≤ 10.8 mg/dL. Participants were censored on the last CSC assessment day if their CSC level never reached \> 10.8 mg/dL after the complete response. If a participant had no CSC assessment after the complete response, duration of complete response was set to zero and censored. Duration of complete response was summarized for participants who achieved a complete response using the Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 until the end of study date or primary data cutoff date (13 September 2012), whichever occured first; median time on study was 1.8 months.|Time to Relapse/Nonresponse of Hypercalcemia of Malignancy, Time to relapse/nonresponse was defined as the number of days from study Day 1 until the last day of CSC ≤ 11.5 mg/dL for all particiipants with relapse after the first response. Participants were censored on the last CSC assessment day if their CSC level never reached \> 11.5 mg/dL after first response. For participants who never achieved response, time to relapse/nonresponse was set to zero. Otherwise, if there was no post-baseline CSC assessment, time to relapse/nonresponse was censored on study Day 1. Time to relapse/nonresponse was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 until the end of study date or primary data cutoff date (13 September 2012), whichever occured first; median time on study was 1.8 months.|Change From Baseline in Corrected Serum Calcium, Baseline and Days 2, 4, 8, 10, 15, 19, 23, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57
