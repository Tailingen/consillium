Study of Donafenib Combined With Tislelizumab in the Adjuvant Treatment of Primary HCC With High Risk of Recurrence
To explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of donafenib combined with tislelizumab in adjuvant therapy after radical surgical resection of primary hepatocellular carcinoma with high risk of recurrence.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Donafenib + Tislelizumab
1-year recurrence-free survival, Ratio of patients from first treatment to disease recurrence within 1 year, 1 years
recurrence-free survival with surgical resection, Time elapsed from surgical resection to tumor recurrence or death from any cause (if the subject died before disease recurrence), 2 years|overall survival, Time from enrollment date to date of death from any cause, up to 1 years|adverse events, Incidence of adverse events in combination immunization with donafenib, up to 1 years
This study is a single-center, single-arm, open-label clinical study. For HCC patients who the investigator believes can benefit from adjuvant treatment with donafenib combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody, they will sign an informed consent form, and then start donafenib within 1-2 months after radical surgery (stable disease assessment or improvement). Adjuvant therapy with fenib combined with tislelizumab for 6 months, to explore the safety and efficacy of postoperative adjuvant therapy with donafenib combined with tislelizumab.
