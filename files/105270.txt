Study of Different Doses of Irinotecan and Cisplatin for First-line Extensive-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer Treatment
The purpose of this study is to identify the appropriate dose of irinotecan by dose escalation(dose climbing) test. The study would provide rationale for regimen decision in a future phase III clinical trial, in which irinotecan combined with cisplatin(IP) will be selected as therapeutic drugs.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: irinotecan
Limiting Toxicity (DLT )in the irinotecan, up to 18 weeks
Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD)in the irinotecan, up to 18weeks
To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) of irinotecan in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with irinotecan plus cisplatin
