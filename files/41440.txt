Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy Study of Bisthianostat in Refractory or Recurrent Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is a first-in-human study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of Bisthianostat in refractory or recurrent multiple myeloma patients.
Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Recurrent Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bisthianostat
Maximum tolerated dose of Bisthianostat, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Bisthianostat in refractory or recurrent multiple myeloma patients., Up to 24 months|Treatment-related adverse events considered as dose-limiting toxicity, To evaluate the severity of treatment-related AEs considered as dose-limiting toxicity., During the first cycle (4 weeks)
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To determine the Peak Plasma Concentration of Bisthianostat., During the first cycle (4 weeks)|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), To determine the Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve of Bisthianostat., During the first cycle (4 weeks)|Time of Peak Concentration (Tmax), To determine the time of peak concentration of Bisthianostat., During the first cycle (4 weeks)|Half life (T1/2), To determine the half-life of Bisthianostat., During the first cycle (4 weeks)|Objective Response Rate, To evaluate the objective response rate in refractory or recurrent myeloma patients after bisthianostat treatments., Up to 1 month after last dose|Incidence of adverse events related to treatments, To evaluate the incidence of adverse events that are related to treatments in refractory or recurrent myeloma patients, Up to 1 month after last dose|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities related to treatments, To evaluate the incidence of laboratory abnormalities that are related to treatments in refractory or recurrent myeloma patients, Up to 1 month after last dose
This is a first-in-human, single center, open-label, single arm, dose escalating phase I study. This study will be conducted in 3 parts.

Phase A : Patients will receive single dose of bisthianostat to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety.

Phase B: After single-dose phase, patients will receive multiple dose bisthianostat for 4 weeks on day 1,4,11,14,18,21,25,28 to evaluate the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and safety

Phase C: Patients will continue on the study if they benefit from the drug and not experience any serious side effects.
