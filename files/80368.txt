Effect of Laparoscopy-Assisted Distal Gastrectomy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of laparoscopy-assisted D2 radical surgery for distal advanced gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: open surgery|PROCEDURE: laparoscopic surgery
Postoperative complication rate, Surgical complications within 30 days after surgery, 30 days
3-year disease free survival rate, 3-year disease free survival rate, 3 years
In both arms,subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy) and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of splenic artery (4d, 4sb), hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) wiil be performed basically. As a general rule, Billroth I or BillrothII methods will be used for gastric reconstruction for all cases. For anastomosis, absorbable suture is used. Anastomotic diameter is 5\~6 cm length. Drainage tube is inserted through the right flank area and additional drainage tubes can be inserted as needed.
