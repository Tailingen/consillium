Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Radiation Therapy
This is a master prospective Phase I-II trial evaluating feasibility and efficacy of stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR) guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) in patients with cancer.

* The phase 1 study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of delivering SMART in patients with cancer.
* Phase 2 will evaluate efficacy of SMART with specific reference to tumor control and improvement in patient reported outcome measures

This research study is a feasibility study, which means it is the first-time investigators at this institution are examining this type of MR-guided radiation to treat cancer.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this device as a treatment option for cancer.

In this research study, the investigators are hoping to determine if adjusting radiation treatments based on daily MRI has a feasible way to deliver radiation for participants with pancreatic, lung or renal cancer.
