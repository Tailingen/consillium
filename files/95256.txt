Cis-urocanic Acid (Cis-UCA) in Patients With Primary or Recurrent Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intravesical cis-urocanic acid in patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

This is a single dose, dose-escalating, Phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intravesical cis-urocanic acid (cis-UCA) in patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

The primary objectives is to evaluate safety and tolerability of cis-UCA after a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of cis-UCA after a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate pharmacokinetics of cis-UCA after a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses, to obtain preliminary information on possible anti-tumor effects of cis-UCA by cystoscopy and histological evaluation after a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses, and to evaluate the effects of cis-UCA on different surrogate biochemical markers on tumor growth and differentiation after a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses.

The key eligibility criteria are the following: Patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer; eligible for intravesical treatment; age 18-80 years; WHO performance status 0-2; acceptable liver, renal and hematological function within 30 days prior to inclusion.

At minimum 3 patients and at maximum 24 patients is planned to be included in the study. The fixed dose-escalation levels will be used.

Up to three dose cohorts are planned to be included:

* Cohort I: 2% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 3, max 12 patients
* Cohort II: 4% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 0, max 12 patients
* Cohort III: 6% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 0, max 12 patients
