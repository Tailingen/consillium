A Trial of Thalidomide, Celecoxib, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Relapsed or Progressive Cancer
This study will use a combination of four oral drugs (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and celecoxib) to treat patients with relapsed or progressive cancer. These drugs are expected to target the blood vessels that supply the tumors with what they need to grow.
Neoplasms
DRUG: Thalidomide|DRUG: Celecoxib|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
To evaluate the feasibility of administering thalidomide, celecoxib, etoposide and cyclophosphamide for recurrent and poor prognosis tumors., 6 months
To obtain preliminary evidence of biologic activity of these four orally administered, 6 months|to evaluate and document side effects from chronic administration of these four drugs at the doses prescribed in this protocol, 6 months|to evaluate different radiographic techniques as markers of tumor response., 6 months
* Thalidomide will be given orally every evening and the daily dose will escalate until the patient reaches a dose on which they are comfortable and will given continuously for one year.
* Celecoxib will be given orally twice a day and escalated as tolerated for one year.
* Etoposide will be given orally once a day for 21 consecutive days. This medication will alternate with oral cyclophosphamide and will continue for one year.
* Cyclophosphamide will be given orally once a day for 21 consecutive days and as stated above will alternate with etoposide for one year.
* During the treatment, blood tests will be performed every three weeks except during the first 3 week cycle in which testing is performed every 2 weeks. Appropriate imaging studies will be performed every 9 weeks.
* The duration of treatment is one year unless the side effects are too harmful or the tumor grows. Treatment may be continued past one year if the drugs are well tolerated and disease progression has not occured.
