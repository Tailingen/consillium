A Study of Durvalumab With or Without Tremelimumab in Endometrial Cancer
This study will test the safety and efficacy of the experimental drug called durvalumab with or without another experimental drug called tremelimumab in endometrial cancer.

Radiologic tumor assessment will be repeated every 8 weeks +/- 7 days for the first 48 weeks and then every 12 weeks +/- 7 days until PD. For patients who remain progression free 2 years post completion of protocol directed treatment, every 6 months +/- 1 month. irRECIST assessments will only be completed for patients continuing treatment beyond PD.
Endometrial Cancer|Endometrial Carcinosarcoma|Endometrial Carcinoma|Endometrial Cancer Recurrent|Endometrial Carcinoma, Recurrent
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Treatment Efficacy Determined by Measuring the Overall Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 72 months
