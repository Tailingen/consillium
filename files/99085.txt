Lidocaine Combined With Sufentanil for Preventing Catheter-related Bladder Discomfort
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the incidence and severity of postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

The main question it aims to answer is to evaluate incidence of CRBD immediately after extubation in resuscitation.

A total of 20ml of 2% lidocaine and 1μg/ml sufentanil or 20ml normal saline was injected into the bladder of the participants through the catheter. After drug injection, the catheter was clamped for 20 minutes, and then 100ml normal saline was injected into the bladder through the catheter to flush out.

Then, the incidence of CRBD was compared between the two groups.
