Thoraco-laparoscopic Partial Esophagogastrectomy for Management of Esophageal Cancer
Thoraco-laparoscopic partial esophagogastrectomy has emerged as a promising minimally invasive alternative, combining thoracoscopy and laparoscopy to reduce the trauma associated with open surgery.Early and intermediate-term outcomes provide critical information on both the oncological efficacy and functional benefits of the procedure. By examining recurrence rates within the first 12-24 months, this study will provide valuable insights into the oncological robustness of this approach compared to more invasive approaches.
