TT52CAR19 Therapy for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL)
PBLTT52CAR19 modified T cells are allogenic engineered human T cells (defined as TT52CAR19 +TCRαβ-) prepared for the treatment of CD19+ B cell leukaemia. The cells are from healthy adult volunteer donors and are not HLA-matched. They have been transduced to express and anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) using a lentiviral vector that also incorporates CRISPR guides for genome editing of CD52 and TRAC loci in the presence of transiently provided Cas9.

Recognition by TT52CAR19 T cells mediates eradication of CD19+ leukaemia and other CD19+ B cells through T cell mediated cytotoxicity.

This study aims to apply PBLTT52CAR19 T cells to secure molecular remission in children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL ahead of programmed allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The cells are to be used in a time-limited manner for their anti-leukaemia effects and then depleted by standard pre- transplant conditioning.

B-ALL remission, The main benefit expected from PBLTT52CAR19 for anti-CD19 activity leading to anti-leukemic effect and induction of remission in children with refractory/relapsed B-ALL. Patients who achieve molecular remission will become eligible to receive an allo-HSCT that would otherwise be considered futile.Remission of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) in anticipation of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT that would otherwise be considered futile., 28 days
