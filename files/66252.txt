Tiragolumab, Atezolizumab and Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a phase II study, preceded by a safety run-in, with two independent cohorts (cohort A in early Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients and cohort B in late in metastatic TNBC patients) designed to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab, tiragolumab and chemotherapy.

Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]., In Safety run-in, safety and toxicity of the combination Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab + chemotherapy in cohorts A, 6 weeks for cohort A and 8 weeks for cohort B|In cohort A, Rate of pathological complete response (pCR), pCR is defined as ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; as centrally assessed at the time of definitive surgery)., 6 months|In cohort B, Progression-free survival rate (6mPFS),, 6mPFS is defined as the proportion of patients without progression (as assessed by central review per Positron Emission Tomography Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) v1.0) or death within 6 months after the date of inclusion., 6 months
SAEs (serious adverse events) and AEs (adverse events), SAEs and AEs will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, by grade and their relationship to atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab and/or chemotherapy., 36 months|In Cohort A, alternative definition of pCR rate: Residual cancer burden (RCB), Residual cancer burden (RCB) classes according to the MD Anderson classification as assessed per central assessment., 6 months|In Cohort A, alternative definition of pCR rate: ypT0 ypN0 (no invasive or noninvasive residual in breast or nodes, ypT0 ypN0 defined per central assessment., 6 months|In Cohort A, Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), 3 years-iDFS defined as the time from inclusion to occurrence of any of the following: ipsilateral invasive breast cancer recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second non-breast invasive cancer, whichever comes first., 3 years|In Cohort B, Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of patients who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator assessment, per PERCIST 1.0 among patients with measurable disease at baseline., 6 months|In Cohort B, Duration of response (DoR), DoR defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression per PERCIST 1.0 based on local investigator assessment or death due to any cause., 3 years|In Cohort B, Clinical benefit rate (CBR), 6-month-CBR defined as the proportion of patients who have achieved either a confirmed complete or partial response, or stable disease for at least 24 weeks after treatment start per PERCIST 1.0 based on local investigator assessment., 6 months|Quality of Life mesurement with 5 Dimension 5 Level scale Questionnaire, The scale measures quality of life on a 5-component scale including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The five states in the EQ-5D-5L are referred to by 5-digits, score from 11111 to 55555. Each number is added up to produce a score between 5 and 25 for EQ-5D-5L., 6 months|Overall Survival (OR), OS defined as the time from inclusion to the date of death due to any cause., 5 years
In the early TNBC setting (cohort A) dedicated to patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, non-metastatic disease (tumor stage T1c, nodal stage N1-2, or tumor stage T2-4, nodal stage N0-2), the treatment will consist in:

First part: Nab-paclitaxel administered weekly in combination with atezolizumab, tiragolumab and carboplatin, administered every 3 weeks over 12 weeks Second part: Atezolizumab, tiragolumab, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, administered every 3 weeks over 12 weeks Patients will undergo surgery of the primary disease 3 to 6 weeks after last neoadjuvant treatment dose, followed by 9 cycles of atezolizumab and tiragolumab administered every 3 weeks.

Treatment efficacy will be assessed early on, through 18F-FDG PET/CT during the first two cycles. Patients whose tumor shows no sign of response after two cycles (i.e. no partial or complete metabolic response of the breast tumor according to 18F-FDG PET/CT by PERCIST criteria) would then be switched to standard treatment, per investigator decision.

Tiragolumab 600 mg and Atezolizumab 1200 mg administered by IV infusion every 3 weeks after surgery for a total of 9 cycles.

In the metastatic TNBC setting (cohort B) dedicated to patients with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic disease eligible to first line treatment, patients will be included regardless of their PD-L1 tumor expression defined by immunohistochemistry (Ventana SP142) at baseline, but no more than 40% of PD-L1 negative (i.e \<1%) will be included. The treatment will consist in nab-paclitaxel administered at d1, d8, d15 of every 28-day cycle, combined with atezolizumab and tiragolumab administered every 3 weeks until disease progression or limiting toxicity.

Treatments will be administered until disease progression or limiting toxicity.

As the the combination Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab + chemotherapy has never been tested, a safety run-in phase of 10 patients is planned in each cohort to verify the tolerance of the combination
