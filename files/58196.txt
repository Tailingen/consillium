Defined Green Tea Catechin Extract in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery
This randomized pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well defined green tea catechin extract works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing surgery. Defined green tea catechin extract contains ingredients that may prevent or slow the growth of certain cancers.

F-PSA-to-PSA ratio remains constant in men without prostate cancer while total PSA increases. This F-PSA to-PSA ratio is useful diagnostic tool with borderline total PSA values (4.0 to 10.0 ng/mL); additionally values of 20% to 25% F-PSA eliminates 1/3 of biopsies in some studies; and F-PSA of 15.6% and PSA-ACT of 26.7% yielded 95% sensitivity \[17\].

OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the short-term effects of daily Polyphenon E (defined green tea catechin extract) administration (800 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate \[EGCG\] once daily \[QD\]) during the interval between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (approximately 6 weeks) in men with localized prostate cancer.

II. Compare the change in levels of intermediate biomarkers (Ki-67, B-cell lymphoma 2 \[Bcl2\], cyclin D, KiP1/P27, vascular endothelial growth factor \[VEGF\], and cluster of differentiation \[CD\]31) in biopsy (pre-treatment) and prostatectomy (post-treatment) specimens collected from subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and prostatectomy.

III. Compare the change in pre- and post-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in subjects treated with Polyphenon E or placebo during the period between biopsy and prostatectomy.

IV. Evaluate bioavailability of catechins from Polyphenon E (plasma and tissue catechin levels, catechin metabolites in urine).

V. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Polyphenon E in this subject population.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive defined green tea catechin extract orally (PO) QD for 4-10 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical prostatectomy between days 28-70.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 4-10 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo radical prostatectomy between days 28-70.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
