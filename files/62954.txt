Study of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This study evaluates the rate of radiological disease progression with the new 2nd generation positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical, 18F-DCFPyL, in patients with metastatic castration (mCRPC) and non-metastatic (nmCRPC) castration resistant prostate cancer who have evidence of biochemical (PSA) disease progression without evidence of radiological disease progression on conventional standard radiologic testing (99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan and CT).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 18F-DCFPyL Injection
Sensitivity 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to detect metastatic prostate cancer, Proportion of patients demonstrating disease progression by conventional criteria evaluated by CT scan and 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan and on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT., 3 years
Correlation of findings on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT with conventional imaging as determined by Number of Lesions detected on each imaging modality, Number of lesions detected on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in comparison to number of lesions detected on conventional imaging (99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan and CT), 3 years
