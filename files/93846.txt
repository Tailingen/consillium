Nipple-sparing Mastectomy in Combined With Buried Flap Monitoring
1. Learning curve of ms-Tram and DIEP breast reconstructions surgery are important to guide the training of new surgeon.
2. Buried flap post operative monitoring without implantable doppler was seldom studied, a validated protocol reported.
3. The complication rates of the flap and oncological safety were studied.
Breast/Surgery
OTHER: No intervention
Total flap failure rate, The rate of ms-tram and diep flap were removed from the patients, Through study completionï¼Œ and average of 2.5 year
Operative time and complication rate are employed to analysis the learning curve of the ms-Tram and DIEP surgery,which is meaningful for the new microsurgeon training.

Buried flap without the implatable doppler is very common condition all over the world, and the complication rate was evaluated as evidence of reliable of the validated monitoring protocol.

Complication rates were considered as different before and after the platue of the learning curve. Within the study of the learning curve, complication rates were reported.
