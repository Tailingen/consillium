A Study of MK-1084 With Midazolam and Digoxin in Healthy Participants (MK-1084-009)
The goal of the study is to see what happens to levels of midazolam and digoxin in a person's body over time (a pharmacokinetic or PK study). Researchers will compare what happens to midazolam and digoxin in the body when it is given with and without another medicine called MK-1084. Researchers are testing if digoxin and midazolam levels in the body are different when digoxin and midazolam are given with or without MK-1084.
