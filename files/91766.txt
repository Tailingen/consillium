A Phase III Study of YL201 in Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of YL201 with Investigator's choice of chemotherapy in subjects with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have failed prior PD-(L)1 inhibitor and at least two lines of chemotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: YL201|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine
To compare the ORR of YL201 versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma assessed by BICR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Approximately within 36 months|To compare the OS of YL201 versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma., OS defined as the time interval from the randomization to death from any cause., Approximately within 36 months

The primary objective of this study is to assess whether treatment with YL201 prolongs overall survival (OS) and increases objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR) compared with treatment of investigator's choice of chemotherapy among subjects with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The secondary objectives of the study are to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of YL201, and the correlation between B7-H3 expression level and the efficacy of YL201.
