Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection Consortium
The purpose of the Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection (PRECEDE) Consortium is to conduct research on multiple aspects of early detection and prevention of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by establishing a multisite cohort of individuals with family history of PDAC and/or individuals carrying pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in genes linked to PDAC risk for longitudinal follow up.

The main objective of the PRECEDE Consortium is to build a shared resource to drive research in critical areas necessary for early detection and prevention of PDAC.

The PRECEDE Consortium is an observational prospective cohort study, with single or serial biosample collection (every 6-12 months) in defined high-risk groups.

A standardized procedure for collection and processing of human blood for the PRECEDE Consortium will be applied to all blood samples collected as part of the study. Barcoded samples will be stored at the clinical centers, using the specific labels for the PRECEDE study and corresponding data will be entered into the study database.

Clinical data and outcomes will be obtained from institutional databases or clinical records to correlate patient information with laboratory results from biospecimens obtained for research. Patients will be followed by their attending physician and receive the standard follow-up care after the procedure in which biospecimen was obtained. It is the intent that biospecimens will be made available to all consortium investigators.
