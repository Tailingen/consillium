Clinical Outcomes of Preservation Versus Resection of Portal/Superior Mesenteric Vein During Pancreaticoduodenectomy in Pancreatic Cancer Patients Who Respond to Neoadjuvant Treatment
1. There is a lack of evidence on the need to perform portal/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) resection routinely in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with venous involvement who responded to neoadjuvant treatment (NAT).
2. There is no significant differences in R0 rate, 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival between the PV/SMV preservation (PVP) group and PV/SMV resection (PVR) group.
3. PVP group showed significantly better 5-year PV/SMV stenosis free survival than the PVR group.
4. We propose that if dissection is possible and there is a high likelihood of achieving R0 resection after NAT, routine PVR may be unnecessary in PDAC patients with venous involvement.
