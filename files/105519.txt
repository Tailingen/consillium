An Open Label Study of BIBW 2992/Afatinib in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Pre-treated With Erlotinib or Gefitinib
Advanced lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer) with a mutation in the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene, which have disease progression after treatment with an EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib or gefitinib), and have progression of disease also after treatment with chemotherapy will be recruited. The trial has only one arm, of afatinib daily treatment. Blood and exhaled breath samples will be collected for investigations aiming to identify factors that predict response to afatinib.
NSCLC
DRUG: Afatinib treatment
Progression free survival, One year
Overall survival, One year
