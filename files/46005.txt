E GFR TKI and EGF-P TI C Ombination in EGFR mutA nt NSCL C
This is a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase Ib clinical study. Patients who give informed consent will be screened for the study, including genotyping of the tumour and baseline characteristics. Eligible patients will receive a single pre-treatment of low dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 (Day -3). Patients will commence daily oral therapy with the EGFR TKI afatinib as soon as possible, preferably on the same day as low dose cyclophosphamide. Afatinib will be prescribed according to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the product, and will continue in nominal 21-day cycles for as long as clinically indicated. The first day of dosing with EGF-PTI will be designated Day 1.

Immunisation with EGF-PTI will commence 3 days after low dose cyclophosphamide and commencement of EGFR TKI, and will be repeated on Day 14, Day 28, Day 43, and Day 92. After the 5 th vaccination, patients will be followed up every 6 weeks for basic safety data and every 3 months for complete efficacy data, safety data, and maintenance (reduced) doses of EGF-PTI. Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, death, safety concerns (in the opinion of the investigator), non-compliance with the protocol, the patient withdraws from the study, 1 year after randomisation of the last patient, or the study is stopped the sponsor, whichever occurs sooner
