A Study of APTO-253 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory AML or MDS
This study is being done to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of APTO-253 for the treatment of patients with the condition of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) for which either the standard treatment has failed, is no longer effective, or can no longer be administered safely or poses a risk for your general well being.

This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase Ia/b dose escalation study of safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of APTO-253 in ascending cohorts (3+3 design) to determine the MTD or recommended dose in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk MDS patients. This is to be followed by a cohort expansion phase at the MTD or recommended dose.
