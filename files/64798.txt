Ph 1 Study in Subjects With Tumors Requiring Arginine to Assess ADI-PEG 20 With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin
A study of ADI-PEG 20 (pegylated arginine deiminase), an arginine degrading enzyme in patients with histologically proven advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), advanced peritoneal mesothelioma (in dose escalation cohort only), non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma stage IIIB/IV (NSCLC), metastatic uveal melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), glioma and sarcomatoid cancers

DRUG: ADI-PEG 20
Define initial estimates of efficacy, measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria for non-squamous NSCLC, advanced peritoneal mesothelioma, metastatic uveal melanoma, HCC, glioma and sarcomatoid cancers for ADI-PEG 20 in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin., 18 weeks|Define initial estimates of efficacy, measured by modified RECIST criteria for advanced MPM, 18 weeks
Determine the MTD of ADI-PEG 20 in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin, 18 weeks
Weekly ADI-PEG 20 will be cohort dose escalated (18, 27 and 36 mg/m2), with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 both given every 3 weeks. Subjects may receive a maximum of 6, 3-week cycles of ADIPemCis for a total of 18 weeks of treatment. Subjects with NSCLC may receive 4 to 6, 3-week cycles as per local institutional policy. Those subjects completing ADIPemCis treatment may continue on ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy if they have SD or better. Subjects with NSCLC may continue to receive pemetrexed as per local institutional policy along with ADI-PEG 20 and/or continue on ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy after pemetrexed is also discontinued.
