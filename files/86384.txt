A Study of Duvelisib in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Head and Neck Cancer
This study was designed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of duvelisib in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

This was a non-randomized, open-label Phase 1b/2 study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of duvelisib in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with R/M HNSCC who were eligible for pembrolizumab monotherapy based on the current pembrolizumab prescribing information.
