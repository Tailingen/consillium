Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Registry
This trial will evaluate two separate groups of patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The objective of Group 1 is to investigate an FDA-approved drug in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer patients that has spread to the bones. The objective of Group 2 is to see if a blood test can be used to predict when cancer-related bone lesions develop. This trial is seeking patients 18 years or older that have been diagnosed with Stage IIIB or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be treated by surgery.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer|Pleural Effusion, Malignant
DRUG: zoledronic acid
Group 1: Time to the first occurrence of an skeletal related event (SRE) in unresectable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients with bone metastases|Group 2: Observational
Patients with an SRE will be evaluated for:|Time from stage IIIB/IV NSCLC diagnosis to progression to bone|Time from bone metastasis diagnosis to presentation of clinical symptoms of skeletal complications|The effect of serum NTX levels on the development of skeletal events (SREs), and|Overall survival|Group 2: Obervational
