Study of Safety and Efficacy of Letrozole Monotherapy as Second-line Endocrine Therapy in Postmenopausal Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer Who Received Previous Anti-estrogen Treatment
* Safety and efficacy of letrozole 2.5 mg/day monotherapy as second-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who received previous anti-estrogen treatment
* To investigate changes in blood drug concentrations and blood hormone kinetics.
* To investigate gene polymorphisms of CYP2A6, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of letrozole
