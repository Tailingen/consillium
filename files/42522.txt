Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Tirabrutinib (ONO/GS-4059) Given as Monotherapy in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory NHL and CLL
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tirabrutinib (formerly ONO/GS-4059) given as monotherapy to participants with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Non Hodgkins Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia
DRUG: Tirabrutinib
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities, Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) were defined as follows:

* All Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade 4 tirabrutinib related adverse events
* All CTC Grade 3 tirabrutinib related adverse events, with the exception of the following:

  * CTC Grade 3 lymphocytosis considered an expected outcome of therapy

Any toxicity which in the opinion of the Investigator is attributed to a participant's underlying disease was not considered a DLT., Day 1 through Day 28
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best overall response of complete remission (CR, unconfirmed complete response (CRu), complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi)) or partial remission (PR, nodal PR) during study as assessed by the investigator.

ORR assessment was defined per following standardized criteria:

* NHL: Cheson, 1999
* CLL: International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008, Up to Cycle 37 (28 days for each cycle) plus 6-month intervals thereafter until disease progression (maximum: up to 39 months)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax of Tirabrutinib, Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug., Pre-dose, then 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose at Cycle 1, Day 28|PK Parameter: AUCtau of Tirabrutinib, AUCtau is defined as concentration of drug over dosing interval., Pre-dose, then 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose at Cycle 1, Day 28
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tirabrutinib (formerly ONO/GS-4059) given as monotherapy to participants with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
