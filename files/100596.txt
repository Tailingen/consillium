Sentinel Node in Colon Cancer
More than 20% of patients operated on for colon cancer without node metastasis will develop visceral metastases. The purpose of the study is to determine sentinel lymph nodes with two methods: blue injection and isotopic detection. Sentinel nodes will then be analyzed by immunohistochemy to detect micrometastases. No adjuvant therapy will be proposed to the patient if there are only node's micrometastases and survival will be analyzed in regard to the presence of these micrometastasis.
