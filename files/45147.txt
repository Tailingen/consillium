SGI-110 in Participants With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
Phase 1-2 dose-escalation randomized study in participants with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

Once the biologically effective dose (BED) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined in the Dose Escalation Segment, the Dose Expansion Segment will randomize participants with MDS, treatment naïve elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and relapsed/refractory AML participants to receive the BED or MTD dose. Relapsed/refractory AML participants may also receive SGI-110 on a daily x 10 schedule based on the total dose per cycle evaluated in the Dose-escalation Segment using the 5-daily regimen.
