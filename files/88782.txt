KN026 in Combination With Chemotherapy in HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer Subjects Who Have Failed First-line Therapy
KN026-001 is a two-stage study (Open-label stage/Randomized stage). Open-label stage is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KN026 and chemotherapy when given together. Randomized stage is designed to evaluate the OS and PFS in patients receiving KN026 and chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo and chemotherapy.

To explore the correlation of gene mutation status and the efficacy, Exploration of drug resistance mechanism , Explore predictive biomarkers, Up to 2.5 years|Subjects will be assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions and 5 Lines (EQ-5D-5L) scales, It is a vertical visual analogue scale that takes values between 100 (best imaginable health) and 0 (worst imaginable health), on which patients provide a global assessment of their health., Up to 2.5 years|Subjects will be assessed using the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) scales, The QLQ-C30 is composed of six functioning scales (including a measure for global quality of life), three symptom scales, and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Up to 2.5 years|Subjects will be assessed using the Quality-of-life Questionnaire Oesophago Gastric module 25 (EORTC QLQ OG25) scales, Quality-of-life Questionnaire Oesophago Gastric module 25 (EORTC QLQ OG25): Description: All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for all the scales and single-items represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Up to 2.5 years|Change from baseline in CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), Up to 2.5 years|Change from baseline in CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 199), Up to 2.5 years|Change from baseline in CA72-4 (carbohydrate antigen 724), Up to 2.5 years
KN026-001 is a two-stage randomized, multicenter, phase Ⅱ/Ⅲ clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of KN026 in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with HER2-positive advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer, including adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction, who have failed first-line therapy.

Stage 1 is an open-label, multicenter, phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the safety and ORR in subjects receiving KN026 in combination with chemotherapy. Stage 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ш study to evaluate the OS and PFS in subjects receiving KN026 in combination with chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy.
