Study of Arimidex and Radiotherapy Sequencing
The purpose of this study is to compare TGF-β1 change in concomitant with that in sequential Arimidex in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, as measured by the proportion of patients with an elevation of TGF-β1 level at the 4th week after initiation of radiotherapy relative to the pre-treatment baseline.

Level of TGF-β1, To compare TGF-β1 change in concomitant with that in sequential Arimidex in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, as measured by the proportion of patients with an elevation of TGF-β1 level at the 4th week after initiation of radiotherapy relative to the pre-treatment baseline., First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled
Acute skin reaction, Acute skin reaction occurrence rate defined by the occurrence of grade II or above acute skin reaction in patients with concurrent or sequential arimidex with radiotherapy., First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled|Other serum inflammatory cytokine, Pre-and post-radiotherapy other serum inflammatory cytokine, First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled|Cosmetic outcomes, Cosmetic outcomes in patients receiving breast conservative therapy treated by both arms., First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled|Lung toxicity, Occurrence of grade II or higher radiation-induced lung toxicity., First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled|Local-regional recurrence, Local-regional recurrence within two arms., First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled|Correlation between TGF-β1 Change and Clinical Outcomes, The correlation between TGF-β1 change and clinical outcomes will be explored., First analysis will occur 1 year after first subject enrolled
