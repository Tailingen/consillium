Multiparametric Imaging for Analysis of MVNT (Multinodular and Vacuolating Neuronal Tumor)
Differential diagnoses of MVNT include DNT (dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor), low-grade gliomas, cortical dysplasias or even hamartomas.

Differential diagnoses of MVNT include DNT (dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor), low-grade gliomas, cortical dysplasias or even hamartomas.

However, in order to avoid an invasive surgical procedure to remove the lesion, a certain diagnosis of its benignity is essential. The contribution of advanced techniques in MRI, such as spectroscopy in the characterization of these lesions, has not yet been studied today
