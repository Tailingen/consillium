Immunohistochemical Expression Patterns of microRNA Processing Enzyme Dicer in Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma, Benign and Dysplastic Melanocytic Naevi
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are very small endogenous RNA molecules about 22-25 nucleotides in length, capable of post-transcriptional gene regulation. miRNAs bind to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to cleavage or suppression of target mRNA translation based on the degree of complementarity. miRNAs have recently been shown to play pivotal roles in diverse developmental and cellular processes and linked to a variety of skin diseases and cancers. In the present study the researchers investigate the immunohistochemical distribution of Dicer in benign and dysplastic melanocytic naevi as well as in cutaneous malignant melanoma compared to intraindividual healthy control.
