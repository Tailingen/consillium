The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0264. This drug is being evaluated to check the effects on previously treated Asian individuals with Advanced GI Carcinoma (Phase 1) or Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (Phase 2). The study will enroll approximately 95 participants.

In Phase 1, approximately 14 Asian participants with GI malignancies will be enrolled in 3 planned dose cohorts according to the traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. The starting dose will be 1.2 mg/kg of MLN0264 administered IV on Day 1 of 3-week cycles for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Dose escalation will take place until Phase 2 recommended dose is determined.

In Phase 2, eligible Asian participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction will be enrolled. Participants must have failed at least 2 lines of prior anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Disease recurrence within 6 months of the last dose of post-surgical adjuvant chemotherapy counts as 1 line of prior anticancer therapy for advanced disease.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 3 years.
