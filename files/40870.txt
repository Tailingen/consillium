Comparison of 0.4% Hyaluronic Acid Solution Versus Hydroxyethylamide Solution in Submucosal Endoscopic Resections
This is a randomized, single-center clinical trial that will compare the efficacy of two substances used in the submucosal cushion formation stage of endoscopic submucosal resections of early esophageal malignant neoplasms. Such substances are hyaluronic acid in the form of TS-905 Blue Eyeₒ and hydroxyethylamide (Voluven®).
Esophageal Neoplasms|Endoscopic Mucosal Resection|Hyaluronic Acid
PROCEDURE: Submucous Endoscopic Dissection with hydroxyethylamide|PROCEDURE: Submucous Endoscopic Dissection with Hyaluronic acid (TS-905 Blue Eye)
Volume of solution, Compare the volume of TS-905 Blue Eye versus the solution of hydroxyethylamide used., During the procedure
Procedure duration in minutes, Evaluate how the procure lasts using each one of the solutions, During the procedure|Number of additional injections, Evaluate the number of additional injections need to complete the lesion ressection, During the procedure
1. Design of the study:

   This is a randomized clinical trial in a single center. The lesions will be randomized into three blocks based on the diameter of the largest axis (less than 3 cm, between 3 - 5 cm and greater than 5 cm).
2. Selection of patients:

   The population studied will be patients with early esophageal neoplasia diagnosed and/or referred for submucosal endoscopic dissection at the São Paulo Cancer Institute (ICESP), University of São Paulo.
3. Evaluation of effectiveness and definitions:

Effectiveness will be measured from the degree of usefulness. The degree of utility will be determined from two variables: obtaining or not a complete block resection and additional number of submucosal injections performed during endoscopic dissection. The solution that results in a complete block resection with a number of additional injections of 0 (excellent utility degree) or 1 (good utility degree) will be considered effective.
