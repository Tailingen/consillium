Senl-T7 CAR-T Cells for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory CD7+ Lymphoma
This study is an open and prospective clinical study, taking patients with relapsed or refractory CD7+ lymphoma as the test subjects, in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Senl-T7 CAR-T for patients with CD7+ lymphoma.
Lymphoma, T-Cell
BIOLOGICAL: Senl-T7
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after CD7, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Remission Rate, Remission Rate including complete remission(CR)、CR with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi)、No remission(NR), 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of CD7 CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, percentage of CD7 CAR- T cells measured by flow cytometry method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry method, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion
Main research purposes:
