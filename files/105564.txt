Study of AZD0754 in Participants With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumour activity of AZD0754 CAR T-cell therapy in participants with metastatic prostate cancer.

This is a first-time in human, multi-center, open label, Phase I/II study of AZD0754 autologous CAR T-cell therapy administered intravenously to participants with metastatic prostate cancer. The study is intended to assess the safety, cellular kinetics, pharmacodynamics, preliminary efficacy, and feasibility of manufacturing AZD0754 for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
