Study of TBX-3400 in Patients With Stage III and IV Melanoma Resistant or Refractory to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
This is a study of transfusion of TBX-3400 in patients with stage III and IV melanoma resistant or refractory to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.

The patient's own blood cells are exposed to a protein that has been shown in the laboratory to result in anti-tumor activity.

The study hypothesis is that TBX-3400 cells will enhance anti-tumor activity and improve the body's immune response.
