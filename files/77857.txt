The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the MTD to subsequently define an RP2D of alisertib in combination with weekly paclitaxel in East Asian participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Ovarian Cancer|Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Alisertib|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Dose Escalation Phase: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.

Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events.

Dose Expansion Phase: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to disease response based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Day 21 of every other Cycle beginning with Cycle 2 (Up to 12 months)
The drug being tested in this study was called alisertib. Alisertib in combination with paclitaxel was tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in East Asian participants. The study consisted of 2 parts: a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the alisertib plus paclitaxel combination in East Asian participants with advanced solid tumors; the second part is an expansion cohort at the RP2D of the alisertib plus paclitaxel in East Asian participants with either ovarian cancer or small cell lung cancer. This study looked at safety (lab results and side effects) and pharmacokinetic properties (how the drugs move throughout the body).

This open label study enrolled 9 participants. Dose Escalation Phase: Alisertib tablets at a starting dose of 15 mg, orally, twice daily, 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycle in combination with paclitaxel, 60 mg/m\^2 intravenous on days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles in Cohort 1 escalated to a dose of 25 mg alisertib, orally, twice daily 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycles in Cohort 2. If ≥ 2 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) the dose of alisertib decreased to 20 mg. Expansion Cohort: alisertib tablets at the determined RP2D dose orally, twice daily 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycles in combination with paclitaxel, 60 mg/m\^2 intravenous. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

* Alisertib 15 mg to 25 mg tablets
* Paclitaxel 60 mg/m\^2 intravenous solution

This multi-centre trial was conducted in Japan and Korea. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 24 months.

The study was terminated early because of the sponsor's decision. Enrollment was completed in the dose escalation cohort, but no participants were enrolled in the dose expansion cohort.
