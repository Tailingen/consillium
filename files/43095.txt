Mobilization of Stem Cells With Motixafortide (BL-8040) in Combination With G-CSF in Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase Ⅲ bridging clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of Motixafortide (BL-8040) + G-CSF vs placebo + G-CSF mobilized hematopoietic stem cells for autologous transplantation in Chinese patients with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
