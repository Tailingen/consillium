A Clinical Trial Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Biodegradable Magnesium Embolic Microspheres for Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if the addition of biodegradable magnesium metal microspheres to traditional TACE (Transarterial Chemoembolization) is effective in treating hepatocellular carcinoma, and to assess the safety of these microspheres.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is the treatment more effective than traditional TACE alone?
* What additional medical issues arise when using the microspheres?

Researchers will compare TACE with magnesium microspheres to traditional TACE without microspheres to see if the addition of the microspheres improves treatment outcomes.

Participants will:

* Receive up to 3 treatments of TACE with or without microspheres
* Undergo checkups and tests every 30 days
* Keep records of tumor size and other safety issues
