Phase I Imaging Study Evaluating Gem/Cis or Gem/Carbo for Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-0000-083 AM3)
This study will use imaging to look at tumor response to combination chemotherapy of gemcitabine (Gem) and cisplatin (Cis) or gemcitabine and carboplatin (Carbo) in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Metabolic Response Conversion Rate Between 3 and 6 Weeks After Starting Chemotherapy at a Threshold of a 20% Decrease in SUVmean, Metabolic response conversion rate is the number of participants initially classified as non-metabolic responders relative to baseline at week 3 after starting chemotherapy, who are then, relative to week 3, reclassified as metabolic responders at week 6 after starting chemotherapy, based on a pre-specified threshold of a 20% decrease in mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of \[18F\]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The SUVmean was calculated by summing the radioactivity from volumes of interest within each tumor and normalizing for the injected dose and lean body mass., Weeks 3 and 6 following chemotherapy
Repeatability of FDG SUVmean at Baseline, Two positron emission tomography (PET) scans are obtained on different days at baseline, as close together as possible, under conditions of no biological change, to measure FDG SUVmean. The SUVmean was calculated by summing the radioactivity from volumes of interest within each tumor and normalizing for the injected dose and lean body mass., Between -14 to -6 days and between -5 to 0 days prior to starting chemotherapy|Change in FDG-PET Uptake From Baseline to Week 3, Fold change in SUVmean of FDG uptake with accompanying 80% Confidence Interval. The SUVmean was calculated by summing the radioactivity from volumes of interest within each tumor and normalizing for the injected dose and lean body mass., Baseline and Week 3|Change in FDG-PET Uptake From Week 3 to Week 6, Fold change in SUVmean of FDG uptake with accompanying 80% Confidence Interval.
