Valproic Acid (Depakote ER) in Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs such as valproic acid may make thyroid cancers more radioiodine sensitive, which will allow for detection of tumor and make further ablation treatment effective.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Valproic Acid
Decrease in Thyroglobulin Level, Number of participants with decreased thyroglobulin level after study treatment, Baseline, 16 weeks|Decrease in Tumor Size, Number of participants with decreased tumor size after study treatment, Baseline, 16 weeks
Increased Radioactive Iodine Uptake, Number of participants with increased radioiodine uptake on the Thyrogen scan post valproic acid therapy, Baseline, 10 weeks|Side Effects of Drugs Affecting Quality of Life, Number of participants experiencing \> Grade 1 adverse events (including fatigue) attributable to study treatment, 17 weeks|Survival, up to 10 years post-study treatment
PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well valproic acid works in treating patients with thyroid cancers that do not respond well to other treatments.
