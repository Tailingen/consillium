Azacitidine and Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Lung or Head and Neck Cancer
The standard of care for head and neck and lung cancer includes chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. For patients with cancer of head and neck or lung that recurs after surgery and/or radiation, or has spread to other parts of body, chemotherapy using cisplatin can slow down tumor growth and extend lifespan.

The study drug, azacitidine, can block the ability of some cancer cells to replicate, and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a slowly developing blood cell-related cancer. In laboratory and animal experiments using head and neck and lung cancer cells, azacitidine has been shown to be a cisplatin "helper", (that is, it makes cisplatin more effective in stopping the growth of head and neck and lung cancer. )

Since the combination of azacitidine and cisplatin has not been used in patients with head and neck or lung cancer, the investigators are performing this study combining azacitidine and cisplatin to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the study drug may have on patients with advanced head and neck or lung cancer. The investigators are doing this study because they would like to find a better treatment for these types of cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Azacitidine and Cisplatin
Evaluate the safety and toxicity of azacitidine and cisplatin combination., weekly for first 4 weeks, then weekly times 2 for every 4 weeks
Determine the biologically effective dose of azacitidine, maximum tolerated dose of azacitidine and cisplatin combination, and tumor response, every 8 weeks for response evaluation
Azacitidine will be given with standard dose of cisplatin. At the beginning of the study, three patients will be treated with low dose of azacitidine. If that dose does not cause bad side effects, then the dose will slowly be made higher for new patients who take part in the study.

Patients will receive azacitidine as a once-a-day subcutaneous (under the skin) injection every day from day 1 to day 5 of 28 days in this study. Cisplatin is given intravenously on day 8. This 28-day or 4-week period of time is called a cycle. Cycles are repeated every four weeks for as long as the physician recommends.

During this study, patients will need the following tests and procedures.

* Physical exam - This will be done weekly during first 2 weeks of every 4-week treatment cycle.
* Blood tests for blood counts - These will be done every week.
* Blood tests for kidney function, liver function, and to measure electrolytes - These will be done every week
* Blood samples for research study - This will be done weekly during first cycle, then weekly during the first 2 weeks on the subsequent treatment cycles
* X-rays or scans - These will be done once every 8 weeks.
