Project CASCADE: Community and Academic Synergy for Cancer Survivorship Care Delivery Enhancement
The purpose of this study is to implement a clinic-level cancer survivorship care delivery intervention in partnership with community health center clinicians, patients, and community representatives to test effectiveness of the intervention to improve patient and clinician outcomes and to evaluate implementation of the intervention using an iterative, concurrent mixed-methods approach guided by the Practice Change Model.
Cancer Survivorship
