Stereotactic Radiosurgery Combination With Anlotinib for Limited Brain Metastases in NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic radiosurgery combination with Anlotinib could improve the efficacy and outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer with limited brain metastases.

This is a retrospective study. The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic radiosurgery combination with Anlotinib could improve the efficacy and outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer with limited brain metastases. Patients in Anlotinib group took Anlotinib 1 week before the MRI-based simulation，12mg/d QD，day1\~14, 21d/cycle. Patients in SBRT group took no anti-angiogenic drugs. All patients received SBRT for brain metastases.
