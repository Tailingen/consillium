18F FES-PET/MRI for Tailoring Treatment of Luminal a and Lobular Breast Cancer
Study hypothesis is that combining the advantages of hybrid PET/MRI and the high sensitivity/specificity of 16-alpha-18F-fluoro-17-beta-estradiol(FES), a radiolabeled form of estrogen binding to functionally active ER, the investigators could obtain a reliable, non-invasive, operator-independent, one-stage imaging method for staging LumA and ER-positive Lobular tumours.

Sensitivity of FES PET/MRI in detecting macrometastatic axillary lymph nodes, Ability of FES PET/MRI to detect macrometastatic (tumor deposit\>2mm) axillary lymph nodes in BC patients with LumA or Lob who are candidates to primary surgery., Day 50
Changes in Standard Uptake Value (SUV) of FES in patients undergoing induction Endocrine Treatment (ET), To investigate the potential correlation between Δ(FES SUV) and Δ(Ki-67 as proliferation index) after induction ET in luminal BC., Day 0 and Day 50
FES PET/MRI sensitivity compared to that of standard imaging in patients undergoimg systemic therapy for neoadjuvant purposes or for metastatic disease., Results from FES PET/MRI will be compared with those from standard imaging in terms of sensitivity and number of lesions detected., Day 0|FES PET/MRI ability to predict tumor response or no response to therapy, Results of FES PET/MRI after two cycles of therapy will be compared to final pathology (cohort C) or standard imaging at 6 months (cohort D), Day 180
This is a single-centre prospective cohort study where patients with LumA and ER-positive Lob will be enrolled in 4 cohorts undergoing: primary surgery; induction endocrine therapy; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; systemic therapy for metastatic disease. For the purpose of the study an additional FES PET/MRI exam will be performed at baseline for local and systemic staging and a second exam after systemic therapy. Correlations between FES PET/MRI parameters and pathology, gene expression and FDG PET parameters, when available, will be investigated. Aim 1: Evaluating the performance of FES PET/MRI in axillary staging compared with axillary surgery. Aim 2: Evaluating potential correlations between changes in FES uptake and changes in proliferation index after 3 weeks of endocrine therapy before surgery. Aim 3: Evaluating the performance of FES PET/MRI in staging of patients undergoing systemic therapy in comparison with standard imaging. Additionally, biological determinants of tumor heterogeneity will be investigated.
