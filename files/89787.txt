A Study of LY3039478 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level of LY3039478 that can safely be taken by participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, including but not limited to lymphoma. The study will also explore changes to various markers in blood cells and tissue. Finally, the study will help to document any tumor activity this drug may have.

DRUG: LY3039478|DRUG: Prednisone
Part A and F: Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Baseline to disease progression or participant discontinuation (estimated 8 -12 weeks)|Part B, C, D, E and F: Number of Participants with Tumor Response, Baseline to disease progression or participant discontinuation (estimated 8 -12 weeks)
Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3039478, Predose up to 30 hours post dose|Pharmacokinetics: Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of LY3039478, Predose up to 30 hours post dose|Part A: Number of Participants with Tumor Response, Baseline to disease progression or participant discontinuation (estimated 8 -12 weeks)|Part B, C, D, E and F: Duration of Response (DoR), Date of Complete Response or Partial Response to Date of Objective Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Estimated up to 6 Months)|Part B, C, D, E and F: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Baseline to Objective Progression or Death from Any Cause (Estimated up to 6 Months)|Part B, C, D, E and F: Overall Survival (OS), Baseline to Date of Death from Any Cause (Estimated up to 14 Months)
In Part A of this study, participants with advanced/metastatic cancer (including lymphoma) will receive increasing doses of LY3039478 to define the dose level for Part B, C, D and E. In Part B, C, D and E LY3039478 will be explored at a predefined fixed dose level. Participants in Part B and D must have a defined alteration in a certain molecular pathway. Enrollment of participants in Part B, C, D and E will start once Part A is completed. In Part F participants will receive increasing doses of LY3039478 in combination with prednisone to define the maximum tolerated dose level.
