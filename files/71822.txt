Phase III Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of EP2006 and Filgrastim
The study will assess the efficacy of EP2006 compared to Filgrastim with respect to the mean duration of severe neutropenia during treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
Chemotherapy Associated Neutropenia|Breast Cancer
DRUG: EP2006|DRUG: Filgrastim
Mean Duration of Grade 4 Neutropenia During Cycle 1 of Chemotherapy, Mean duration of severe neutropenia, defined as the mean number of consecutive days with Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC less than 0.5\*10\^9 cells/L), 21 days (Cycle 1 of chemotherapy treatment)
Incidence of Febrile Neutropenia, Incidence of febrile neutropenia by duraton within each cycle and across all cycles. Febrile neutropenia is defined as oral temperature greater than or equal 38.3°C while having an Absolute Neutrophil Count \< 0.5\*10\^9 cells/L (both measured on the same day), 21 weeks/ 6 cycles|Number of Days of Fever, Number of days of fever by cycle. Fever is defined as oral temperature greater than or equal to 38.3°C., 21 weeks/ 6 cycles|Depth of Absolute Neutrophil Count Nadir, Depth of Absolute Neutrophil Count Nadir, defined as the patient's lowest Absolute Neutrophil Count in cycle 1, Cycle 1/ 21 days|Time to Absolute Neutrophil Count Recovery, Time to Absolute Neutrophil Count recovery, defined as the time in days from Absolute Neutrophil Count nadir until the patient's Absolute Neutrophil Count increases to more or equal to 2\*10\^9 cells/L after the nadir in cycle 1, Cycle 1/ 21 days|Frequency of Infections, Frequency of infections by cycle and across all cycles, 21 Weeks/ 6 cycles|Incidence of Hospitalizations Due to Febrile Neutropenia, Incidence of hospitalizations due to Febrile Neutropenia, 21 Weeks/ 6 cycles
The study will assess the efficacy of EP2006 compared to Filgrastim with respect to the mean duration of severe neutropenia during treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
