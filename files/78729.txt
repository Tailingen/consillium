Prognostic Indicators in Pituitary Adenoma Surgery: a Comprehensive Analysis of Surgical Outcomes and Complications.
Predicting the outcome of pituitary surgery, particularly the risk of complications, is a critical determinant in selecting the appropriate treatment modality for patients. To date, only a limited number of risk factors have been identified for complications following pituitary surgery, including tumor size, younger age, and previous surgical intervention. Furthermore, existing studies have demonstrated that prolactin levels can serve as a surrogate marker for assessing pituitary function, specifically revealing associations between elevated prolactin levels and anterior pituitary insufficiencies.

In a retrospective study on the "HYP'OP" cohort, the aim of the study is to identify predictive factors for both surgical outcomes and complications.

Risk factors associated with complications, Risk factors associated with complications arising from surgery, specifically targeting the incidence of de-novo, clinically significant pituitary insufficiencies, Within 6 months after surgery
Factors predictive of the 'success' of surgery, Patients were stratified into groups based on surgical indications. The first group consisted of non-secreting, non-compressive adenomas without preoperative insufficiency or hyperprolactinemia, with success defined as absence of new insufficiency and no MRI-detected residual tissue. The second group was similar to the first but included disconnection hyperprolactinemia, and success was defined by the absence of new insufficiency and hyperprolactinemia regression. The third group involved non-secreting adenomas with at least one preoperative axis deficiency, irrespective of hyperprolactinemia, with success defined as restoration of at least one deficient axis without new insufficiency. The fourth group included secreting adenomas, with success defined as hypersecretion regression. The fifth group involved adenomas operated on for their compressive effect on the optic pathways, with or without hyperprolactinemia, and success was defined as no compression observed on follow-up MRI., Within 6 months after surgery|Is immediate postoperative hypoprolactinemia predictive of the onset of a new, clinically significant hormonal insufficiency?, patients were stratified into four groups based on immediate postoperative prolactin levels: Group 1 consisted of severe hypoprolactinemia; Group 2 included moderate hypoprolactinemia; Group 3 involved normal prolactin levels, defined by prolactin levels between 5 and 20 ng/ml; and Group 4 comprised hyperprolactinemia, defined by prolactin levels \> 20 ng/ml. It should be noted that these instances of hyperprolactinemia are theoretically all disconnection hyperprolactinemias, as patients with lactotroph adenomas were excluded from this analysis. Patients under treatment for hyperprolactinemia were also excluded., Within 6 months after surgery
Is hypoprolactinemia at the 4-month follow-up is correlated with the number of affected pituitary axes?, Patients were stratified into four groups using the same criteria as outlined in Outcome 3., Within 6 months after surgery
