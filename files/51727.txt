Artificial Intelligence Driven Personalisation of Radiotherapy and Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Patients (the HypoPro Trial)
The aim of this prospective, single-arm phase II study is the individualization of both radiotherapy (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) duration for patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) based on multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI) classification. All patients will receive (i) a dose escalation to the prostate via HDR brachytherapy (boost), (ii) twelve months of ADT and (iii) extremely hypofractionated RT to the prostate (5 fractions).

This way, patients in the HypoPro trial will receive a prostate-only dose escalation and benefit from shortening of the ADT compared with current guideline recommendations.

Disease-free survival 5 years after treatment, Disease recurrence is defined as PSA failure according to Phoenix, new lesions on PSMA PET and/or MRI imaging or the beginning of any salvage therapy., Five years

For the diagnosis of local failure, verification via biopsy is warranted, Two and five years after RT|Metastatic free survival (MFS) after end of RT, MFS is defined as survival time in months from beginning of RT until detection of any new lesion confirmed as metastasis by PSMA-PET/CT or mpMR imaging or death., Two and five years after RT|Overall survival (OS), OS will be measured from the last day of RT to the date of death whatever the cause of death is. Patients who are alive are censored at the date of the most recent follow-up examination. The cause of death of each patient dying during the study will be recorded and reported., Assessment at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 months after RT|Prostate cancer specific survival (PCSS), PCSS is defined from the last day of RT until death as most reasonable consequence of progressive prostate cancer, judged by the investigator., Assessment at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 months after RT|Biochemical failure, Time to biochemical failure after end of RT (phoenix definition), Two and five years after RT|Quality of Life (QoL), Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) EPIC-26: the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-Short form) with score: 0-100, Assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after randomization (± 14 days for each visit) and at 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 months after Ultra-hypofractionated RT - UHF (± 1 month)|Quality of Life (QoL), Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) IIEF-5: The International Index of Erectile Function with score: 0-5, Assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after randomization (± 14 days for each visit) and at 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 months after Ultra-hypofractionated RT - UHF (± 1 month)|Genitourinary (GU) acute toxicities, Cumulative acute GU toxicities using the RTOG grading system (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; with grade: 0-5, where 0 implies no toxicity and 5 implies a side effect related to death), During, at 1 and 3 months after RT|GU acute toxicities, Cumulative acute GU toxicities using the CTCAE v5.0 criteria (the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria; with grade: 1-5 where 1 means asymptomatic or mild symptoms and 5 means death related to adverse event), During, at 1 and 3 months after RT|GU chronic toxicities, Cumulative chronic GU toxicities using the RTOG grading system (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; with grade: 0-5, where 0 implies no toxicity and 5 implies a side effect related to death), During, at 1 and 3 months after RT|GU chronic toxicities, Cumulative chronic GU toxicities using the CTCAE v5.0 criteria (the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria; with grade: 1-5 where 1 means asymptomatic or mild symptoms and 5 means death related to adverse event), during, 1 and 3 months after RT|Gastrointestinal (GI) acute toxicities, Cumulative acute GI toxicities using the RTOG grading system (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; with grade: 0-5, where 0 implies no toxicity and 5 implies a side effect related to death), During, 1 and 3 months after RT|GI acute toxicities, Cumulative acute GU toxicities using the CTCAE v5.0 criteria (the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria; with grade: 1-5 where 1 means asymptomatic or mild symptoms and 5 means death related to adverse event), During, at 1 and 3 months after RT|GI chronic toxicities, Cumulative chronic GU toxicities using the RTOG grading system (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; with grade: 0-5, where 0 implies no toxicity and 5 implies a side effect related to death), Assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after RT|GI chronic toxicities, Cumulative acute GU toxicities using the CTCAE v5.0 criteria (the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria; with grade: 1-5 where 1 means asymptomatic or mild symptoms and 5 means death related to adverse event), Assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after RT|Testosterone recovery, Testosterone recovery is to be done through a blood test, Assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after randomization (± 14 days for each visit) and at 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 months after Ultra-hypofractionated RT - UHF (± 1 month)
In Cyprus approximately 800 men are newly diagnosed with PCa every year. Prostate cancer caused 6.1 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) globally in 2016. The socio-economic burden is high since PCa-related life-time costs are approximately 40,000 per patient with early stage disease at initial diagnosis.

This is a prospective, single-center phase II trial. Patient participants will receive treatment for prostate +-seminal vesicles base high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR BT) with 15 Gray units (Gy) with minimal dose covering 90% of the prostate (D90) / 1 fraction followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with 25 Gy in 5 Gy / fraction (daily); of the prostate +- seminal vesicles. Concomittant/adjuvant admission of 12 months ADT.

First: 1 fraction HDR BT including fiducial placement Second: 14 ±2 days gap Third: 5 fractions of SBRT within 5 consecutive weekdays For the HypoPro patients, we expect no significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) rates compared to the FLAME trial (2) which one arm treated the patients with moderately-hypofractionated RT to the prostate plus dose escalation to the intraprostatic tumor plus 18-24 months of ADT. Secondary endpoints like metastatic free survival, prostate cancer survival and overall survival will depict the oncologic efficacy in this patient cohort. Thus, the results of this study might be used as the basis for a randomized-controlled trial comparing this dose escalated radiotherapy plus shortened ADT duration with the standard of care (no dose escalated RT, ADT for 2-3 years) in this highly selected treatment group: NCCN high-risk, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) cN0/cM0 and MMAI low/intermediate-risk. Considering the epidemiological importance of the PCa, these results could have a significant socio-economic impact. In parallel a translational research program will address the identification of novel biomarkers to predict the treatment outcome.
