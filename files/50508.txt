Assessment of adverse events (based on CTCAE version 3.0), laboratory values, vital sign measurements, general examination, HRCT, SpO2, ECG, Laboratory assessment prior to chemotherapy administration in all treatment cycles and on days 2, 8 and 15 in cycle 1. General exam, SpO2 and ECG prior to chemotherapy administration in all treatment cycles. HRCT scans performed days 21, 42, 70-98.
