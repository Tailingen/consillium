Phase II Study Of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy In Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The goal of this study is to determine the effect of chemotherapy on decreasing the size of unresectable pancreas cancer thereby allowing it to be surgically removed. In addition, this study may provide information on how tumors behave when exposed to certain types of chemotherapy.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Erlotinib
The primary endpoint is a dichotomous variable evaluating the # of patients who obtain an RO resection versus the number of patients that do not obtain an RO resection plus the number of patients who are not resectable., 9-10 months
DFS, PFS, OS and TD will be observed on each patient and censored at the end of the study. Measurements of toxicity are categorical variables. All numerical variables will be summarized by mean +- standard deviation (STD) and/or median (range), 9-10 months
Although surgery is the only curative modality for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the majority of patients (\~80%)are unresectable at presentation. The use of a multimodality approach may be a crucial method to improve the dismal survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. A logical tactic is to use neoadjuvant cytotoxic agents and targeted drugs to facilitate resectability.
