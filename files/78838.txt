Sequential or Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced NPC
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of sequential chemoradiotherapy (induction chemotherapy + intensity-modulated radiotherapy +adjuvant chemotherapy) with induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in order to confirm the value of sequential chemoradiotherapy in NPC patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: gemcitabine and cisplatin (Induction and adjuvant chemotherapy)|RADIATION: IMRT|DRUG: gemcitabine and cisplatin (Induction chemotherapy)|RADIATION: IMRT and concurrent cisplatin
Failure-free survival, Failure-free survival is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of treatment failure or death from any cause, whichever is first., 3-year|Grade III or more mucositis, Grade III or more mucositis during radiotherapy, From the start of radiotherapy to 30 days after radiotherapy
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause., 3-year|Locoregional failure-free survival, Locoregional failure-free survival is calculated from randomization to the first locoregional failure., 3-year|Distant failure-free survival, Distant failure-free survival is calculated from randomization to the first remote failure., 3-year|Short-term treatment response, Treatment response after induction chemotherapy, IMRT and completion of treatment., Two weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy. Three months after completion of the radiotherapy.|Number of participants with adverse events, Incidence of acute and late toxicity, up to 3 years|Quality of Life, Use EORTC QLQ-HN35., up to 3 years
Patients with non-keratinizing NPC III-IVA (UICC/AJCC 8th edition) are randomly assigned to receive sequential chemoradiotherapy (induction chemotherapy + intensity-modulated radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy) or induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is given as 2.2 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to a total dose of 66 or 70.4 Gy to the primary tumor. The induction or adjuvant chemotherapy is given gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8) and cisplatin (25mg/m² d1-3) every 3 weeks for two cycles. The concurrent chemotherapy is given cisplatin 30 mg/m² every week concurrently with IMRT. Our primary endpoint is failure-free survival(FFS) and grade III mucositis during radiation. Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS) rates and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
