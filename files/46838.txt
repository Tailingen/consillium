Early Biomarkers of Tumor Response in High Dose Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Word Package 3 : Immune Response
This study will follow-up immune cell populations, secreted factors and released nanovesicles in the blood before, during and after high dose radiation therapy which should give new information of the efficacy of the hypofractionated high dose radiation therapy and a rationale for adjuvant immunotherapy.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Colorectal Neoplasms|Melanoma|Kidney Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Blood samples collection before radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Blood samples collection during radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Blood samples collection after radiotherapy|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Analyse of immunological parameters, decription of secreted markers and nanovesicles production, Description and evolution of cell fraction, quantification of immune cells, verification of the presence and evolution of activation markers and quantification of secreted exosomes ; before, during and after radiotherapy, from baseline to 1 year follow up
Cell viability, determined by number of live/dead cells present, Cell viability and cell proliferation, from baseline to 1 year follow up|Progression-free rate, progression-free rate at 12 months, from baseline to 1 year follow up|Number of Participants with Adverse Events related to radiotherapy, adverse effects (acute toxicity) according to CTCAE-NCI, from baseline to 1 year follow up
* Patient information and collection of a signed informed consent form
* Clinical data collection
* Blood samples of 35 mL:

  1. after registration, prior to the first fraction of radiotherapy
  2. within 15 minutes after the administration of the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd radiotherapy sessions
  3. one week, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after the last radiotherapy session
* Storage of the blood samples at ambient temperature
* Transportation of the samples to the Institute of Biology of Lille (IBL) - CNRS UMR8161 for analysis
* Destruction of the samples at the end of the analysis
