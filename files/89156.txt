This is a phase 2, single-arm, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in patients with R/R DLBCL. The eligible patients will receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection (20 mg/m\^2) once every 4 weeks for a maximum of 8 cycles. Patients will receive treatment until the completion of 8 cycles of treatment, disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal (patient's decision or investigator's decision), whichever comes first. All patients will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease progression/recurrence, initiation of new antitumor therapy, or being lost to follow-up.
