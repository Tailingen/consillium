Pancreatic Cancer Biomarker Study
This is a non-treatment, blood collection study to evaluate biomarker panels for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, Number of patients clinically diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Up to three years|Investigational biomarker panel for diagnosis, sTRA biomarker and CA 19-9 levels at enrollment, Enrollment
Disease progression, Disease progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma as measured by RESIST v1.1 criteria, Up to three years|Investigational biomarker panel for disease surveillance, sTRA biomarker and CA 19-9 levels measured at any time point deemed clinically relevant for standard of care., Up to three years
This is a non-treatment, blood collection study to evaluate biomarker panels for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

Study participants will be recruited by physician referral or from a list of clinical patients being evaluated for a potential pancreatic abnormality or for potential treatment of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, a surveillance cohort will be recruited among individuals who are being monitored for recurrence following surgical or medical treatment for pancreatic cancer.

Peripheral blood specimens will be collected from all participants at time of enrollment. Additional specimens may be collected from surveillance cohort participants no more frequently than once every 3 months as clinically indicated.

The specimens will be sent to a clinical lab for sTRA biomarker and CA19-9 analysis. Participants will be followed for 36 months to track clinical outcomes. The performance of the investigation biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, or surveillance of pancreatic cancer will be compared to the performance of CA19-9.
