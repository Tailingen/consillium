A Pilot Study to Evaluate Neurocognitive Injury and Longitudinal Changes in White Matter During Radiation Therapy in Children With Primary Brain Tumors
This is a pilot study to assess the changes in white matter, in the brain, in response to radiation therapy and correlate these changes with later declines in cognitive function.
Brain Tumor, Primary
RADIATION: Cranial Radiotherapy|DEVICE: MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)|BEHAVIORAL: Neuro-cognitive Testing (CogState)
Evaluate the Change From Baseline in Perpendicular Diffusivity of Water as Measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at 3 Weeks and at 6 Weeks Post Radiation Therapy., Descriptive statistics and plots will be used to determine Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) parameters for various regions in the brain. The mean (across subject) change in DTI parameter for a given region, at a given time, will be used to assess white matter injury., Baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks
Evaluate the Correlation Between Global COGState Scores and the Perpendicular Diffusivity of Water by Diffusion Tensor Imaging at Baseline, 3 Weeks, and 6 Weeks Into Treatment., Determine the change in cognitive test scores from baseline to time-points early during radiation therapy (3 and 6 weeks) using CogState (a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based on expansive neurocognitive tests). Correlate test scores from COGState with changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at the same timepoints using scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients. As a pilot study multiple comparisons will be assessed; however, the working hypothesis is that DTI changes as measured by an increase in diffusivity of water perpendicular to the direction of axonal transport will be measurable even in this acute setting and will correlate with global response as measured on COGState with the sub-domains on executive function anticipated to be most highly correlated., Baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks|Evaluate the Correlation Between Global COGState Scores, Radiation Dose, and the Perpendicular Diffusivity of Water as Measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging at 6 Months, Determine the change in cognitive test scores from baseline, at 6 months using CogState (a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based on expansive neurocognitive tests). Correlate test scores from COGState with changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at the same timepoints (Baseline and 6 months) using scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients. As a pilot study multiple comparisons will be assessed; however, the working hypothesis based upon results in adults treated with radiation therapy is that DTI changes as measured by an increase in diffusivity of water perpendicular to the direction of axonal transport will correlate with changes in global response as measured on COGState with the sub-domains on executive function most highly correlated. In addition, these regional changes in DTI will be directly related to the radiation doses received in these regions., 6 months
