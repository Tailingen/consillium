Clinical Study of Hospital-manufactured CD19 CAR-T in Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) have been developed to treat relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies with promising outcome in patients with very poor prognosis. The purpose of this clinical study is to produce the CD19\[cluster of differentiation antigen 19\] CAR-T (SNUH-CD19-CAR-T) at the investigational site and to evaluate safety and efficacy of SNUH-CD19-CAR-T in children and adolescent with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
