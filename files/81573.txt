Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for Patients With Rectal Cancer
This study will investigate short course radiation therapy using IMRT as an alternative to standard chemo radiation because prior studies have shown that this method of treatment will potentially reduce some fo the side effects of standard treatment, improve quality of life, and help to control the growth of rectal cancer cells. IMRT is a type of radiation that uses computer-generated images to match radiation to the size and shape of the tumor. Since the intensity of each radiation beam can be controlled, the radiation dose can wrap around normal tissue which allows the study doctor to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumor with less damage to nearby healthy tissue. The purpose of this research study is to see what impact this treatment will have on quality of life, as well as to see if there are any late side effects that come about after the participant has completed the treatment.

Pelvic Control Rate, To determine the pelvic control rate of patients after short course radiation therapy and surgery., 2 years|Surgical Complication Rate, To determine the surgical complication rate in patients who received preoperative radiation therapy., 2 years|Tissue Microarray, To determine changes in the tumor induced by radiation as assessed by tissue microarray., 2 years|Quantity of Circulating Tumor Cells, To determine the impact of radiation and surgery on quantity of circulating tumor cells in both metastatic and non-metastatic patients., 2 years|Accuracy, To determine the accuracy of advanced MRI imaging and PET (Positron Electron Tomography) /CT in predicting nodal stage., 2 years
* Radiation treatment to the rectum will be given once a day, for 5 days. Each radiation treatment will take about 20-30 minutes.
* The following procedures will be performed on day 1 of radiation treatment: physical examination, blood tests and quality of life questionnaire.
* During radiation treatment a physical examination will be performed once during the 5 days of radiation treatment. A Quality of Life Questionnaire will be administered on the last day of radiation treatment.
* Surgery will be performed within 3-14 days after the last day of radiation treatment.
