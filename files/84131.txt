Multicentre Phase I Trial of Engineered T Cells for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Primary Cutaneous CD30+ Large T Cell Lymphoma or Transformed CD30+ Mycosis Fungoides
Patients with cutaneous CD30 positive lymphoma will receive systemical and topical treatment with their own genetically modified T cells. Treatment evaluation consists of assessment of safety and preliminary evidence of response.
CD30 Positive Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma|CD30 Positive Transformed Mycosis Fungoides
GENETIC: Genetically modified T cells # 1138
Rate of patients experiencing dose limiting toxicities of engineered T cells #1138.|Definition of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of engineered T cells #1138.
Preliminary evidence of response to treatment, * Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of treated lesion.
* Partial Response (PR): At least 30% decrease in the sum of two diameters compared to the initiatal diameters of the treated lesion.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least 20% increase in the sum of two diameters of treated lesions.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of two diameters while on study.
