CD34+ Enriched Transplants to Treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This study will evaluate whether processing blood stem cell transplants using an investigational device (the CliniMACS system) results in fewer complications for patients who undergo transplant to treat a blood malignancy (cancer) or blood disorder.

The CliniMACS system will be used to remove immune T-cells from the transplant donor's blood. Immune T-cells contribute to graft versus host disease (GVHD) - a serious complication that can happen after transplant. GVHD occurs when a patient's immune system attacks the donor's cells. The study aims to reduce the number of the donor immune T-cells thereby preventing or reducing the severity of GVHD.

DRUG: Busulfan|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Fludarabine|DEVICE: CliniMACS CD34+ enriched, T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
Change in incidence of graft vs. host disease (GVHD), Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, Weekly until 3 months, monthly until 6 months, 12 months, 24 months|Change in severity of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD), Severity of acute GvHD as graded using the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry Severity Index, which includes assessment of skin, liver, and gut, grading each's severity from 0 to 4 (higher numbers reflecting the more severe disease). The overall assessment is based on the involvement and severity of each of the areas. A = Stage 1 skin involvement, no liver or gut involvement; B = Stage 2 skin involvement, Stage 1 to 2 gut or liver involvement; C = Stage 3 skin, liver or gut involvement; D = Stage 4 skin, liver, or gut involvement., Weekly until 3 months, monthly until 6 months, 12 months, 24 months|Change in severity of chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD), Severity of chronic GvHD as graded using the NIH scoring system, which includes assessment of skin, mouth, eyes, GI tract, liver, lungs, joint/fascia, and genital tract and grades the severity of affected organs from 0 to 3 (higher scores reflecting the more severe disease). The overall assessment is based on the number of organs/sites with clinically significant functional impairment (i.e., score 2-3). No GVHD = no organs/sites with significant functional impairment; Mild GVHD = involves two or fewer organs/sites with significant functional impairment; Moderate GVHD = involves three or more organs/sites with significant functional impairment -OR- involves one or zero organs/sites with NO significant functional impairment; Severe GVHD = Major disability caused by chronic GVHD., Weekly until 3 months, monthly until 6 months, 12 months, 24 months|Change in incidence of relapse-free mortality (transplant-related mortality), Incidence of relapse-free mortality, defined as mortality related to the transplant rather than the disease, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months|Change in overall survival, Incidence of overall survival, defined as time from transplant to death or last follow-up., 6 months, 12 months, 24 months|Change in disease-free survival, Incidence of disease-free survival, defined as the minimum time interval of relapse/recurrence, to death or to the last follow-up, from the time of transplant., 6 months, 12 months, 24 months
Proportion of patients receiving optimal vs. suboptimal CD34+/CD3+ PBSC doses, Proportion of patients receiving optimal CD34+ (\>5 x 10\^6/kg) and CD3+ (\< 5 x10\^4/kg) cell doses versus the proportion recurring suboptimal doses (\<3 x 10\^6/kg) CD34+ cells; and the proportion of patients receiving CD3+ T-cell doses (\>5 x 10\^4/kg), Day 0
