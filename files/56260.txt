Plerixafor Harvesting And No Chemotherapy for Transplantation of Autologous STem Cells In Cancer (PHANTASTIC)
To assess the efficacy and toxicity of plerixafor (AMD 3100) together with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for stem cell mobilisation, in patients with myeloma or lymphoma requiring high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.

DRUG: Plerixafor and G-CSF
A composite primary endpoint of BOTH an adequate stem cell harvest (â‰¥4 x 106 CD34+/kg in no more than 2 aphereses); AND a neutrophil count that never falls below 1.0 x 109 / Litre in the 3 weeks following initiation of mobilisation., 3 weeks following initiation of mobilisation
Serial neutrophil and platelet counts during mobilisation, 1 Day|Total stem cell yield in 1-2 aphereses, 1 day|The usage of plerixafor and the number and timing of apheresis collections, 1 day|The time to neutrophil engraftment after subsequent transplantation, First of 2 consecutive days on which the neutrophil count equals or exceeds 0.5 x 109/litre|The time to platelet engraftment after subsequent transplantation, First of two consecutive days on which the platelet count equals or exceeds 50 x 109/litre, having been free of platelet transfusion for at least 48 hours
