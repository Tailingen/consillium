A Study of Subcutaneous (SC) Pembrolizumab Coformulated With Berahyaluronidase Alfa (MK-3475A) vs Intravenous Pembrolizumab in Adult Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475A-D77)-Japan Extension
This study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of SC pembrolizumab (+) berahyaluronidase alfa vs intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab, administered with chemotherapy in first line treatment of adult Japanese participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The primary hypotheses of this study are pembrolizumab (+) berahyaluronidase alfa subcutaneous (SC) is noninferior to pembrolizumab IV with respect to PK parameters.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~16 months
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, AUC is defined as area under curve exposure. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., At designated time points (Up to ~14 months)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, Ctrough is defined as the trough concentration at steady-state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Ctrough., At designated time points (Up to ~18 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, Cmax is defined as the peak concentration over the dosing interval. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, Ctrough is defined as the trough concentration. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Ctrough., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, AUC is defined as area under curve exposure at steady state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, Cmax is defined as the peak concentration over the dosing interval in steady-state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax, At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Number of Participants Who Test Positive for Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) for Pembrolizumab, Blood samples are to be collected at designated time points for the determination of the presence or absence of anti-pembrolizumab antibodies. The percentage of participants who develop anti pembrolizumab antibodies will be reported., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~59 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~59 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), For participants who show confirmed CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~59 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants with an AE will be reported for Arms 1 and 2., Up to~28 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported for Arms 1 and 2., Up to~25 months
Japan extension study will require approximately six years which includes one additional year (beyond the global study's last participant last study related contact) from the time the first participant (or their legally acceptable representative) provides informed consent until the last participant's last study related contact to complete.

The Japan extension study will include participants previously enrolled in Japan in the global study for MK-3475A-D77 (NCT05722015) plus the study will continue to enroll participants in Japan until the sample size for participants in Japan reaches approximately 39.

As of Amendment 1 of the supplemental statistical analysis plan (effective date: 23 Aug 2024), patient reported outcomes will no longer be the secondary outcome measures of the study.
