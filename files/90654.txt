A Comparison of Breast Tomosynthesis Mammography and Conventional Breast Imaging in the Characterization of Breast Masses
The purpose of this study is to compare conventional breast imaging and diagnostic work-up (2 dimensional imaging) to digital breast tomosynthesis (3 dimensional imaging) in the appearance of non-calcified breast masses. It is thought that non-calcified breast masses will be better visualized with the new 3D technology.

DEVICE: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis
It is anticipated that out of 100 subjects recalled for additional breast imaging that 10 women will be recalled for biopsy. By adding 2D & 3D imaging, it is anticipated that 30 subjects out of 100 will have needed no workup., 9 months
