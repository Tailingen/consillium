This study will include participants with 1 of the following advanced or metastatic tumors approved for treatment with nivolumab monotherapy:

* non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
* renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
* unresectable or metastatic melanoma
* hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
* microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer (MSI-H/dMMR CRC)
* in Part B, other solid tumors may be considered at the discretion of the Clinical Trial Physician
* In addition to the above tumors, Part E will also include participants with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC).

Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From first dose until 100 days post last dose (up to approximately 28 months).|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment Related Adverse Events (TRAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. TRAEs are AEs where a reasonable causal relationship exists between study treatment administration and the AE., From first dose until 100 days post last dose (up to approximately 28 months).|Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: (a) results in death, (b) is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), and/ or (c) requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization., From first dose until 100 days post last dose (up to approximately 28 months).|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment Related Serious Adverse Events (TRSAEs), A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: (a) results in death, (b) is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), and/ or (c) requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization. TRSAEs are SAEs where a reasonable causal relationship exists between study treatment administration and the SAE., From first dose until 100 days post last dose (up to approximately 28 months).|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment Related Adverse Events (TRAEs) Leading to Discontinuation, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. TRAEs are AEs where a reasonable causal relationship exists between study treatment administration and the AE., From first dose until 100 days post last dose (up to approximately 28 months).|Number of Participants Who Died, Number of participants who died due to any cause., From randomization until data cutoff (up to approximately 46 months).|Number of Participants With Select Laboratory Changes From Baseline, Laboratory parameters including hematology, chemistry, liver function, and renal function summarized using worst grade NCI CTCAE v.5 criteria. Baseline refers to evaluations with a date on or prior to the day of first dose of study treatment., From first dose until 30 days post last dose (up to approximately 25 months).|Number of Participants Experiencing Any Select Adverse Events Within the Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reaction Category and Broad Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) of Anaphylactic Reaction Occurring Within 2 Days of Study Drug Administration, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From first dose until 2 days post last dose (up to approximately 24 months and 2 days).|Number of Participants With Anti-Nivolumab Antibodies (ADAs) and Neutralizing Antibodies, Anti-drug antibody (ADA) Positive: A participant with at least one ADA-positive sample relative to baseline (ADA negative at baseline or ADA titer to be at least 4-fold or greater (\>=) than baseline positive titer) at any time after initiation of treatment; Neutralizing Positive: At least one ADA-positive sample with neutralizing antibodies detected post-baseline.

Baseline ADA Positive: A participant with a baseline ADA-positive sample. Baseline refers to evaluations with a date on or prior to the day of first dose of study treatment., At baseline and up to 100 days post last dose (up to approximately 28 months).
