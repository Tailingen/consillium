A Study Of Oral Palbociclib (PD-0332991), A Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor, In Patients With Advanced Cancer
PD-0332991 may work in cancer by stopping cancer cells from multiplying. PD-0332991 is in a new class of drugs called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK inhibitors). This research study is the first time that PD-0332991 will be given to people. PD-0332991 is taken by mouth daily.

DRUG: PD-0332991
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLT: an adverse event occurring after initiation of PD 0332991 that met any following criteria: 1) Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (platelets less than \[\<\] 25000 per microliter (mcL), absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \<500/mcL, hemoglobin \[Hb\] \<6.5 gram per deciliter \[g/dL\]; 2) ANC \<1000/mcL associated with documented infection or fever greater than or equal to (\>=) 38.5 degrees Celsius; 3) \>=Grade 3 non-hematologic treatment-related toxicity. In an asymptomatic participant, Grade 3 corrected QT (QTc) prolongation (\>500 millisecond) (only if persisted with repeat testing and after correction of reversible causes \[electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia\]); and 4) Inability to receive next dose of PD 0332991 within 1 week (+/-1 day) of last dose due to lack of hematologic recovery (platelets \<50000/mcL, ANC \<1000/mcL, and Hb \<8.0 g/dL) or due to prolonged non-hematologic toxicities of \>=Grade 3 severity. Occurrence of a DLT necessitated immediate interruption of scheduled study treatment., Baseline up to 28 days|Maximum Administered Dose (MAD), Three new evaluable participants were to be assessed at each new dose level. The minimum time that these participants were to be followed after starting treatment was 1 cycle (28 or 21 days) before a new dose level could be opened. If none of these 3 participants experienced a DLT, the next higher dose level was to be opened on that schedule. If 1 participant developed a DLT, 3 more evaluable participants were to be enrolled at that dose level; if none of these additional 3 participants developed a DLT, the next higher dose level was to be opened on that schedule. If \>=2 participants experienced a first cycle DLT at the same dose level and schedule, that dose level was to be defined as the MAD for that schedule. No additional participants were to be entered at the MAD for that dosing schedule. DLT is defined in Outcome Measure 1., Baseline up to 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose Level (RP2D), MTD was defined as the highest dose level studied for which the incidence of first cycle DLT was \<33%.

High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content., Hour 0 (pre-dose) to 10 hours post-dose on C1D1|Percent Dose Recovered Unchanged in Urine (Percent Ae): Single Dose, Percent of dose recovered unchanged in urine over the 10 hour collection interval=100\*(Ae divided by dose). Ae is the cumulative amount of drug recovered unchanged in urine over the 10 hour collection interval. Cumulative amount was calculated as sum of urine drug concentration in sample volume for each collection interval., Hour 0 (pre-dose) to 10 hours post-dose on C1D1|Percent Dose Recovered Unchanged (Percent Ae) in Urine: Food Effect, The percent Ae is defined in Outcome Measure 44. To determine impact of food (specifically high-fat meal) on PD 0332991 PK, participants were tested under fed and fasted conditions in crossover fashion. Each participant served as their own control. In crossover fashion first dose was administered under either fed (high-fat meal) or fasted (10-hour fast) condition on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2. First 6 participants were tested under fed (on C1D1) followed by fasted (on C2D1) conditions, next 6 participants were tested under fasted (on C1D1) followed by fed (on C2D1) conditions. Only participants in PD 0332991 200 mg (14/21 days) and 125 mg (21/28 days) groups participated in food effect crossover and results were to be reported as per fed and fasted conditions. High-fat meal was composed of around 800 to 1000 calories total, with fat composing around 50% of total caloric content., Hour 0 (pre-dose) to 10 hours post-dose on C1D1|Number of Participants With Best Response, Number of participants with best response. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial Response (PR): \>=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of lesions taking as reference baseline sum LD and no unequivocal progression in non-target lesions. Progressive disease (PD): \>=20% increase in sum of LD of lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of the LD since treatment start, or the appearance of \>=1 new lesion or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD): neither shrinkage for PR nor increase for PD taking as reference smallest sum of LD since treatment start. SD was assessed following the first 2 cycles of treatment (\>=2 cycles), 4 cycles of treatment (\>=4 cycles), and 10 cycles of treatment (\>=10 cycles). Participants may be reported in more than 1 category of SD. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Baseline up to end of treatment, assessed at C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C1D22, thereafter Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every other cycle up to end of treatment (up to Cycle 93)|Inhibition of Cyclin-dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk4/6) Based on Phosphorylated Retinoblastoma (p-Rb) in Tumor Tissue, Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein by Cdk4/6 is typically required for human cancer cell proliferation. Tumor biopsies were to be performed, to demonstrate inhibition of Cdk4/6 based on reduction in phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb) in tumor tissue and p-Rb levels (fold decrease) were to be reported., Baseline, C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C1D22, thereafter Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every other cycle up to end of treatment (up to Cycle 93)|Correlation of Cyclin-dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk4/6) With PD 0322991 Dose, Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein by Cdk4/6 is typically required for human cancer cell proliferation.

PD-0332991 may work in cancer by stopping cancer cells from multiplying. PD-0332991 is in a new class of drugs called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK inhibitors). This research study is the first time that PD-0332991 will be given to people. PD-0332991 is taken by mouth daily.
