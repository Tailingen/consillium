Effects of Anesthesia on Immunity in Cancer
The aim of the study is a comparative study of the cellular immunity response of patients operated on for kidney cancer under total intravenous and inhalational anesthesia.

The severity of perioperative immunosuppression is directly proportional to the degree of surgical stress. A series of experimental and clinical studies indicate a different effect of certain types of anesthesia on immunity. It is believed that surgical stress itself opens an opportunity for the recurrence of oncological diseases precisely due to the immunosuppressive effect. The aim of present pilot clinical study is to test a hypothesis that total intravenous anesthesia as superior to inhalational anesthesia in term of its effects on cell immunity among patients with kidney cancer.
