Observational Study of Viral BIOmarkers and microRNAs in Tumors Orofarynx and Occult Tumors Positive for Papilloma Virus
Based on the evidence summarized in the introduction, the clinician hypothesize that the detection of the presence and expression of HPV-DNA, certain miRNAs, and a certain mutational profile in the tissues and biological fluids of these patients, may have important prognostic and diagnostic value not only in HPV-related OPSCCs but also in HPV+ occult T. Accordingly, this study aims to aim to better characterize their potential as biomarkers and to detect the possibility of their their use to implement the sensitivity and specificity of radiological methodologies (PET-CT and MRI), already in use in clinical practice, for monitoring disease progression in this specific subgroup. Finally, by using the collected material to generate organoids and Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX), the study also aims to identify possible new molecular drugs, which could solve the problem of resistance to radiochemotherapy.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Study of Viral BIOmarkers and microRNAs in Tumors Orofarynx
Accouracy, Investigating the kinetics of HPV-DNA and miRNAs in patients with oropharyngeal and occult T tumors with laterocervical metastasis. Conducting this study will allow us to collect the information needed to be able to generate hypotheses and design a subsequent larger study., Baseline
