A Study Comparing Standard Treatments in People With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of different FDA-approved/NCCN-recommended drug treatments for NMIBC. In particular, the FDA-approved drug nadofaragene firadenovec will be compared to usual care with other NCCN-recommended standard treatments for NMIBC (gemcitabine with or without docetaxel, mitomycin, re-treatment with BCG, or pembrolizumab).
Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Nadofaragene Firadenovec|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel
high-grade recurrence-free survival, The time from the initiation of treatment to the detection of recurrence of high-grade bladder cancer (biopsy-proven intravesical recurrence or distant metastasis). Biopsy proven high grade intravesical recurrence will be based on the MSK pathology review of the bladder tissue samples., up to 24 months
Progression-free survival, Disease progression is defined as the development of muscle-invasive disease (stage â‰¥T2), lymph node or distant metastasis, or death without documented disease progression., up to 24 months
