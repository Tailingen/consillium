Exploratory Study of Topical Norepinephrine in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Radiotherapy
This study, a nonrandomized open-label safety and exploratory study, will evaluate the safety of topical norepinephrine in post-surgical breast cancer patients who are undergoing radiation therapy.

The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or decrease the severity of the radiation dermatitis experienced by these patients.
Radiodermatitis
DRUG: Norepinephrine
Safety of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field, The primary safety hypothesis is that there will be little or no skin irritation associated with the application of the topical norepinephrine and no systemic effects secondary to transdermal absorption., Safety will be assessed for up to 11 weeks following the start of treatment.
Efficacy of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field, The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the portion of the radiation site that is treated with topical norepinephrine immediately prior to daily radiotherapy will have less severe radiation dermatitis than the adjacent untreated portion of the radiation site., Efficacy will be assessed for up to 11 weeks following the start of treatment..
