Adjuvant Epirubicin/Cytoxan Followed By A Taxane VS. Epirubicin/Taxane As Treatment For Node-Positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare two combinations of drugs, epirubicin given with a taxane (ET) or epirubicin given with cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) and followed by a taxane to see if one of the combinations is better at preventing or delaying the time for breast cancer recurrence and death after 3 years. The study will also evaluate the side effects of both treatment combinations.
