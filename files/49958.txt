Satisfaction Survey for the Outpatient Unit Dedicated to Post-cancer Treatment
The care pathway for breast cancer is complex, punctuated by consultations, complementary examinations and treatments. Patients benefit from close medical and paramedical support. At the end of the treatment, the post-cancer phase begins and the surveillance begins. The National Cancer Institute's (INCa) ten-year cancer control strategy for 2021-2030 defines in its second axis the objective of limiting the after-effects and improving the quality of life of cancer patients. Indeed, ensuring rapid access to functional rehabilitation and post-treatment reconstruction, and setting up personalized and graduated follow-up between the city and the hospital, are crucial. Better information for patients on the post-cancer period is a way for them to acquire greater autonomy, to enable them to take an active role in it and to approach it with greater serenity.

The Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group (GHPSJ) has therefore created an outpatient medical unit (UMAb) dedicated to post-cancer treatment in July 2021. It is offered to all patients who have had localized breast cancer and have received curative treatment. Each patient, 3-4 months after the end of treatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy), will benefit from a half-day session including 3 consultations: medical, nursing and physiotherapy. The medical consultation allows for additional information if there are any questions about the care received, a clinical examination, reassessment of the tolerance of adjuvant hormone therapy if it is indicated, and delivery of the personalized post-cancer program (PPAC). The nursing consultation is conducted by a person certified in therapeutic patient education. Numerous items are discussed, with the aim of identifying personal difficulties (financial, family or work-related, for example) that may hinder post-cancer rehabilitation, detecting specific support care needs and promoting post-cancer health (encouraging normal weight, smoking cessation, recommended nutritional factors and physical activity). Finally, the physical therapy consultation consists of a joint, muscle and scar assessment to promote normal functionality and the implementation of recommended physical activity. Imaging examinations (cardiac ultrasound and/or mammography/ultrasound and/or bone densitometry) may be associated with the consultation.

As part of investigator's quality and continuous improvement approach, investigators would like to collect the opinions of patients who have benefited from the UMAb post breast cancer since its creation.
