Sunitinib for Advanced Thymus Cancer Following Earlier Treatment
Background:

- Sunitinib is drug that is approved for treating various types of cancers, including kidney cancers. However, it has not been approved to treat cancers of the thymus. Sunitinib works by blocking proteins that are responsible for cell division and growth. Some of these proteins can be found on thymus cancer cells. Researchers want to see if sunitinib can be used to treat advanced thymus cancer. It will be given to people who have had at least one earlier chemotherapy treatment containing platinum.

Objectives:

- To see if sunitinib is a safe and effective treatment for advanced thymus cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced thymus cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments.
* At least one previous cancer treatment must have been chemotherapy treatment containing platinum.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor biopsies will be used to check the severity of the cancer.
* Participants will take sunitinib tablets once a day, in the morning. They will take the tablets daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest with no sunitinib. This 6-week period is called a cycle.
* Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.
* Treatment cycles may be repeated as long as the tumor does not continue to grow and there are no severe side effects....

Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response (Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR) for Sunitinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Thymoma or Thymic Carcinoma, Objective response rate (CR + PR) will be measured according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for sunitinib monotherapy in participants with advanced thymic malignancies. Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., A median duration of 6 months
Progression-free Survival for Sunitinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Thymoma or Thymic Carcinoma, Progression free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progression was measured by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesion, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; and the appearance of one or more new lesions., An average of 10 months|Number of Participants Alive at 1 Year After Treatment With Sunitinib, Number of participants alive at 1 year after treatment with sunitinib., 12 months after initiation of treatment|Number of Grades â‰¥3 Adverse Events Related to Sunitinib, Adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). Grade 3 is severe. Grade 4 is life-threatening. Grade 5 is death related to adverse event., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 110 months and 28 days for the thymoma/thymic carcinoma group and 91 months and 11 days for the thymic carcinoma only group.
Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0)., Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 110 months and 28 days for the thymoma/thymic carcinoma group and 91 months and 11 days for the thymic carcinoma only group.
BACKGROUND:

Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymoma and thymic carcinoma. However over 50% of these patients may fail initial therapy and therefore require second-line therapy. New therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. Results obtained from protocol 12-C-0118 so far have shown impressive clinical activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent thymic carcinoma with an objective response rate of 23% and disease control rate of 91% which is unprecedented for this histology. Treatment at a dose of 50 mg once daily for four weeks followed by 2 weeks off was poorly tolerated. Twenty five out of 41 patients needed dose reductions due to development of intolerable adverse events.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary objective:

- To evaluate the objective response rate (Partial Response (PR)+Complete Response (CR) for sunitinib in patients with relapsed or refractory thymoma or thymic carcinoma

MAIN ELIGIBILITY:

* Patients with histologically confirmed thymoma (Group 1 only) or thymic carcinoma who have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen with progressive disease prior to study entry
* Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria
* Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function
* No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of sunitinib

DESIGN:

* In the first group (Group 1), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous schedule at 50 mg per day for 4 weeks with 2 weeks off to constitute a 6-week cycle (Schedule 4/2) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.
* In the second group (Group 2), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous schedule at 50 mg per day for 2 weeks with 1 week off to constitute a 3-week cycle (Schedule 2/1) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.
* Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0
* Tumor response assessments by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be performed every cycle for Group 1 and every other cycle for Group 2 (every 6 weeks) for patients receiving treatment for less than one year, and every two cycles for Group 1 and every four cycles for Group 2 (every 12 weeks) for patients who have been receiving treatment one year or longer.
* Exploratory studies include evaluation of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 12 (IL-12), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Group 1 only); and circulating tumor cells, endothelial progenitors, and mature apoptotic endothelial cells (both groups). In Group 2, regulatory T cells (Tregs), exhausted cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and Type 1 T helper (Th1)/Type 2 T helper (Th1) T cell populations will also be evaluated. Where tumor samples are available, intra-tumoral immune infiltrate will be assessed (both groups). Exploratory studies apply to National Cancer Institute (NCI) only.
