The Swallowing Function of Oral Cancer Surgery
This study enrolled patients who underwent oral cancer resection. Swallowing function, muscle status, and nutritional status were assessed before treatment, one month after treatment, and between three months to one year post-treatment.

Dysphagia is a common and debilitating symptom among patients who undergo oral cancer resection with reconstruction followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. During the course of the disease, approximately 20% to 98% of patients experience swallowing difficulties. This is primarily caused by tumor destruction, postoperative sequelae from surgical resection, and the adverse effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy-particularly when combined-increases the incidence of complications such as oropharyngeal mucositis, odynophagia, dysgeusia, xerostomia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. These complications may lead to dehydration and significant weight loss, which in turn negatively impact nutritional status, functional ability, and quality of life.
