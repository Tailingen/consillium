Trial of Ruxolitinib and Erlotinib in Patients With EGFR-mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma With Acquired Resistance to Erlotinib
This is a phase 2 study. The goal of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking erlotinib and ruxolitinib has on the patients and on lung cancer. Erlotinib and ruxolitinib are FDA approved for other indications, but the use of erlotinib and ruxolitinib together has not been studied before and is not FDA-approved.
