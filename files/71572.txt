Clinical Study of Cord Blood-derived IL-10 CD19-CAR NK in the Treatment of Refractory/Relapsed B-cell NHL
To study the safety and effectiveness of cord blood-derived IL-10 CD19-CAR NK in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19 IL10 CAR-NK
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), To evaluate the safety, and tolerability, and determine the recommended dosage of cord blood-derived Anti-CD19 IL10-CAR-NK Cell Therapy for B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Up to 28 days
Complete response rate (CR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of CB IL-10-CD19-CAR NK, Up to 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Up to 2 years|Partial response rate (PR), Up to 2 years|Overall response rate (ORR), Up to 2 years
This is an open, single-arm, single-dose, dose-escalation clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and the preliminary efficacy of CB IL-10 CD19-CAR NK cells. 6-24 patients are planned to be enrolled in the dose-escalation trial (2×10\^6 cells/kg, 3×10\^6 cells/kg, 4×10\^6 cells/kg). The primary endpoints are DLT and MTD; the second is the overall response rates (CR and PR), survival, and progression-free survival. Patients will be infused on day 0, day 3, and day 6， respectively.
