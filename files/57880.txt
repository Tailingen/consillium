High-Dose Firmonertinib Combined With Bevacizumab and Intrathecal Pemetrexed in the Treatment of EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Leptomeningeal Metastasis
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose firmonertinib combined with bevacizumab and intrathecal pemetrexed in EGFR Ex19del/L858R-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), as measured by Overall Survival (OS).

Secondary Objectives:

1. To assess the efficacy of this regimen in EGFR Ex20ins/PACC/L861Q-mutated NSCLC with LM.
2. To further evaluate therapeutic outcomes across cohorts, including:

   * Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)
   * Leptomeningeal Objective Response Rate (ORR-LM)
   * Clinical Response Rate
3. To analyze the impact of this regimen on \*quality of life\* using standardized metrics:

   * EORTC QLQ-C30
   * EORTC QLQ-LC13
4. To assess safety profiles across cohorts, focusing on:

   * Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) graded per \*CTCAE v5.0\*
   * Frequency of treatment-related toxicities

Exploratory Objectives:

To investigate correlations between dynamic changes in:

* Plasma-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
* Cerebrospinal fluid-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and clinical outcomes through comparative analysis of genomic profiling and epigenetic signatures before and after treatment.
