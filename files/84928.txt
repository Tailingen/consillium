CPI-613 and Hydroxychloroquine for Patients With High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is a phase 1/2 study of the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of high risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients who have failed a hypomethylating agent.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Progressive Disease
DRUG: CPI-613|DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine
Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Dose-limiting toxicities assessed in order to be able to establish the maximum tolerable dose for the combination of CPI-613 and Hydroxychloroquine therapy for patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome who have failed hypomethylating therapy. Using the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 for adverse event reporting (Grade 1 (Mild) - 5 (Death) as well as expectedness (unexpected/expected) and attribution (definitely related to study treatment to unrelated to study treatment)., 4 weeks|Overall Response Rate, Measurements for response criteria will be based upon the Modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 response criteria for altering natural history of myelodysplastic syndrome. Overall response rates criteria - complete remission (CR), partial response (PR) marrow CR, hematologic improvement (HI), or stable disease, failure, relapse after complete response or partial response, cytogenetic response, disease progression and survival) of high risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients who have failed hypomethylating agents treated with the combination of CPI-613 and the maximally tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine., 4 weeks
Proportion of Patients with Toxicities, Toxicity profiles of participants during the trial to assess the safety of the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine will be presented in tables that describe the number and proportion of patients observed with toxicities., 4 weeks|Progression-free-survival, Progression-free-survival is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to the time of progression, death, or date of last contact; those lost to follow-up will be censored. Kaplan-Meier survival curves to examine progression free survival in participants will be created., Up to 5 years or until death|Overall Survival, Overall survival of myelodysplastic syndrome patients who have failed hypomethylating agents treated with the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine defined as the time from enrollment on study to death from any cause., Up to 5 years or until death|Changes in the Frequency of Blood Transfusions, The investigators will assess for each participant the number of blood transfusions needed and create tables to display the number and timing of blood transfusions that occur., Baseline to approximately 6 months
Primary Objective(s):

* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of CPI-613 and Hydroxychloroquine therapy for patients with high risk MDS who have failed hypomethylating therapy.
* To determine the overall response rate (complete remission (CR), marrow CR, partial remission (PR), Hematologic improvement (HI)) of high risk MDS patients who have failed hypomethylating agents, treated with the combination of CPI-613 and the maximally tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine

Secondary Objective(s):

* To assess the safety of the combination
* To assess progression-free-survival (PFS)
* To assess the overall survival of MDS patients who have failed hypomethylating agents treated with the combination of CPI-613 and hydroxychloroquine defined as the time from enrolment on study to death from any cause.
* To assess any changes in the frequency of blood transfusions

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine, followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatments repeat every 14 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients receive hydroxychloroquine PO and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
