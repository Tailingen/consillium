Study of Oral Debio 0123 in Combination With Carboplatin in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study has two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. The primary objective of the study, in the Dose Escalation Part is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Debio 0123 when administered in combination with carboplatin in participants with advanced solid tumors that recurred or progressed after prior cisplatin or carboplatin containing therapy and for which no standard therapy of proven benefit is available.

The primary objective of the study, in the Dose Expansion Part is to characterize the safety and tolerability of Debio 0123 when administered in combination with carboplatin at the RP2D determined during the dose escalation part of the study and to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of Debio 0123 when administered in combination with carboplatin.
