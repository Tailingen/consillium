A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Toxicities of PLX038, in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
Single arm phase II study for with primary objective to evaluate the efficacy of PLX038 on response rate for patients with pretreated, metastatic or locally advanced triple negative breast cancer.
Breast|Cancer
DRUG: PLX038
Best tumor response, Best tumor response (defined as PR or CR in the first 6 months of treatment, assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1 criteria)., 24 weeks
Time to response (TTR), Time to response is defined as the time from inclusion to the first objective tumor response and will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, Until 24 months|SAEs (all grade, per NCI-CTCAE v5.0), Serious adverse events (SAEs)according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, by grade and their relationship to PLX038, Until 30 days after the last dose of IMP (24 months + 30 days)|Correlation between PLX038 efficacy and homologous recombination (HR) defect (assessed by HR genes mutational status and BCRAness phenotype), Incidence of efficacy of PLX038 in pre-defined biomarker subgroups (BRCAness), Until 24 months|PK analysis, Maximum Plasma Concentration effect of PLX038, Until 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first documented PR or CR until the date of disease progression or the date of death. DoR will be computed using Kaplan-Meier, Until 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from inclusion to progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death, among included patients, Until 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), PFS is defined as the time from inclusion to the first event among progression and death. OS is defined in the same way but only death is taken into account., Until 24 months|AEs, Adverse events (AEs) according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, by grade and their relationship to PLX038, Until 30 days after the last dose of IMP (24 months + 30 days)|Correlation between PLX038 efficacy and homologous recombination (HR) defect, replication stress-related biomarkers such as SFLN11 expression, Incidence of efficacy of PLX038 in pre-defined biomarker subgroups (SLFN11 expression), Until 24 months|Correlation between PLX038 efficacy and homologous recombination (HR) defect replication stress-related biomarkers such as RB1 loss, Incidence of efficacy of PLX038 in pre-defined biomarker subgroups (RB1 loss), Until 24 months|PD analysis, Maximum Plasma Concentration of effect of PLX038, Until 24 months
This is an open label, multi-centric phase II study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of PLX038 in locally-advanced or metastatic TNBC. Patient must have received prior therapy (administered in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and/or metastatic setting) with chemotherapy by an anthracycline, taxane and sacituzumab-govitecan (unless not medically appropriate or contraindicated for the patient) and received a minimum of two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Patients will be treated at a dose of 1730mg/m2 IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle Q3W (every 21 days, 1 cycle = 1 injection).

All included patients will receive PLX038 as single agent as long as study is ongoing or until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision, lost to follow-up, death, patient non-compliance, or study termination by Sponsor.

Tumor assessments must be performed according to the RECIST V1.1 criteria at inclusion and every 8 weeks (Â± 7 days) from inclusion until documented disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or death. Radiographic measurements must be performed to the RECIST specifications.
