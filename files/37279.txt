A Study of Idasanutlin in Combination With Obinutuzumab in Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and in Combination With Rituximab in R/R Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Participants
This is a open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin in combination with obinutuzumab in participants with R/R FL and rituximab in combination with idasanutlin in R/R DLBCL. The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by an expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase is designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for idasanutlin in combination with obinutuzumab for FL and in combination with rituximab for DLBCL. The expansion phase is designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with idasanutlin at the RP2D with the selected regimen in participants with R/R FL and of rituximab in combination with idasanutlin at the RP2D in participants with R/R DLBCL.

Percentage of Participants With Complete Response at the End of Induction, Determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) on the Basis of Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) Scans Using Modified Lugano 2014 Criteria, The plan was for the IRC to evaluate responses at the end of induction treatment in participants from the expansion phase using Lugano 2014 criteria for malignant lymphoma for a PET-CT-based complete response (CR), which required a complete metabolic response with a score of 1, 2, or 3 with or without a residual mass in lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites on the PET 5-point scale for 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (1 = no uptake above background; 2 = uptake less than or equal to \[≤\] mediastinum; 3 = uptake greater than \[\>\] mediastinum and ≤ liver; 4 = uptake moderately \> liver; 5 = uptake markedly \> liver and/or new lesions). The CR criteria were slightly modified to require normal bone marrow by morphology (if indeterminate, immunohistochemistry negative). PET-CT scans were performed at end of induction only on participants who had received at least 2 cycles of induction treatment; those without a post-baseline tumor assessment were to be considered non-responders., Within 6 to 8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 6 (up to approximately 28 weeks; 1 cycle is 28 days)

Any AEs that were not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 were graded per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to AE. The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade., From first dose until 90 days after the last dose of study drug treatment (up to 31 months)|Baseline Value and Change From Baseline Values of Systolic Blood Pressure at Specified Timepoints, Vital signs were measured prior to the infusion while the participant was in a seated position.
