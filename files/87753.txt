Multidisciplinary Approach to Nutritional Support for Oncological Patients - NUTRACARE PROJECT
Malnutrition correlated to increased perioperative morbidity occurs in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.

Adherence guidelines for nutritional assessment and support in oncological patients is unfortunately very low.

The aim of the study is to improve clinical practice by using and testing the digital platform NUTRACARE in 5 different Centers.

Nutritional intervention, Number and type of nutritional interventions required, 15 days
Complications, Number and severity of surgical and oncological complications, up tp 30 days
After being informed about the study, all the patients undergoing elective surgery or first cycle of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy giving written informed consent will be screened by the surgeon or the oncologist and the NRS-2002 (Nutrition Risk Screening) will be administered.

Patients who will be assessed at risk will be notified to the center nutritionist.
