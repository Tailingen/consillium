Decitabine (DAC) w/ or w/o Valproic Acid (VPA) in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if decitabine, given with or without valproic acid, can help to control AML or MDS. The safety of both treatments will also be studied.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Valproic Acid
Participant Response Rates to Decitabine With or Without Valproic Acid in MDS and AML, Complete Remission (CR): CR defined as normalization of peripheral blood and bone marrow with \< 5% bone marrow blasts, a peripheral blood granulocyte count \> (1.0 x 10\^9/ L, and a platelet count \> 100 x 10\^9/L). CRi or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery is defined as above, but platelets \<100 x 109/L. Partial Remission: as above except for the presence of 6-15% marrow blasts, or 50% reduction if \<15% at start of treatment. Clinical Benefit: In MDS/CMML, as per International Working Group (IWG) criteria, platelets increase by 50% and to above 30 x 10\^9/L untransfused (if lower than that pretherapy); or granulocytes increase by 100% and to above 10\^9/L (if lower than that pretherapy); or hemoglobin increase by 2 g/dl; or transfusion independent; or splenomegaly reduction by \> 50%; or monocytosis reduction by \> 50% if pretreatment \> 5 x 10\^9/L. In addition to IWG criteria, in AML, a decrease in bone marrow blasts to \<5% also considered clinical benefit., 1 Year
Response Duration, The date of Response to the date of loss of response or last follow-up., Up to 60 months|Overall Survival Rate, Time from date of treatment start until date of death due to any cause or last Follow-up., Up to 7 years
Decitabine and valproic acid are both designed to cause changes in different groups of proteins that are attached to DNA (the genetic material of cells), which may cause cancer cells to die. Researchers want to see if a combination of valproic acid with decitabine can help improve disease response as well as how long responses last in treating MDS and AML.

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in one group will receive decitabine. Participants in the other group will receive decitabine and valproic acid. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group at first. After 20 participants are enrolled in each group, you will have a greater chance of being assigned to the group that is showing better results.

Participants in both groups will receive decitabine on Day 1 through a central venous catheter (CVC) in a vein over 1 hour each day for 5 days. A central venous catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure. Participants who are assigned to also get valproic acid will take the drug by mouth on Days 1-7 (7 days in a row).

On Day 0 (the day before treatment begins) or on Day 1, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn on or about Days 0 or 1, 5, and 10 (if your routine blood tests were found to be abnormal) to learn the status of the disease.

Routine blood draws (about 4 teaspoons) will be done 1-2 times weekly for the first cycle and then every 2-4 weeks in further cycles. You will have another bone marrow aspiration to check disease response to treatment, and then you will have one every 1-3 cycles. One (1) cycle of treatment is 4-8 weeks long.

You may remain on this study as long as you are benefitting or up to 2 years after you first achieve a complete response. Your dose level may be decreased depending on the side effects you may experience. However, if the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this study.

This is an investigational study. Decitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of MDS. Valproic acid is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of seizure disorders. Up to 150 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
