A Study of JNJ-54767414 (HuMax CD38) (Anti-CD38 Monoclonal Antibody) in Combination With Backbone Treatments for the Treatment of Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose regimen of daratumumab when administered in combination with various treatment regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose of daratumumab when administered in combination with various treatment regimens for different settings of multiple myeloma. The various treatment regimens to be combined with daratumumab in this study include Velcade-dexamethasone (VD), Velcade-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), Velcade-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD), pomalidomide-dexamethasone (Pom-dex), carfilzomib-dexamethasone (CFZ-dex) and carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd). Approximately 250 patients (approximately 12 participants per VTD and VMP backbone treatment regimen, 6 for the VD regimen, up to 100 participants in the Pom-dex regimen, 80 for the CFZ-dex regimen \[10 participants will receive a single-dose of daratumumab and the remaining participants will receive a split-dose of daratumumab\], and up to 40 for the KRd regimen) will be enrolled in this study. The study will consist of screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Treatment will extend to either the planned treatment duration for a maximum of 1 year (in Velcade-dexamethasone, Velcade-melphalan-prednisone, Velcade-thalidomide-dexamethasone regimens and KRd regimens), or in the Pom-dex and CFZ-dex regimens, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the end of study. Follow-up will continue until the study ends (approximately 25 months after the last patient receives the first dose of daratumumab). Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug does to the body) blood samples will be collected. Clinical efficacy outcomes and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
