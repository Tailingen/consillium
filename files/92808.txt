Futibatinib in Patients With Specific FGFR Aberrations
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of futibatinib in patients with FGFR aberrations in 3 distinct cohorts. Patients will be enrolled into one of 3 cohorts: patients with advanced, metastatic or locally-advanced solid tumors harboring FGFR1-4 rearrangements (excluding primary brain tumors and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma \[iCCA\]); patients with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer harboring FGFR2 amplification; and patients with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangements.

Study TAS-120-202 is an open-label, multinational, 3-arm Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of futibatinib in patients with FGFR aberrations. Eligible patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts based on diagnosis and FGFR gene aberration status.

Patients will receive futibatinib at an oral dose of 20 mg once a day on a continuous 28-day cycle.

The study will enroll approximately:

* Cohort A: 60 patients with locally advanced, advanced, or metastatic solid tumor harboring FGFR rearrangements other than primary brain tumor or iCCA;
* Cohort B: 35 patients with locally-advanced, advanced, or metastatic gastric cancer or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) with FGFR2 amplification;
* Cohort C: 20 patients with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms (MLN) with FGFR1 rearrangements

Treatment in all cohorts will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other of the criteria for treatment discontinuation is met. For patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, tumor assessments should be continued until radiologic disease progression is documented or until initiation of subsequent new anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first).

Patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (Â±2 weeks) until survival events (deaths) have been reported for 75% of enrolled patients or the study is terminated early by the Sponsor.

Additional cohorts may be added in the future in case of new emerging efficacy data.
