A First-in-Human Study of CDK-002 (exoSTING) in Subjects With Advanced/Metastatic, Recurrent, Injectable Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, safety, pharmacodynamic, and PK study of CDK-002 in subjects with advanced/metastatic, recurrent, injectable solid tumors, whose disease has progressed despite receiving standard of care treatment. CDK 002 will be administered intratumorally (IT).

Part A will enroll subjects with advanced/metastatic, recurrent, injectable solid tumors with emphasis on head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).
