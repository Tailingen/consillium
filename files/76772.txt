Durvalumab Long-Term Safety and Efficacy Study
The aims of the study are to monitor the long-term safety of durvalumab, to provide continued treatment or retreatment with durvalumab to eligible patients, and to collect overall survival (OS) information.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Durvalumab
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was the development of any untoward medical occurrence (other than progression of the malignancy under evaluation) in a participant or clinical study participant administered a medicinal product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A SAE was an AE occurring during any study phase that fulfilled one or more of the following: resulted in death; was immediately life-threatening; required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; was a congenital abnormality or birth defect; was an important medical event that jeopardized the participant or required medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above., From the time of signing the informed consent form until the follow-up period is completed (90 days after the last dose of durvalumab); approximately 37 months
Cohort 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed investigator-assessed response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from the date of re-initiation of treatment with durvalumab monotherapy. Tumor assessments were performed according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline and reduction in short axis diameter to \<10 millimeters (mm) for any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameter., Tumor assessments as determined by the Investigator (at least every 12 weeks) until withdrawal of consent, progression or death; approximately 30 months|Cohort 2: Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR was defined as the time from first documented CR or PR to time of first documented disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression. Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST v1.1., Tumor assessments as determined by the Investigator (at least every 12 weeks) until withdrawal of consent, progression or death; approximately 30 months|Number of Participants Who Were Alive, Number of participants who were alive are reported in this outcome measure. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive., Up to approximately 37 months
This is a multicenter, open-label, global study that will enroll patients who are currently receiving durvalumab monotherapy, or have previously received durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with any other approved or investigational anticancer agents, in an eligible AstraZeneca/MedImmune-sponsored clinical study.
