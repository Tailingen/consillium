Efficacy and Safety Study of CB-5945 for the Treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CB-5945 for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain.
Opioid-Induced Constipation
DRUG: CB-5945|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) Responder Rates at 12 Weeks, A Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) Weekly Responder (calculated for each week of the 12-week double-blind treatment period) is a participant who has ≥ 3 SBMs for the week and an increase from baseline of ≥1 SBM for the specified week, based on at least 4 Available Data Days (ADDs) during the week. A Complete SBM (CSBM) Weekly Responder is a participant who has ≥ 3 CSBMs for the specified week and an increase from baseline of ≥1 CSBM for the week.

For the definition of the primary efficacy endpoint, Overall SBM Responder is a participant who is a Weekly SBM Responder for 9 of the 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, including 3 of the last 4 weeks (Weeks 9, 10, 11 and 12)., 12 weeks
Change From Baseline of Chronic Opioid-Related Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale (CORGISS) Scores at 12 Weeks, The CORGISS is designed to assess GI symptoms related to opioid use in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. The CORGISS asks participants to rate the severity of GI symptoms over the previous 24 hours, with answers ranging from 0 ("did not experience") to 4 ("very severe")., Baseline, 12 weeks|Overall Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM) Responder Rates at 12 Weeks, A CSBM Weekly Responder is a participant who has ≥ 3 CSBMs for the specified week and an increase from baseline of ≥1 CSBM for the week. An Overall CSBM Responder is a subject who is a Weekly CSBM Responder for 9 of the 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, including 3 of the last 4 weeks (Weeks 9, 10, 11 and 12)., 12 weeks
Adjudicated Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal and Central Opioid Withdrawal Events, Cardiovascular (CV) events of interested included mycardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiovascular accident, congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and death.

Gastrointestinal (GI) events of interest included emergency department visits for SAEs of gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or cramping.

Central opioid withdrawal events of interest included opioid withdrawal syndrome., Baseline through 16 weeks
This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 600 participants (300 participants per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at approximately 75 study centers to receive either oral 0.25 mg CB-5945 BID or oral matching placebo BID for the 12-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. All randomized participants will be evaluated for clinical response for duration of their study participation. All participants will be followed for safety for 4 weeks after last dose of the study medication, regardless of when they discontinue study medication. The clinical study report for this study includes pooled results for studies 5945-OIC-12-02 (NCT01901302) 5945-OIC-12-03 (NCT01901328), and 5945-OIC-12-04 (NCT01901341).
