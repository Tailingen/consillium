sdAb-based TRNT of Multiple Myeloma: a Feasibility Study
This study aims to show that antiidiotypic sdAb are a new, sensitive, specific and non-invasive tool for imaging and therapeutic purposes and provides a rationale for their clinical evaluation as a personalized treatment option for MM patients expressing surface paraprotein.
