A Clinical Study of Pembrolizumab (+) Berahyaluronidase Alfa (MK-3475A) to Treat Newly-diagnosed Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475A-F84)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is metastatic, which means cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Some people with metastatic NSCLC are treated with pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy treatment that is given into a vein as an intravenous (IV) infusion. Pembrolizumab (+) Berahyaluronidase alfa is pembrolizumab that is given under the skin as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. The goal of this study is to compare what happens to pembrolizumab in a person's body over time when it is given as an IV infusion or SC injection.

Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, AUC is defined as area under curve exposure. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., At designated time points (up to approximately 14 months)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, Ctrough is defined as the trough concentration at steady-state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Ctrough, At designated time points (Up to ~18 months)
Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, Cmax is defined as the peak concentration over the dosing interval. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, Ctrough is defined as the trough concentration. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Ctrough., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|AUC of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, AUC is defined as area under curve exposure at steady state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, Cmax is defined as the peak concentration over the dosing interval in steady-state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax, At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Model-based Ctrough of Pembrolizumab Measured After the First Dose, Model-based Ctrough is defined as the value of trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval, as predicted by the population PK model., At designated time points (Up to ~28 monhts|Model-based Ctrough of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, Model-based steady-state Ctrough is defined as the value of trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval at steady-state, as predicted by the population PK model., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Number of participants with antipembrolizumab antibodies, Blood samples are to be collected at designated time points for the determination of the presence or absence of anti-pembrolizumab antibodies. The percentage of participants who develop anti pembrolizumab antibodies will be reported., Baseline and up to approximately 28 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be presented., Up to approximately 60 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first as assessed by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) will be presented., Up to approximately 60 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be presented, Up to approximately 60 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an AE- All Participants, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 28 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 25 months|Change in Score from Baseline: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL)- Items 29 and 30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" are scored on a 7- point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 combined score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 26 months|Change in Score from Baseline: EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning (Items 1 to 5), Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5 will be presented. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Higher scores indicate a worse level of function., Baseline and up to approximately 26 months|Change in Score from Baseline: EORTC QLQ-C30 Role functioning (Items 6 and 7), Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 6-7 will be presented. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant responses to questions about their role functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much).
