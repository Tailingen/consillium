MEchanisms of Resistance in EGFR Mutated Nonpretreated Advanced Lung Cancer Receiving OSimErtib
Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that is selective for both EGFR-TKI sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

The AURA 3 study (T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy, shown that the median duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months p\<0.001).

In addition, clinical data show that patients with mutated EGFR NSCLC receiving osimertinib in first line, presented an objective response rate of 77 % with a disease control rate of 98 % and a median PFS was 19.3 months.

Finally, The FLAURA study randomized phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the superiority of osimertinib compared with erlotinib or gefitinib in EGFR mutated nonpretreated NSCLC (median PFS of 18.9 months versus 10.2 months).

However, several issues remain unknown or debated :

* What are the mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib prescribed in first-line?
* What are the consequences of prolonged exposure to osimertinib on the expression of markers of response to immunotherapy?
* Is there an association between kinetic parameters of ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) and prediction of response to osimertinib and/ or and prediction of therapeutic escape under osimertinib? In order to respond to all these questions, this phase II trial will be the first to systemically analyze the mechanisms of resistance to Osimertinib based on the analysis of biopsy, and collection of plasma from all patients during the course of treatment.
