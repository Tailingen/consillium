A Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Elesclomol Sodium Given With a Fixed Dose of Docetaxel and Prednisone in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium at escalating doses (ultimately identifying the maximum tolerated dose) when combined with a fixed dose of docetaxel and concomitant prednisone. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics of elesclomol and docetaxel.
