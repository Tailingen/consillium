Personalized Radiation Therapy for GBM
The study is a pilot study to estimate the efficacy of personalized dose-escalation radiation therapy in patients with glioblastoma, as measured by estimating the median of progression-free survival. Toxicity, patterns of recurrence, and overall median survival will be measured as secondary endpoints. Adverse events will be monitored.
