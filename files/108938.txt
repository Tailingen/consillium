Retreatment With Intratumoral Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters
A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation emitter device for superficial cutaneous, mucosal or soft tissue neoplasia
Skin Cancer|Mucosal Neoplasm of Oral Cavity|Soft Tissue Neoplasm
DEVICE: Radiation: Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters Therapy (DaRT)
Tumor response to DaRT, Assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1), 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion|Adverse events, Frequency, severity and causality of acute adverse events related to the DaRT treatment. Adverse events will be assessed and graded according to Common Terminology and Criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0., From conscent up to 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion
Change in tumor volume, Based on imaging, 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion|Local control rate, Will be assessed as the number of complete responses, partial responses and stable disease divided by the total numbers of tumors treated., 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion
Adverse Events, Incidence of all Adverse Events (AE) related and unrelated to the study treatment., From conscent up to 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion
This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety and efficacy of re-treatment with diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in patients.

Superficial lesions with histopathological confirmation of either recurrent or persistent disease following DaRT treatment. .

Reduction in tumor size 70 days after DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be assessed by the incidence, severity and frequency of all Adverse Events (AE).
