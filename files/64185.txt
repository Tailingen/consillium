CIMAvax Vaccine, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Squamous Head and Neck Cancer
This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant human EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine (CIMAvax) and nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer or squamous head and neck cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Vaccine therapy, such as CIMAvax vaccine may help slow down and stop tumor growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving CIMAvax vaccine together with nivolumab or pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer or squamous head and neck cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of CIMAvax followed by a phase II study.

LOADING PHASE I: Patients receive CIMAvax intramuscularly (IM) and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 4 weeks after the 4th dose, patients receive CIMAvax IM at the same time as the next nivolumab dose.

MAINTENANCE PHASE I: Patients who do not experience a DLT receive CIMAvax every 4 weeks and nivolumab every 2 weeks.

PHASE II STUDY A and B: Patients receive CIMAvax IM and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes. Treatment with CIMAvax repeats every 2 weeks for 4 doses during the loading phase and every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Courses for nivolumab repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in Study A with antibody titer \>= 1:4000 at the end of the loading phase may receive CIMAvax IM every 8 or 12 weeks during the maintenance phase.

PHASE II STUDY C: Patients with PD-L1expression \>= 50% receive CIMAvax IM and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment with CIMAvax repeats every 2 weeks for 4 doses during the loading phase and every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Courses for pembrolizumab repeat every 2 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PHASE II STUDY D: Patients with PD-L1 expression \< 50% after 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy with pembrolizumab, receive CIMAvax IM and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 120 days.
