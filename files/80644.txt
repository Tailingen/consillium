Multimodal Imaging in Rectal Cancer & Pancreatic Cancer
Most digestive cancers show (over)expression of the tumour marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Therefore, interest in CEA-targeting tracers has increased over the past years. CEA-targeting tracers can be used for preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative imaging purposes. This study focusses on both preoperative and intraoperative multimodal imaging and image-guided surgery in patients with rectal cancer or pancreatic cancer.
