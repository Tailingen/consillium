Oral Microencapsulated Diindolylmethane in Treating Patients With Stage II-III Triple Negative, Androgen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Who Have Undergone Chemotherapy and Surgery
This study is being done to find out whether a nutritional supplement, called BioResponse-DIM (BR-DIM \[oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane\]), improves the survival for women who have residual cancer cells following surgery after chemotherapy for breast cancer. BR-DIM is an active ingredient in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts and cauliflower). Consumption of these vegetables has been associated with a decreased risk in several cancers. Researchers also hope to find out whether different biomarkers (also called "markers") in the blood predict the chance of breast cancer returning. BR-DIM is thought to be effective in treating stage II-III breast cancer that is triple negative, AR positive (+), and where there is residual cancer cells in the breast after chemotherapy.

Patients receive oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
