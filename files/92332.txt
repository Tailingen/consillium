Telemedicine Follow-Up for Early Laryngeal Cancer: a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Care Close to Home Versus Standard of Care
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether Telemedicine follow-up is a satisfactory and safe alternative to traditional follow-up care for patients treated for early glottic (vocal cord) cancer, particularly those who live far from a specialized head and neck oncology centre (HNOC).

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Is patient satisfaction with Telemedicine follow-up comparable to standard care?

Is the safety of Telemedicine follow-up (measured by recurrence rates, complications, and survival) comparable to in-person follow-up at an HNOC?

Researchers will compare patients receiving Telemedicine follow-up in a nearby hospital with standard in-person follow-up at the HNOC, to see if remote evaluation of endoscopic procedures can maintain patient satisfaction and safety outcomes.

Participants will:

Be randomly assigned to either a Telemedicine follow-up group (if they live ≥ 45 minutes from an HNOC) or a standard of care group

Undergo follow-up including HD-laryngoscopy, according to clinical guidelines

Have endoscopy videos evaluated remotely by specialists at the HNOC (= Telemedicine) (intervention group only)

Complete surveys including patient-reported outcomes and experience measures at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months

Patient satisfaction, Our primary outcomes are satisfaction with care and travel distance. Satisfaction is reported on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) and will be compared between study groups at baseline and 6 months and 12 months post-inclusion., 12 months|Patient satisfaction, Specific questions from the Consumer Quality Index (CQI) questionnaires are used for assessing patient satisfaction, 12 months|Local and regional recurrence rate, Safety is measured by addressing local and regional recurrence rate, 12 months|Postoperative complications after recurrence, Safety: postoperative complications after recurrence, 12 months|Re-referral to the head and neck oncology center, Safety: re-referral rates to the oncology center, 12 months|Disease specific and overall survival, Safety: survival, 12 months
HRQoL, In addition, the following outcome measures will be assessed: health related quality-of-life (HRQoL) using the ED-5D-5L questionnaire, 12 months|Symptom burden, Using specific questions from the EORTC QLQ - H\&N35 questionnaire, 12 months|Fear of disease recurrence, Using the Cancer Worry scale, 12 months|Traveling time and distance, Travel time in hours and minutes, distance in kilometres, 12 months|Number of visits to the hospital, Amount of hospital visits, 12 months
