Phase 2 Trial of Adagrasib Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab and a Phase 3 Trial of Adagrasib in Combination in Patients With a KRAS G12C Mutation KRYSTAL-7
The Phase 2 portion of this study evaluates the efficacy and safety of MRTX849 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in cohorts of patients with advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation and any PD-L1 TPS and who are candidates for first-line treatment.

The Phase 3 portion of the study compares the efficacy of adagrasib in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation and PD-L1 TPS \>=50% and who are candidates for first line treatment.

The Phase 2 portion of this study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRTX849 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. There will be 3 cohorts of patients, all of whom have KRAS G12C mutation, have advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and are candidates for first-line treatment. 2 cohorts have PD-L1 TPS score \<1% and are randomized to MRTX849 monotherapy or MRTX849 in combination with pembrolizumab. The 3rd cohort has PD-L1 TPS score of 1% or higher and is treated with MRTX849 and pembrolizumab

The Phase 3 portion of the study will randomize patients with squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation and TPS \>=50% in the first-line setting to adagrasib plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab. Primary efficacy objective is to compare efficacy between experimental and comparator arms. Secondary and exploratory objectives include evaluation of secondary efficacy endpoints, safety and tolerability, adagrasib PK, PROs, and correlative genomic biomarkers for the combination regimen in the study population.

MRTX849 is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C, and Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDAÂ®) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.
