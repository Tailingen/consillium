Integrative Analysis of Large-cell Lung Cancer
Integrative analysis of LCLC
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Normal lung tissue
5 years overall survival, 5 years
5 years disease-free survival, 5 years
The investigators will analyzed proteomes of paired normal lung tissues and LCLC with or without liver metastasis, sequenced transcriptomes, perform whole exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each comprising normal lung tissue, primary LCLC carcinoma, and its synchronous matched metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of lung cancer characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
