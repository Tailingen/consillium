Life After Breast Cancer - Impact of a Life Coach
The objectives of our intervention are to

1. Ease the transition between cancer treatment and active life, and
2. Allow breast cancer survivors to take control of their lives.

The primary objective of this study is to:

1) Determine whether individual life coaching (i.e., individualized guidance that helps to put resources into action) can significantly improve quality of life and post-traumatic growth among women who have been recently treated with breast cancer.

It is hypothesized that:

1. Participants who receive both "group coaching sessions" and "individualized coaching sessions" will report greater post-traumatic growth and quality of life, and less fear of cancer recurrence when compared to the breast cancer survivors who received only the group coaching sessions or usual care.
2. Participants who receive only the group coaching sessions will report greater post-traumatic growth and quality of life, and lesser fear of cancer recurrence when compared to the participants who receive usual care.

Change from baseline Post-traumatic growth (PTG) assessed by the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), The PTGI consists of 21 items, the response scale is a 6-point Likert scale asking respondents the degree to which changes occurred in their lives as a result of the crisis, where 0 represented "I did not experience this change" and 5 represented "I experienced this change to a very great degree". The PTGI is composed of 5 subscales, with 5 items measuring the construct New Possibilities, 7 items measuring the construct Relating to Others, 4 items measuring the construct Personal Strength, 3 items measuring the construct Appreciation of Life and 2 items measuring the construct Spiritual Change. The scores are summed to provide an overall measure of post-traumatic growth ranging from 0 - 105 where higher scores indicate more reported growth., 12 months
Change from baseline Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) assessed by the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS), The CWS is a six-item scale designed to measure worry about the risk of developing cancer and the impact of worry on daily functioning. The six items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ("never") to 4 ("almost always"). Possible scores range from 6 to 24 with higher scores indicating more worry., 12 months|Change from baseline Quality of life (QoL) assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Preference, The PROPr is a 31-item instrument assessing eight domains (29 items) (i.e., anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and pain intensity), and Cognitive Function Abilities (2 items). Raw scores generated for each domain are transformed into T scores; higher PROMIS T scores indicate greater endorsement of the construct being assessed., 12 months
