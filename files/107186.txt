Sequential Regimen of Bendamustine Followed by Obinutuzumab (GA101), Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) and Venetoclax (ABT-199) in Patients with Relapsed/refractory CLL
CLL2-BZAG is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen of bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab (GA101), zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) and venetoclax (ABT-199) in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia
DRUG: Bendamustine|BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab|BIOLOGICAL: Zanubrutinib|BIOLOGICAL: Venetoclax
Negativity rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood (PB) measured by multi-color flow cytometry, MRD negativity is defined as less than one (1) CLL-cell among 10,000 leukocytes analyzed \[0.01%\]. The MRD negativity rate is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved MRD negativity based on the full analysis set (FAS)., At final restaging (RE): 12 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle
Overall response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients having achieved a complete response (CR), a CR with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi), or a partial response (PR) as best response., At final restaging (RE): 12 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle|CR / CRi rate, Proportion of patients having achieved a CR or CRi as best response (= number of patients with best response CR or CRi divided by the number of the FAS), At final restaging (RE): 12 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle|MRD in PB measured by 4-color flow cytometry at different times to guide the duration of maintenance therapy and for the assessment of the kinetics of response to the different treatment phases, MRD negativity is defined as less than one (1) CLL-cell among 10,000 leukocytes analyzed \[0.01%\], i.e. \< 10-4. MRD values will be categorized into negative (\<10-4) and positive (â‰¥10-4), From date of screening until the end of follow-up, up to 55 month|Safety: Adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of particular/special interest (AEPI/AESI), Type, frequency, severity and relationship to study treatment.of AEs, SAEs and AEPIs/AESIs, Up to 55 months after first dose of study drug
In the CLL2-BZAG trial will be included a total of 40 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL in need of treatment. This trial will evaluate a debulking with two cycles bendamustine (only for patients with a high tumor load), followed by an induction and maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab, zanubrutinib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Thus, this trial combines one established (chemotherapy) and three novel, synergistic (antibody, Bruton's tyrosine kinase(BTK)-inhibitor and Bcl-2 antagonist) principles of action in order to achieve deep and long lasting remissions with a short duration of treatment. Additionally, this trial has an extensive accompanying scientific program aiming at a better understanding of the kinetics of response and clonal evolution of CLL.
