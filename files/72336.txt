Prospective Comparative Study Evaluating the Early Complications of Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Performed As an Outpatient Versus an Inpatient Procedure.
The goal of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that outpatient management for robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is not inferior to inpatient management in terms of the occurrence of early post-operative complications.

Researchers will compare outpatient robot-assisted radical prostatectomy to inpatient procedure.

Participants will:

* Visit the clinic after the operation once at 45 days, 6 months and once a year for up to 5 years for check-ups and tests.
* Answer survey questions about urinary and erectil functions, stress and anxiety, satisfaction, quality of life for 6 months
* Keep a diary to record procedures and treatments related to the care provided

PROCEDURE: radical prostatectomy
Early complication of robot-assisted prostatectomy, The occurrence (yes/no) of at least one early complication of robot-assisted prostatectomy.

The early clinical complications expected are :

* Bleeding from trocar incision scars or surgical excision scars
* Urinary leakage around the catheter
* Retention due to bladder catheter clotting
* Loss of bladder catheter
* Signs of internal haemorrhage (within 24 hours)
* Signs of biological deglobulation
* Intestinal obstruction syndrome
* Signs of urinary fistula
* Infectious signs : fever \> 38Â°, chills
* Thromboembolicaccidents
* Nosocomial infections
* Falls, From the day of surgery to 8 days post-operative
Conversion rate from outpatient to full hospitalisation (Outpatient failure rate), Patients treated on an outpatient basis for whom full hospitalisation is indicated on the day of surgery, as decided by the medical team., Day of surgery|Rate of cancellation of outpatient treatment by the patient or his private environment, Patients included in the study refusing outpatient care up to the day of surgery (before or after surgery) for whatever reason, From enrollment to the day of surgery|Rate of patients readmitted to hospital, either as emergencies or in the department, Patients readmitted to hospital (yes/no), emergency or inpatient department, From hospital discharge to 8 days post-operative.|Association of each early complication with treatment (outpatient or inpatient), Early complication of robot-assisted prostatectomy, From hospitalisation discharge to 8 days post-operative|Rate of patients having had at least one complication secondary to surgery, Patients who had at least one complication secondary to surgery.

The expected complications secondary to surgery are:

* Admission to emergency care
* Re-hospitalization
* Occlusions
* Healing problems
* Perineal hematoma
* Urinary infections
* Lymphoceles
* Thromboembolic accidents
* Nosocomial infections, From 8 days to 45 days post-operative|Rate of patients with at least one complication secondary to surgery, Patients who had at least one complication secondary to surgery., From 45 days to 6 months post-operative|Patient's pre-operative stress/anxiety levels, The participant's stress/anxiety level is assessed at 3 days before surgery using the APAIS (Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale) questionnaire validated in French (Moerman and al, 1996; Maurice-Szamburski and al, 2013), then with a Numerical Scale of stress/anxiety during preparation for the operating theatre in the care unit and at 2 days post-operative., 3 days before surgery, day of surgery and 2 days post-operative|Patient satisfaction level, Patient satisfaction is assessed using the overall satisfaction question in the e-SATIS questionnaire ("Overall, how would you rate the quality of your treatment/care in the department by the doctors/surgeons/nurses? Bad/Weak/Average/Good/Excellent) The patient's opinion (yes/no) is evaluated on whether, if the procedure were repeated, the patient would accept it (yes/no) and whether it reassured him/her to go home in the evening /stay in hospital at night after the procedure., 2 days and 45 days post-operative|Duration of surgery, Duration of surgery 'skin-to-skin' (incision until final stitch complete), Day of surgery|Blood loss, The level of blood loss is assessed by the quantity of blood recovered in the aspiration jar and the quantity from the drains minus the quantity perfused intraoperatively in ml., Day of surgery|Rate of patients who recovered continence and rate of patients who recovered urinary function after surgery, Urinary continence is assessed by the response to question 5 of the EPIC-50 (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) when 0 to 1 pads are used during the day by the patient. Recovery of urinary function was assessed by the difference between the incontinence subscore of the EPIC-50 questionnaire at D45 and the value of the pre-operative score.

The incontinence subscore include questions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6a of the urinary function EPIC-50 questionnaire. The EPIC-50 is a validated questionnaire (Wei and al, 2000) and translated into French (Anota and al, 2016)., Baseline and 45 days post-operative|Evolution of urinary continence between 45 days and 6 months post-operatively and evolution of urinary function pre-operatively, at 45 days, at 6 months., The evolution of continence and urinary function is established on the basis of the parameters defined previously (see Secondary Outcome Measure 12.), Baseline and 45 days, 6 months after surgery|Recovery of erectile function, Erectile recovery is assessed using the IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaire (Rosen R and al, 1997; Dargis and al, 2013) ; erectile dysfunction is defined by an IIEF-5 score \<10., Baseline and 6 months post-operative|Oncological recurrence and retreatment, Recurrence is defined by a PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) level \>0.1ng/ml, the patient's re-treatment (yes/no), the type of re-treatment (hormone therapy / chemotherapy / radiotherapy)., From 45 days to 5 years after surgery|Economic and social cost of patient care, The cost-utility ratio calculated on the basis of :

- The costs of the homogeneous group of patients (GHM) for hospitalisation and the costs of the national care reference system (ENCC) for post-operative management, based on the patient's diary completed up to 6 months after the operation.

The following direct medical costs will be estimated from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 6 months:

* Medical transport, medical and non-medical consultations in town, complementary examinations and drugs: collected in the CRF of the study from the patient logbook and valued using current tariffs.
* The QALY, a unit for measuring life expectancy weighted by health-related quality of life, calculated on the basis of the utility derived from the EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire completed by the patient at D0, D45 and 6 months after surgery., From hospital discharge to 6 months post-operative
The goal of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that outpatient management for robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is not inferior to inpatient management in terms of the occurrence of early post-operative complications.

Researchers will compare outpatient robot-assisted radical prostatectomy to inpatient procedure.

Participants will:

* Visit the clinic after the operation once at 45 days, 6 months and once a year for up to 5 years for check-ups and tests.
