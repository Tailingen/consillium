Comparison of Apixaban Versus Enoxaparin
The goal of this randomized trial is to compare bladder cancer patient experiences taking prophylactic anticoagulation at home after surgery to remove their bladder. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Are patients equally adherent to apixaban as they are enoxaparin? Why or why not?
* Do patients prefer apixaban or enoxaparin?
* What is the typical patient cost to take apixaban vs enoxaparin after surgery?

Participants will be randomized to receive a prescription for either enoxaparin or apixaban which they will then fill themselves and self-administer at home until post-operative day 30. They will receive phone calls from study coordinators at days 30 and 90 to complete questionaries over the phone to assess trial outcomes.
