National Project on Vaccines, COVID-19 and Frail Patients
This is a multicentre observational study with the aim of evaluating the antibody and cellular response after vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in frail subjects with impaired immuno-competence, due to their underlying diseases or ongoing therapies.

BIOLOGICAL: COVID-19 vaccines
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunization, For assessing the immunologic response to the COVID-19 vaccination, the anti-S antibodies levels in the fragile population will be quantified at T2 and compared with the anti-S antibodies levels quantified at the same time point in a population of healthy subjects., 5-7 weeks after T0 for Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination; 6-8 weeks after T0 for Moderna vaccination
anti-S antibodies immunological response, for each time point, the anti-S antibodies levels will be quantified and compared with the anti-S antibodies levels quantified at the same time point in a population of healthy subjects (see controls)., at 6 times points T0 before vaccine administration, T1 before the second dose of the vaccine and at times T2, T3, T4 and T5 which correspond to 5-7 weeks (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 6-8 weeks (Moderna), 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 52 weeks after the first dose|T cell immunological response, At each time point, the Spike and N-specific T-cell immunity of the 1300 enrolled subjects will be assessed and compared to that observed in a population of healthy subjects at the same time point (see controls)., at 6 times points T0 before vaccine administration, T1 before the second dose of the vaccine and at times T2, T3, T4 and T5 which correspond to 5-7 weeks (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 6-8 weeks (Moderna), 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 52 weeks after the first dose|immunological response in different subgroups, Subgroup analysis on the immunological response will be performed according to the clinical characteristics of the patients, the main diagnosis subgroups according to the eligibility criteria and the treatments they have received. we will compare the immune response with the different clinical characteristics of the patients, 1 year|impact of COVID-19 vaccination on patient health status, The impact on health status will be assessed through a questionnaire compiled at T1 and T2 by the physician before the blood sampling. The questionnaire will assess the occurrence of a list of symptoms in the week after the first and second administration of the vaccine., 1 weeks after frist dose and 1 week after second dose|incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection., The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be assessed in terms of number and proportion of patients who during the 52 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 infection will be assessed with: positive to molecular NF swab., all 52 weeks
The immune response to COVID-19 vaccination will be assessed at the following time points:

T0: the day of vaccination T1: the day of the booster dose according to the schedule of the two vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) T2: between 5 and 7 weeks after T0 for those vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech and between 6 and 8 weeks after T0 for those vaccinated with Moderna.

* T3: 12 (± 1) weeks after T0
* T4: 24 (± 2) weeks from T0
* T5: 52 (± 2) weeks from T0 Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be assessed in terms of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections (NF molecular swab positive), and of SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring hospitalisation.
