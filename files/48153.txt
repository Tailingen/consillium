Combination of Nivolumab Plus Relatlimab in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Soft-tissue Sarcoma: a Proof-of-concept Randomized Phase II Study
This is a multicenter study assessing the efficacy of nivolumab in association with relatlimab.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Adult|Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Association of Nivolumab + Relatlimab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Assessment of the antitumor activity of nivolumab in association with relatlimab independently for each arm, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-month progression-free rate and is defined as the rate of complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD), based on RECIST 1.1, 6 months
Best overall response, independently for each arm, Best overall response is defined as the best response across all time points (RECIST 1.1). The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known (RECIST 1.1), throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|1-year progression-free survival, independently for each arm, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 1 year|2-year progression-free survival, independently for each arm, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 2 years|1-year overall survival, independently for each arm, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (of any cause), 1 year|2-year overall survival, independently for each arm, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (of any cause), 2 years|Growth Modulation Index, independently for each arm, GMI is defined for each patient as the ratio of its PFS on the nivolumab + relatlimab treatment combination to its PFS on the previous line of therapy (Von Hoff 1998), throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|Safety profile, independently for each arm, Toxicity graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5, throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|Blood cytokines levels, Levels of cytokines in blood will be measured by ELISA, baseline, cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 3 day 1 and progression (each cycle is 28 days)|Blood lymphocytes levels, Levels of lymphocytes in blood will be measured by flow cytometry, baseline, cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 3 day 1 and progression (each cycle is 28 days)|Blood kynurenine levels, Levels of kynurenine in blood will be measured by ELISA, baseline, cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 3 day 1 and progression (each cycle is 28 days)|Tumor immune cells levels, Levels of immune cells in tumor will be measured by immunohistochemistry, before treatment onset and cycle 3 day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
This multicenter, prospective, open-labeled 2-arm, randomized non-comparative phase II trial. This phase II trial is based on a 2-stage Simon's optimal design. Randomization 1:1 with 1 patient randomized in experimental arm A (association of nivolumab plus relatlimab) and 1 patient randomized in arm B (treatment by nivolumab alone).
