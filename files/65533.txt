Self- Sampling in Cervical Cancer Routine Screening
SELF-SAMPLING IN CERVICAL CANCER ROUTINE SCREENING (FALCON) -Study implements a self-sampling option for the non-attendees of the national cervical cancer screening program in the Wellbeing Services County of Pirkanmaa. HPV primary testing is currently preferred method for cervical cancer screening. The HPV-DNA self-sampling has been shown to have screening performance equal to that of provider-obtained samples. In 2024, those turning 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, or 65 had the opportunity to participate in the FALCON study if they do not respond to the first invitation to cervical cancer screening. From March 2025 also women living in Kanta-Häme, Central Finland, Päijät-Häme, and Ostrobothnia can take part to the study.

The main objective of the FALCON study is to increase the current coverage of the cervical cancer screening program in the Pirkanmaa, Kanta-Häme, Central Finland, Päijät-Häme, and Ostrobothnia region and assess how acceptable self-sampling is for women.
