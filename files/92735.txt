The median OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the 95% CI for median was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley., Baseline up to death due to any cause (from baseline up to study completion date, up to approximately 5.5 years)|Percentage of Participants Who Died Due to Any Cause: Obinutuzumab Containing Cohorts (Cohorts E + H and E + G), Percentage of participants who died due to any cause was reported., Baseline up to death due to any cause (from baseline up to study completion date, up to approximately 5.5 years)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Modified Response and Progression Criteria for NHL: Obinutuzumab Containing Cohorts (Cohorts E + H and E + G), Tumor response was evaluated according to modified response and progression criteria for NHL published by Cheson et al (2007 and 2014) and confirmed by repeat assessments \>/=4 weeks after initial documentation. PD was defined as appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis, at least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD or longest diameter of any previous lesion or node. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. In absence of PD or death, PFS was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Participants with no post-baseline tumor assessment were censored on the date of randomization or date of enrollment.
