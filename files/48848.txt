A Study of MHB046C Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter Phase I/II study of MHB046C in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of MHB046C monotherapy.
Advanced Solid Cancer
DRUG: MHB046C
I (Dose-Escalation Stage): Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for MHB046C, To determine the MTD for further evaluation of IV administration of MHB046C in subjects with advanced solid tumors., Up to day 21 from the first dose|II (Dose-Expansion Stage): ORR determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1, To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MHB046C for the treatment of selected patients with advanced solid tumors based on the safety and efficacy results from all enrolled subjects., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), AE assessed by investigator exclusively related to subject's underlying disease or medical condition \[graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0\]., Baseline up to 5 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of total antibody, ADC, and free toxin at various time points, The PK parameters at different time points include:Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), From pre-dose to 22 days after the first dose|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of total antibody, ADC, and free toxin at various time points, The PK parameters at different time points include:Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), From pre-dose to 22 days after the first dose|Immunogenicity, Proportion of subjects who develop anti-MHB046C antibodies (ADA)., From pre-dose to 30 days post end of treatment.|ORR determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). ORR is evaluated by the number of participants with best overall response of CR and PR (Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least 1 repeat)., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Duration of response (DOR) determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1, DoR was defined as the period from the first occurrence of CR or PR to PD or death from any cause. If no PD or death after CR/PR, the cut-off date of progression-free survival (PFS) would be used \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks)\]., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Disease control rate (DCR) determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). DCR was evaluated by the number of participants with best overall response of CR, PR and stable disease (SD) \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks); SD shall be assessed at least 5 weeks after the first dose\]., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). PFS was defined as the time from random assignment (dose expansion stage) or first dose (dose escalation stage) to PD or death from any cause., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from random assignment or first dose to death from any cause., Baseline up until death up to approximately 5 years
This first-in-human clinical trial of MHB046C comprises two parts: a dose escalation phase and an indication expansion phase. The dose escalation phase is an open-label, multicenter study including dose escalation and PK expansion cohorts. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of MHB046C in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In this phase, additional patients may be enrolled in the PK expansion part at dose levels that have completed DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) evaluation.

Based on the safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy data from the completed DLT-evaluated dose levels, the sponsor will initiate the indication expansion phase. This phase is an open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort study designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of MHB046C monotherapy in patients with specific types of advanced solid tumors.
