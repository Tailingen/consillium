Long-term Outcomes for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients
This international observational study aims at examining the patterns of health-related quality of life differences between long-term acute myeloid leukemia patients and their healthy peers from the general population.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
OTHER: Questionnaire
Number of differences in SF-36 scores, The Role Physical scores of AML survivors will be compared to that in the general population as assessed by SF-36 questionnaire. Comparisons will be performed on age-sex matched pairs of AML patients and healthy subjects from the general population., At enrollment
Outcomes from SF-36 questionnaire will be described and compared between AML patients from RCTs vs non RCTs., Prior to these comparisons, to further minimize the possible influence of confounding factors, RCTs and non RCTs AML groups will be previously matched on their estimated propensity scores, At enrollment|QoL profiles of AML survivors will be compared with those in the general population also as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire., Comparisons will be adjusted by age and sex, using the European reference values for the EORTC QLQ-C30. A subgroup analysis on elderly patients (i.e. 60+ patients) will be also performed., At enrollment|Outcomes from SCQ questionnaire will be described and compared between AML patients from RCTs vs non RCTs., Prior to these comparisons, to further minimize the possible influence of confounding factors, RCTs and non RCTs AML groups will be previously matched on their estimated propensity scores., At enrollment|Outcomes from EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be described and compared between AML patients from RCTs vs non RCTs., Prior to these comparisons, to further minimize the possible influence of confounding factors, RCTs and non RCTs AML groups will be previously matched on their estimated propensity scores., At enrollment
