Expanded Use of G-CSF Mobilized Donor CD34+ Selected Cells for Allogeneic Transplantation
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established form of treatment for hematological abnormalities. Poor graft function, occurs when there poor donor engraftment. A second infusion of unselected donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can result in improvement, but can potentially increase the incidence of graft versus host disease. Cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) selected stem cells depleted of T-cells is an attractive alternative for treatment of poor graft function as it may be associated with less Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) and enhanced count recovery. The investigators are using the Miltenyi CliniMACS device and CD34 cell selection reagents for the preparation of allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplants for patients who have had prior stem cell transplants and require a stem cell "boost" from the original donor.

BIOLOGICAL: G-CSF mobilized CD34+ selected cells for transplantation
This is a single-arm, open label, single institution, compassionate study which will enroll patients who are marginally engrafted and transfusion and/or growth factors dependent after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) regardless of the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed. Study subjects will receive a "booster" infusion of CD34+ cell selected and T-cell depleted G-CSF mobilized apheresis product from the original stem cell donor in order to improve engraftment. The "booster" infusion will be administered without prior conditioning.
