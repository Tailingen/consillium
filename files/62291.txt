The Role of Consolidative Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation After First-line Therapy in Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
The role of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the first remission (CR1 \& PR1) of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) is not well defined. This study analyzed the impact of ASCT on the clinical outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed PTCL in CR1 and PR1.
