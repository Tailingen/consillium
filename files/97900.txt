Study of Management of Pasireotide-induced Hyperglycemia in Adult Patients With Cushing's Disease or Acromegaly
The study was designed to investigate the optimal management of hyperglycemia developed during pasireotide treatment in participants with Cushing's disease or Acromegaly, which was not manageable with metformin.

This was a Phase IV, multi-center, randomized, open-label study. Eligible patients started pasireotide subcutaneously (s.c.) for Cushing's disease and pasireotide LAR (long-acting release) for Acromegaly.

Participants being treated with pasireotide s.c or LAR at screening were eligible as long as they met protocol criteria during the screening period. If previously normo-glycemic participants experienced an increase in their fasting blood glucose and met the criteria for diabetes while on pasireotide, they started anti-diabetic treatment using metformin. If they continued to have elevated blood glucose above target on metformin within the first 16 weeks, they were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with incretin based therapy or insulin for approximately 16 weeks.

Participants who continued to receive clinical benefit after completing the Core Phase could enter an optional Extension Phase if pasireotide was not commercially available in their country or a local access program was not available to provide drug. Patients continued in the Extension Phase until the last participant randomized in the Core Phase completed 16 weeks of treatment post-randomization.

Change in HbA1c From Randomization to Approximately 16 Weeks, Absolute change in HbA1c from randomization to end of core phase (16 weeks) in incretin based therapy arm and insulin arm, and mean difference of change in HbA1c between the two treatment groups based on an ANOVA model using treatment (Incretin, Insulin) and the two randomization stratification factors (Disease: Cushing's disease vs Acromegaly; Baseline glycemic status: HbA1c \<7% vs HbA1c ≥ 7%) as fixed effects. For Participants who discontinued the study or required rescue treatment before the time of assessing the primary endpoint, the last HbA1c assessment collected 8 weeks (56 days) after randomization (and prior to or on the date of start of rescue treatment) was carried forward. If the participant discontinued the study or used rescue treatment within 8 weeks after randomization, it was considered missing., Randomization, 16 weeks
