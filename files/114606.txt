Combination of Chemoradiation Therapy and Epitope Peptide Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of multiple peptides (URLC10, TTK, KOC1 VEGFR1, and VEGFR2) emulsified with Montanide ISA51 in combination with chemotherapy (CDDP, 5-FU) plus radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer.

Up-regulated ling cancer 10 (URLC10), TTK protein kinase (TTK) and K homology domain containing protein over expressed in cancer (KOC1) were identified as new targets of tumor associated antigens using cDNA microarray technologies combined with the expression profiles of normal and cancer tissues. Furthermore, anti-angiogenic therapy is now considered to be one of promising approaches for treating cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are essential targets for tumor angiogenesis. Epitope peptides for these targets are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) restricted to HLA-A \*2402 in vivo. On the other hand, chemotherapy (CDDP, 5-FU) plus radiation therapy has been to be a standard treatment for unresectable advanced esophageal cancer. In this clinical trial, we evaluate the safety and immune responses of different doses of multiple peptides (URLC10, TTK, KOC1, VEGFR1, and VEGFR 2) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with chemotherapy (CDDP, 5-FU) plus radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer.
