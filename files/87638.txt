This is a monocentric, single arm, prospective clinical trial designed to obtain explorative information about the effect of Cabozantinib on bone in prostate cancer patients with bone metastatic castration resistant disease, previously treated with two taxanes and at least one next generation hormonal agent.

Activity of bone metastatic disease will be assessed by WB-DW-MRI, while changes in bone metabolism will be studied through DXA scan and soluble biomarkers
