A Study on the Management and Outcome of Patients With Systemic AL Amyloidosis in Europe
This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter study to collect Real-World Evidence (RWE) data on systemic AL-AMY patients in Europe. Data from paper/electronic medical records and/or electronic databases from key reference centers in Europe will be used. Data will either be entered by the site staff in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) or, where feasible, transferred directly, always in accordance to local regulations.
AL Amyloidosis
Patient and disease characteristics, To describe the proportion of patients belonging to different age groups, and the proportion of patients per gender, stage, organ involvement, performance status, and hematologic biomarkers at screening or at baseline; by first-line treatment initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall., 2004-2018|Treatment patterns, To describe the proportion of patients who had an autologous stem cell transplantation by first-line initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall; the proportion of regimen combinations used by line of treatment, and by first-line initiation period; the proportion of patients receiving specific regimen combinations following different first-line regimens, by first-line initiation period and overall., 2004-2018|Response evaluation and efficacy outcomes, To describe the treatment effectiveness in terms of hematologic response rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after first-line initiation, by regimen and first-line initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010); overall survival, progression-free survival, and time on treatment, overall, by first-line treatment and by first-line initiation period., 2004-2018|Healthcare resource utilization: hospitalizations, To describe the healthcare resource utilization patterns during the treatment of AL amyloidosis by first-line treatment initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall, in terms of hospitalization information (number of hospitalizations, duration per hospitalization); use of concomitant treatment (frequency of regimens used, proportion of patients receiving concomitant treatment); proportion of patients undergoing imaging exams; proportion of patients undergoing cardiac exams; proportion of patients receiving dialysis., 2004-2018|Healthcare resource utilization: concomitant therapy, To describe the healthcare resource utilization patterns during the treatment of AL amyloidosis, by first-line treatment initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall, in terms of the proportion of patients receiving concomitant therapy., 2004-2018|Healthcare resource utilization: imaging and cardiac assessments, To describe the healthcare resource utilization patterns during the treatment of AL amyloidosis, by first-line treatment initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall, in terms of the proportion of patients undergoing imaging and cardiac exams., 2004-2018|Healthcare resource utilization: dialysis, To describe the healthcare resource utilization patterns during the treatment of AL amyloidosis, by first-line treatment initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall, in terms of the proportion of patients receiving dialysis., 2004-2018|Safety management, To describe the proportion of patients having serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest, by first-line treatment initiation period (pre-2010 or post-2010) and overall., 2004-2018
The lack of regulatory approved treatment options for AL amyloidosis (AL-AMY) justifies the need to understand the current treatment practice and outcomes of this disease. There is a need for objective Real-World Evidence (RWE) that reflects how treatments are initiated, combined and sequenced, and how their relative effectiveness and safety profiles emerge outside a clinical trial setting. Therefore, the aim is to generate RWE on systemic AL-AMY patients in Europe, including patient characteristics, resource use, treatments and associated patient outcomes.
