A Study Investigating BG-60366 in Adults With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1a/1b clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-60366, a highly potent, selective EGFR-mutation targeted Chimeric Degradation Activation Compound (CDAC). BG-60366 is designed to degrade mutant EGFR, which is a common cause for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). This study will evaluate how well BG-60366 works in participants with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts: 1) Phase 1a Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion, and 2) Phase 1b Dose Expansion.

DRUG: BG-60366
Phase 1a: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations, and that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria., From first dose of the study drug to 30 days after the last dose or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first (approximately 18 months)|Phase 1a: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD), MTD is defined as the highest dose evaluated for which estimated toxicity rate is the closest to the target toxicity rate. MAD is defined as the highest dose administered if MTD is not reached., Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDFE) of BG-60366, RDFE of BG-60366 will be determined based upon the MTD or MAD., Approximately 18 months|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, ECGs, and laboratory assessments as needed., From first dose of the study drug to 30 days after the last dose or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first (approximately 24 months)|Phase 1b: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Approximately 24 months
Phase 1a: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed CR or PR assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Approximately 24 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of objective response that is confirmed by the subsequent assessment until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever comes first., Approximately 24 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drugs to the date of teh first determination of objective response that is confirmed by the subsequent assessment., Approximately 24 months|Phase 1b: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of disease progression assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 24 months|Phase 1b: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with the best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease assessed., Approximately 24 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) of BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Minimum observed plasma concentration (Cmin) of BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Apparent total clearance (CL/F) of BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of BG-60366, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Accumulation Ratio (AR) of BG-60366, Once in the first three months|Phase 1a and 1b: Plasma concentrations of BG-60366, Approximately up to 6 months
