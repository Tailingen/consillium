Study of Pemetrexed in the Treatment of Patients With Ovarian Cancer Who Have Failed Prior Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
The purposes of this study are to determine: - whether standard or higher doses of pemetrexed should be given to patients with ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred; - the safety and side effects of standard and higher doses of pemetrexed given to patients with ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred; - whether standard or higher doses of pemetrexed can help patients with ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred.

To assess the anti-tumor activity, as measured by tumor response rate (proportion of patients with complete or partial response, of 500 mg/m2 vs. 900 mg/m2 of pemetrexed therapy administered every 21 days
