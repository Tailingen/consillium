Biological Therapy and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as poly-ICLC use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining biological therapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining poly-ICLC with radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: poly ICLC

To Determine 6 Months Progression Free Survival, Patients evaluated from date of diagnosis to the 6 month scan, 6 months|Determine the 12-month Survival Rate, 12-month survival rate calculated from date of diagnosis, 1 year|to Determine Grade 3 and 4 Toxicities Associated With Poly-ICLC in Newly Diagnosed Patients, CTCAE 4, 2 years|To Determine the Change in Neurological Status in Patients With Glioblastoma Treated With External Beam Radiotherapy and Poly-ICLC, Descriptive measure per investigator to describe change in neurological status post-intervention., 1 year|To Determine Tumor Response, Tumor response to treatment with Poly-ICLC, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of poly ICLC and radiotherapy, in terms of total survival from date of diagnosis, in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
* Determine the safety and toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the 12-month survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Assess progression-free survival at 6 months and median progression-free survival from date of diagnosis of patients treated with this regimen.
* Assess response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Assess changes in neurological status in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Within 1-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive poly ICLC intramuscularly 3 times weekly (on days 1, 3, and 5). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

One week after the initiation of poly ICLC, patients undergo external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

Patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
