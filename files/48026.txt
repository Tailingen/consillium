Radiation Use During Vemurafenib Treatment
Patients are being asked to take part because they have melanoma that has spread to other organs in their body (metastatic). As part of this study, patients will receive radiation therapy and an approved drug (Vemurafenib).
BRAFV600 Mutation|Stage IV Melanoma
RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: Vemurafenib
Number of patients with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety of radiation combined with vemurafenib treatment in patients with BRAFV600 mutated Stage IV or unresectable Stage III melanoma, 36 months
Response rate, To evaluate response rates as assessed by RECIST criteria 1.1, at baseline, and at 8 week intervals throughout the study, 36 months
Patients will be treated with vemurafenib plus radiation therapy (RT) based upon the administration schedule. The starting dose of vemurafenib will be the patient's baseline tolerating dose, between 720 - and 960 mg by mouth. Patients must be tolerating at a minimum 720mg for one cycle (28 days) prior to enrollment.
