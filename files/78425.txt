Iloprost in Preventing Lung Cancer in Patients at High Risk for This Disease
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. Iloprost may be effective in preventing lung cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well iloprost works in preventing lung cancer in patients who are at high risk for this disease.

Change in Average (Follow-up - Baseline) From All Biopsies, This outcome measure is created for each subject as follows:

From all biopsies scored at the baseline bronchoscopy, the mean WHO score is calculated.

From all biopsies scored at the follow-up bronchoscopy, the mean WHO score is calculated.Histology on bronchial biopsies pre-treatment and post-treatment will be compared. All biopsies will be graded according to the WHO classification for bronchial epithelium for this outcome, and all the following outcomes.

WHO Classification Grade Normal 1.0 Reserve Cell Hyperplasia 2.0 Metaplasia 3.0 Mild Dysplasia 4.0 Moderate Dysplasia 5.0 Severe Dysplasia 6.0 Carcinoma in Situ 7.0 Carcinoma 8.0

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare the reversal of premalignant histological changes in the bronchial epithelium of patients at high risk for lung cancer (defined by \> 20 pack years of smoking and sputum atypia) treated with iloprost vs placebo.
* Determine whether this drug modulates Ki-67 proliferation index (Antigen Ki-67) in these patients.
* Determine whether this drug affects prostaglandin metabolism in these patients.
* Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine whether this drug modulates a panel of biomarkers, including MCM-2(Minichromosome maintenance protein: forms DNA helicase), EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor: cell surface receptor for the epidermal growth factor family of proteins. Mutations in EGFR expression or activity can result in cancer.) , HER2/neu (Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 is a member of the EGFR family), RARβ (Retinoic Acic Receptor Beta is a nuclear transcription regulator and a member of the thyroid-steroid hormone receptor superfamily), p53, FHIT (Fragile histidine triad protein is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism and had been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor), apoptotic index, and microvessel density, in these patients.
* Determine the genes whose expression is altered by this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to smoking status (current vs former) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral iloprost twice daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed at 1 month and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 152 patients (76 \[38 current smokers and 38 former smokers\] per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
