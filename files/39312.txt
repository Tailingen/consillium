A Phase 1 Study of HS130 in Combination With Viagenpumatucel-L (HS110) in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 open-label, single center, dose escalation study to determine a safe and effective maximum tolerated dose of HS-130 in combination with viagenpumatucel-L (HS-110) for adult subjects with advanced solid tumors who are refractory to Standard of Care.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L)|BIOLOGICAL: HS-130
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Number of Patients with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), 1 month
This is an open-label, non-controlled, first-in-human Phase I study of HS-130 and HS-110 in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, Standard of Care.

Seven dose levels will be explored in escalating doses. For each dose level, patients will receive combination HS-130 and HS-110 via intradermal injections once every 14 days. The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) window of observation will include the first 28 days of treatment. In the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, patients will continue to receive combination treatment every two weeks until disease progression, death, patient's withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs first.
