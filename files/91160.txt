Phase II Trial of Regimen for Stage III (N2) NSCLC Using Induction Treatment Followed by Resection
The investigators hypothesized that the Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy was a beneficial treatment for Patients with Stage IIIA-N2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, so we try to evaluate the security of treatment, the QoL of patients and the influence to the PFS and OS.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIA
OTHER: Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
PFS, up to 3 years
Adverse events, observe and record the toxicity profile(including but not limit to mucositis,liver and kidney function,et al.)according NCI-CTCAE(3rd edition) during the neoadjuvant chemoradiation and follow-up., participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay,an expected average of 100 days and every 3 months thereafter for 5 years|QOL, up to 3 years|OS, up to 3 years
Scheme:

Patients will receive different chemotherapy regimens depending on the pathological type.

Squamous cell carcinoma:Docetaxel/Cisplatin and concurrent radiation (46Gy/23f) followed by surgery, consolidate Docetaxel/Cisplatin 2 cycles.

Non-squamous cell carcinoma:Pemetrexed/Cisplatin and concurrent radiation (46Gy/23f) followed by surgery, consolidate Pemetrexed/Cisplatin 2 cycles.
