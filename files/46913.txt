IDA+BUCY vs BUCY Conditioning Regimen for Intermediate-risk AML Undergoing Auto-HSCT
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Auto-HSCT) is an effective alternative to allogeneic HSCT for intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without HLA-matched donors. At present, the best conditioning regimen for AML undergoing auto-HSCT remains in discussion. In this study, the safety and efficacy of IDA+BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in intermediate-risk AML undergoing auto-HSCT are evaluated.

Auto-HSCT is an effective alternative to allogeneic HSCT for intermediate-risk AML without HLA-matched donors. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative regimen. However, auto-HSCT with BUCY conditioning regimen appears to have higher relapse rate. To reduce the relapse rate, IDA is added in the conditioning regimen. In this study, the safety and efficacy of IDA+BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in intermediate-risk AML patients undergoing auto-HSCT are evaluated.
