Ivonescimab (AK112) Plus Paclitaxel as Second-line Therapy in Patients With Advanced G/GEJ Cancer
A Randomized, Controlled, Multi-center Phase II Study of Ivonescimab (AK112) plus Paclitaxel versus Paclitaxel with or without Ramucirumab as second-line therapy in subjects with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction（G/GEJ）cancer who failed immunochemotherapy
Gastric (Cardia, Body) Cancer
DRUG: AK112 + paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel ± ramucirumab
PFS, 12-24 months
ORR, 12-24 months|DCR, 12-24 months|DoR, 12-24 months|OS, 12-24 months
This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase II trial (N ≈ 110) conducted in China to assess the safety and antitumor activity of AK112 combined with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab in subjects with advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who failed immunochemotherapy. The study objective was to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of AK112 combined with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab in subjects with advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who failed immunochemotherapy. The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by RECIST v1.1, and the secondary endpoints were ORR, OS, DoR, time to response (TTR), DCR, and incidence/severity of adverse events (AEs) graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0. Eligible patients with progression after PD-1/L1 inhibitor plus platinum chemotherapy will be stratified by peritoneal metastasis (present vs. absent) and randomized 1:1 to: Group A (n=55): AK112 (20 mg/kg IV, D1/D15) + paclitaxel (80 mg/m² IV, D1/D8/D15), Q4W; Group B (n=55): Paclitaxel (80 mg/m² IV, D1/D8/D15) ± ramucirumab (8 mg/kg IV, D1/D15), Q4W. Treatment continues until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or investigator-determined clinical futility.Tumor assessments occur every 8 weeks (±7 days) via RECIST v1.1.
