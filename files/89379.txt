Elderly cancer incidence increases exponentially with advancing age. However, elderly patients are largely underrepresented in cancer treatment trials. The geriatric population presents particular physical, mental, psychological or social specificities that may condition the prognosis especially for patients with metastatic neoplasia. Recently, the measurement of quality of life (QoL) in aging population is being recognized as an important part of clinical decision. It is therefore essential to set up prospective studies to evaluate the impact of oncogeriatric practices on the quality of life of elderly patients with metastatic neoplasia. The main objective of this prospective study is to describe the contribution of geriatric intervention on quality of life for for elderly (\> 75 years) with metastatic solid cancer receiving systemic treatment during the first 6 months of their therapeutic management.
