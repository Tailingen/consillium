Romidepsin in Combination With Lenalidomide in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Lymphomas and Myeloma
The treatments used to treat lymphoma and multiple myeloma sometimes do not always work well or they may only work for a short period of time. This is why new treatments are being tested.

This study will test a new combination of two drugs that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of certain kinds of blood cancers. These drugs are romidepsin and lenalidomide. Both these drugs by themselves have been used to treat lymphoma or multiple myeloma. However, while these drugs are routinely used alone, this is the first time they will be tested together. The mechanism of action of both drugs is not well understood but both have been shown to to be effective by themselves in lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Romidepsin|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities/DLTs, The phase Ib portion of the study is designed to determine the MTD of romidepsin and lenalidomide., 1 year|Number of Participants Evaluable for AEs, Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v4.0 used as a guide for the grading of severity., 1 year
Assess the Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate, very good partial response/partial response rate will be summarized using proportions and confidence intervals will be provided. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year|Complete Response Rate/CRR, CRR is defined as Complete Response Rate. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year|Assess the Time to Best Response (TTBR), Duration of response (DOR), and event free survival (EFS). Time to response,duration of response and event free survival will be analyzed by routine survival analysis tools such as Kaplan-Meier estimation or competing risks method. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, up to 50 months
