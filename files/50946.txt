Safety of Clofarabine With Multiagent Chemotherapy in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to determine Maximum Tolerated Dosage (MTD), Dosage Limited Toxicities (DLT), and the Rate Phase 2 Dosage of clofarabine when used in combination with etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone and to assess the feasibility and safety of this combination regimen to treat children with high risk relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Acute Lymphoid Leukemia Relapse|Acute Lymphoid Leukemia Relapse After Bone Marrow Transplant
DRUG: Clofarabine
maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine in combination with etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone, within the 40 days after the chemotherapy
efficacy of clofarabine used in combination with etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone, Complete remission rate and minimal residual disease level, 40 days after the chemotherapy|Event free survival, 4 months
I.3 Primary Objectives :

To determine the MTD of escalating doses of clofarabine starting from 20 mg/m2/day to 40 mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5, as a replacement of cytarabine as part of a combination of etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (VANDA regimen).

I.4 Secondary Objectives :

1. To determine the safety and tolerability of clofarabine when used in combination with etoposide, asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (VANDA regimen) and determine the duration, seriousness, and relationship of adverse events that occur during the treatment and follow-up periods ; we search DLT
2. To determine the Overall Response rate (OR) (Complete Remission + Complete Remission without platelet's normalization) of clofarabine plus etoposide ,asparaginase, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone (VANDA regimen) in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL at the established clofarabine RP2D.
3. To document the rate of Partial Response\[s\] in the study population
4. To document time-to-event parameters, including duration of remission, Event Free Survival (EFS), 4-month EFS, and overall survival (OS).
