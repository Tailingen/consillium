Change in scores of Canadian Occupational Performance Measure., Canadian Occupational Performance Measure - COPM assesses perceived daily performance and performance satisfaction with meaningful daily activities.

During the pre-chemotherapy assessment, participants will identify up to five activities that they prioritize as meaningful for them. Each of these activities is then rated on a 10-point scale for perceived performance (1=not able to do at all, 10=able to do extremely well) and similarly for satisfaction with performance. The final scores of the COPM are the average scores for total performance and for satisfaction (higher scores indicate better performance or satisfaction with performance).
