Study of E7777 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma and Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of E7777 in participants with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma|Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: E7777
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants whose best overall response (BOR) was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on independent review of Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee. ORR was assessed according to modified response criteria based on the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), skin lesion and peripheral blood disease were assessed according to clinical end points and response criteria in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome (Olsen, 2011). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites., From the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug until completion of the study or treatment discontinuation, up to approximately 3 years 1 month
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS: time between the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug and the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) based on independent review of Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee, assessed by modified response criteria based on the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), skin lesion and peripheral blood disease assessed according to clinical end points and response criteria in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome (Olsen, 2011). PD: Any new lesion or unequivocally increase of previously involved sites from nadir. PFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Participants with no baseline assessments, treatment discontinuation without postbaseline tumor assessments, new anticancer treatment started prior to disease progression, death or PD after more than one missed tumor assessments and participants still on treatment without PD as of data cut-off were censored., From the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug until date of the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) up to approximately 3 years 1 month|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR: Time between date of first documentation of CR or PR and PD or death due to any cause based on independent review of Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee, assessed by modified response criteria based on revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson,2007),skin lesion and peripheral blood disease by clinical end points and response criteria in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome(Olsen,2011). DOR was assessed in responders who had CR or PR. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites. PD: Any new lesion or unequivocally increase of previously involved sites from nadir. DOR was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Participants with new anticancer treatment started prior to disease progression, death or PD after more than one missed tumor assessments and participants still on treatment without PD as of data cut-off were censored., From the date of first documentation of CR or PR until date of the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) up to approximately 3 years 1 month|Time to Response (TTR), TTR was defined as time between the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug and the date of first documentation PR or CR based on independent review of Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee. PR or CR were assessed according to modified response criteria based on the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), skin lesion and peripheral blood disease were assessed according to clinical end points and response criteria in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome (Olsen, 2011). TTR was only conducted among responders who had experienced CR or PR. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites., From the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug until date of the first documentation of PR or CR or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) up to approximately 3 years 1 month|CR Rate, CR rate was defined as the percentage of participants whose BOR was CR based on independent review of Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee. CR was assessed according to modified response criteria based on the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), skin lesion and peripheral blood disease were assessed according to clinical end points and response criteria in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome (Olsen, 2011). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease., From the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug until completion of the study or treatment discontinuation, up to approximately 3 years 1 month|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time between the date of administration of the first dose of the study drug and the date of death due to any cause.
