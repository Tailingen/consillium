Study of RSO-021 in Patients With Malignant Pleural Effusion Due to Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors Including Mesothelioma
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, translational Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and expansion study designed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RSO-021 after intrapleural (IP) administration in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) (non-mesothelioma) and MPE from mesothelioma.

Dose-limiting Toxicity, The incidence of DLTs during the DLT assessment period., First 21 days of treatment.|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events (AE), The incidences and percentages of patients experiencing AEs summarized by NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grade and by causality., Screening to 90 days from last dose.|Dose Finding, Determination of the MTD and/or the RP2D., Screening to 90 days from last dose.
Pharmacokinetics of RSO-021, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Day 1 of dosing through 21 days post last dose.|Pharmacokinetics of RSO-021, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Day 1 of dosing through 21 days post last dose.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR according to RECIST v1.1., Day 1 of dosing through day 90 after the last dose.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of subjects with a complete response, partial response, or stable disease for at least 2 consecutive tumor assessments., Day 1 of dosing through day 90 after the last dose.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of initiation of study therapy to the date measurement criteria are first met for PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Day 1 of dosing through day 90 after the last dose.
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center study whose primary Phase 1 stage objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RSO-021 (thiostrepton), a naturally-occurring, sulfur-rich, cyclic oligopeptide antibiotic of the thiopeptide class, in patients with MPE from any solid tumor, including mesothelioma.

In the Phase 2 stage, once the RP2D has been identified, the antitumor activity of RSO-021 will be evaluated in four recruitment arms; (1) in patients with MPE (non-mesothelioma), (2) in patients with MPE (non-mesothelioma) in combination with paclitaxel, (3) in patients with MPE from mesothelioma after first-line SoC, and (4) in patients with MPE from mesothelioma who have a 'window of opportunity' for treatment prior to first-line systemic therapy.
