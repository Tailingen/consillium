The Value of 68Ga-grazytracer PET in Monitoring Responses to Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer.
This study aims to investigate the value of 68Ga-grazytracer in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
Evaluation the responses to immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer, The value of 68Ga-grazytracer PET in monitoring responses to immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer, up to about 10 weeks|Standardized uptake value(SUV), SUV of 68Ga-grazytracer uptake on PET/CT images for tumor lesions, up to about 10 weeks|Target-to-background ratio(TBR), 68Ga-grazytracer uptake ratio of tumor lesions to mediastinum and liver blood pool on PET/CT images., up to about 10 weeks
Progress free survival, Progress free survival, 1 years|Overall survival, Overall survival, 1 years
The investigators will number all participants, create a medical record file, and record their basic information (gender, age) as well as contact information and medical history information. All participants will undergo a 68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT after 3 cycles of immunotherapy to evaluate response. The imaging response measurements will be compared with the histopathological or clinical assessment results as gold standard.
