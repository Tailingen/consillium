Accurate Diagnosis System for Postoperative Chronic Pain Based on fMRI
Postoperative pain is an ideal model for study on acute pain changing into chronic pain. The functional imaging of magnetic resonance can reflect the extent and character of pain exactly and the structural imaging of it can be a sign of the change. By analyzing fMRI results of participants with acute pain and following them up for three months, the investigators expect to find objective indicators for acute pain changing into chronic pain and give preventive analgesia for people with high risk of chronic pain.

different fMRI results of specific brain regions between people with and without chronic pain, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation(ALFF) and regional homogeneity(ReHo) of related brain regions, in the first week after surgery
the incidence of chronic pain after mastectomy, calculate the percentage of participants who rate pain more than three points on numerical rating scale, six months after surgery|the quality of life in patients after mastectomy, the results of brief pain inventory in the first week after surgery and the EORTC QLQ-C30 results in the first, second and third month after surgery, six months after surgery
The day before surgery, evaluate and choose patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Use the same anaesthesia and management and record information needed by the case report format. Patients are examined by fMRI on their brains during the first week after surgery. Follow up the patients after surgery for three months to find out whether they have chronic pain. The NRS, DN4, ID pain and QLQ-C30 are used for each patient.
