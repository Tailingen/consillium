The Remote Study: Investigating the Effects or Online Exercise on Quality of Life in Men With Prostate Cancer
Currently, there are few opportunities for patients with cancer to have individual exercise guidance, and this has further been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, during the pandemic the use of virtual/remote platforms has been crucial in delivering care to cancer patients. The investigators think that remote exercise training may also offer a solution to support positive change in prostate cancer patients. As a result, the investigators have developed a remote/online exercise programme to explore this further.

This study will explore the effectiveness of an 8-week remote exercise and behavioural support intervention, and whether prostate cancer patients feel they benefit from this. The study also aims to see if this sort of exercise programme can be delivered to more prostate cancer patients in the future. This project is open to men with prostate cancer on long term hormone therapy. The intervention will be comprised of one remote supervised session per week, completed 1-1 using an online platform and up to two additional sessions, depending on its suitability for the patient, will be prescribed as unsupervised home-based exercise.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. Twenty-seven questions about physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being are graded from 0-4 (0 = not at all; 4 = very much), yielding a total between 0 and 108., t= 0, 4, 8, 16 & 30 weeks|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy fatigue (FACIT-f) questionnaire. The FACIT-Fatigue is a validated questionnaire that was originally developed for the precise evaluation of fatigue levels in cancer patients with anemia. It consists of 13 questions using a 5 point scale (0=not at all; 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much). It has been used frequently in the clinical trial setting (please see appendix 1). Responses to each question are added with equal weight to obtain a total score. The range of possible scores is 0-52, with 0 corresponding to the highest level of fatigue and 52 corresponding to the lowest level of fatigue., t= 0, 4, 8, 16 & 30 weeks
Leisure time physical activity, Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire. This is a 3 question self-report questionnaire - indirect measure of physical activity, t= 0, 4, 8, 16 & 30 weeks|Physical activity, The Dukes Activity Status Index. The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) is a 12-item questionnaire that utilized self-reported physical work capacity to estimate peak metabolic equivalents (METs)., t= 0, 4, 8, 16 & 30 weeks|Cardiovascular risk, Qrisk3. Estimation of cardiovascular risk based on demographical and physiological parameters, t= 0, 4, 8 weeks|Exercise adherence, Session adherence. The number of sessions attended, and % of scheduled sessions performed. Every exercise session either completed or not completed over the 8 week intervention period, weekly for 8 weeks|Health status, eq-5d-5l. It comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, some problems, severe problems and unable to do. Each level of answer consists of each level of score ranges from 1 to 5. Each participant will have a health status consisting of 5 digits. Using the set of weights from Vietnamese population provided from the EuroGroup, we can convert each EQ-5D health state into a single summary index value. The index value ranges from 0 to 1, higher scores meaning better health quality., t= 0, 4, 8, 16 & 30 weeks
