Hybrid PET/CT in Cancer Patients
The purpose of the present study is to assess the role of hybrid PET/CT imaging diagnosis of active malignancy in cancer patients with rising tumor markers after treatment and in the diagnosis of primary tumor in patients with metastatic cancer of unknown origin. The clinical impact of PET/CT in the management and treatment of these two groups of cancer patients will be evaluated
