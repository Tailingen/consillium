Observational Study to Evalute the Efficacy and Safety of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Addition to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for First-Line Treatment of Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of Bevacizumab in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of participants with advanced stage (IIIB/IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) other than predominantly squamous cell histology.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Bevacizumab
Time to Disease Progression, Time to progression is the time elapsed from the date of enrollment to the first documented progression or to death of any cause. For participants who don't show progression or die until the end of treatment, the date of last contact is taken as the censoring time., up to 45 months
Best Tumor Response, Best tumor response is evaluated as percentage of participants with complete remission (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease., Up to 45 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is the time elapsed between enrollment and death of any cause. For participants who don't die until the end of treatment, the overall survival data will be analyzed retrospectively based on their date of death after the end of study., Up to 45 months|Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product.
