Study of TRC105 With Abiraterone and With Enzalutamide in Prostate Cancer Patients Progressing on Therapy
This research study is being done to measure the clinical benefit of TRC105 in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who are taking either abiraterone or enzalutamide and showing signs of biochemical progression without radiographic progression. A patient who is progressing on AR-therapy will continue the same AR-therapy on study with the addition of TRC105. The two arms will accrue in parallel and independently.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: TRC105|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Enzalutamide
Overall Clinical Benefit, Number of participants with stabilization of disease for at least 2 months or disease improvement at any time from start of combination therapy by radiographic and/or biochemical criteria through treatment completion up to an estimated period of 24 months

* radiographic improvement defined as a PR (At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum. There can be no appearance of new lesions) or CR (Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions) by RECIST 1.1 or improvement by PCWG3 criteria
* Biochemical response will be defined by PCWG3 criteria
* Stabilization will be defined as the absence of progression by BOTH radiographic and biochemical criteria, Through study completion, average 24 months
Adverse Events From TRC105 and Abiraterone or Enzalutamide, Number of participants with grade 3/4 Adverse Events Related to investigational therapy as assessed Using CTCAE (v.4) up to 4 months from treatment initiation., 4 months|Progression Free Survival, Time (in Months) from treatment initiation to radiographic and clinical progression over study duration (estimated 24 months)

- radiographic criteria measured by RECIST 1.1 \[Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions plus an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, taking as reference the smallest sum recorded since the start of study\], 24 months|Clinical Benefit at Two Months, Proportion of participants with stabilization of disease for two months or disease improvement at anytime from start of combination therapy to two months by radiographic and/or biochemical criteria

* radiographic improvement defined as a PR (At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum. There can be no appearance of new lesions) or CR (Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions) by RECIST 1.1 or improvement by PCWG3 criteria
* Biochemical response will be defined by PCWG3 criteria
* Stabilization will be defined as the absence of progression by BOTH radiographic and biochemical criteria, 2 months|Clinical Benefit at Four Months, Proportion of participants with stabilization of disease for at least 4 months or disease improvement at anytime from start of combination therapy to four months by radiographic and/or biochemical criteria

* radiographic improvement defined as a PR (At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum. There can be no appearance of new lesions) or CR (Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions) by RECIST 1.1 or improvement by PCWG3 criteria
* Biochemical response will be defined by PCWG3 criteria
* Stabilization will be defined as the absence of progression by BOTH radiographic and biochemical criteria, 4 months|Clinical Benefit From PSA Serum Concentration (2 Months), Proportion of participants with stabilization of disease based on PSA serum concentration levels. Stabilization of disease refers to PSA values that do not meet criteria for progression where progression will be defined as a rise in serum PSA that is ≥ 25% and 2 ng/mL above nadir which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3 weeks later., 2 months|Clinical Benefit From PSA Serum Concentration (4 Months), Proportion of participants with stabilization of disease based on PSA serum concentration levels. Stabilization of disease refers to PSA values that do not meet criteria for progression where progression will be defined as a rise in serum PSA that is ≥ 25% and 2 ng/mL above nadir which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3 weeks later., 4 months
This is a Phase II, open-label study of TRC105 (anti-endoglin antibody) in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who are taking either abiraterone or enzalutamide and showing signs of biochemical progression without radiographic progression. A patient who is progressing on AR-therapy will continue the same AR-therapy on study with the addition of TRC105. The two arms will accrue in parallel and independently.

There will be a 2-week washout of the active AR-targeted therapy prior to initiation of combination therapy. Tumor response should be assessed at a frequency of 8 weeks by CT/MRI chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as bone scan. Patients may continue on therapy until radiographic progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 criteria.
