Non-interventional Study With Nab-Paclitaxel (AbraxaneÂ®)
The purpose of this non-interventional study is to collect data on the efficacy and safety of Nab-Paclitaxel in the routine application.

The main focus of this non-interventional study is set on answering the following questions:

* Can the results observed in controlled clinical trials regarding efficacy and safety be reproduced in the routine clinical setting?
* Are the side-effects of nab-paclitaxel therapy observed in this study comparable to the previously described safety-profile in terms of frequency and intensity?
* What are the main reasons for modification or termination of the nab-paclitaxel therapy?
* How does nab-paclitaxel therapy influence the patients' quality of life?
* What are the criteria for selecting nab-paclitaxel as therapy for metastatic breast cancer?
