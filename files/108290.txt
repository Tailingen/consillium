Safety Study of APR-246 in Patients With Refractory Hematologic Cancer or Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the highest feasible dose (HFD) of intravenous (IV) APR-246 when given to patients with refractory hematologic malignancies or prostate carcinoma.
Hematologic Neoplasms|Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: APR-246
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is reached and HFD is defined accordingly, OR the dose, which is expected to result in maximum plasma concentration close to, but not exceeding 35 Î¼g/ml in any single patient without showing signs of DLT., 21 days
Determination of the toxicity and safety profile of APR-246 based on safety parameters from the entire study period., continuously during 21 days|Determination of the PK profile for up to 22 hours after the last APR-246 infusion. Cmax (maximal plasma concentration), AUC (area under the curve), t1/2 (half-life) and clearance will be determined., continuously, during 21 days
The purpose of this study is to determine the highest feasible dose (HFD) of intravenous (IV) APR-246 when given to patients with refractory hematologic malignancies or prostate carcinoma.
