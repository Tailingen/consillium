A Study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Pharmacokinetic profile: Cmax, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic profile: Tmax, Time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic profile: AUC0-t, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic profile: AUC0-∞, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-∞), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic profile: t1/2, Half-time (t1/2), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic profile: CL, Clearance (CL), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic profile: Vz, Volume of Distribution (Vz), Pre-dose and multiple timepoints up to Cycle 4th (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a response of CR/PR or stable disease (SD) as per RECIST 1.1, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first assessment of CR or PR until the date of first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) as per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of first documented PD as per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection. This study consists of two phases: dose-escalation phase and dose expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in patients with advanced solid tumors based on a 3+3 design. Patients enrolled in this phase will receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection followed by a 3-week DLT observation period. After DLT observation, two to four dose cohorts will be selected for dose-expansion to further explore the safety and efficacy of study drug according to the dose-escalation results. In the dose-expansion phase, patients will receive the study drug every 3 weeks (q3w, a cycle) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or withdrawal by investigator or patient decision (a maximum of 6 cycles).
