MRNA Neoantigen Vaccine in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Brief Summary: This study is an open, prospective, exploratory clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety,ability, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of a personalized neoantigen mRNA vaccine in combination with adebelimab as adjuvant treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary objectives of this study are to answer the following key questions:

1. The incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the designated observation period.
2. The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
3. The determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD).
