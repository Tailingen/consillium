A Prospective Non-Interventional Study in Participants Receiving Nivolumab in Adjuvant Setting for Resected Melanoma in Real-World Conditions in France
This is an observational prospective study to estimate in real world conditions the effectiveness, the safety profile and the pattern of use of adjuvant nivolumab in adults participants with stage III/IV resected melanoma, and subsequent treatments administered in case of relapse.
