Proton Radiation for the Treatment of Pediatric Bone and Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The main purpose of this study is to assess the short term and the long term side effects of proton beam radiation for pediatric bone and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas.
Non-rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Bone Sarcoma
RADIATION: Proton Beam Radiation
Acute and late toxicities, Assess frequency and severity of morbidities from irradiation using proton beam therapy in this patient population., 5 years|Local Control, Rates of local control using proton radiotherapy., 5 years
Dosimetric Comparison, Comparison of Dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using DVH's generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and the photon plan generated for comparison purposes., 5 years
* Participants will receive radiation treatments once per day, 5 days a week for a total of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on how much total dose the tumor requires. The radiation doctor will see the participant once each week to monitor and record any side effects they may have from radiation treatment.
* A special device will be made for each participant to help them hold still during the treatment. This may either be a mask or foam cradle, depending on the area to be treated.
