A Study of Lifestyle Intervention in Overweight or Obese Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that an intervention of lifestyle modification will positively impact women with breast cancer who are overweight and/or obese. To that end, our primary endpoint is to examine the effects of a practical lifestyle intervention that can be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to 25) with early stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI over the course of the study.
Weight
BEHAVIORAL: Diet and exercise
Lifestyle intervention, To examine the effects of a practical lifestyle intervention that can be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to 25) with early stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI over the course of the study., One year
Lipid Profiles, hemoglobin A1C, To assess the impact of such intervention on lipid profiles and hemoglobin A1C. The study group will be compared with a historical control group of patients with early stage breast cancer who are obese or overweight who were not given the intervention and to examine whether an active intervention program will lead into longstanding lifestyle modification in breast cancer patients with a BMI greater or equal to 25., 1 year
