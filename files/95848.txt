A Study of CC-97540, CD19-targeted NEX-T Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells, in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study of CC-97540, CD19-targeted NEX-T chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The study will consist of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part A) and dose-expansion (Part B). The dose-escalation part (Part A) of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of CC-97540 to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); and the dose-expansion part (Part B) of the study is to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of CC-97540 at the RP2D.

BIOLOGICAL: CC-97540
Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.ject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology.
