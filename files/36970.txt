90Y DOTA/Retinoic Acid for Neuroblastoma and Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET)
This study is for patients with neuroblastoma or a neuroendocrine tumor who have not been able to have standard therapy or have failed the first-line therapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination of retinoic acid and Onalta (Y-90-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide) in treating neuroblastoma and neuroendocrine tumors.

DRUG: Retinoic Acid|DRUG: Placebo
Evaluate tumor response to 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide alone and in combination with 13-cis retinoic acid for the treatment of children and young adults with recurrent, somatostatin-receptor positive tumors, 6 weeks after last treatment
Estimate and compare time to tumor progression and overall survival in the patients treated with 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide alone and in combination with 13-cis retinoic acid., up to 5 years
This study builds on the promising results of the Phase I trial of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide in childhood solid tumors and the history of cis-Retinoic Acid (cis-RA) use in children with neuroblastoma. This study will combine these two agents in a randomized Phase II trial. The safety and feasibility of using individual dosimetry measurements to maximize the 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide radiation dose to tumor while limiting the renal radiation dose to 23 Gy will be rigorously tested.

Fixed dosing will allow each subject to receive three cycles of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide at 50 mCi/m2. Dosimetry will be performed at each of these cycles; the combined dosimetry measurements will be utilized to determine whether or not a fourth cycle will be administered and, if so, what that dose will be. The administration of this additional cycle is conditional upon a) a subject not experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity during any previous cycle and b) meeting all criteria required at study initiation prior to the fourth dose.
