Gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 and Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 PET/MRI in Diagnosing Participants With Recurrent Prostate Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work in diagnosing participants with prostate cancer that has come back. Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 PET/MRI, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma|PSA Progression|Recurrent Prostate Carcinoma
DRUG: Gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1|DEVICE: Gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2
Number of Lesions Detected by Investigational Imaging Agent, The number of lesions detected on Ga- NeoBOMB1 positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Ga PSMA R2 PET/MRI, and conventional MR will be compared., Up to approximately 2 hours to complete each scan
Number of Detected Lesions Confirmed to be Malignant for Each Imaging Method, The predictive value of Ga- NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI and Ga PSMA R2 PET/MRI imaging will be evaluated based on biopsy and/or imaging results at the end of the 12 month standard clinical follow-up period, by comparing the investigational scans against scans the patient received as standard of care., At 1 year post-scan follow-up
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 (68Ga-NeoBOMB1) and gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 (68Ga-PSMA R2) PET/MRI for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients meeting the criterion of biochemical recurrence.

OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Participants receive gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 intravenously (IV) and 45 minutes later, undergo PET/MRI. Within 2 weeks, participants receive gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 IV then undergo PET/MRI 45-60 minutes later.

ARM II: Participants receive gallium Ga 68 PSMA-R2 IV and 45-60 minutes later undergo PET/MRI. Within 2 weeks, participants receive gallium Ga 68 DOTA-NeoBOMB1 IV then undergo PET/MRI 45 minutes later.

After completion of study, participants are followed up at 12 months.
