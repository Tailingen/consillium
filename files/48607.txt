Fertility After Uterine Artery Embolization
Uterine leiomyomas (or fibroids) are a common disease (30% of women over 35 years of age) in women of childbearing age and can cause various symptoms such as menometrorrhagia, dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and heaviness, and infertility.

Uterine artery embolisation, first used in France in 1990, is a safe, effective and less invasive therapeutic technique than surgical treatment (myomectomy or hysterectomy), particularly in the case of numerous and large fibroids. This technique is validated by the French National College of Gynaecologists-Obstetricians (CNGOF) as an alternative treatment for women who do not wish to become pregnant (grade A recommendation), but at present there is little reliable data concerning fertility, the occurrence of pregnancy and the obstetrical prognosis after uterine artery embolisation for fibroids. A recent systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis published very recently showed that 40.5% of patients with a desire for pregnancy were able to become pregnant after embolisation (CI: 33.3%-48.2%) but that the rates of miscarriage, obstetric complications and low birth weight were not negligible (respectively 33.5% (95% CI: 26.3-41%), 25.4% (95% CI = 13-40.2%) and 10% (95% CI = 6.2-14.6%) (Ghanaati et al. 2020).

In France, uterine artery embolisation is performed in more than thirty centres in women who have completed their parental project. On the other hand, in the absence of consistent literature, it is performed in patients of childbearing age, when it represents the only acceptable alternative or in the event of contraindication or refusal of surgery by the patient. To our knowledge, there is no large-scale French study to date on the impact of embolisation on fertility and pregnancy outcomes.

The aim of this study is to compile a retrospective database of all cases of uterine artery embolisation for uterine pathology performed at the Georges-Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP) since 2007 and to assess the impact of embolisation on fertility in patients of childbearing age.
