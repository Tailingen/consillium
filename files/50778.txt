Second-line Endocrine Treatment Followed by Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Followed by Endocrine Treatment in Patients With Metastatic ER Positive Breast Cancer
This trial studies the effects on quality of life and on time to second progression of the sequence endocrine therapy-capecitabine versus the sequence capecitabine-endocrine treatment. It is anticipated that the time on study (which is the time between randomization and the discontinuation of the second treatment in the sequence) will be similar for both arms of the study. The quality of life during this period, however, could be better in the patient group receiving the most effective first agent in the sequence. If this proves to be true, the conventional wisdom that endocrine therapy should be continued until no further endocrine options remain, must be abandoned.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: hormonal treatment (tamoxifen, exemestane, anastrozole or letrozole)
Quality of life during the study period: Physical functioning scale of the QLQ-C30; Global Health status/QoL of the QLQ-C30, every 6 weeks
Time to second progression and quality of life adjusted time to 2nd recurrence., at the end of the study
This is a randomized phase II/II study. Patients are randomized for the sequence capecitabine-hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy- capecitabine. At progression the patient should receive the other protocol treatment (e.g. if the patient was randomized to capecitabine, at progression the treatment should be switched to hormonal treatment).
