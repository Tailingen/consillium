Thymectomy Trial in Non-Thymomatous Myasthenia Gravis Patients Receiving Prednisone Therapy
The purpose of this trial is to determine if thymectomy combined with prednisone therapy is more beneficial in treating non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis than prednisone therapy alone.
Myasthenia Gravis
PROCEDURE: thymectomy plus prednisone|DRUG: prednisone alone
Time-weighted Average Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Weakness Score Over 3 Years, Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) test. QMG total scores range from 0 to 39 for a given visit, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The time weighted average is a calculation that provides an integrated measure of the outcome over the time of followup. The denominator that was used to compute the time-weighted average for the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and the prednisone dose was the number of days from randomization to the last visit. Computations used the trapezoidal method where in the QMG score is multiplied by the number of days at this level from one visit to the next and added up over the entire followup experience and divided by the total number of days from randomization., baseline, month 3, 4, 6 and every 3 months through 36 months|Time-weighted Average Alternate-day Prednisone Dose (mg) Measured Over 3 Years, Participants reported alternate-day prednisone dose (mg) intake from baseline through withdrawn or completed 3 years follow up.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease involving the thymus in which 85 percent of patients have antibodies to muscle acetylcholine receptors (AchR-Ab) that interfere with neuromuscular transmission. MG frequently causes severe disability that can be life-threatening. Thymectomy-a surgical procedure that removes thymus gland tissue from the chest cavity-has been an established therapy for non-thymomatous MG, or MG without thymoma, for more than 60 years (based on retrospective, non-randomized studies). Corticosteroids are now being used increasingly either as the sole treatment or in combination with thymectomy. Both therapies have associated adverse effects and indications for their use based on randomized trial data are lacking.

The purpose of this 5-year trial is to determine if the surgical procedure, extended transsternal thymectomy (ETTX), combined with prednisone therapy is more beneficial in treating individuals with non-thymomatous MG than prednisone therapy alone. More specifically, this study will determine 1) if ETTX combined with prednisone results in a greater improvement in myasthenic weakness, compared to prednisone alone; 2) if ETTX combined with prednisone results in a lower total dose of prednisone, thus decreasing the likelihood of concurrent and long-term toxic effects, compared to prednisone alone; and 3) if ETTX combined with prednisone enhances quality of life by reducing adverse events and symptoms associated with the therapies, compared to prednisone alone.

Learning that thymectomy results in a meaningful reduction of prednisone dosage or even full withdrawal or reduces side effects related to prednisone would support using the two treatments-thymectomy and prednisone-together. However, if no meaningful reduction of prednisone dosage or side effects is shown, the results would mean that using the two treatments together offers no advantages over prednisone treatment alone.

After an initial screening, study participants will be randomized either to undergo the surgical procedure ETTX and receive prednisone treatment, or to receive prednisone treatment alone without surgery. Participants will be followed for at least 3 years.
