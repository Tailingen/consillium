Trial Comparing 19 and 25-gauge EUS-FNA Needles
This study compares the 19G and 25G needles for procuring tissue samples from the pancreas during Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) procedures.
Cancer of Pancreas|Pancreatic Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Pancreatic Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Histological Samples
Median Number of Passes to Establish Diagnosis, To compare the median number of passes required to establish diagnosis using the 19G and 25G needles for FNA of solid pancreatic mass lesions. This will be measured by comparing the rates of diagnostic accuracy (%) between both needle types., 5 months
Procurement of Histological Samples, The ability of the 19G and 25G needles to obtain core (histological) tissue will be compared and a significance will be determined., 30 days|Needle Dysfunction, The percentage of cases in which needle dysfunction occurs will be compared between the 19G and 25G needle types. Needle dysfunction will be defined as the need to use more than one FNA needle per lesion in an individual patient., 2 hours|Complications, The safety profile of the 19 and 25G needles will be compared that includes bleeding, pancreatitis and perforation., 30 days
The study compares the median number of passes to establish a definitive diagnosis using the 19G or 25G needles. Also, the ability of both needles to procure a histological core tissue is assessed.
