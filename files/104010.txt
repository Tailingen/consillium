Pembrolizumab in Combination With Decitabine and Hypofractionated Index Lesion Radiation in Pediatrics and Young Adults
This pilot study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab, decitabine and fixed-dose hypofractionated index site radiotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed, refractory or progressive non-primary CNS solid tumors and lymphomas.

Primary Objectives

* To determine the feasibility of administering pembrolizumab in combination with decitabine and hypofractionated index lesion radiation
* To identify the treatment related toxicity and tolerability of the combination of decitabine and pembrolizumab with hypofractionated index lesion radiation

Secondary Objective

To preliminarily define the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab, decitabine and hypofractionated index lesion radiation in patients with relapsed, refractory, or progressive non-CNS solid tumors and lymphomas using overall response rate (CR + PR) by irRECIST after 2 cycles of therapy.

Exploratory Objectives

To profile the kinetics of the immune response and to correlate with promotor methylation changes, nuclear imaging, stool microbiota diversity, and tumor associated antigen immune responses.

Feasibility of administering Pembrolizumab in combination with Decitabine and hypofractionated index radiation, Incidence of number of patients who experience a DLT, Days 1 thru 57
Identification of treatment related toxicities and tolerability, Incidence of adverse events (toxicities) according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, Days 1 thru 57|Define anti-tumor efficacy of treatment combination of pembrolizumab, decitabine, and hypofractionated index radiation (per irRECIST criteria), Incidence of patients who experience an overall complete response or partial response to study treatment, 2 cycles (56 days)
Patients will receive pembrolizumab and decitabine every 28 days, and a single 3 day course of fixed-dose hypofractionated index site radiotherapy to one or more index lesions.

One cycle lasts 28 days. Radiation is given in Cycle 1 only. Cycles may repeat for a total of 26 cycles if patient meets criteria to continue protocol therapy.
