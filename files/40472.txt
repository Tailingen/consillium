A Study of Vismodegib (GDC-0449, Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor) With Concurrent Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab As First-Line Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of vismodegib (GDC-0449) added to biochemotherapy standard-of-care regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), with treatment until disease progression. Patients received either FOLFOX (FOL=leucovorin calcium \[folinic acid\], F=fluorouracil, OX=oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (FOL=leucovorin calcium \[folinic acid\] F=fluorouracil, IRI=irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy with bevacizumab. The decision of which regimen (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) to use was made by the treating physician and patient. Patients were randomized to receive vismodegib or placebo and were stratified based on the chemotherapy regimen chosen and whether or not Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) measurable disease was present at baseline.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Vismodegib 150 mg|DRUG: Placebo to vismodegib|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Modified FOLFOX|DRUG: FOLFIRI
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of documented disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For patients without measurable disease, PD was defined as an increase in the size of a lesion to one that is measurable or unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion., From first treatment through the data cut-off date of March 15, 2010, up to 90 weeks
Progression-free Survival (PFS) in Patients With Various Degrees of Hedgehog Antigen Tumor Expression, Indian + Sonic Hedgehog antigen expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from archival tumor tissue taken from each patient prior to enrollment in the study. Results are reported in 3 categories; the 33% of patients with the lowest level of expression, the 35% of patients with a middle level of expression, and the 32% of patients with the highest level of expression. PFS was defined as the time between randomization and disease progression, as confirmed by radiography, or death for any reason., From first treatment through the data cut-off date of March 15, 2010, up to 90 weeks
