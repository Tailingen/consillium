A Study of Dato-DXd With or Without Durvalumab Versus Investigator's Choice of Therapy in Patients With Stage I-III Triple-negative Breast Cancer Without Pathological Complete Response Following Neoadjuvant Therapy (TROPION-Breast03)
This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, 3-arm, multicenter, international study assessing the efficacy and safety of Dato-DXd with or without durvalumab compared with ICT in participants with stage I to III TNBC with residual invasive disease in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes at surgical resection following neoadjuvant systemic therapy.

Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) for Dato-DXd + durvalumab vs. ICT, iDFS is defined as time from randomisation until date of first occurrence of one of the following events: ipsilateral invasive breast tumour (local) recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence (axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and skin of ipsilateral breast), or distant recurrence (metastatic breast cancer that has either been biopsy-confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer); contralateral invasive breast cancer; second primary non-breast invasive cancer (other than squamous or basal cell skin cancer); or death from any cause.

iDFS will be determined based on disease recurrence per investigator assessment based on all available clinical assessments. The analysis will include all randomised participants, as randomised, regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised therapy or receives another anticancer therapy.

The measure of interest will be the HR (hazard ratio) of iDFS for Dato-DXd + durvalumab vs ICT., From randomisation to date of the event, up to 57 months from first subject in

The study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Dato-DXd with or without durvalumab when compared with ICT (capecitabine and/or pembrolizumab) in participants with stage I to III TNBC who have residual invasive disease in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes at surgical resection following neoadjuvant systemic therapy.

The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of Dato-DXd in combination with durvalumab relative to ICT by assessment of iDFS in participants with stage I to III TNBC with residual invasive disease at surgical resection following neoadjuvant therapy.
