To describe patterns of adherence and pilot baseline measures to investigate factors associated with lower adherence to lenalidomide in older adults with myeloma.

Adherence rate as measured by the number of days in which the lenalidomide pill bottle was open, -Participants will be given a pill diary in which they will record if they opened the pill bottle without taking a medication (e.g. to ascertain remaining supply) to adjust the adherence rate accordingly, Through completion of study (estimated to be 3 months)
Adherence rate as measured by a modified Brief Adherence Rating Scale, * Participants will fill out a brief survey about taking lenalidomide and an estimate of their adherence using a visual analog scale
* Scored 0-100%, 0% = lenalidomide not taken on any days and 100% = lenalidomide taken every day, Through completion of study (estimated to be 3 months)
