Low and Intermediate Risk OliGometastatic ColoREctal CancEr PatieNts Treated with Stereotactic ABlative Radiotherapy
This is an experimental study without drug or device, randomized, open-label, non-profit, sponsored by the IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital in Negrar, which will take place at the Department of Advanced Oncological Radiotherapy and 18 other Italian centers.

The reason for this research study is to evaluate whether stereotactic radiotherapy treatment (SABR), in addition to the systemic chemotherapy treatment foreseen by clinical practice for low-intermediate risk oligometastatic colorectal cancer, is able to:

* delay possible local recurrence and/or distant polymetastatic progression
* improve disease-free survival
* reduce side effects in the short and long term

thus inducing an improvement in the quality of life of patients suffering from this type of pathology.

Therefore, as part of this randomized study, before starting first or second line systemic therapy for his tumor, the patient will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms:

* Experimental arm: ablative stereotactic radiotherapy on all sites of oligometastatic disease (from 1 to 3 sites, performed at most within the second cycle of systemic therapy)
* Control arm: no ablative stereotactic radiotherapy to sites of oligometastatic disease

The procedure that is intended to be tested in the experimental arm is a stereotactic radiotherapy treatment on oligometastases (up to a maximum of 3 sites), with ablative dosage (effective biological dose \>100 Gy), performed before the start of systemic therapy of I or II line (at most within the second cycle of the same).

It is hoped that the addition of this type of radiotherapy will increase the potential clinical benefit of the treatment in the context of colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
RADIATION: SABR
Progression-free survival (PFS)., PFS is defined as the time between randomization to the radiological evidence of disease progression.

For patients with a PFS event, PFS will be calculated as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of first objective evidence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

For patients without a PFS event, PFS will be censored at the date of the last radiographic assessment prior to the date of study end., 7 years
Time to the polymetastatic conversion (tPMC), tPMC will be defined as the time between randomization to the date of radiological occurrence of \>5 new metastases. For patients without a tPMC event, time to tPMC will be censored at the date of the last radiographic assessment prior to the study end date., 7 years|Local control (LC): the time between randomization to the date of radiological development of local progression after SABR., For patients without LC, time to LC will be censored at the date of the last radiographic assessment prior to the study end date., 7 years|Overall survival (OS), OS will be defined as the time between randomization to the date of death or last follow-up. For patients who are alive at the time of the study end date, OS time will be censored on the last date the patient is known to be alive or the study end date, whichever occurs first., 7 years|Time to start of the next systemic treatment line (NEST), For patients without a NEST, time to NEST will be censored at the date of the last patient visit before the study end date., 7 years|Number of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 60 months|Number of acute side-effects, Acute side-effects, from enrollment until 6 months after the last dose of SABR|Number of Late side-effects, Late side-effects, from the 6 months after the last dose of SABR until up to 3 years after inclusion in the trial|questionnaire QLQ-C30, Quality of life (QoL): QoL will be evaluate with the questionnaire QLQ-C30, 60 months
