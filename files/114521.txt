A Phase I Study of WT1 or NY-ESO-1 Vaccine and Nivolumab For Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of an investigational WT1 vaccine and another drug called nivolumab. This is the first time that the WT1 vaccine and nivolumab are being used in combination. Also, to test the safety of a combination of an investigational NY-ESO-1 vaccine and another drug called nivolumab.

BIOLOGICAL: WT1 Vaccine|DRUG: Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: NY-ESO-1 Vaccine
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), The first 3 patients will be observed for 30 days before enrolling the next 7 patients. Accrual will continue as patients become available after the first 3 patients are observed for 30 days. If \>2/10 DLTs are observed then the study combination will not be considered safe., 30 days
immune response (cohort 2), Serologic IgM and IgG antibody responses will be measured by ELISA against each antigen, week 15|progression-free survival rate (cohort 2), Will evaluate PFS rate at 1-year using Kaplan Meier methodology, 1 year
