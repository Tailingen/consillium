Phase I Trial of Weekly MEDI-522 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors
To determine the safety profile of single and multiple doses of MEDI522 in patients with refractory solid tumors.
Cancer
DRUG: MEDI-522
Safety: The incidence and severity of adverse experiences and laboratory abnormalities will be tabulated and presented overall and by dose., Study Day 1 up to 8 weeks
Pharmacokinetics: Will be assessed using the variables of area under the concentration curve (AUC) which will be calculated by the trapezoidal rule, peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), half life, 35 days after the first dose|Measured pharmacokinetic parameters may be one of the factors used in determination of the Phase II regimen., Appx. 5 days after the 4th weekly dose|Antitumor Activity: The antitumor activity of MEDI-522 in patients with refractory solid tumors will be assessed by calculating tumor response rate and time to disease progression.
To determine the safety profile of single and multiple doses of MEDI522 in patients with refractory solid tumors.
