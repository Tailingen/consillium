S-1 Versus 5-FU Bolus in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Gemcitabine-Based Regimen
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether S-1 increases overall survival when compared to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with a gemcitabine-based therapy.

The secondary objectives are to compare: progression free survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit and improvement in tumor related symptoms and also to assess overall safety and pharmacokinetics of S-1.
