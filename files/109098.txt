Epidemiological Study to Describe NSCLC Clinical Management Patterns in Europe. Lung-EPICLIN
To provide accurate and reliable information regarding NSCLC clinical management across European countries in order to detect unmet medical needs of this disease in terms of: patient and hospital characteristics; diagnostic and treatment approaches: initial and subsequent, follow-up patterns in clinical management; outcomes: symptoms, death, functionality, quality of life; use of resources and burden on patients and health care systems.
