Trial of High Dose Lenalidomide in Patients With MDS and AML With Trilineage Dysplasia
This is a phase II study of lenalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with trilineage dysplasia. Patients will receive two cycles of lenalidomide. Patients who respond may given additional cycles of lenalidomide until disease progression.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Lenalidomide 50 mg|DRUG: Lenalidomide 15 mg
Response Rate, Number of participants with a complete or partial response according to International Working Group 2006 criteria., 15 weeks
Grade 3-4 Toxicity, Number of participants who experienced at least one grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicity by CTCAE 3.0 that was attributed to lenalidomide., Up to 8 months
This is a single center open label phase II study of lenalidomide in IPSS Int-1 with increased blasts or hematologic needs with 5q31.1 deletions who have failed to respond to standard dose lenalidomide., IPSS Int-1 with increased blasts or hematologic needs without 5q31.1 deletions, and Int-2 and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with or without 5q31.1 deletions, regardless of whether they have received lenalidomide previously or not. Patients will receive two cycles of 15 mg daily lenalidomide (later amended to 50 mg daily lenalidomide) given on days 1-28 out of a 42 day cycle. Within each of the two cycles of lenalidomide, patients will be given up to three weeks with no drug treatment to recover. Patients who fail to respond after two cycles of treatment may receive two additional cycles if stable. Patients who develop clinical response may continue to receive drug until disease progression.
