Impact of COL7A1 Gene Therapy on SCC Recurrence in RDEB Skin
The study objective is to see if BVEC induced C7 expression in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) skin following Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) excision will normalize the invasive tumor microenvironment and reduce tumor recurrence.

Prevention of SCC's in the RDEB subjects will increase their life span.

DRUG: BVEC
Recurrence rate of Squamous Cell Carcinoma, The outcome measure is recurrence rate of SCC following BVEC application at each SCC lesion, 2 years
