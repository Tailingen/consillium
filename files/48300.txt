A First-in-Human (FIH) Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of VVD-130850 in Participants With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Tumors
A FIH study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VVD-130850, as single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibition, in participants with advanced solid and hematologic tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Advanced Hematologic Tumors
DRUG: VVD-130850|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose Escalation: Incidence and Severity of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During DLT Observation Period, Incidence and severity of DLTs will be assessed per DLT criteria set forth in the protocol based on adverse events (AEs) evaluated per National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., From Day 1 to Day 21 of Cycle 1 [cycle length=21 days]|Dose Expansion: Number of Participants with AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Expansion: Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Signs, Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Expansion: Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Changes in Laboratory Evaluations, Up to approximately 4 years
Dose Escalation: QT/Corrected QT (QTc) Interval and Other Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters, Number of participants with changes in QT/QTc interval and other ECG parameters will be assessed., Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Escalation: Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) of VVD-130850 as a Single Agent and in Combination with Pembrolizumab, The RDE will be based on safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic biomarker data, and preliminary anti-tumor activity collected during the study as defined by the safety review committee., Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Expansion: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Expansion: Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from initial response of CR or PR to progressive disease or death, whichever comes first per RECIST version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Expansion: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the time of confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurs first per RECIST version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Expansion: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR or PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 4 years|Dose Escalation and Expansion: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of VVD-130850, Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)|Dose Escalation and Expansion: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of VVD-130850, Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)|Dose Escalation and Expansion: Apparent Terminal Half-life (t1/2) of VVD-130850, Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)
