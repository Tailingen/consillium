Intrapleural Instillation of the Nivolumab in Cancer Patients With Pleural Effusion.
Patients with advanced cancers who have pleural effusion, especially those requiring pleural evacuation, experienced poorer survival when treated with immunotherapy. The pleura also acts as a natural barrier that can limit the penetration of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this multicenter phase 2 study, the preliminary efficacy and toxicity of intrapleural instillation of the nivolumab in patients with immune-sensitive metastatic cancers will be accessed.
