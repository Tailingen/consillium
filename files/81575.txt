AZD4573 in Novel Combinations With Anti-cancer Agents in Patients With Advanced Blood Cancer
This is a modular, multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, Phase I/II, dose-setting and expansion study including an intra-participants dose ramp up. AZD4573 will be administered intravenously, in novel combinations with anti-cancer agents, to participants with relapsed/refractory (r/r) haematological malignancies.

In Module 1 Part A (dose-setting), this study module will enrol participants with r/r Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or r/r Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have failed prior therapy(ies), are not eligible for curative treatment options, for whom there is no standard therapy available, and will initially explore once weekly administration of AZD4573 at up to three target dose levels in combination with oral acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily. The primary objective of Part A will be to identify the maximum tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for further evaluation in Part B. A 5-week DLT-assessment period will incorporate the whole of Cycle 1 in Part A, including the dose ramp up and the first 3 weeks at the target dose. In Module 1 Part B (expansion), separate expansion cohorts for participants with Germinal Centre B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL subtypes will be opened at the RP2D.

In Module 2, this study module will enroll participants with r/r Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who have failed at least one line of prior therapy, are not eligible for curative treatment options. Module 2, Part A consist of AZD4573 monotherapy (Period 1) followed by AZD4573 + acalabrutinib combination treatment (Period 2). Period 1: AZD4573 will be administered weekly (12 mg, infusion). Period 2: AZD4573 (RP2D from Module 1) will be administered (weekly) in combination with oral acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily. Cycle 1 of each dosing period has a duration of 5 weeks; subsequent cycles have a duration of 3 weeks. The AZD4573 monotherapy (Period 1) includes an intra-patient ramp up; participants will receive AZD4573 at Cycle 1 Week 1, Cycle 1 Week 2, and Cycle 1 Week 3 in 3 dose escalation manner (6, 9 and 12 mg respectively). Part A, Period 1 of Module 2 aims to confirm the AZD4573 monotherapy RP2D in MCL participants. In Period 2, the safety and tolerability of the RP2D of AZD4573 + acalabrutinib established in Module 1 will be assessed in participants with MCL. The study design of Part B of Module 2 will be determined from the data emerging from Part A.
