Prostate-cancer Treatment Using Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Oligometastases Ablation in Hormone-sensitive Patients
INDICATION: Oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: Open label, double arm, randomized 1:1, multicenter phase III study.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of ablative radiotherapy (SBRT applied to all oligometastases) administered to all gross tumor sites (metastases and prostate if applicable), in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients.
Oligometastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) + Standard of care|DRUG: Standard of care
Castration-resistant prostate cancer free survival, Castration-resistant prostate cancer free survival, defined as the time from randomization to castration resistance or death from any cause. Castration resistance is defined as either biochemical progression or radiological progression, with serum testosterone being at a castrated level (\<50 ng/dL or \<1.7 nmol/L)., From randomization to castration resistance or death from any cause, up to 1 year
Overall survival, The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive. The outcome is to evaluate whether SRBT improves overall survival compared to standard of care, From randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years|Prostate cancer specific survival, To evaluate, compared to standard of care, whether SRBT improves survival of patients until death from prostate cancer, From randomization to death from prostate cancer, up to 5 years|Time to castration resistance, The length of time patients leave without resistance to castration treatment, where deaths occurring with no castration resistance (i.e. unrelated to prostate cancer) are censored, Time from randomization to castration resistance, up to 5 years|Time to next symptomatic skeletal event, The length of time until manifestation of the first symptomatic skeletal event among the following: symptomatic bone fracture, surgery to bone or use of palliative radiotherapy to bone, Time from randomization to the first symptomatic skeletal event, up to 5 years|Time to next symptomatic skeletal event at the treated metastatic bone sites, The length of time until manifestation of the first symptomatic skeletal event, at a site irradiated during the study for patients in the experimental arm, among the following: symptomatic bone fracture, the use of bone surgery, or palliative bone radiotherapy and spinal cord compression, Time from randomization to the first symptomatic skeletal event, 5 years|Time to use of intermittent hormonal therapy, The length of time patients receive continuous androgen deprivation therapy before the switch to the intermittent androgen deprivation therapy, Time from randomization to the use of intermittent androgen deprivation therapy, up to 5 years|Duration of intermittent hormonal therapy, The length of time patients receive intermittent androgen deprivation therapy, From the end of continuous therapy to the end of intermittent therapy, up to 5 years|Time to secondary treatments (local or systemic), The interval between the randomization and the initiation of the first treatment after disease progression: systemic chemotherapy, second line hormonal therapy, bone directed treatment (bisphosphonate or denosumab), or the use an antalgic palliative bone treatment (interventional radiology or radiotherapy), From randomization to initiation of secondary treatment, up to 5 years|Acute and late toxicity of stereotactic radiotherapy of oligometastases: Adverse events, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale will assess the severity of sensory neuropathic disorders, this derivative into 5 grades determined by the investigator., Throughout study completion, up to 5 years|Severity of pain during treatment, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. This self-report questionnaire includes:

* A body schema
* The maximum pain, lowest pain, usual pain within the last 15 days (Numerical Numeric rating scales (NRS) 0 to 10
* Description of current analgesic treatment
* An assessment of relief by a percentage scale (0-100%), Assessment of the impact of pain on: mood, relationships with others, walking, sleep, work, happiness the joy - of living, recreation, activities in general (digital scales, rating from 0 \[normal\] to 10 \[no activity\])., At baseline before radiotherapy, week 6, and at every follow-up (every three months for the first three years then every 6 months for the last two years after randomization), up to 5 years|The 3-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire, This self-reported questionnaire that assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials consists of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).

The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each dimension has 3 levels (1 = "no problems", 2 = "some problems", and 3 = "extreme problems"). This questionnaire provide a 5-digit score which generate a health state profile. The VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the score range from 0 (Best imaginable health state) to 100 (Worst imaginable health state). The VAS is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement., At baseline, week 6, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, and at castration resistance (up to 5 years)|Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) short form, This self-reported questionnaire, designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment, contains 26 item divided in 5 domains (Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal). Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health-related quality of life., At baseline, week 6, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, and at castration resistance (up to 5 years)|Cost-effectiveness analysis of the proposed therapeutic strategy, To evaluate the economic cost of the SBRT treatment as compared to the treatment without radiotherapy in terms of cost assessments, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and quality of life adjusted life years, At baseline, week 6, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, castration resistance (up to 5 years)
