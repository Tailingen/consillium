Malignant gliomas recur mostly 2 cm within originated area. Local therapies therefore become particular important. Gliadel wafer developed in the States and marketed in the developed countries is an example of such treatments. The product in this study, Carmustine Sustained Release Implant (CASANT), is similar to that of Gliadel wafer as for the API(Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient), but different as for drug delivering system. As required, the preliminary clinical studies were conducted in China. Based on the results of phase I/II , 8-10 wafers containing given dose of BCNU will be administered intracranially in this phase III to the tumor resected cavity to investigate the safety and efficacy in the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma in 212 patients.
