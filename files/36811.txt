Pharmacokinetic Study on the Addition of Aprepitant to Cisplatin - Etoposide Treatment in Lung Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether aprepitant can be used in the Cisplatin - Etoposide chemotherapeutic regimen.
Tumor
DRUG: aprepitant|DRUG: Dexamethasone and Ondansetron during CE-treatment
plasma concentrations of etoposide will be measured, just before etoposide infusion, at 0.5, 1,4,6,8 and 24 hours and 32 hours after dosing on study days 1 and 3
Nausea and emetic episodes are recorded, Day 1,3,5 and 8 of each cycle
Aprepitant acts initially as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 followed by a short period of CYP3A4 induction. Etoposide is a substrate of CYP3A4 and may therefore be suvject to a drug interaction with aprepitant.

CE can be classified as a highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic regimen and the use of aprepitant may therefore be considered when no clinically relevant drug interaction with etoposide can be determined.
