Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence - Assisted Colonoscopy in Colorectal Neoplasms
The primary goal of this study is to estimate the effectiveness of a medical decision support system based on artificial intelligence in the endoscopic diagnosis of benign tumors.

Researchers will compare Adenoma detection rate between "artificial intelligence - assisted colonoscopy" and "conventional colonoscopy" groups to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of artificial intelligence model.
Colonic Neoplasms|Colonic Polyp|Diagnosis
DEVICE: The system based on real - time artificial intelligence - assisted for colonoscopy
Adenoma detection rate, In each group, the percentage of patients with at least one histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma, during the procedure
Polyps detection rate, In each group, the number of patients with all type of neoplasms (polyps) was detected as a percentage of the total number of patients., during the procedure|Number of polyps, In each group, the number of detected all type of polyps, during the procedure|Number of adenomas, In each group, the number of detected adenomas, during the procedure
The primary outcome is adenoma detection rate per patient.

The secondary outcomes will be measured:

* Polyps detection rate (all type of lesions) per patient;
* Number of adenomas per patient;
* Number of polyps per patient;
