Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Malignancies
This study is an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter, continuous dose escalation study of XT-0528 in adult subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Malignancies.

The study will consist of 4 periods:

Screening Period (up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) Safety Run-in Period (Cycle 1; continuous dosing on Days 1-21 of 28-day cycle) Continuous Dosing Period (Cycle 2 and beyond; continuous dosing on Days 1-28 of 28-day cycle) Safety Follow-up Period (30 days post-last dose).
Metastatic Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: XT-0528
To determine the dose recommended for future Phase 2 studies (RP2D) that maximally suppresses Th17 cell activities, Determination of Th17 cell suppression by measuring serum levels of Th17 cytokines before and during continuous dosing of XT-0528, Cycle 1 (Days 1-21)|To determine the dose recommended for future Phase 2 studies (RP2D) with an absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and without exceeding the maximum tolerable dose (MTD)., Determination of MTD, in the continuous dosing setting, as assessed by collection of adverse event/serious adverse event (AE/SAE) information, if MTD is reached during dose escalation., Cycle 1 (Days 1-21)
To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528 and its (R)-isomer - Cmax, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), End of Cycle 1 (Days 1-21 of 28-day Cycle)|To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528 and its (R)-isomer - Cmax Steady State, maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss), End of Cycle 1 (Days 1-21 of 28-day Cycle)|To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528 and its (R)-isomer - Tmax, time to Cmax (Tmax), End of Cycle 1 (Days 1-21 of 28-day Cycle)|To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528 and its (R)-isomer - Tmax Steady State, time to Cmax at Steady State (Tmax,ss), End of Cycle 1 (Days 1-21 of 28-day Cycle)|To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528 and its (R)-isomer - AUC, area under the concentration-time curve calculated using linear trapezoidal rule from time zero to 24 hours, the dosing interval, after first dose (AUC0-t), End of Cycle 1 (Days 1-21 of 28-day Cycle)|To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528 and its (R)-isomer - AUC Steady State, area under the concentration-time curve calculated using linear trapezoidal rule from time zero to 24 hours, the dosing interval, after first dose at Steady State (AUC0-tau), End of Cycle 1 (Days 1-21 of 28-day Cycle)|To observe subjects for evidence of the antitumor activity of XT-0528 - ORR, To determine the objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. \* Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants whose best observed response is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST in the population of interest, End of Cycle 3 (Each cycle is 28 days)|To observe subjects for evidence of the antitumor activity of XT-0528 - PFS, To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS). Progression free survival (PFS) for a participant is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first objectively documented disease progression per RECIST in the population of interest, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, End of Cycle 3 (Each cycle is 28 days)|To measure anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation against XT-0528, Neutralizing antibody assessments will be performed in samples positive for ADA and will be analyzed to determine impact on rate and severity treatment-emergent adverse event(s) (TEAE)., End of Cycle 3 (Each cycle is 28 days)|To observe subjects for evidence of the antitumor activity of XT-0528 - OS, To determine the median overall survival (OS). Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of death from any cause., End of Cycle 3 (Each cycle is 28 days)
Primary Objective

* To determine the dose recommended for future Phase 2 studies (RP2D) that maximally suppresses T helper 17 (TH17) cell activities with an absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and without exceeding the maximum tolerable dose (MTD).

Secondary Objective

* To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered XT-0528.
* To observe subjects for evidence of the antitumor activity of XT-0528.
