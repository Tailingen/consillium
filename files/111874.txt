Testosterone Therapy in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is an open-labeled, single-arm, interventional pilot study. It is being done to determine the feasibility of the administration of transdermal testosterone alternating with enzalutamide, as well as the safety and efficacy.

Safety of the Administration of Transdermal Testosterone Alternating with Enzalutamide, Safety will be assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 criteria, in which rates of Grade 1-5 AE will be assessed, with a prticular attention to grade 3-5 events, Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate, PSA response rates as measured by serum PSA at designated study visits. Response will be defined as a decline in the serum PSA of 50% from baseline value at start of study., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Time to Radiographic Progression, Time to radiographic progression as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Time to Radiographic Progression, Time to radiographic progression as measured by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) imaging criteria., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Time to PSA Progression, This will be defined by the PCWG3., Study start date to study end date, every four weeks, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Maximum Decrease in PSA, PSA will be assessed at baseline and every four weeks. Maximum decrease assessed through these measurements., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Physical Function Change, Assessed through handgrip exercises., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Physical Function Change, Assessed through chair rise exercises., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Patient Activation, Assessed using the Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Scale (SEPA), which uses a 5 point Likert scale., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Reported Fatigue, Measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-Fatigue 13)., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Patient Mood and Depression Evaluation, Measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), which uses a point system based on responses ranging from "not at all" to "all the time.", Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Bone Health, Standard bone densometry assessment will be used to calculate T and Z score to determine normal, osteopenic, or osteoporotic bone mineral density., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Body Composition, Measured by a DXA scanner. Free fat mass and lean body mass will be assessed to determine sarcopenic obesity., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Quality of Life Assessment, Measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P)., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Change in Hormones, Change in testosterone, estrogen, and sex hormone binding globulin., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Self-Reported Physical Function, Measured by the PROMIS-PA., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Energy Expenditure, Measured by hood assessment., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Change in Max Repetition, Measured by subject's maximal leg press over time in the energy-balance laboratory., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|Change in Spontaneous Physical Activity and Sedentary Time, Measured through accelerometry. Patients will wear an accelerometer for one week at initiation and again one month later., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death|PSA Response in this Cohort of Patients vs Historical Cohorts, Assessed through IM testosterone historical data., Study start date to study end date, up to 12 months, or until patient death
The primary endpoint of this trial is to determine the feasibility of the administration of transdermal testosterone alternating with enzalutamide. High dose testosterone has shown activity in phase II studies of patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer; however, these studies have generally employed the intramuscular formulation. It has been hypothesized that the transdermal formulation will show activity but will have less potential for toxicity due to extremely high levels of circulating testosterone (i.e. thrombotic events). In addition, this will allow for a steady state of elevated testosterone, rather than the peaks and troughs seen with the IM approach.
