A Multimodal Intervention Program to Improve Sexual Health and Self-perceived Quality of Life in Patients Treated for Cervical Cancer (PROVIDENCE)
The PROVIDENCE Trial aims to explore the improvement of sexual health and self-perceived health related quality of life (measured by Patient Reported Outcome Measures) through a multimodal intervention that includes patient education on healthy habits and the prevention of vaginal dysfunction using vaginal moisturizers and topical estrogens. To achieve this, a randomized design is proposed to assess sexual health and quality of life in patients treated for cervical cancer who undergo this intervention compared to those who receive standard care.

Cervical cancer treatment, both radical hysterectomy and chemoradiotherapy, can impair all scopes of daily life and, beyond the physical changes caused by treatment, has psychological and social implications that influence health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Patients undergoing treatment for cervical cancer have shown to score less in HR-QoL scales compared to healthy women. More than half of women with gynecological cancer experience sexual dysfunction, especially those affected by cervical cancer. In spite of the latest 2023 ESGO/ESTRO/ESP recommendations on the management of cervical cancer, several observational studies indicate that the percentage of cervical cancer patients receiving information and treatment for early menopause and sexual dysfunction, especially regarding hormone replacement therapy, does not exceed 50%.

The PROVIDENCE trial is a multi-institutional, national, randomized clinical trial which aims to demonstrate that a multimodal intervention including patient education on sexuality and healthy habits and the prevention of vaginal dysfunction reduces sexual disfunction and HR-QoL impairment in patients treated for cervical cancer. The recruitment period is scheduled from January 2024 to December 2026 and will be held in Gynecology Oncology Units of referral hospitals in Spain.

Patients will be randomized 1:1 at diagnosis of cervical cancer to control arm or intervention arm. After treatment for initial or locally advanced cervical cancer, patients in the control arm will undergo the standard follow-up and treatment of post-treatment morbidity will be performed following the standard procedures as determined by their referring physician. The proposed multimodal intervention for patients assigned to the intervention group (detailed below) includes education on healthy habits, the prevention of vaginal dysfunction using vaginal moisturizers and topical estrogens, and a systematic evaluation of the need of hormone replacement therapy.
