Efficacy and Safety of Systemic Treatments of Bone Metastases From Kidney Cancer in Patients Treated With Targeted Therapies
Multicenter, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group, phase III study whose goal is to assess the efficacy and safety profile of bone-targeted treatments (Arm A: denosumab or zoledronic acid) versus the control arm (Arm B: no specific treatment) in patients with bone metastases under targeted therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: denosumab
Time to first Skeletal Related Event, Defined as the time from randomization to first SRE. Patients without event will be censored at the time of the last clinical evaluation., Up to 54 months after the first inclusion
Number of specific event-free survivals, Specific times from randomization to appearance of the first Skeletal Related Event., Up to 54 months after the first inclusion|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Incidence of adverse events (AEs) assessed using the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE) v4 grading scale, specific registration of ONJ or other osteonecrosis and rate of skeletal event per patient during study duration, Every 3 months until the 18th month for each patient|Evolution of pain severity, Proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful change in pain severity evaluated using a numerical rating scale (NRS), Every 3 months until the 18th month for each patient|Evolution of pain, Proportion of patients that shifted from not taking a strong opioid at baseline, Every 3 months until the 18th month for each patient|Patient's condition evaluation, "Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)" questionnaire, made of 27 items measuring the respondents' health state, each of which is answered using a five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state. Subscale scores are added to obtain total score., Up to 9 months for each patient (evaluated at baseline, months 3, 6, 9)|Patient's condition evaluation, "EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels" questionnaire is a scale used in the health state description. Each items is a three-level scale : having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems.The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions)., Up to 18 months for each patient (evaluated at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 18)|Overall survival, Measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, Up to 54 months after the first inclusion|Evaluation of the different practices for bone metastases treatments, Financial evaluation of centers' practices (home or hospitalization), Up to 18 months for each patient|Cost-utility analysis, All the hospitalization costs will be collected during the timeframe: outpatient, inpatient, and home care, Up to 18 months for each patient|Cost-effectiveness analyses, All the hospitalization costs will be collected during the timeframe: outpatient, inpatient, and home care, Up to 18 months for each patient|Budget impact analysis, Quantification of financial consequences of rolling out this kind of medical supportive care strategy throughout the health system., Up to 18 months for each patient
