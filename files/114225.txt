A Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of AGS-8M4 Given in Combination With Chemotherapy in Women With Ovarian Cancer
This is a parallel arm study to evaluate AGS-8M4 administered in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with ovarian cancer. AGS-8M4 will be administered as an IV infusion until disease worsens.

BIOLOGICAL: AGS-8M4|DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: carboplatin
Incidence of adverse events, Throughout the treatment
Assessment of PK variables, Treatment Arm A: Weeks 1 and 3 of each cycle. Treatment Arm B: Week 1 of each cycle. In addition, samples will be drawn at the Safety F/U, 2 Month F/U and 3 Month F/U visits.|Incidence of anti-AGS-8M4 antibody formation, Treatment Arm A: Day 1 of every other cycle and at Day 15 for the first cycle only. Treatment Arm B: Day 1 of every other cycle. In addition, samples will be drawn at the Safety F/U, 2 Month F/U and 3 Month F/U visits.|Changes in tumor status per RECIST, Treatment Arm A: Every 8 weeks. Treatment Arm B: Every 9 weeks.|Change in CA-125 levels, Treatment Arm A: Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle. Treatment Arm B: Day 1 of each cycle. In addition, samples will be drawn at the Safety F/U.
All Subjects will receive AGS-8M4 treatment. Subjects will be enrolled into 1 of 2 treatment arms according to their disease status. A disease assessment will be performed every 8 or 9 weeks (Â± 3 days) depending on the treatment arm assignment. The assessment will be based both on changes in clinical symptoms, and radiographic images. Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive treatment based on their original treatment assignment until disease progression or intolerability. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last dose infusion of AGS-8M4.
