After screening, participants will be assigned to the Dose Escalation, Dose Confirmation, Efficacy Expansion, or Coformulation Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase will evaluate available PK and safety data including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The Dose Confirmation Phase will gather additional safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy data of quavonlimab in combination with pembrolizumab, and will include first-line advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and second line (and beyond) advanced/metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The purpose of the Efficacy Expansion Phase is to gather preliminary anti-tumor efficacy data for quavonlimab in combination with pembrolizumab as well as for quavonlimab monotherapy in the specific target population of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) refractory melanoma. The Coformulation Phase will evaluate the safety and PK of a coformulated product of pembrolizumab/quavonlimab (MK-1308A) in comparison to that of the single, co-administered products given at the same dose and schedule, and include participants with advanced solid tumors and participants from mainland China.
