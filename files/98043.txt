Virtual Interactive 3D Modelling to Improve Outcomes in Robotic-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy
The primary objective is to determine if 3D modelling shortens total console operation time as a surrogate endpoint for clinical outcomes like perioperative complications and morbidity in robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy.
Kidney Tumor
PROCEDURE: partial kidney nephrectomy|DEVICE: DaVinci Robot|DEVICE: Innersight 3D software
Primary endpoint is the console operation time measured intra-op., Total console time is measured as time from starting the surgical procedure in the DaVinci console to ending the procedure in the console., intra-operative

3DPN is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled, two-armed, open trial to compare the 3D modelling with the 2D modelling in robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy. According to the randomisation the 3D or 2D modelling is used for patient information (before intervention) and for partial nephrectomy. A six-month follow-up visit is provided.
