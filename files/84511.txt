Correlation of Lung Ultrasonography With Chest CT Findings in Cancer Patients With COVID-19 Viral Pneumonia
Thoracic imaging, either with chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT), is an essential part of the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in patients admitted to hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms.

Inspite of the results of PCR tests are the gold standard, the sensitivity of CT for diagnosing COVID-19 is 97%. The specific epidemic contingency makes CT an accurate tool to stratify patients based on imaging patterns, predicting poor outcomes and the need for ventilation.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is widely used in emergency departments because it is broadly available, low-cost, and has a high accuracy for diagnosing pulmonary diseases.

Despite the diagnostic power of LUS and its influence on decision-making and therapeutic management, there are still significant barriers to the widespread use of this tool.

The advantages of LUS are more obvious in older patients with multimorbidity and restricted mobility, for whom high-quality CXR and CT scans are difficult to obtain. In the hands of experienced clinicians, LUS diagnostic accuracy for bacterial pneumonia is similar to chest CT.

However, a correlation between LUS and CT findings in patient urgently hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia remains to be determined.

COVID-19 leads to an aggressive inflammatory response that is actually the reaction of the immune system. Some patients exhibit pneumonia in both lungs, multi-organ failure, and even death. Individuals who have severe health conditions, like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and pulmonary diseases, are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection.

Also, this dysregulated immune response resulting in excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (as IL-1ra, IL-6, IP-10, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α and TNF) causes the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which is considered as pathologic underpinning for disease progression and lead to severe collateral tissue damage.

IL-6 may serve as a predictive biomarker for disease severity as its elevated levels were reported in several studies of COVID-19 infection. Also IL-6 levels were correlated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. IL-6 blockade is a promising strategy for COVID-induced CRS.

In particular, clinical epidemiological studies are needed to determine if IL-6 and/or other inflammatory cytokine levels predict subsequent development and persistence of long COVID 19 viral pneumonia.
