Patients with negative PET after salvage therapy. To assess prospectively the overall survival and progression-free, 3 years|Patients with positive PET after salvage therapy. Evaluate the role of allogeneic transplantation in these patients after salvage chemotherapy and compare the results with those obtained by 2 cycles of high dose chemotherapy with stem cell, 3 years
Evaluate the percentage of complete remission., 3 years|Evaluate the haematological toxicity and non-haematological (including acute and chronic GVHD, infections)., 3 years|Evaluation of the chimera., 3 years
This is a prospective observational study in which patients with positive PET scan after salvage therapy are candidates to a sequential scheme "auto-allotransplantation" in case of availability of a donor . In the event of unavailability of a donor , the same patients are candidates for a double high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support.
