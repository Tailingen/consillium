Multi Dimensional Precise Exploration of Immunoconsolidation Therapy for Locally Advanced NSCLC After Chemo-radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to carry out a prospective observational study in patients with locally advanced NSCLC receiving radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy and follow-up immune consolidation therapy. By detecting ctDNA and TILs of the patients, we explored the value of blood dynamic monitoring of ctDNA in patients with prognosis stratification and treatment effect, and explored the patients before and after concurrent chemoradiotherapy and immune consolidation therapy The characteristics of DNA, RNA, T cells and other biomarkers were correlated with the efficacy and prognosis.
NSCLC|Chemoradiotherapy|ctDNA
Correlation between ctDNA dynamic detection and 1-year PFS rate after chemoradiotherapy, The ctDNA dynamic detection will contain NGS test including mutations(both somatic and germline), copy number variations, gene fusions along with genetic interpretation for each and every mutation identified in each test(both blood and tissue) during the whole therapeutic process, Six months after consolidation treatment
PFS, Six months after consolidation treatment|OS, Six months after consolidation treatment
