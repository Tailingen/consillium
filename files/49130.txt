Blinatumomab as a Bridge to Allo-HSCT in HR BCP-ALL
To explore the efficacy and safty of Blinatumomab as a bridge to Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in High Risk Precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab|OTHER: Conventional therapy
Overall survival (OS), The time from randomization to death from any cause., From the 1st day to the 720th days after enrollment.
The proportion of patients with negative minimal residual disease (MRD), Negative MRD is defined as below 10-4 by flow cytometry., From the 1st day to the 720th days after enrollment.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), It is defined as the total survival of a patient after the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, until the tumor recurrence or death from any cause., From the 1st day to the 720th days after enrollment.|Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), From hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to recurrence, relapse-free death was considered a competing risk event., From the 1st day to the 720th days after enrollment.
High Risk Precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is a kind of leukemia with poor prognosis. Here, we want to explore the efficacy and safty of Blinatumomab as a bridge to Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in High Risk Precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
