Clinical Validation of An Optimized Multi-Target Stool DNA (Mt-sDNA 2.0) Test, for Colorectal Cancer Screening "BLUE-C"
The primary objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity for colorectal cancer (CRC) and specificity of the mt-sDNA 2.0 test.
Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: mt-sDNA 2.0 screening test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: FIT test|PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy
Sensitivity for CRC with the mt-sDNA 2.0 test, Through study completion, an average of 180 days|Specificity with the mt-sDNA 2.0 test, Through study completion, an average of 180 days
Sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions, Through study completion, an average of 180 days|Sensitivity for CRC compared to a commercially available fecal immunochemical test (FIT), Through study completion, an average of 180 days|Sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions compared to commercially available fecal immunochemical test (FIT)., Through study completion, an average of 180 days|Specificity for no colorectal neoplastic findings, Through study completion, an average of 180 days
Subjects 40 years of age and older scheduled for a screening colonoscopy will be enrolled. Subject will complete the mt-sDNA 2.0 test and the commercially available FIT, followed by completion of a screening colonoscopy. The results of the mt-sDNA screening test and FIT will not be provided to investigators for clinical management of the study subject. Personnel performing the colonoscopy and producing the resulting report and personnel performing histopathologial review of reports or tissue (if applicable) will remain blinded to the results of the mt-sDNA 2.0 screening test results.
