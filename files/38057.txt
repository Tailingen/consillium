Ischemic Heart Disease in Male With Prostate Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of the study: to increase the efficiency of diagnosis, treatment and prediction of the course of coronary heart disease in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland, depending on the hormonal status by determining the cardiovascular risk factors, factors of angiogenesis, structural and functional state of the heart, coronary vessels, kidney damage and their pharmacological correction.
