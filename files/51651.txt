PCSK9 Inhibitor and PD-1 Inhibitor in Patients With Metastatic, Refractory To Prior Anti PD-1 Non-small Cell Lung
PCSK9 mediates immune checkpoint blockade resistance by downregulating tumor cell surface MHC class 1 molecules. This study will evaluate if combining the anti-PCSK9 antibody alirocumab with the anti-PD-1 antibody cemiplimab can generate anti-tumor activity and clinical responses in patients with metastatic lung cancer who have progressed on first line immune checkpoint blockade therapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Alirocumab and Cemiplimab
Response rate associated with combination of alirocumab and cemiplimab, Ascertain the response rate associated with alirocumab and cemiplimab, with 95% confidence intervals. Response rate is defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a complete or partial response per RECIST 1.1 criteria. All patients who receive at least one dose of alirocumab and cemiplimab will be considered for the primary outcome analysis, Day 1 of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 110 weeks per RECIST 1.1
Safety and tolerability of the combination regimen, Toxicity analysis will be performed on a continual basis following CTC V 5.0 criteria, Day 1 of treatment until 30 days post last dose|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival will be assessed utilizing RECIST 1.1 criteria, Day 1 of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 110 weeks|Overall survival, Patients will be followed till death or off study due to any other reason, Day 1 of treatment until death or off study due to any other reason whichever comes first, assessed up to 110 weeks
