Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab Simultaneous Combination Study
The efficacy and safety of the use of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib.
Advanced Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) for best overall response (confirmation required) according to immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) and RECIST v1.1., 12 months
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), * Number of each AE of the worst grade occurring in this study was evaluated based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 and tabulated throughout all cycles. This study also includes a special note regarding abnormal laboratory values. When clinical signs and symptoms observed in this study were elicited, diagnosis and related data were collected based on whether they were due to abnormal laboratory values. Therefore, for example, grading results for liver dysfunction may differ between non-hematologic toxicities and laboratory values.
* Adverse-Events occurrences means "prevalence proportion" of any undesirable occurrence based on investigator's medical decision in this study., Basically 2 years, maximum 28 months|Objective Response Rate (irORR), Objective response rate (irORR) according to immune-related (ir) RECIST, 12 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), * 1 "Progression" will be PD based on diagnostic imaging according to overall response by RECIST v1.1. The day of the imaging test will be defined as the day of progression. When the treatment are discontinued due to clinical PD and diagnostic imaging can't be performed, the day of clinical PD will be defined as the day of progression.
* 2 Surviving patients, who are not assessed as progression will be censored on the last day when no progression is confirmed on imaging (last day of PFS confirmed)
* 3 For patients who died without being assessed as progression, whether to consider to be an "event on the day of death" or "censoring on the last day of PFS confirmed" should be decided at the time of data review performed prior to data fixation. In principle, they should be "an "event on the day of death" unless the period from the last day of PFS confirmed to the day of death is long., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), * The period will be from the day of enrollment, as the starting date of the computation, to the day of death of any cause. Surviving patients should be censored on the last day of PFS confirmed. Patients who are lost to follow up should be censored on the last day when their survival is confirmed before being lost to follow up.
* The protocol for this clinical trial stipulated that the observation period was "2 years from the date of registration of the last case." Meanwhile, OS was stipulated as "the period from the date of registration to the date of death from any cause. For surviving cases, the period was censored at the date of last confirmed survival." The observation period varied by case, with follow-up surveys lasting up to 28 months., 28 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR will be defined as the percentage of patients who achieved CR or PR, or Stable Disease (SD) for best overall response according to RECIST v1.1., 2 years
In this study, if combination therapy with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with gastric cancer is judged to be effective, a prospective treatment regimen can be expected for a larger number of participating subjects.

The anticipated disadvantages include any adverse events associated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. To minimize the risk and disadvantages of adverse events, the data center together with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will monitor any adverse events in the present trial to determine whether or not they are within the expected range. These bodies will also conduct a thorough examination in the event that serious or unexpected adverse events occur, and adopt an appropriate system to take any necessary actions.
