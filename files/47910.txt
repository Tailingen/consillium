Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cysts: Endoscopic Ultrasound With Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS/FNA), Direct Visualization, and Confocal Laser-induced Endomicroscopy-A Pilot Study
The purpose of this study is to assess the yield of combination modalities in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts using EUS/FNA, Fiber optics (direct visualization probe), and prototype needle based confocal laser-induced endomicroscopy miniprobe (nCLE).
Pancreatic Cysts
DEVICE: Direct visualization and needle based confocal laser-induced endomicroscopy miniprobe
Assess the yield of combination modalities in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts using EUS/FNA, Fiber optics (direct visualization probe), and prototype needle based confocal laser-induced endomicroscopy miniprobe (nCLE), Data will be analyzed descriptively to include patient characteristics, procedural variables, and outcomes., From the date of imaging until follow up for 6 months to two years.
