A Study to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of MOXR0916 and Atezolizumab (Also Known as MPDL3280A or Anti-PD-L1) in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase Ib, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the combination of MOXR0916 and atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable solid malignancy that has progressed after available standard therapy; or for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective or intolerable or is considered inappropriate; or for which a clinical trial of an investigational agent is a recognized standard of care. Participants will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage.
