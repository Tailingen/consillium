Investigating Cabozantinib in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study seeks to use Cabozantinib to treat those with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer who have not previously responded to treatment.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Oral Tablet: Cabozantinib
12-Week Progression Free Survival, A patient is classified as progression-free if s/he is assessed as not having progressive disease (PD) as defined per RECIST 1.1 criteria at either the 12-week assessment or after having at least 11 weeks of treatment for subjects without the 12-week assessment. Censored patients (i.e. those who have not progressed but who are missing a 12-week assessment) are not included in the analysis. Subjects who didn't have the 12-week assessment but who had clinical progression were included and considered to have progressed.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECISTv1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., This outcome was assessed at the 12-week assessment. Subjects without the 12-week assessment but who had at least 11 weeks of treatment were included.
12-Week Progression-Free Survival by RAS Mutation Status, This has the same outcome measure description as the primary analysis. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECISTv1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., This outcome was assessed at the 12-week assessment. Subjects without the 12-week assessment but who had at least 11 weeks of treatment were included.|12-Week Progression-Free Survival by PIK3CA Mutation Status, This has the same outcome measure description as the primary analysis. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECISTv1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., This outcome was assessed at the 12-week assessment. Subjects without the 12-week assessment but who had at least 11 weeks of treatment were included.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from administration of the initial dose of cabozantinib to evidence of radiographic progression as defined by RECIST criteria or death from any cause without evidence of disease progression, whichever occurs first.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECISTv1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by RAS Mutation Status, This has the same outcome measure description as the PFS analysis.

This is a phase II clinical trial that seeks to use Cabozantinib to treat those with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer who have not previously responded to treatment. This study is a two stage study that will first measure (up to) 16 patients' progression free survival (PFS). Stage two will, again, measure PFS, but in a population (up to) 28 patients.
