Carboplatin, Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM)
The purpose of this research study was to evaluate how effective the combination of Carboplatin, Bevacizumab (Avastin™) and, Pemetrexed (Alimta™) is in the treatment of patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). A combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed is considered standard for this disease and typically off protocol patients would receive cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed as standard of care.

The planned length of the study (first patient screened to last patient enrolled) was 24 months. The planned length of the entire study (enrollment period + the treatment period + a follow-up period of at least 12 months) was 36 months.
Mesothelioma
DRUG: Carboplatin, Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed
Number of Participants With Partial Response (PR) of Target Lesions, Tumor response was assessed in 12 patients who had at least one follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) definition of Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to 12 Months
Number of Months of Progression Free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., 2 Years, 9 Months
This was a planned Phase I/II dose escalation study. Patients were enrolled in a cohort of 3.

Eligible patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma received frontline treatment consisting of carboplatin AUC 5, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m\^2 every 21 days (Tier-1). Dose escalation continued to achieve a target dosage using carboplatin AUC 6 (Tier-2). After a maximum of 6 treatment cycles, non-progressing patients received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and pemetrexed every 21 days to complete 1-year total treatment duration.
