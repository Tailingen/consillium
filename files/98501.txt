Binaural Sound for Remimazolam Induction
It is important to decrease the time-to-loss of consciousness and anesthetics dose of remimazolam for general anesthesia induction. We will evaluate the effect of binaural sound for general anestheia induction using remimazolam infusion.
General Anesthesia|Prostate Cancer|Uterine Myoma
PROCEDURE: Binaural sound|PROCEDURE: Placebo
Remimazolam dose for no response to voice, Remimazolam dose for no response to voice will be measured at anesthesia day 0., At anesthesia day 0
Remimazolam dose for no eye lash reflex, Remimazolam dose for no eye lash reflex will be measured at anesthesia day 0., At anesthesia day 0|Remimazolam dose for patient state index 50, Remimazolam dose for patient state index 50 will be measured at anesthesia day 0., At anesthesia day 0|Anxiety level, Anxiety level will be evaluated using viosual analogue scale at anesthesia day 0 (at arrival of preanesthetic room and operating room)., At anesthesia day 0|Patient state index electroencephalography, Patient state index electroencephalography will be evaluated at anesthesia day 0, At anesthesia day 0
