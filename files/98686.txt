Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET for CRC Recurrence Detection in Elevated CEA
This single-center, phase II clinical trial investigates the diagnostic efficacy of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET scans in detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence during post-treatment surveillance, particularly in patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The study compares the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET with the conventional F-18-FDG PET scans, aiming to enhance recurrence detection in CRC patients who underwent curative surgery. Thirty participants will be enrolled and monitored through imaging studies and clinical follow-up.
Colorectal Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: Ga-68-FAPI-46
Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET for CRC Recurrence Detection, Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET in detecting colorectal cancer recurrence. Pathological results will be used as the reference standard where available, or clinical follow-up will be used in cases where tissue sampling is not feasible., Within 6 months of PET imaging.|Comparison of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET and FDG PET in CRC Recurrence Detection, Compare the diagnostic performance of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET and F-18-FDG PET in detecting colorectal cancer recurrence, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy., Within 6 months of PET imaging.
Clinical Impact of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET on Management Decisions, Evaluate the impact of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET imaging on clinical decision-making through a questionnaire completed by the principal investigator before and after receiving the PET results. The questionnaire assesses changes in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management., Immediately after completion of PET imaging and report review.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality, with a significant recurrence rate following curative surgery, particularly in stages II and III. Early detection of asymptomatic recurrence is critical for initiating salvage treatment. Serum CEA elevation is a marker for recurrence, necessitating advanced imaging tools for precise localization.

This study evaluates the use of Ga-68-FAPI-46, a novel imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed in the tumor stroma. Ga-68-FAPI-46 demonstrates higher tumor uptake and faster clearance from normal tissues compared to F-18-FDG, offering a potential diagnostic advantage. Participants will undergo both F-18-FDG PET and Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET scans, with lesion detection validated through pathology or clinical follow-up.

The trial aims to determine the diagnostic performance of Ga-68-FAPI-46 PET in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, using the McNemar test for statistical comparison. The study also emphasizes participant safety and data protection, adhering to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.
