Conversion From Fast Acting Oral Opioids to AbstralÂ®
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy when using a novel dose conversion strategy to switch from immediate release oral opioids to sublingual (SL) fentanyl (Abstral) for treatment of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP).
Pain
DRUG: SL fentanyl
Response rate in patients converted to SL fentanyl., A subject is defined as responder if the change of Pain Intensity (PI) on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) rated from 0 to 10, at 30 minutes (PID30) is similar or higher after the conversion to SL fentanyl compared to baseline PID30 as assessed by standard care rescue treatment of BTcP episodes., 30 minutes post dose
Responder rate in patients converted to SL fentanyl as assessed by the PID15., 15 minutes post dose|Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) Symptom Distress Score (SDS), 24 hour assessment on days with pain episodes|Patient's global assessment of treatment (patient satisfaction)., 2 occasions|Patients preference of treatment (baseline treatment/SL fentanyl)., end of study|Occurrence of AEs, withdrawals, during a maximum treatment period of 21 days.
The study aims to show that in the advanced stage of cancer the individual patient already on high doses of BTcP medication will benefit from starting treatment on a higher first dose of SL fentanyl thus reducing the number of dosing steps with insufficient pain relief.
