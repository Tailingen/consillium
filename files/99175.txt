Safety and Toxicity Study of Intravesical Instillation of TARA-002 in Adults with High-grade Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (Phase 1a)
This study is an open-label dose escalation study (Phase 1a) to investigate the safety and toxicity of intravesical treatment of high-grade NMIBC (HGTa or CIS, including CIS with concomitant Ta) after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and/or biopsy using TARA-002 in adults unable to obtain intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), adults who have received at least one dose of intravesical BCG or adults who have received at least one dose of intravesical chemotherapy. Dosing will start in subjects with HGTa or CIS (including CIS with concomitant Ta), and all subjects will receive 6 weeks of treatment at a fixed volume with varying dose levels.

BIOLOGICAL: TARA-002
Phase 1a, Dose Escalation Phase: Incidence of DLT AEs in subjects with HGTa or CIS NMIBC, DLT = dose limiting toxicities; HGTa = high grade Ta; CIS = carcinoma in situ, includes CIS with concomitant Ta, Day 1 to Day 43|Phase 1a, Dose Escalation Phase: MTD and RP2D of TARA-002 in subjects with HGTa or CIS NMIBC, MTD = maximum tolerated dose; RP2D = recommended Phase 2 dose, Day 1 to Day 43
