EUFURO - EUS-based Follow-Up on R0-resected Patients for Esophageal, Gastric and Pancreatic Cancer
Follow-up after successful operative treatment of cancer in the esophagus, stomach or pancreas in order to detect recurrent disease is a controversial topic.

This is because the methods and the consequence of following these patients is unknown.

Therefore the investigators will randomize these patients in to two groups:

1. One group of patients will be offered visits with a specialist surgeon in a outpatient setting for a clinical evaluation every 3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months after surgery, as is the current standard at our department.
2. The other group will be offered Endoscopic UltraSound, EUS, and PET/CT with the same intervals as the first group.
