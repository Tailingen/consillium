Safety and Efficacy of Intrathecally Administered Magnesium Sulfate
Magnesium sulfate safety profile has been documented by histopathological analysis in experimental studies. magnesium sulfate added to local anesthetics decrease postoperative opioid requirements.

change pain sensation using VAS scores, pain sensation using VAS scores with movement (0-10) 0=no pain 10=worst pain ever, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours post operative
change in MAP, Mean arterial pressure, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours post operative
Spinal anesthesia is commonly used for the major abdominal cancer surgery because of decreasing the risks of general anesthesia.The quality and duration of sensory and motor block and decrease post operative pain is important in the major abdominal cancer surgery and patient's content satisfaction. Opioids in high doses and other drug such as clonidine and neostigmine added to local anesthetics to this purpose, but significant side effects.

Magnesium sulfate block the N- methyle -D- aspartate (NMDA) channels in a voltage-dependent way to be improve the quality and duration of spinal block. However, the use of magnesium sulfate safety profile has been documented by histopathological analysis in experimental studies. Systemic delivery of magnesium sulfate decrease postoperative opioid requirements. In experimental studies, spinal injection of magnesium sulfate reduces the respond to painful stimulus in rats.
