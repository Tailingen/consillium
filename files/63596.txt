Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin and 5-FU for Gastric Cancer With Inoperable Malignant Bowel Obstruction
This is a multi-center, non-randomized, 3-cohort, phase II trial, evaluating a triplet combination of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil for gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and inoperable malignant bowel obstruction.

The primary study hypothesis is that the regimen will provide a clinically meaningful bowel obstruction clearance. This trial has 3 paralleled cohorts with the same experimental regimen: Cohort A (first-line therapy) will include 35 participants who have not received any palliative chemotherapy; Cohort B (second-line therapy) will include 22 participants who progress after the first-line therapy; Cohort C (third- or later-line therapy) plans to include 22 cases who have received two or more prior therapies for their metastatic disease.
