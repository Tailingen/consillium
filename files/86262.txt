Study of Aerobic Training for People Receiving Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
In this study, investigators will compare standard Aerobic Training/AT with adaptive Aerobic Training/AT. Standard AT will be a fixed (unchanging) amount of walking each week, while adaptive AT will adjust the level of exercise depending on participants' response to the exercise. Investigators will see how both study approaches (standard AT and adaptive AT) affect participants' CRF.
Breast Cancer|Breast Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Adaptive Aerobic Training/AT Dosing|BEHAVIORAL: Standard (fixed) Aerobic Training/AT dosing
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) response rate, The primary endpoint will be CRF response rate as assessed by the proportion of patients with a peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak; ml O2 .kg-1.min-1 ) change from baseline (T0) to T2 (\~32 weeks) of ≥3.50 ml O2 .kg-1.min-1 . A CRF change ≥3.50 ml O2 .kg-1.min-1 will be considered a response; a change \<3.50 ml O2 .kg-1.min-1 will be considered a non-response., 32 weeks from baseline
