Dovitinib in Combination With Imatinib in Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
The objective of this study is to determine the recommended dose of combination of dovitinib and imatinib in phase I study.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: dovitinib plus imatinib
Maximal tolerated dose and recommended dose, Initially three patients will be treated at each dose level. If one out of three patients experiences a DLT, three additional patients will be entered at that dose level. Dose escalation will be continued until DLTs are experienced in two or more out of six patients (more than 33% of patient cohort), which will be defined as the MTD.If more than 33% of patients experience a DLT in a dose level, one doe level below will be the RD, 3 years

combination of dovitinib and imatinib could lead to additive or synergistic effect in patients who had failure of standard TKI therapies including imatinib, sunitinib, and/or regorafenib. In this phase I-II study of dovitinib plus imatinib, we aim to determine a recommended dose of dovitinib plus imatinib and to evaluate the safety and activity of the combination at the recommended dose as a 3rd or more line of treatment in metastatic or unresectable GIST.
