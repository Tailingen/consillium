Respiratory Measurement Using Infrared Camera and Respiratory Volume Monitor (ExSpiron 1Xi) for Sedation in Patients Undergoing TURP/TURB Under Spinal Anesthesia
In patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, the investigators used an Infra-red camera and a respiratory volume monitor to determine the accuracy of the ventilation rate of the infra red camera by measuring the respiratory rate, ventilation volume, and ventilation volume with respiratory volume monitor.
