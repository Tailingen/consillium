This study was a first in human, open-label, multi-center phase I/II study which consisted of a phase I dose escalation part of BLZ945 as single agent, and of BLZ945 in combination with PDR001, where alternative dosing regimens of BLZ945 were evaluated. The escalation was guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for BLZ945 as single agent was established, a phase II part could commence, should signs of antitumor activity had been seen during the phase I. Once the MTD/RP2D for BLZ945 in combination with PDR001 was established, a phase II part could commence.

Phase I part of the study involved patients with advanced solid tumors, including patients with recurrent glioblastoma and patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and phase II part patients with relapsed or refractory glioblastoma.

A separate Japanese single agent dose escalation was performed in order to ensure that the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of BLZ945 single agent were adequately characterized in Japanese patients. The Japanese dose escalation for BLZ945 single agent run separately from the ongoing global dose escalation. No Japanese patients were enrolled in phase II part according to protocol. The enrollment of the Japanese cohort was halted per investigator letter, dated 18-Jun-2021.
