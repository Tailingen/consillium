Samsung Medical Center-Lymphoma Cohort Study-II
The purpose of this study is to establish a model which can predict the treatment outcome and the risk of treatment-related morbidity in patients with lymphoma.
Lymphoma
All cause mortality, Disease and non-disease-related mortality including treatment-related death, 5 years
Treatment response, Response to primary and salvage treatment Revised response criteria for lymphoma should be used (J Clin Oncol 2007;25(5):579-586).

Complete response: disappearance of all evidence of disease Partial response: regression of measurable disease and no new sites Stable disease: failure to attain CR/PR or PD Relapsed disease or Progressive disease: Any new lesion or increase by \>=50% of previously involved sites from nadir, 1 year|Rate of occurrence of toxicity, Infectious complications and other toxicities, 2 years from the start of the 1st therapy|Quality of life, Change of quality of life, 5 years|Biomarker development, Biomarkers associated with treatment outcome, 5 years
Although the cure rate of lymphoma has been increased due to the development of newer effective drugs, a substantial portion of patients is still suffered from relapse. Furthermore, the treatment-related morbidity is another factor which can make the treatment outcome worse in patients with lymphoma, especially elderly patients. Thus, this study is going to assess factors which may affect the treatment outcome and the risk of treatment-related morbidity.

1.Biologic factors associated with the aggressiveness of lymphoma

* molecular markers in serum, cytogenetic markers 2.Factors associated with the risk of treatment-related morbidity
* comorbidity, nutrition status, performance status, quality of life at diagnosis
