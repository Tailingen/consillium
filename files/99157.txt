Personalized Tumor Vaccine Strategy and PD-1 Blockade in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) has a number of effective standard of care therapies; however, FL is not currently considered curable. Therefore, designing well tolerated therapies without cumulative and long-term toxicity is critical. This is a pilot safety and feasibility study that combines a personalized tumor vaccine with nivolumab for the treatment of FL. Patients who demonstrate progression on this study may be treated with rituximab (or another monoclonal antibody against CD20) in addition to vaccine therapy with nivolumab at the discretion of treating physician if clinically indicated.
Follicular Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Personalized tumor vaccine|DRUG: Poly ICLC|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draws|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab|PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Feasibility and safety of vaccine in combination with nivolumab +/1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy as measured by the number of participants whose personal vaccines can be manufactured and delivered without unacceptable toxicity, -Unacceptable toxicity will be described as inability to receive further therapy due to toxicities of therapy as defined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 or the occurrence of other toxicities deemed to be at sufficiently high risk to patients by the principal investigator, Through 6 months following the first treatment of the last patient enrolled (approximately 54 months)
Overall response rate (ORR), * ORR = number of participants with complete response + number of participants with partial response
* Overall response rates will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)|Complete response (CR) rate, * CR rates will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment
* CR:

  * Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy.
  * London Deauville score of 1 and 2 in lymph nodes and extra lymphatic sites is considered to represent complete metabolic response. A London Deauville score 3 in the post treatment PET scan may be considered to represent complete metabolic response especially if it is not higher than the surrounding normal physiologic uptake.
  * No evidence of FDG avid disease in the bone marrow
  * No new lesions
  * If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy., Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)|Duration of response, * Duration of responses will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment
* Duration of response = time from first vaccine dose to first evidence of disease progression in participants with at least one response of CR, PR, or SD, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), * PFS will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment
* PFS: time from first CR, PR, or SD response to disease progression, death, or last follow-up
* PD:

  * London Deauville score of 4 or 5 in individual target nodes/masses with an increase in intensity of uptake from the baseline and/or new FDG avid foci consistent with lymphoma at interim or end of treatment assessment
  * New FDG avid foci of extranodal disease consistent with lymphoma. If there is concern regarding the etiology of the new lesions, biopsy or interval scan may be considered.
  * New or recurrent FDG avid foci in the bone marrow, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)|Overall survival (OS), * OS will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment
* OS: time from first vaccine dose to death or last follow-up, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)|Partial response (PR) rate, * Partial response rates will be compared between participants who received anti-CD20 mAb treatment (rituximab) versus those participants who did not receive anti-CD20 mAb treatment
* PR:

  * London Deauville score of 4 or 5 in lymph nodes and extra lymphatic sites with reduced uptake compared with the baseline and residual mass(es) of any size on interim scan
  * Residual bone marrow uptake higher than the uptake in the normal marrow but reduced when compared with baseline If there are persistent focal changes in the marrow in the context of a nodal response consideration should be given to further evaluation with MRI or biopsy or an interval scan
  * No new lesions, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (approximately 111 months)
