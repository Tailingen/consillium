a Clinical Research of CD19 and CD22 Targeted Prime CAR-T Cell in Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Lymphoma
This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22 targeted prime CAR-T cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory B Cell Lymphoma
B Cell Lymphoma

Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies.

There are patients who resisted anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or with CD19 negative relapse. To make further improvement, the investigators launch such a clinical trial using CD19 and CD22 targeted prime CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and refractory B Cell Lymphomato evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22 targeted prime CAR-T cell therapy.
