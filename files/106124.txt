Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Metastatic Kidney Cancer Being Treated With Sunitinib
Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a newer type of focused radiation therapy that precisely and accurately delivers high dose radiation to a tumour, while sparing much of the nearby normal organs. The use of stereotactic radiotherapy results in high rates of tumour destruction with minimal side effects which are very well tolerated. Often stereotactic radiotherapy has been used to try to cure patients who have an early stage cancer which has not spread, but there is less experience with using it in patients with cancer which has spread.

The purpose of this study is to measure how well stereotactic radiotherapy can destroy kidney cancer tumours which are no longer being controlled by Sunitinib and to measure how much longer such an approach will allow patients to stay on Sunitinib before needing to switch to another medication. Stereotactic radiotherapy will be used to treat only the growing tumours and then patients will continue with Sunitinib.

RADIATION: Stereotactic radiotherapy
To evaluate local control at one year of metastases treated with stereotactic radiotherapy in patients who present with oligo-progression while receiving first-line treatment with Sunitinib., Patients will have evidence of measurable metastatic kidney cancer according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. All progressing metastases sites will be amenable to stereotactic radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of local control will be defined as the absence of local failure in the irradiated site(s). Progressive enlargement will be defined as a 20% enlargement observed on two consecutive scans from baseline scan., 3 years
To evaluate progression free survival after stereotactic radiotherapy while continuing to receive first-line systemic therapy with Sunitinib., Progression free survival will be evaluated via disease assessments of radiology scans completed every three months from the time of stereotactic radiotherapy until progression is confirmed. Progressive disease will be defined as a 20% increase in RECIST 1.1 criteria measurements observed on two consecutive scans from the baseline scan., 3 years|To evaluate the acute and late toxicity to stereotactic radiotherapy., Acute and late toxicities to stereotactic radiotherapy will be assessed from adverse events, vital signs and by clinically significant changes in laboratory evaluations. Adverse events will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. These events will be followed until resolution or for a maximum of two years, which ever occurs first., 3 years
