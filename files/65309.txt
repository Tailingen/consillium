Primary Radiotherapy Versus Primary Surgery for HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer
The goal of this randomized treatment de-escalation study is to formally compare outcomes in HPV related oropharyngeal cancer tumors treated with a primary radiotherapy versus a primary surgical approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment options for a subsequent phase III trial

The goal of this randomized treatment de-escalation study is to formally compare outcomes in HPV related oropharyngeal cancer tumors treated with a primary radiotherapy versus a primary surgical approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment options for a subsequent phase III trial

The study will compare overall survival rates relative to historical controls for de-intensified primary radiotherapy \[60 GY +/- chemotherapy\] versus transoral surgery (TOS) and neck dissection \[+/- adjuvant 50Gy radiotherapy\] in patients with early T-stage HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and to compare quality of life (QOL) profiles.

The study will require a sample size of 140 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the two arms. Arm 1 (radiotherapy +/1 chemotherapy) and Arm 2 (TOS)

Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years
