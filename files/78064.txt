Screening of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Compensated Cirrhosis
Liver carcinoma is becoming the main complication of cirrhosis. Treatment of symptomatic or large tumors is disappointing. Regular ultrasonographic screening of small (curable) tumors is currently recommended, but the best periodicity is unknown.This randomized trial is aimed to compare 6-month (current recommendation) and 3-month ultrasonographic screenings.
Compensated Cirrhosis
PROCEDURE: Ultrasonographic screening
Incidence of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 6 months versus 3 months
Survival, during the study|Clinical value of serum alfa-fetoprotein assay, during the study
Patients: All consecutive patients with compensated HBV, HCV, alcohol or hemochromatosis-related cirrhosis (without any previous clinical complication including liver cancer).

Randomization: factorial: ultrasonography (3-month versus 6-month); serum alfa-fetoprotein assay (none versus 6-month).

End points: rate of small tumors (first main criteria); survival (second main criteria).
