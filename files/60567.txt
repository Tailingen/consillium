Study of PIK3CA Mutations and Effectiveness and Tolerability Outcomes of Alpelisib in Real-world
SPEAR is a non-interventional / observational, prospective, multicenter study planned to be conducted across \~ 30 sites in India, among HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC/MBC patients. This being a non-interventional study, no investigational drug or intervention will be administered as a part of the study participation. All the therapeutic decisions, as well as the type and timing of disease monitoring, laboratory tests or medical procedures will be at the discretion of the treating physician and upon patient's consent. No visits will be scheduled as a part of this non-interventional study, however, data by visits for variables will be collected for all the enrolled patients.

* HER2: Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, Baseline|PART A: Prior number of LoT for the advanced / metastatic disease, To identify the treatment patterns of prior therapies received for ABC/MBC, as available in the patient's medical record, prior number of Line of Therapy (LoT) for the advanced / metastatic disease will be collected, Baseline|PART A: Prior treatment type, To identify the treatment patterns of prior therapies received for ABC/MBC, as available in the patient's medical record, prior treatment type (hormone alone, hormone with targeted therapy (TT), chemotherapy, etc.) will be collected, Baseline|PART A: Prior treatment sequence by LoT, To identify the treatment patterns of prior therapies received for ABC/MBC, as available in the patient's medical record, prior treatment sequence by Line of Therapy (LoT) will be collected, Baseline|PART A: Time to next treatment, To identify the treatment patterns of prior therapies received for ABC/MBC, as available in the patient's medical record, time to next treatment will be collected.

Time to next treatment: defined as time gap between two Line of Therapy (LoT), as applicable, Baseline|PART A: Reason (s) for discontinuation of prior therapy, To identify the treatment patterns of prior therapies received for ABC/MBC, as available in the patient's medical record, reason (s) for discontinuation of prior therapy will be collected, Baseline|PART A: PIK3CA mutation positive patients not prescribed alpelisib, To identify the treatment patterns of prior therapies received for ABC/MBC, as available in the patient's medical record, PIK3CA mutation positive patients not prescribed alpelisib will be collected by reason, Baseline|PART B: Progression Free Survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1, Defined as the time from start of treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant (index date) to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment., Up to 24 months|PART B: Overall Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or partial response (PR) evaluated based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 24 months|PARTB: Duration of response (DoR) by RECIST 1.1, Calculated as the time from the date of the first documented Complete Response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST version 1.1., Up to 24 months|PART B: Tolerability of alpelisib plus fulvestrant measured by adverse events (AEs), Up to 24 months|PART B: Number of patients with laboratory abnormalities, The laboratory assessment will be recorded at baseline and during the study observation period based on changes in Grade of laboratory abnormality., Baseline, Up to 24 months
Overall, this study will have 2 parts (Part A and Part B). However, it is to be noted that, these parts (Part A and Part B) are independent of each other and can run in parallel. The purpose of the Part A of study is to determine the proportion of PIK3CA mutation positive patients among the HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC/MBC diagnosed patients in India. The Part B of the study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of alpelisib plus fulvestrant among men, pre-menopausal women (ovarian ablation) or post-menopausal women who are PIK3CA mutation positive patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC/MBC diagnosis among Indian population, in the real-world setting.

Part A- This will involve enrolling of approximately 1200 patients (males, post-menopausal women or pre-menopausal women who are receiving ovarian ablation) with a documented diagnosis of HR-positive HER2-negative ABC/MBC. The data on PIK3CA mutation status will be collected only for those patients who signs ICF for participation in the study. Once, patient signs ICF, their samples will be sent for PIK3CA mutation status testing, that will be performed at central laboratory and the results on mutation status will be reported to the investigator.

Part B- This part aims to enroll approximately 200 patients who are PIK3CA mutation positive. The patients enrolled into the Part B of the study can either be continued from Part A of the study or be a direct enrollment into the Part B of the study. For the patient's entering directly into Part B of the study, positive PIK3CA status should be available prior to study entry. All the patients entering into part B of the study must be alpelisib treatment naïve. The patients enrolled into Part B of the study, should have already been planned to receive treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant, based on their treating physician's discretion and upon patient's consent. The treatment decision by the physician are to be made independent of the patient's inclusion in this observational study. During the Part B of the study, data by visits for variables will be collected for the enrolled patients at every 3 months interval (±1 month), if feasible or until a maximum of 24 months observational period or lost to follow-up (End-of-study \[EoS\] assessment will be performed), or death, or disease progression, whichever occurs first.
