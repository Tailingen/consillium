Zometa for the Management of Tumor-induced Hypercalcemia and Malignant Bone Pain in the Community
Treatment in the home and hospice of long-term care facilities, particularly for non-ambulatory patients, could provide significant advantages for patients and for the region. The Calgary Health Region has a unique resource in the home parenteral therapy program (HPTP). With the assistance of HPTP, patients requiring bisphosphonate treatment for the management of tumor-induced hypercalcemia (TIH) or malignant bone pain (MBP) could be treated in the community (ie at home). However, the resources required and the costs associated with community-based (homes, hospices, long-term care facilities) treatment of TIH and MBP need to be identified and evaluated so as to guide future regional decision making.
