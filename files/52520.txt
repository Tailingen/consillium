A Study to Investigate APL-4098 Alone and/or in Combination With Azacitidine in R/R AML and High-Risk MDS
This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of APL-4098 alone and/or in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML and MDS-excess blasts (EB). Participants with the MDS-EB subtype will be eligible for the Phase 1 part of the study only.
