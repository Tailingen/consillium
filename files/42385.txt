Fludarabine in Combination With Daunorubicin and Cytarabine Liposome in Newly-diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
This phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fludarabine in combination with CPX-351 in patients with untreated AML. Patients will receive fludarabine and CPX-351 during Induction 1 and 2 as well as 2 cycles of consolidation therapy.

This is a phase 2, open label single arm study to look at the effectives and safety of fludarabine in combination with CPX-351 in patients with untreated AML. The rationale for this combination stems from data which indicated that pre-treatment of the THP-1 cell line with fludarabine for 4 hours prior to CPX-351 administration (Flu-CPX) significantly potentiated intracellular ara-CTP accumulation compared to CPX-351 alone. This suggests that fludarabine combined with CPX-351 may have efficacy against leukemic clones that would be resistant to CPX-351 or standard chemotherapy in first induction. It has been demonstrated that treatment with CPX-351 produces superior clinical outcomes in secondary AML likely due to its novel formulation, which results in sustained exposure of the cytotoxic agents cytarabine and daunorubicin in a synergistic 5:1 ratio within the plasma and bone marrow. Fludarabine can potentially improve upon the outcomes observed with CPX-351 monotherapy and 7+3 by enhancing intracellular ara-CTP accumulation from CPX-351. Patients will received fludarabine and CPX-351 for up to 2 cycles of induction and 2 cycles of consolidation.
