A Phase I Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of [225Ac]Ac-DOTATATE in Patients with SSTR+ GEP-Nets
This is a phase I study to assess the safety and efficacy of \[225Ac\]Ac-DOTATATE in patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic, progressive, Well-Differentiatedwell differentiated (G1/G2/G3 ), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with either no prior history of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT naive) or prior history of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (Previous PRRT).
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: [225Ac]Ac-DOTATATE
Safety and tolerability of 225Ac-DOTATATE, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0, 32 weeks following first 225Ac-DOTATATE injection|Recommended phase II dose of 225Ac-DOTATATE, Rate incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), First 56 days following first 225Ac-DOTATATE injection
ORR, ORR was calculated as the proportion of patients with tumour size reduction (sum of partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR)) and assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., 24 months after last dose administration|PFS, PFS will be defined as the number of days from the first dose of \[225Ac\]-DOTATATE to documented tumor progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause., 24 months after last dose administration|DoR, DoR was defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria for response (CR or PR) until the time of progression and assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., 24 months after last dose administration|TTP, TTP was defined as the time from randomization to progression assessed by investigator. It included patients who dropped out due to toxicity, but omitted patients who died without measured progression (censored to last follow-up date or death date)., 24 months after last dose administration|DCR, DCR is defined as the incidence of complete response, partial response and stable disease assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1., 24 months after last dose administration|12-month PFS Rate, 12-month Progression-Free Survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients whose time from enrollment to disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death exceeds 12 months., From date of enrollment until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes firstï¼Œassessed up to approximately 24 months
Whole body and organ uptake of [225Ac]Ac-DOTATATE, To estimate the absorbed doses of target organs and lesions., 8 weeks after the first dose administration
