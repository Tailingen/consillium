A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Anti-tumour Activity of Ascending Doses of Selumetinib in Combination With MEDI4736 and Selumetinib in Combination With MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of double and triple combination oral selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) plus intravenous (IV) MEDI4736 and oral selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 and IV tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours.

This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of double and triple combination oral selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) plus intravenous (IV) MEDI4736 and oral selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 and IV tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. The safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of ascending doses of Selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) in Combination with MEDI4736 and Selumetinib in Combination with MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab will be investigated. Once safety and tolerability have been established for the relevant dose, expansion cohorts will commence in order to further evaluate safety, tolerability, and provide a preliminary evaluation of the mechanism of action and anti-tumour activity of the drug combination. Mandatory paired biopsy expansion cohorts will be tumour-type specific. Expansion cohorts will open independently for double and triple combination treatments.
