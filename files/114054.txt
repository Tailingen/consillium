Ipilimumab With Nivolumab for Molecular-selected Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of 4 cycles of combinatory immunotherapy (ipilimumab and nivolumab), followed by monotherapy nivolumab in participants with immunogenic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant
BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Efficacy endpoint: DCR, For patients with RECIST1.1 evaluable disease this includes a change from baseline in tumour volume as measured by PR or CR by best ORR, or an SD, all lasting longer than 6mo, and the absence of clinical disease progression.

In patients without RECIST1.1 evaluable disease, disease control is defined by the absence of new measurable lesions and unequivocal PD of non-target lesions on CT scan, the absence of bone progression as defined by the PCWG3 criteria, and the absence of clinical disease progression, At inclusion, Weeks 7, 17, 29, and 41, and 30 days after last dose given at week 49
Safety endpoint: adverse effects, Percentage of Grade 3/4 and 5 treatment-related adverse effects, At inclusion, Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, and 49, and at end of treatment (typically at one year, or earlier when treatment is stopped prematurely)|Efficacy endpoint: ORR, Best objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST1.1 criteria (cohort A1 only), At inclusion, Weeks 7, 17, 29, and 41, and 30 days after last dose given at week 49|Efficacy endpoint: BRR, Biochemical response rate (BRR) at week 13 and maximal PSA decline according to PCWG3 criteria, BRR at Week 13, PSA at inclusion, Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49 and at end of treatment (typically one year, or earlier when treatment is stopped prematurely)|Efficacy endpoint: rPFS, Radiographic progression free survival per irRECIST1.1 immune-related response criteria, At inclusion, Weeks 7, 17, 29, and 41, and 30 days after last dose given at week 49|Efficacy endpoint: OS, Overall survival, Follow-up of 1 year following trial discontinuation (onwards from the 30-day safety follow-up visit).|Efficacy in the BRCA, CDK12 and MSI/hTMB subgroups, DCR, ORR, BRR, rPFS and OS per subgroup, At inclusion, Weeks 7, 17, 29, and 41, and 30 days after last dose given at week 49|Efficacy in the subgroup of patients with prior RT, DCR, ORR, BRR, rPFS and OS in patients with and without prior radiotherapy, At inclusion, Weeks 7, 17, 29, and 41, and 30 days after last dose given at week 49
Translational endpoint: biomarkers, To further optimize and validate predictive and early response immunogenic signatures from biomarkers in tissue and blood, associating with an objective response and disease control (DCR) of at least 6 months., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Following molecular characterization (next-generation sequencing) a total of 75 mCRPC patients with a putative immunogenic subtype will be included within the phase 2 INSPIRE trial. As treatment we will be utilizing a combinatory regimen of nivolumab 3mg/kg and ipilimumab 1mg/kg for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 480mg flat dose for up to one year. All participants will additionally undergo an on-trial metastatic tissue biopsy. Translational research will study immunological correlates and in-depth genomic/transcriptomic and multispectral immunohistochemical analyses of immune infiltrate.
