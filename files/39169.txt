A Dose Escalation Study of MLN7243 (TAK-243) in Adult Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability (establish maximum tolerated dose \[MTD\], inform the recommended phase 2 dose \[RP2D\], and identify the dose-limiting toxicities \[DLTs\]) of MLN7243.

H-score was a composite score that comprised of intensity and percentage of staining and was used for assessing the amount of protein or phospho-protein present in a biopsy sample. The composite score obtained by H-score is derived by summing the percentages of cell staining at each intensity multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0, 1+, 2+, 3+; where 3+ indicates the strongest staining, 2+ indicates medium staining, 1+ indicates weak staining, and 0 indicates no staining). The composite H-score ranges from 0 to 300, with a score of 0 representing the absence of any of the target protein and an H-score of 300 representing maximum staining and intensity of the target protein., Baseline and Cycle 1 Day 12|Change From Baseline in IHC Biomarkers in Tumor Biopsies at C1D12 as Assessed by Positive Index, The pharmacodynamics IHC biomarkers included polyubiquitin marker and Ub-histone H2B marker. Positive index was calculated by taking the number of positive cells over the total number of cells., Baseline and Cycle 1 Day 12|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response, Best overall response for participant is best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target and non target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum of diameter. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference smallest sum of diameter; PD: at least 20% increase in sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference, smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is smallest on study). In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least mm. The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression., Baseline up to end of study (approximately 7 months)|Duration of Response, Duration of any response (CR or PR) was defined as the time (in both days and months) from the date of first documented response per the investigator response assessment to the date of first progressive disease after the first documented response or, if the participant discontinues treatment, the date of last disease assessment as per RECIST version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target and non target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum of diameter., Baseline up to end of study (approximately 7 months)
