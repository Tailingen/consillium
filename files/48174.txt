Study of TGF-Î² Receptor Inhibitor Galunisertib (LY2157299) and Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to compare the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with enzalutamide in combination with LY2157299 (Arm 1) versus enzalutamide alone (Arm 2).
