In this phase â…¡, open-label, single arm, multicenter study, efficacy and safety of oral X-396 capsule (Ensartinib) in 37 Chinese ALK-positive NSCLC patients with brain metastases will be assessed. Eligible patients will receive 225mg X-396 capsules once daily and objective responses of brain metastasis based on investigator assessment according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) are primary outcome measures.
