DNA Methylation and the Increased Risk of Cervical Cancer Development
This study aims to investigate the correlation between reproductive tract microbiota and DNA methylation in cervical epithelial cells, as well as its impact on the development of cervical cancer, through a paired case-control clinical study

Changes in DNA methylation of cervical epithelial cells, Changes in DNA methylation of cervical epithelial cells, Baseline (enrollment period)
Cervical lesions (including different stages of development: normal, CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and cervical cancer), and sexually transmitted pathogens, Cervical lesions (including different stages of development: normal, CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and cervical cancer), and sexually transmitted pathogens., Baseline (enrollment period)
This study is a multicenter matched case-control study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified by collecting HPV test results, TCT examination results, and for the case group, participants' histopathological results are also collected. Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria have their HPV DNA test original secretion samples and TCT examination original cervical scrape cell samples (preserved in RNA preservative solution) collected. Enrollment involves dividing the samples into a discovery cohort of 800 cases and a validation cohort of 1200 cases. The discovery cohort undergoes multi-target DNA methylation testing, STDs pathogen testing, HPV E6/E7 testing, and metagenomic sequencing; the validation cohort undergoes PCR validation of DNA methylation sites related to cervical cancer, STDs pathogen testing, HPV E6/E7 testing, and metagenomic sequencing
