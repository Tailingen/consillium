The Safety and Efficacy of SNC-109 CAR-T Cells Therapy the Recurrent Glioblastoma
This is a single arm clinical study to estimate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of Chimeric Antigen Receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T) SNC-109 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (r-GBM) and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness, the immunogenicity of the product, as well as their correlation between the changes of cytokines from baseline level after cellular infusion.

It is planned to recruit about 16 patients with rGBM subjects. The protocol consists of screening period, Lymphocytes apheresis period, Operation period, pre-infusion evaluation (-2\~-1 days), infusion (day 0), infusion observation (day 1-post infusion), and follow-up period (last infusion-720 days). The incidence of dose limitation toxicity (DLT) will be observed within 28 days after the first infusion. Subjects in this study will receive multiple infusions, starting with 2Ã—104 CAR+ T cells/dose in the first subject, and the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate the subsequent dosing regimen, dose, infusion interval, and number of treatment cycles. Subsequent subjects will be evaluated by the SRC on the basis of available PK and safety data, and the SRC will determine the dosing regimen, dose, infusion interval and number of treatment cycles based on observed evidences.
