Development of an Educational Patient Decision Aid (Treatments in Advanced Cancer - Decision Aid, TA-DA) to Promote Shared Decision Making for Third-line or Beyond Palliative Systemic Therapy
To develop an educational patient decision aid for advanced cancer patients to prepare them to have conversations with their clinicians about treatment options (Treatments in Advanced cancer - Decision Aid, TA-DA).

Primary Objectives:

The study objective is to develop an educational patient DA (Treatments in Advanced cancer - Decision Aid, TA-DA) to assist patients, their caregivers, and clinicians to make an informed decision about third-line or beyond palliative systemic therapy for advanced cancer. To fulfill the study's objectives, we will complete 3 study parts:

Using qualitative methods, explore the decision-making needs of patients with advanced cancer, their caregivers, and clinicians, about third-line or beyond palliative systemic therapy; identify initial preferences and recommendations to inform the design of the educational patient DA in Part II.

Following a user-centered design approach, develop and measure the acceptability of an educational patient DA to promote shared decision making among patients with advanced cancer, their caregivers, and clinicians, about third-line or beyond palliative systemic therapy.

Conduct a pilot RCT to estimate the effect of the educational patient DA (TA-DA) on patient's knowledge of their treatment options.

Secondary Objectives:

Examine the impact of the educational patient DA (TA-DA) on patients' illness understanding (Prigerson's items), preparation for decision making (PrepDM Scale), decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale \[DCS\]), quality of the shared decision-making process (SDM Process Scale), decisional regret (decisional regret scale), therapeutic alliance (The Human Connection Scale \[THC\]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 \[GAD-7\]), final treatment choice, and end-of-life care outcomes (e.g., systemic therapy use in last month of life).

Examine the impact of the educational patient DA (TA-DA) on caregivers' knowledge of the patient's treatment options, illness understanding (Prigerson's items), preparation for decision making (PrepDM Scale), decisional conflict (DCS), quality of the shared decision- making process (SDM Process Scale), therapeutic alliance (THC Scale), and anxiety (GAD-7).

Examine the acceptability (Ottawa Acceptability Scale) of the educational patient DA (TA-DA) among patients, caregivers, and oncologists in the educational patient DA group. Examine the acceptability (modified Acceptability of Intervention Measure \[AIM\]), appropriateness (Intervention Appropriateness Measure \[IAM\]), and feasibility (Feasibility of Intervention Measure \[FIM\]) of the educational patient DA (TA-DA) among clinicians in the educational patient DA group.

Exploratory Objective:

2.3.1. (Part III) Examine the impact of the educational patient DA (TA-DA) on the concordance between patient-caregiver dyads for knowledge of the patient's treatment options, illness understanding (Prigerson's items), preparation for decision making (PrepDM Scale), decisional conflict (DCS), quality of the shared decision-making process (SDM Process Scale), therapeutic alliance (THC Scale), and anxiety (GAD-7).
