Analysis of Expression of Specific Markers in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive disease with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, new approaches to treat this type of cancer are needed with immunotherapy potentially being one of these. As a first step in the development of novel therapies, expression analysis of specific markers, including tumor antigens will be carried out. This will be done retrospectively using available hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples.

OTHER: Retrospective analysis of already archived samples
This study will also analyze whether this gene-expression signature is present in matched cirrhotic tissue and the interface tissue with the tumor., At the time of analysis.|Proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma cancer patients whose tumor tissue -expresses any one or more of specific target antigens -overexpresses c-MET -expresses a pre-defied gene-expression signature, At the time of analysis.
