A Clinical Study Comparing Chemotherapy Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Cervical Cancer Patients With Positive Lymph Nodes After Surgery: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
This study aims to conduct a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial targeting patients with cervical cancer who have been pathologically confirmed to have lymph node metastasis after surgery. The study will proceed as follows:

Patients who have undergone cervical cancer surgery and have been pathologically confirmed to have positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes will be selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Their clinical and pathological data will be collected. These patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two groups: the chemotherapy-immunotherapy (chemo-immunotherapy) group and the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group.

The study will compare the two treatment strategies by evaluating tumors' 3-year recurrence rate, distant metastasis rate, and overall survival prognosis in patients. The primary endpoints are the 3-year recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate. Secondary endpoints include the 3-year local recurrence rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Additionally, the study will assess differences in complications, toxic side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and quality of life between the two groups to determine the value of chemo-immunotherapy in treating this patient population.

In addition, biological tissue samples from 50 patients in the chemo-immunotherapy cohort will be collected for multi-omics analysis and detection of immune-related biomarkers. Using bioinformatics methods, the study will analyze the differences in cellular immune subtypes and immune-related biomarkers between patients who benefit from the treatment and those who do not. This analysis aims to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in patients with postoperative lymph node metastasis after cervical cancer surgery and to identify biomarkers and immune markers associated with treatment benefits.
