Study of Dalpiciclib Isethionate Plus Pyrotinib Maleate in the Treatment of Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of dalpiciclib combined with pyrotinib as second-line therapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Dalpiciclib + Pyrotinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects in the analysis population who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., an expected average of 24 months
Overall Survival（OS）, Time from initial treatment to the subject's death. At the end of the study, if the subject is still alive, the last known date of survival of the subject will be the date of deletion., an expected average of 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from initial treatment to first radiographic disease progression (RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death, whichever occurs first., an expected average of 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects in the analysis population who achieved complete response (CR) , partial response (PR) or stable disease(SD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., an expected average of 24 months|Adverse events, The incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) were determined according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria., an expected average of 24 months
Correlations between biomarkers and clinical activity, tumor biopsies are collected before start of treatment, for assessing the relationship between different biomarkers with Dalpiciclib and Pyrotinib regimens., an expected average of 24 months
The incidence of esophageal cancer is ranked seventh in the world, and the mortality rate ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. The investigators designed a single-arm, phase II clinical trial of dalpiciclib combined with pyrotinib as second-line therapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
