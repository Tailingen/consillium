Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography to Assess Radiation Therapy in Liver Cancer Patients
This is a pilot study that uses a standard of care technique, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), in combination with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (DCE-CT) to determine if perfusion changes from SBRT of liver cancer may be used for outcome assessment and prediction of prognosis.

DCE-CT Perfusion Metrics: K-Trans, Determine the association between the delivered radiation therapy dose distribution and the change in perfusion measurement through K-Trans (extraction-flow product) as shown through DCE-CT imaging., Baseline to end of follow-up, up to 12 weeks|DCE-CT Perfusion Metrics: Blood Volume, Determine the association between the delivered radiation therapy dose distribution and the change in perfusion measurement through blood volume as shown through DCE-CT imaging., Baseline to end of follow-up, up to 12 weeks|DCE-CT Perfusion Metrics: Blood Flow, Determine the association between the delivered radiation therapy dose distribution and the change in perfusion measurement through blood flow as shown through DCE-CT imaging., Baseline to end of follow-up, up to 12 weeks
Correlation Between Patient Demographics and K-Trans: Age, Stratify K-Trans results by age to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and K-Trans: Sex, Stratify K-Trans results by sex to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and K-Trans: Race, Stratify K-Trans results by race to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and K-Trans: Clinical Stage of Disease, Stratify K-Trans results by clinical stage at diagnosis to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Volume: Age, Stratify blood volume results age to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Volume: Sex, Stratify blood volume results sex to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Volume: Race, Stratify blood volume results race to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Volume: Clinical Stage of Disease, Stratify blood volume results by clinical stage at diagnosis to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Flow: Age, Stratify blood flow results age to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Flow: Sex, Stratify blood flow results sex to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Flow: Race, Stratify blood flow results race to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months|Correlation Between Patient Demographics and Blood Flow: Clinical Stage of Disease, Stratify blood flow results by clinical stage at diagnosis to determine correlation of DCE-CT imaging results compared to patient demographics, Post follow-up to end of study, up to 12 months
Patients will undergo standard of care SBRT while also receiving DCE-CT, also known as perfusion CT, pre-treatment, 6 hours post-treatment and 6 weeks post-treatment.
