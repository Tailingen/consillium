Pilot Study of 18F-FLT PET
Fractionated radiotherapy induces an observable change in the proliferative activity as assessed by pre-treatment and early-treatment 18F-FLT PET imaging. This study is designed to investigate 18F-FLT as a PET imaging agent for predicting treatment effectiveness in several tumors and will serve as a pilot study to a planned PO1 submission
