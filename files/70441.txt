Standard Chemotherapy With of Without Axitinib in Malignant Mesothelioma
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of axitinib, a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, on tissue and clinical outcome in combination with chemotherapy given to patients with mesothelioma
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
BIOLOGICAL: axitinib|DRUG: chemotherapy
To test the impact of the addition of axitinib to standaard chemotherapy treatment on histology samples, To determine the effects of the addition of axitinib to standard chemotherapy on tissue samples with respect to micro-vessel density (MVD); expression of VEGF-Receptor; PDGF receptor expression; extent of necrosis and apoptosis, micro-vessel density;expression of VEGF and PDGF receptor; extent of necrosis and apoptosis
the side effects of the standard chemotherapy and the additional risks related to axitinib use, hypertension, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, AE;SAE;SUSAR
To determine the effects of the addition of axitinib to standard chemotherapy on tissue samples with respect to micro-vessel density (MVD): expression of VEGF-Receptor; PDGF receptor expression; extent of necrosis and apoptosis.

To determine the safety of the addition of axitinib (to a maximum of the recommended dose of maximally 2 x 10 mg per day) to the standard treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed.

To determine the feasibility of performing a (second) thoracoscopy after 10 weeks of the combination treatment with cisplatin, pemetrexed and axitinib.

Serum samples will be collected and tested for inhibiting effects in a tube formation and spheroid sprouting assay.
