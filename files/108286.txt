Fruquintinib in the Cross-line Treatment of Refractory mCRC
This is a real-world study. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed (PD) after third-line treatment with fruquintinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors will receive fruquintinib combined with TAS-102 as fourth-line therapy. The objective of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of cross-line（from third to fourth line）treatment with fruquinitinib.
Fruquintinib|Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib+PD-1 inhibitors|DRUG: Fruquintinib+TAS-102
Overall survival 2(OS2), Overall survival (OS) of fourth-line treatment of mCRC with fruquinitinib and TAS-102, From the date of first fruquinitinib combined with TAS-102 treatment until the date of first documented date of death from any cause , assessed up to 12 months
Objective response rate 2(ORR2, investigator based on RECIST1.1), Objective response rate (ORR) of fourth-line treatment of mCRC with fruquinitinib and TAS-102, from received fruquinitinib combined with TAS-102 to one year|Progression-free survival 2(PFS2, investigators based on RECIST1.1), Progression-free survival (PFS) of fourth-line treatment of mCRC with fruquinitinib and TAS-102, From the date of first fruquinitinib combined with TAS-102 treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months|Disease control rate 2 (DCR2, investigators based on RECIST1.1), Disease control rate (DCR) of fourth-line treatment of mCRC with fruquinitinib and TAS-102, from received fruquinitinib combined with TAS-102 to one year
This is a real-world study. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer confirmed by histopathology had previously received 2-line system therapy with fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, anti-VEGF, anti-EGFR (RAS and BRAF wild type) (treatment with anti-VEGF-TKI is not allowed), and had received fruquinitinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors for third-line treatment. After progression (PD) (confirmed by RECIST 1.1 ), fruquinitinib combined with TAS-102 as fourth-line therapy was received. The primary endpoint was observation the overall survival (OS) of fourth-line treatment of mCRC with fruquinitinib and TAS-102. The study objective is to explore the possibility of cross-line rechallenge of fruquinitinib.
