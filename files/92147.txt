A Phase I/II Clinical Study of SAF-189s in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients
The study comprises two phases: phase I dose escalation (including PK run-in period and treatment period) and phase II study.

This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label dose-finding phase I/II study to determine the MTD and RP2D of oral foritinib succinate monotherapy in patients with advanced ALK-positive malignant solid tumor, and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK characteristics of SAF-189s in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Phase II clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, tumor activity, and safety of remitinib succinate in patients with ALK/ROS1 positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and to preliminary evaluate the population pharmacokinetic characteristics of remitinib succinate.

This study consisted of two phases: phase I (including PK induction and continuous administration) and phase II, Phase I dose escalation : the patients with advanced ALK-positive malignant solid tumor who have progressed on standard therapies; Phase I study: histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced ALK-positive and/or metastatic stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who have progressed on standard therapy; Phase II Study Part I: Patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed ALK or ROS1 positive locally-advanced and/or metastatic stage IIIb \~IV NSCLC;Patients who had not previously received or had received only one ALK/ROS1 inhibitor for disease progression or intolerance, and who had no more than 3 previous treatment lines overall Phase II Study Part Ⅱ: cohort1：ROS1-positive locally advanced and/or metastatic stage IIIB\~IV NSCLC patients diagnosed histologically and/or cytologically, with no prior systemic therapy or only one line of non-ROS1-inhibitor treatment cohort 2: patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed ROS1-positive locally advanced and/or metastatic stage IIIb \~IV NSCLC who had previously only received crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor for disease progression or intolerance and had no more than 3 overall previous treatment lines；
