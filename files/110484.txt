Clinical Study of Autologous Natural Killer Cells in Multiple Myeloma
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a lethal disease and at present no available treatment method seems to prevent the disease from progressing or relapsing in the long term. NK cells have a relatively high cytotoxic capacity and an anti tumour effect, suggesting a potential as a treatment of MM.This is a phase I, first-in-human, therapeutic exploratory study, where no benefits for the patients can be guaranteed. However, the theoretical implication is that the infused cells may have a positive antitumour effect for the participating individuals.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: autologous NK cells
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events/serious adverse events (TEAEs/SEAS)(including IARS). TEAEs are defined as AEs that develop, worsen (according to the Investigators opinion), or bedome serious during the treatment period., From first dose of study treatment up until six months from last infusion.
