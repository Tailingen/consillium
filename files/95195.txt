An Efficacy and Safety Study of Decitabine (DACOGEN) Plus Talacotuzumab (JNJ-56022473; Anti CD123) Versus Decitabine (DACOGEN) Alone in Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Ineligible for Intensive Chemotherapy
The primary objective of study Part A is to assess the safety of talacotuzumab (formerly CSL362) monotherapy and confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for whom experimental therapy is appropriate. The primary objective of study Part B are to assess complete response (CR) rate and overall survival (OS) in participants with AML who are not eligible for intense induction chemotherapy and who are randomly assigned to receive decitabine plus talacotuzumab at the RP2D or decitabine alone.

This endpoint is reported here for Part B only as per the planned analysis., Approximately up to 2.5 years|Part B: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) Plus Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Complete Response With Incomplete Recovery (CRi), Percentage of participants who achieved CR plus MRD-negative CRi were reported.

This endpoint is reported here for Part B only as per the planned analysis., Approximately 2.5 years|Part B: Time to Best Response, Time to best response is calculated as the time from the randomization date to the first documented date for the best response for participants who achieved CR or CRi, as per modified IWG criteria. CR: Bone marrow blasts less than (\<)5 %; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count greater than (\>)1.0 \*10\^9/liter (L) (1000/mcL); platelet count \>100\*10\^9/L (100 000/mcL); independence of red cell transfusions; CRi: Bone marrow blasts \<5 %; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; residual neutropenia \<1.0\*10\^9/L (1000/mcL) or thrombocytopenia \<100\*10\^9/L (100 000/mcL); independence of red cell transfusions.

This is a 2-part, open-label, multicenter, Phase 2/3 study conducted in participants with AML who are suitable for experimental therapy (Part A) and in participants with untreated AML who are not eligible for intense induction chemotherapy or hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Part B). In Study Part A, the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile will be assessed to confirm the RP2D of 9 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) talacotuzumab. In Study Part B, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either decitabine + talacotuzumab (arm 1) or decitabine alone (arm 2). Blood and bone marrow sampling will be done in Part A and B for disease assessment, PK, PD, and biomarkers will be collected in all participants. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
