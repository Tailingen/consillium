Colorectal Cancer|ERAS
PROCEDURE: Hyper-ERAS Program
30-day overall complication rate, The primary endpoint was the 30-day overall complication rate., 30 days after surgery
Severe complications (CD≥IIIb) rate, within 30 days after surgery, Severe complications (CD≥IIIb) rate, 30 days after surgery|The rehospitalization rate within 30 days after surgery, 30 days after surgery
The Hype-ERAS protocol includes preoperative education, intraoperative quality control, postoperative preventive analgesia, early ambulation, early recovery of diet, early removal of drainage tube, urinary catheter, and gastric tube, discharge within 48 hours after surgery, and standardized follow-up outside the hospital. Patients treated with the Hyper-ERAS rehabilitation protocol and discharged within 48 hours were in group A. Patients who were treated with Hyper-ERAS protocol and had a postoperative hospital stay of more than 48 hours were classified as group B. Patients eligible but not treated with the Hyper-ERAS rehabilitation protocol during the same period were in group C (Control group). The postoperative recovery of each group was compared to explore the safety and efficacy of Hyper-ERAS rehabilitation program in patients with colorectal cancer.
