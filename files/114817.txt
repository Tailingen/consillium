S0216, Combination Chemotherapy and RT in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: fluorouracil|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the overall survival of patients with stage III or IV squamous cell head and neck cancer treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil followed by accelerated fractionation/concomitant boost radiotherapy and cisplatin.
* Determine the unconfirmed complete response rate in these patients after treatment with induction chemotherapy.
* Determine the overall complete response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE:

* Induction Chemotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
* Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 3-4 weeks after administration of the second course of induction chemotherapy, patients receive accelerated fractionation radiotherapy once daily, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks with concomitant boost radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for the last 2.5 weeks of radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22.

Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
