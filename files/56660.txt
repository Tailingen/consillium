Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Blood sampling|PROCEDURE: Tumor sampling|OTHER: Stool sampling
Feasibility of the analysis of different blood-borne tumor biomarkers, Success rate of the tested detection techniques. The success rate of a given detection technique is calculated by the ratio " detection success " / " number of screened patients "., 18 months
Correlation with biological and clinical data, Number of biological analysis results correlated to clinical data. Establishment of a proof of concept, 18 months
Exploratory multi-cohort study including different types of cancer (different organs and/or different histological types).

Each kind of blood-borne biological markers analyses corresponds to a cohort.
