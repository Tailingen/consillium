Laparoscopic Myomectomy Using Barbed or Conventional Sutures
The aim of this study is to compare operative data and early postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic myomectomy using barbed sutures with those of laparoscopic myomectomy using conventional sutures .
Fibroid
PROCEDURE: myomectomy using barbed sutures|PROCEDURE: myomectomy using conventional sutures
Operative time, During myomectomy operation
Suturing time of myoma bed, During myomectomy operation
• Till now , there is only one small randomized controllrd study (n=22 in each arm) which compared the use of barbed suture with conventional suture in laparoscopic myomectomy .The myoma bed was closed with either conventional polyglactin suture or unidirectional barbed suture . The operative time was shorter in the barbed suture group (73.3 ± 21.4 min Vs. 80.7 ± 18.6 min) but this difference failed to reach statistical significance because of small sample size . However, the time required to suture the myoma beds was significantly lower in the barbed suture group .
