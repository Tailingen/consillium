Open Label Study of Sargramostim Among Patients Receiving Myelosuppressive Induction Chemotherapy for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
Primary Objective:

Measure the proportion of patients who develop binding and neutralizing antibodies in the blood after treatment with sargramostim following induction/reinduction chemotherapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* Assess the time after treatment at which the antibodies develop and the level of antibodies is measured after the first dose.
* Measure the levels of immunoglobulin protein.
* Assess the impact of any immune response on safety and the duration of low white blood cell count.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia NOS
DRUG: sargramostim GZ402664
Proportion of patients who develop antibodies (binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies), 1 month after 1st dose of sargramostim|Proportion of patients who develop antibodies (binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies), 2 months after 1st dose of sargramostim|Proportion of patients who develop antibodies (binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies), 3 months after 1st dose of sargramostim|Proportion of patients who develop antibodies (binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies), 6 months after 1st dose of sargramostim. If positive at month 6, this will be continued every 6 months until the values return to baseline or up to 24 months

If antibodies are positive at month 6, the level of immunoglubolins will be assesed every 6 months until the antibodies level return to baseline or up to 24 months|Proportion of patients with adverse events, Up to 24 months|Duration of neutropenia (time from initiation of sargramostim to recovery of ANC to â‰¥1500/mm^3), Up to 42 days after first day of sargramostim administration
The total study duration for a participant is up to 6 months from 1st dose of sargramostim or until the antibodies level return to baseline or up to 24 months if antibodies test is positive at month 6.
