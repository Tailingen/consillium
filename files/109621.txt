Nanatinostat Plus Valganciclovir in Advanced EBV+ Solid Tumors and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in EBV+ RM-NPC
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nanatinostat in combination with valganciclovir in patients with relapsed/refractory EBV-positive solid tumors and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma

This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 study evaluating nanatinostat in combination with valganciclovir alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Nanatinostat is a selective class I HDAC inhibitor which induces EBV early lytic phase protein generation, activating (val)ganciclovir to its cytotoxic form.

The Phase 1b dose escalation portion is designed to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with EBV+ RM-NPC followed by a Project Optimus \| FDA (https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/project-optimus) cohort to confirm the RP2D. Up to 60 patients with EBV+ RM-NPC will be randomized 1:1 to receive nanatinostat in combination with valganciclovir at the confirmed RP2D with or without pembrolizumab to evaluate safety, overall response rate, and potential pharmacodynamic markers in the Phase 2 dose expansion part of the study. Additionally, patients with other EBV+ solid tumors will be enrolled to receive nanatinostat in combination with valganciclovir at the RP2D in a Phase 1b cohort.

The study was prematurely terminated after the end of Phase 1b and did not proceed to Phase 2.
