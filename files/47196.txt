Rituximab,Methotrexate and Lenalidomide in Newly Diagnosed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
It is a single arm, multicenter, phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety study of R2-MTX chemotherapy（Lenalidomide, Rituximab and Methotrexate）as first-line regimens in the treatment of newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma. Objective response rate is the primary endpoint.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Methotrexate
Objective response rate(ORR), The objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a response of complete response(CR) or partial response(PR)., At the end of Cycle 6 chemotherapy (each cycle is 21 days), assessed up to 18 weeks.
Progression free survival, From date of patients sign informed consent until the date of progression or death or the date of last follow-up time, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years, 3 years|Overall survival, From date of patients sign informed consent until the date of death or the date of last follow-up time, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years, 3 years|Treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 1 year
This is a single arm, multicenter, phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab, methotrexate and lenalidomide as first-line regimens in the treatment of newly primary central nervous system lymphoma. A total of 40 patients plan to participate in this study to receive a total 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by 4 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy. Follow-ups should be taken up to the first 3 years. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoint includes Progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events.
