Effect of Iressa With/Without Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy on Tumor Gene Expression Profiles in Patients With Advanced Non-Nasopharyngeal Head and Neck Carcinoma
Two different patient populations will be targeted for this study. The first population (SP1) will include patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancers, excluding salivary gland carcinomas. The second population (SP2) will include treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC).

SP1 will be treated with palliative intent and the patients can be treatment-naïve or have received prior chemotherapy. Study treatment will consist of Iressa (gefitinib) alone.

SP2 will be treated with radical intent. The patients must be treatment-naïve and study treatment will consist of induction Iressa for 3 weeks followed by a combination of Iressa plus cisplatin and concurrent irradiation.
