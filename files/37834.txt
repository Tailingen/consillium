Selective Transvenous Chemoembolization of Primary Pancreatic Tumors
Catheter directed retrograde venous infusion of gemcitabine/lipiodol into pancreatic tumors.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Retrograde venous infusion of gemcitabine/lipiodol
Feasibility as determined by technical success of Pancreatic Retrograde Venous Infusion (PRVI) with gemcitabine and Lipiodol®, Technical success is measured as number of participants who did not experience technical failure, which is defined as the inability to administer the gemcitabine/ Lipiodol® to the targeted pancreatic tumor., 30 days|Safety as measured by number of participants with Grade 3, 4, and 5 toxicities, Number of participants with Grade 3, 4, and 5 toxicities as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; Version 5.0) that occur during and within 30 days after PRVI, 30 days
Efficacy as assessed by Objective tumor response, Objective tumor response is measured as number of participants with response as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria to assess change in tumor size and percent tumor enhancement as visualized on pancreatic protocol CT scans., 30 days|Efficacy as assessed by change in serum CA19-9, Change in serum CA19-9 measurements pre- and post-PRVI., Change from baseline to 30 days|Efficacy as assessed by change in levels of gemcitabine and dFdu in peripheral blood samples, Change in levels of gemcitabine and its inactive metabolite 2',2'-Difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) found in peripheral blood samples pre-and post-PRVI., Change from baseline to 30 days
Overall, subjects with resectable, borderline-resectable and/or locally-advanced pancreatic cancer are eligible to be entered into the study. Each enrolled study subject will receive a single neoadjuvant pancreatic retrograde venous infusion (PRVI) administration of the gemcitabine/Lipiodol® emulsion.

Complete enrollment in 12 months from date of enrollment of first study subject.
