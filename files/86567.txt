Enhanced Recovery After Surgery in Extremity Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of implementing the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway in a prospective manner to patients undergoing surgical treatment for extremity sarcoma.
Sarcoma
PROCEDURE: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery
Pain scores, Measured by Quality of Recovery questionnaire (QoR-15) scale = 0-10 (0=none of the time and 10 = all of the time), 3 months|Pain scores, Measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29 Profile v2.0) Score 1-5 (1 being worst and 5 being best), 3 months|Limb function, Measured by Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system (MSTS) scored from 0-5 (5 being best and 0 being worst), 3 months|Clinical outcomes - length of hospital stay, Measured by the number of days in the hospital, 3 months|Clinical outcomes - opioid requirements, Measured by the amount of opioids consumed, 3 months|Clinical outcomes - perioperative complications (e.g. wound complications and 30-day readmission), Measured by the number of perioperative complications reported, 3 months
Specifically, the focus of this study will be regarding the administration of a perioperative non-narcotic, multimodal pain management pathway. Primary endpoints collected with be short-term patient reported outcomes (pain scores \[PROMIS\] and \[QoR-15\]), limb function scores \[MSTS\], and key clinical outcomes (hospital length of stay, opioid requirements/prescribing data and perioperative complications).
