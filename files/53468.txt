Dabrafenib, Trametinib and Hydroxychloroquine in Patients With Advanced BRAF Mutant Melanoma
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when administered in conjunction with oral dabrafenib and trametinib (D+T) in patients with advanced BRAF mutant melanoma.
Advanced BRAF Mutant Melanoma
DRUG: Trametinib 2 mg daily|DRUG: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)|DRUG: dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice a day
Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose, Phase 1: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) = a) the dose producing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in 2/6 patients, or b) the dose level below the dose which produced DLT in ≥ 2/3 patients, or in ≥ 3/6 patients, 5 weeks|Phase 2: To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ+D+T by 1 year PFS rate., Phase 2: Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of first progression, death due to any cause or last patient contact alive and progression-free, 1 year
