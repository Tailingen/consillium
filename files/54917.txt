Safety and Efficacy Real-world Data of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan and Sacituzumab Govitecan
The study aims to evaluate real-world efficacy and toxicity data of treatment with Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a HER2-targeting ADC and sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a TROP-2-targeting ADC in pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Antibody-Drug Conjugates
The primary endpoint was toxicity rate of each drug, Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), From the initiation of ADC to the date of discontinuation (due to any reason), first documented progression, death from any cause or last contact, throughout study completion, up to 24 months
progression-free survival (PFS), From the date of disease progression to the date of death from any cause or last contact, throughout study completion,up to 24 months
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have significantly changed the therapeutic landscape of advanced breast cancer. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a HER2-targeting ADC and sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a TROP-2-targeting ADC, recently demonstrated superior efficacy over standard of care treatments depending on breast cancer subtype. The study aims to evaluate real-world efficacy and toxicity data of treatment with T-DXd and SG in pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer.

This study includes a retrospective/prospective multicenter review of medical records of patients with advanced breast cancer who received treatment with T-DXd and SG at Departments of Oncology, affiliated with the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG).
