Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of AI-081, a Bispecific Antibody for PD-1 And VEGF in Advanced Solid Tumors
BIPAVE-001 is a Phase 1-2 study for evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of AI-081 in solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: AI-081
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Maximal tolerable dose (MTD), the study drug, AI-081, 21 Days|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The number of subjects who have Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) as defined by protocol DLT criteria during the first cycle of study drug, AI-081, administration., 21 Days
Cmax of AI-081, The highest Serum concentration of AI-081 after IV infusion at cycle 1 and cycle 3 from different timepoints (within 60 minutes before dosing, 60 minutes post-dose, 6 hours post-dose, 24 hours post dose, day 8, 15 and 21 post-dose) after drug administration., 63 Days|The serum half-life of AI-081, To determine the drug concentration in serum samples that are taken in various timepoints (Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: within 60 minutes before dosing, 60 minutes post-dose, 6 hours post-dose, 24 hours post dose, day 8, 15 and 21 post-dose. Cycle 2 and Cycle 4-13: within 60 minutes before dosing and 60 minutes post-dose) during the treatment in order to calculate drug half life., 63 Days
AI-081 is a bispecific antibody against PD-1 and VEGF. The study BiPAVE-001 is consisting of two integrated parts: Part A is the first-in-human dose escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AI-081 monotherapy, while Part B are dose optimization trials comparing the safety and clinical activities of AI-081 at RP2D and one dose level lower than RP2D (RP2D-1), either as monotherapy or in combination therapy with standard of care (SOC) in selected indications.
