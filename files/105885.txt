First-in-human Phase I Study of a Selective c-Met Inhibitor PLB1001
This phase I, first-in-human dose-escalation study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1001.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: PLB1001
Percentage of participants with dose-limiting toxicities, 2 years
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of PLB1001 and its metabolite, In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles ofPLB1001 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of PLB-1001 on Day 1 to Day 2. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10.5, 12 and 13 hour time points on days 8, 22of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 9, 14, 15, 16and 23 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-2 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State|Maximum plasma concentration observed (Cmax) of PLB1001 and its metabolite, In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles ofPLB1001 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of PLB-1001 on Day 1 to Day 2. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10.5, 12 and 13 hour time points on days 8, 22of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 9, 14, 15, 16and 23 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-2 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of PLB1001 and its metabolite, In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles ofPLB1001 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of PLB-1001 on Day 1 to Day 2. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10.5, 12 and 13 hour time points on days 8, 22of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 9, 14, 15, 16and 23 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-2 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State|Preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1001, Preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1001 assessed using RECIST1.1, 2 years
This is a Phase I, open-label, multicentre study of PB1001 administered orally to patients with Met-positive (Met+) advanced NSCLC. The study includes a Dose-escalation Part (part A)and a Dose Expansion Part(part B). The aim of the part A is to estimate the MTD and to identify the dose limited toxicity(DLT) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for PLB1001 single agent as well as to determine the PK/PD profile .Once response has been observed in certain dose level ,then followed by the expansion part to further assess the clinical efficacy and safety of PLB1001 single agent. Aprox. 40 patients will be enrolled in PART A, while 20-30 patients for expansion cohort .

PLB1001 is a potent selective c-Met inhibitor. PLB1001 acts on cancer by blocking abnormal cmet-mediated signalling, leading to profound tumour growth inhibition in xenografts of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours. Preliminary data from a c-Met inhibitor INC 280 has provided possibility on the safety and clinical activity of PLB1001 monotherapy in this patient population.
