A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Docetaxel and Carboplatin in Metastatic Malignant Melanoma Failed First-Line Dacabazine or Temozolomide Contained Therapy
This is the phase II, single-arm, single-center study assessing the efficacy of weekly docetaxel plus carboplatin in second-line treatment of malignant melanoma (unresectable or metastatic) who has failed dacarbazine or temozolomide contained therapy. The primary end point is overall response rate according to RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed using CT or MRI and secondary end point includes disease control rate, progression free survival, overall survival and safety.
