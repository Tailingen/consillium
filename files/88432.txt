The Accuracy and Acceptability of Magnet Assisted Capsule Endoscopy in the Diagnosis of Esophageal Pathology: a Pilot Study
A pilot study to assess the accuracy and acceptability of a magnet assisted capsule endoscopy in detecting esophageal pathology compared to standard endoscopy.
Barrett's Oesophagus|Oesophageal Varices
DEVICE: Magnet assissted capsule endoscopy
Diagnostic accuarcy, endoscopic, immediate
comfort, questionnaire, 2 weeks
This will be a single centre feasibility study performed at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trusts.
