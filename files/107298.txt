NEMO - an App for Side Effect Management in Oncology
This study investigates the use of digital and standardized documentation by patients of frequently occurring adverse events in oncological therapies.
Cancer Patients
OTHER: Documentation of cancer treatment side effects
Phase I: Patient acceptance of a new medium of communication, Acceptance of documentation of occurring side effects of oncological therapies with new communication media, 6 months|Phase II: Change of occurred adverse events, Changes of side effects by at least 1 degree according to CTCAE scoring in comparison to the study start, 6 months
Phase II: Doses of chemotherapy, Maintenance of chemotherapy doses through better adverse event management, 6 months|Phase II: Incidence of adverse events, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events as assessed by the CTCAE scale, 6 months
This research study is structured as a Phase I and II clinical trial. In phase I, the feasibility of using a smartphone application to document adverse events that have occurred during oncological therapies by the patient will be investigated. In phase II we will investigate whether the use of the smartphone app allows an improvement of patient care by reducing occurred adverse events.
