Proton Pencil Beam Scanning GRID for Treatment of Bulky Tumors
This is a single arm, phase I study, evaluating the feasibility, toxicity, and degree of tumor response after novel proton pencil beam scanning (PBS GRID) treatment in patients with bulky tumors that are difficult to manage.

Feasibility of the Pro-GRID intervention as assessed by success of intervention delivery for a number of participants, To assess the feasibility of successfully creating treatment plans and delivering a novel proton therapy called Pro-GRID. Feasibility will be determined by a successful intervention delivery for 10 of 12 patients with bulky solid tumors., 1.5 years
Rate of toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4), To determine the rate of mild acute toxicity, defined as any CTCAE grade 2 or lower toxicity, and severe acute toxicity, defined as any CTCAE grade 3 or higher toxicity., 3 months post-treatment|Change in rate of treatment response of bulky tumors treated and not treated with proton GRID therapy, To determine the change in response rate for bulky tumors treated and not treated with Proton GRID by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria., 1, 6 and 12 months post-treatment|Change in degree of treatment response of bulky tumors treated and not treated with proton GRID therapy, Change in degree of treatment response would be measured by RECIST criteria (partial response, complete response, stable disease, or progression of disease)., 1, 6 and 12 months post-treatment
The proton group at Sibley Memorial Hospital has developed a new method for multi-beam proton delivery making it possible to arrange and optimize GRID dosimetry and normal tissue sparing compared to other similar techniques.

In this phase I pilot study, patients with bulky tumors will receive this novel method of GRID-therapy also called spatially-fractionated radiotherapy which involves delivering high dose radiation to small amounts of tumor in a manner that creates alternating regions of high and low dose radiation within the tumor and is often aligned in a grid pattern.

In so doing, this study will ascertain the feasibility, safety and tumor response i.e. shrinkage and resectability of this treatment. Ultimately, the goal is to improve local outcomes of patients with bulky tumors and to offer new treatment options for patients with difficult-to-manage bulky tumors.
