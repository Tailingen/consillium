Retrospective Assessment of Adverse Events-related Healthcare Resource Utilization and Costs of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor and Targeted Therapy for Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma
This was a retrospective cohort study using the PharMetrics database. The analysis was conducted using the most recent 5 years of data from the database, January 1, 2015, to October 30, 2020. Included patients were followed for outcome evaluation from the index date (first prescription of treatment, immunotherapy \[IO\], or targeted therapy \[TT\] following diagnosis of non-metastatic malignant melanoma and evidence of first lymph node resection), until the first occurrence or end of continuous eligibility or end of the study period.
