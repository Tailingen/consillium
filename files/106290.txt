Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS by investigator-reported measurements according to CT image. PFS was calculated from the day of treatment start to the first observation of progression disease (PD) or death from any cause.PD was defined as Overall Response by RECIST criteria v1.1 according to CT image., Up to 18 months
Overall response rate (ORR), Up to 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Up to 36 months|Incidence of adverse events, Adverse events were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. All adverse events was collected in duration from starting treatment to whichever shorter "after 30 days from withdrawal treatment" or "later treatment, Up to 36 months|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) / Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Neurotoxicity 4, Up to 18 months
QUATTRO-II is an open-label, multicenter, randomised, phase II study to investigate the efficacy and safety of CAPOXIRI+BEV versus FOLFOXIRI+BEV in 1st line mCRC.

This study is composed two steps because of confirming of recommended dose (RD) for CAPOXIRI+BEV regimen.

1. Dose finding step (Step1): CAPOXIRI+BEV doses findings were planned by 3+3 cohort design, register up to maximum of 12 cases.
2. Randomised step (Step2): After confirmation of RD regarding CAPOXIRI+BEV, we will move to Step2 to compare the efficacy and safety between FOLFOXIRI+BEV and CAPOXIRI+BEV, register up to 65 cases.
