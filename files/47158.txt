Thiotepa-based Conditioning for Allogeneic Stem-cell Transplantation (SCT) in Lymphoid Malignancies
The study hypotheses is that the introduction of dose escalated thiotepa, in substitution to busulfan or melphalan, will reduce toxicity after allogeneic transplantation while improving disease eradication in patients with lymphoid malignancies not eligible for standard transplantation.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Hodgkin Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Thiotepa
disease-free survival, The percentage of patients alive without disease recurrence 2 years after transplant, 2 years after transplantation
treatment-related mortality, The percentage of patients who die of complications related to the transplant, 2 years after transplantation|graft versus host disease, The percentage of patients experiencing graft-versus-host disease after transplant, 1 year after transplantation|relapse, The percentage of patients experiencing disease recurrence after transplant, 2 years after transplantation
