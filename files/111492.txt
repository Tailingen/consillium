This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate BN301 administered intravenously in patients with B-cell NHL who have previously failed standard therapy or who are intolerant to standard therapy. This study includes two parts: a Phase 1 dose escalation part and a Phase 2 dose expansion part. In Phase 1 and Phase 2, BN301 will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or other conditions in which patients are not suitable for study treatment, whichever occurs first.

Laboratory tests will be performed weekly in Cycles 1-4 and every 3 weeks from Cycle 5 onwards (see Study Flow Chart). PK sample analysis will be performed on Days 1, 2, and 8 of the first two treatment cycles, Day 1 of the third treatment cycle, and at specified time points at the end of treatment (see Attachment 1). Additional clinical assessments and laboratory tests may be performed at discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated.
