Using Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI to Measure Inflammation in Patients With Brain Tumors or Other Conditions of the CNS
This pilot clinical trial study will assess the inflammatory response of brain tumors or other central nervous system conditions in pediatric and adult patients using ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI. Imaging features will be correlated with the number of inflammatory cells (macrophages) at histopathology. Determining the extent of inflammation associated with pathologies in the central nervous system may be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes as well as monitoring treatment response of current and future immunotherapies.

Obtain measurements of iron concentration (indicative of ferumoxytol uptake) on T2*-weighted MR images., Day 1
Determine the number of macrophages in resected/biopsied samples at histopathology., Days 2-4
In this study, we will establish the MR imaging characteristics of macrophages in malignant brain tumors and other CNS conditions in the pediatric and adult populations using ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle that is approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. The investigators will correlate the MR signal of ferumoxytol uptake with the number of macrophages in surgical specimen at histopathology. This information may potentially offer clinicians a new means for risk stratification and monitoring treatment efficacy.
