Study of Selumetinib in Patients With Previously Treated or Untreated Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC
This research is being done because further research on selumetinib in combination with standard chemotherapy treatment is needed. Although the number of treatment options for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer has increased over the past decade, prognosis remains poor, and there is a need for additional therapeutic options.

Maximum dose tolerability of Selumetinib in patients, Determination of the maximum administered dose and the recommended phase II dose, 24 months
Pharmacokinetic response prediction to selumetinib, pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of selumetinib when given daily continuously in combination with chemotherapy; gene expression signatures/profiles and/or KRAS codon subtypes in tumour and/or tumour derived material that may influence response; the use of plasma as a potential source of circulating free tumour DNA (cfDNA) for the analysis of KRAS mutation status; and serum exploratory markers that may predict response to selumetinib; and preliminary assessment of efficacy in all patients and in expansion cohorts of up to 10 patients with KRAS positive NSCLC, 24 months
The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a new drug, selumetinib, given in combination with standard chemotherapies, that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that does not cause side effects in animals. Participants are given selumetinib and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more potential participants are asked to join this study and are given a higher dose of selumetinib. Participants joining this study later on will take selumetinib at higher doses, take doses twice daily or take for more days in a 21 day period than participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
