Combination Chemotherapy and Rituximab With Pegfilgrastim Followed by Rituximab, in Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The purposes of this trial are to decrease toxicity and improve treatment effectiveness elderly patients. With a short course of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and prednisone with concurrent administration of rituximab it is likely to be as effective as longer programs, and will certainly be better tolerated by this patient group. The addition of maintenance therapy may result in substantial prolongation of remission duration.
Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Rituximab
Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 Months
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will receive:

* Cyclophosphamide + Mitoxantrone + Vincristine + Prednisone + Rituximab

Patients that are not considered candidates for anthracycline therapy will not receive mitoxantrone. Patients with objective response (partial or complete response) or stable disease will receive Rituximab maintenance therapy.
