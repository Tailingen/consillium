Preoperative Short-course Radiation Followed by Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX for MSS Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma (PRECAM)
Short-course radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy may bring revolutionary changes to the preoperative neoadjuvant treatment mode for locally advanced rectal cancer. According to the existing theory, the use of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody after short-course radiotherapy may be the best solution. In this study, the investigators will perform single-cell sequencing of participants tissue samples, fully explore the multi-dimensional omics information of tumors and microenvironments, explore the characteristics of the treatment benefit population, and try to construct an efficacy prediction model to screen the treatment benefit population early and implement precise treatment.
MSS Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Envafolimab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Short-course Radiation|PROCEDURE: TME surgery, total mesorectal excision
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate following short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX, pCR was defined as the absence of viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0N0)., Up to 10 weeks (once surgery is done)
Tumor regression grade following short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by AJCC/CAP TRG system, Tumor Regression Grade（TRG）will be done via pathologic assessment on the surgical specimen with AJCC/CAP TRG system, Up to 10 weeks (once surgery is done)|The proportion of participants who remain survival at 3 years, Defined as the percentage of patients alive after 3-year follow-up, Up to 3 years|The proportion of participants who remain progression free at 3 years, Defined as the percentage of patients without disease recurrence or progression after 3-year follow-up, Up to 3 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Treatment- related adverse events are assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 in each visit, Up to 3 years|Surgical Complications of total mesorectal resection procedure for patients after short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by Clavien-Dindo classification, Surgical Complications are assessed by Clavien-Dindo classification after surgery., Up to 24 weeks|Quality of life of the patients in a neoadjuvant setting of short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by FACT-C questionnaire, Quality of life is measured via FACT-C questionnaire in each visit., Up to 3 years
