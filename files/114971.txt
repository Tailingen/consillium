AD1208 in Subjects With Any Progressive, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AD1208 to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) or maximumly administered dose(MAD) in any progressive, locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Which dosage of AD1208 is safe and tolerable for participants?
* What medical problems do participants have when taking AD1208?

Participants will:

* Take drug AD1208 every day up to 1 cycle at the least.
* Visit the site once every 1 weeks for checkups and tests during cycle 1 and every 3 weeks from cycle 2 onwards.
* Keep a diary of any adverse events and administrated drug

- Dose-escalation Part The treatment cycle is defined as 21 days and AD1208 will be administered orally once or twice a day from Day 1 to Day 21 in every 21-day cycle. The dose-escalation part is divided into phase 1a, which determines the Recommended dose of AD1208 in monotherapy, and phase 1b, which determines the RP2D of AD1208 in combination therapy.
