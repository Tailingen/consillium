Icotinib as Adjuvant Therapy in Treating Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Patients With Positive EGFR Mutation
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib as adjuvant therapy in treating such patients. The primary endpoint is to compare the recurrence-free survival after 1-year or 2-year treatment with icotinib.
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: 1-year treatment with icotinib|DRUG: 2-year treatment with icotinib
Recurrence-free Survival, 6 months
Overall survival, 6 months
Adjuvant therapy has been proved effective in treating stage II-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer. However, few data on the treating time of adjuvant therapy is available. Here we conduct a randomized, prospective study to compare the recurrence-free survival after 1-year or 2-year treatment with icotinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer patients.
