Combination of Donafenib and Cytarabine/Daunorubicin in Relapsed AML
This phase â…  study of Donafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf kinase and receptor tyrosine kinases, is to assess safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with Relapsed AML.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Donafenib
Safety(including the type, severity and frequency of AE), Safety of combination of donafenib with Cytarabine/Daunorubicin in relapsed AML patients., through study completion, an average of 2 months
Donafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which is acting on various cellular pathways involved in the genesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Donafenib is therefore a promising candidate for improvement of chemotherapy results in AML. This clinical trial evaluates the safety and pharmacokinetics of Donafenib combination with Cytarabine/Daunorubicin for AML in patients between 18 and 55 years of age.
