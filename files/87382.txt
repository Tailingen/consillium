Single Cell Acute Leukemia Analysis
Numerous chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance genes have been identified in cancers in general and acute myeloid leukemia in particular. As a preliminary to this study, the investigators hypothesized the co-expression of these genes in the same cell as a major factor in relapse. This hypothesis was supported in vitro by the study of the evolution of these co-expressions after incubation with chemotherapy drugs. The current study aims to verify this hypothesis by studying the expression of these genes in single-cell samples from relapsed acute myeloid leukemia patients.
Acute Myeloid Leucemia
PROCEDURE: blood sampling
percentage of leukemic blasts coexpressing P-glycoprotein (PGP)-Multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP)+ Glutathione S-transferase (GST)+ anti- B-cell Lymphoma 2 (BLC2), Preliminary in vitro data show that the percentage of blasts coexpressing PGP+MRP+GST+BCL2 is 15% after in vitro chemotherapy. To verify these data in relapsed/refractory patients, the investigators will evaluate the percentage of patients with in vivo leukemic blasts coexpressing PGP+MRP+GST+BCL2 at \>15% post-chemotherapy., 36 months
percentage of P-glycoprotein (PGP)-Multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP)+ Glutathione S-transferase (GST)+ anti- B-cell Lymphoma 2 (BLC2) coexpression in leukemic blasts, Mean percentages of PGP+MRP+GST+BCL2 co-expression in leukemic blasts from patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia., 36 months
