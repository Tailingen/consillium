Randomized Trial of Five or Two MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy Treatments for Prostate Cancer
The study is a randomized study that compares 5 radiation therapy treatments to 2 radiation therapy treatments in men with low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Change in the number of patient-reported GI symptoms using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), The primary objective is to demonstrate that 2 treatments of radiotherapy does not significantly increase patient-reported Gastrointestinal (GI) and Genitourinary (GU) symptoms compared to 5 treatments of radiotherapy 2 years after treatment completion., Baseline, 24 months
Change in the number of patient reported GI symptoms at specific intervals as measured by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), Compare patient-reported GI symptoms using the EPIC at end of RT and 3, 6, 12, and 60 months from end of treatment.

Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) short form questionnaire. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. Scores range from 0 to 100, lower scores indicate worse outcomes and higher EPIC scores represent better outcomes.

Adverse events can be unexpected or expected, related to treatment., Baseline, 1 week , 3months, 6 months, 12 months and 60 months|Change in the number of patient reported GU symptoms at specific intervals as measured by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), Compare patient-reported GU symptoms using the EPIC at end of RT and 3, 6, 12, and 60 months from end of treatment.

This study is a randomized non-inferiority trial comparing 5 to 2 radiotherapy treatments using an MRI linear accelerator for men with low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer electing for definitive radiotherapy.
