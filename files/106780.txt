Uro-DNA Collection for Expanded Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
In the last decade, investigators from the Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (National Cancer Institute, USA) have conducted genome-wide association (GWAS) studies of renal cell carcinoma.

Dr. Mark PURDUE and Dr. Stephen CAHNOCK (Department of Epidemiology of Cancer and Genetics, NCI) propose to expand their genome-wide association study (Expanded GWAS) by genotyping approximately 10,000 additional cases of kidney cancer patients, in collaboration with US institutions, South-American and European.

This study describes the participation of the French Kidney Cancer Research Network (UroCCR) in the Expanded GWAS research, under the coordination of Professor BERNHARD (Bordeaux University Hospital).

Identification of new clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) risk loci, From the DNA sample collected at inclusion visit, and the derived Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) genotype data:

Association between evaluated genetic variants (SNPs) and renal cell carcinoma will be statistically determined if the p-value is found to be close to or lower than the Genome-wide significance threshold (p \<5\*10-8)., Inclusion Visit
The aim of the Expanded GWAS study is to better understand the role of common genetic variants in susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

The participation of the French UroCCR network consists in completing the bio-collection of the UroCCR cohort by preserving constitutional DNA and to provide DNA samples to the US NCI team.

This will increase the number of samples for meta-analysis and contribute to better identify clear cell kidney cancer susceptibility loci.
