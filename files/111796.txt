Study of Resection Combined With Stereotactic Radiosurgery for 1 to 3 Brain Metastases
This study is to look more closely at the tumor removed during your surgery, and to follow your condition after your treatment.

The purpose of this study is to determine what side effects are common or more rare from this treatment, how well the treatment has worked for you, and to track whether you develop other brain metastases.
