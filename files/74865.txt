MGD007 Combined With MGA012 in Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The primary goal of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGD007 when combined with MGA012. Pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), and the anti-tumor activity of the combination of MGD007 and MGA012 will also be assessed.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
BIOLOGICAL: MGD007 + MGA012
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Up to approximately 12 weeks
Peak Plasma Concentration, PK of MGD007 and MGA012 in combination, 7 weeks|Number of Participants That Develop Anti-drug Antibodies, Proportion of patients who develop anti-MGD007/MGA012 antibodies, immunogenicity, 1 year|The Number of Participants With Response Based on the Change in Tumor Volume, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) and immune related RECIST criteria: number of patients with either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR), Every 8 weeks
This study is an open-label, Phase 1b/2, dose escalation and cohort expansion study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of MGD007 and MGA012, administered in combination by IV infusion, in patients with histologically proven, relapsed/refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma, irrespective of the KRAS and MMR status of their tumors.

The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the MTD or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD; if no MTD is defined) of the combination, followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial antitumor activity of the combination with the doses established in the Dose Escalation Phase.
