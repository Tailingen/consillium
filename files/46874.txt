A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Targeted Therapies in Subpopulations of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (INTRINSIC)
This open-label, exploratory study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or combinations, in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose tumors are biomarker positive as per treatment arm-specific definition. Eligible participants with mCRC will be enrolled into specific treatment arms based on their biomarker assay results.
