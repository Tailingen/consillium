A Phase I, Multicenter, Open-Label, Multi-Part, Dose-escalation Study of RAD1901 in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Estrogen Receptor Positive and HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of elacestrant (RAD1901) in patients with advanced ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer.
Advanced ER+, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Elacestrant
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of Elacestrant (RAD1901), the incidence of Dose Limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed., The first 28 days of treatment.
Safety and Tolerability of Elacestrant (RAD1901), Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of adverse events, serious adverse events, ECG, physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory values., Up to 30 days after the end of treatment.|Pharmacokinetics of Elacestrant (RAD1901), Plasma concentrations of RAD1901 will be assessed at predefined intervals, Every 28 days|Anti-Tumor Effect of Elacestrant (RAD1901), Tumor response will be evaluated in patients with measurable or evaluable disease, using RECISTv1.1 guidelines., Every 8 weeks
The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of elacestrant in patients with advanced ER+HER2-negative breast cancer.

The secondary objectives of this study are:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of elacestrant
