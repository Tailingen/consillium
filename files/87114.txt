Response to Influenza Vaccination in Lymphoma Patients Treated With Rituximab
The purpose of this study is to compare the number of responders to vaccination with the influenza virus vaccine at different time points after last dose of rituximab in patients with lymphoma. Secondly to study the immune-response to vaccination with influenza virus vaccine, after treatment with rituximab in relation to the reconstitution of immune-function.
