Comparison of Gastrointestinal Motility in Healthy Children and Children With Constipation
To gain a better understanding of the underlying dysmotility in constipation in children, we will use a novel minimal invasive method called 3D Transit. We will examine four groups of children aged 7 to 17 years: healthy children, chronically constipated children (ROM IV criteria), children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and finally children receiving chemotherapy (vincristin) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
