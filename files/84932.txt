Retinal Ganglion Cell Function After Intravitreous Ranibizumab in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema
To evaluate the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab repeated injections in patients with diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function.
Diabetic Macular Edema
DRUG: Ranibizumab
focal macular changes in full-field and photopic negative response (PhRN) amplitude (in µV), The photopic negative response (PhNR) of the full-field cone electroretinograms (ERGs) is a functional indicator of retinal ganglion. The PhNR consists of a negative-going wave that follows the photopic cone b wave. The PhNR is selectively attenuated in patients with optic nerve disease and glaucoma, indicating that the PhNR can be an objective functional measure reflecting the sum of the total response of the retinal ganglion cells in the entire retina., at Baseline and Months 3, 6, 9, 12
The mean change in BCVA, The mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to month 12, monthly, from baseline to Month 12|the mean change in central macular thickness (CMT), To assess the mean change in central macular thickness (CMT), measured in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) from baseline to month 12, monthly, from baseline to Month 12
assess adverse events, To assess adverse events during the twelve months of the study., monthly, from Month 1 to Month 12
* Ranibizumab can be a safe treatment for diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function after repeated intravitreal injections.
* To evaluate the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab repeated injections in patients with diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function.
* The primary endpoint for the study will be the changes in full-field and focal macular photopic negative response (PhRN) amplitude (in µV) over time, from baseline to month 12.
