Multicenter Hologic Tomosynthesis Study
The purpose of this image acquisition study is to compare, in a Reader Study, the performance of Tomosynthesis (3D) to (2D FFDM) conventional images in an enriched retrospective reader study. Synthetic 2D images, generated from the tomosynthesis image, will be available to the readers to provide an over view of the anatomy similar to a scout view in CT imaging and to determine whether the 3-D images with the synthesized 2D overview are non-inferior to the 2-D images alone as determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve.

To Demonstrate Non-inferior ROC Performance as Measured by the Area Under the Curve When Comparing 3-Ds Plus 3-D Images to the 2-D Images., ROC performance as measured by the area under the curve when comparing 3-Ds plus 3-D images to the 2-D images., At time of exam
Analysis of ROC Performance in Subjects With Dense Breasts, The radiologist's POM case based score will be used to generate the 2D FFDM and 3DS ROC curves for women with dense breasts (defined as BIRADS density score of 3 or 4).

Endpoint Analysis - A multi-reader, multi-case ROC analysis will be used to compare 3DS to 2D FFDM. The areas under the curve (AUC) will be used to compare ROC performance. 3DS will be considered non-inferior to 2D FFDM if the lower limit one-sided 95% CI for the difference in AUCs (3DS minus 2D FFDM) is greater than -0.05. A difference of 0.05 is considered a clinically significant difference., At time of exam|Analysis of Non-Cancer Recall Rate: 3DS Compared to 2D FFDM, The non-cancer recall rate was measured for 3DS and 2D FFDM, at time of exam
