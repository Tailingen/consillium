Phase 1-2 Amrubicin in Combo With Lenalidomide + Weekly Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
To assess if amrubicin is safe and useful for patients with multiple myeloma requiring additional treatment.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Amrubicin|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Aspirin|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim
Response Rates After Amrubicin + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone, Per International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria, Modified International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria:

Complete (CR)=

* Negative for monoclonal protein (MP) in urine (U) and serum (S) +
* No tissue plasmacytomas (PC) +
* \<5% plasma cells (PCs) in marrow (M)

Stringent CR (sCR)= CR with normal light chain ratio+ no PCs in M

Near CR (nCR)= CR, except MP persists in U and S

Partial (PR)= S MP ≤50%, + U MP ≤90% or \<200 mg/24 hours (hr)

Very Good PR (VGPR)= in S MP ≤90%, + U MP \<100 mg/24 hr

Minimal (MR)=

* S MP ≤51-75%, +
* If light chain is excreted, reduced 50-89%/24 hr that is also \>200 mg/24 hr, +
* No increase in lytic bone lesions

Progressive disease (PD)= any of:

* S MP ≥125% and/or ≥+0.5 g/dL,
* U MP ≥125% and/or ≥+200 mg/24 hr
* New or increased bone lesions/PC
* S calcium \>11.5 mg/dL (attributed to increased PCs)

PD after CR/sCR=

* Reappearance of S or U MP
* ≥5% clonal PCs in M
* New PC, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia

Stable Disease (SD)= Not CR, VGPR, MR, PR, or PD, 12 weeks
Duration of Response (DOR), 140 days|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is alive and free from progression, per the modified International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria, defined as any of:

* Serum monoclonal protein ≥ 125% baseline and/or ≥ +0.5 g/dL from baseline,
* Urine monoclonal protein ≥ 125% baseline and/or ≥ +200 mg/24 hour from baseline
* New or increased bone lesions or plasmacytomas
* Serum calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL (attributed to increased plasma cells), 9 months|Time-to-next Treatment, 9 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

* Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile for the combination of amrubicin with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in previously treated adult patients with multiple myeloma during Phase I
* Determine the combined rate of complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR) for this combination in this population as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWGURC)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

* Determine the overall response rate (CR, VGPR and PR)
* Assess additional evidence of ant-tumor activity as measured by duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS)
