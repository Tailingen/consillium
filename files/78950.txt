Esophageal Cancer Multimodal Prehabilitation Study
The goal of this research study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a prehabilitation program that aims to improve a patient's physical, nutritional, and sleep health before surgery in an older, at-risk group with esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer|Esophageal Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Prehabilitation Program
Enrollment Rate (Feasibility), Number of eligible patients who enroll in study, At screening|Completion Rate (Feasibility), Defined as the number of patients who complete study procedures., 30 days
Nutrition Compliance Rate (Feasibility), Comparison of number of nutritional supplements consumed compared to number of nutritional supplements prescribed as determined from daily check-ins. A cut-off value of 80% will be used to indicate compliance., 5 days|Physical Function Compliance Rate (Feasibility), Comparison of the total minutes of physical function completed compared to the total minutes of physical function prescribed as determined from daily check-ins and wearable device. A cut-off value of 80% will be used to indicate compliance., 30 days|Sleep Health Compliance Rate (Feasibility), Comparison of the average daily hours of sleep duration, minutes of wake after sleep onset, and variability in sleep timing, achieved compared to prescribed as determined from actigraphy. A cut-off value of 80% will be used to indicate compliance., 30 days|Actigraphy Compliance Rate (Feasibility), Total daily hours of actiwatch/wearable device wear-time. A cut-off value of 80% will be used to indicate compliance., 30 days
Sarcopenia, Assessed by baseline Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the thorax., At baseline|Malnutrition, Assessed by the Perioperative Nutrition Screen (PONS) Risk Score, a modified version of the malnutrition universal screening tool, which determines the presence of nutrition risk based on BMI, recent body weight loss, decrement of dietary intake, and preoperative albumin concentration., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit|Patient-Reported Sleep Measures, Assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), a 27-item self-reported measure of physical activity., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit|Hand Grip Test, Assessed by change in baseline and post-operative Hand Grip tests using a hand-held dynamometer. An average score is calculated using measurements from both hands., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit|BMI, Assessed by change in baseline and post-operative height and weight., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit|Energy expenditure, Assessed by change in baseline and post-operative Metabolic Cart, or indirect calorimetry., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit|6-Minute Walk Test, Assessed by a baseline and a post-operative 6-Minute Walk Test, a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit|Patient-Reported Measures on Physical Function Score, Assessed by Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC), a standardized assessment used to measure the physical function and functional status of patients. The AM-PAC consists of 13 tests that divided into lower and upper extremity function, gait and balance and activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Also assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF), a 45-item self-reported measure to evaluate physical function., At baseline visit and second measure at post-operative 1 day visit
This research study is to test whether a novel, 4-week surgical multimodal prehabilitation protocol is feasible in at-risk older adult patients who have previously undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy and are scheduled for surgical removal of esophageal cancer.

Research study procedures include screening for eligibility, clinic visits, questionnaires, blood tests, and Computed Tomography (CT) scans.

Participation in this research study is expected to last 7 months.

It is expected about 30 patients will participate in this study.
