CD19 T-CAR for Treatment of Children and Young Adults With r/r B-ALL
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of autologous CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes in a cohort of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed /refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia

The main objectives of the study are:

1. To investigate the safety of auto-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy among children and young adults with refractory/relapsed B-cell ALL on the basis of prospective evaluation of adverse affects frequency and severity according to CTCAE v.4
2. To study the efficacy of auto-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy among children and young adults with refractory/relapsed B-cell ALL on the basis of proportion of patients in haematological and molecular remission at 28 days after infusion.
3. To evaluate long-term efficacy of auto-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy among children and young adults with refractory/relapsed B-cell ALL on the basis of overall and event-free survival at 1 and 3 years after infusion.

The novelty of this study will be cytokine release syndrome prophylaxis by tocilizumab Patients will receive fludarabine 120 mg/m2 (totally) intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2 and cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes on day -2. One hour prior to infusion of CAR T-cells patients will receive tocilizumab IV 8 mg/kg (max 800 mg) over 1 hour. Patients then receive CD19-CAR T cells IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0.

This is a dose-escalation study of CD19-CAR T cells. Dose escalation consistently:

* Level 1 5х105/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes
* Level 2 1х106/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes
* Level 3 3х106/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes
* Level 0 1х105/kg CD19 CAR-T lymphocytes (in case of dose-limiting toxicity at dose Level 1) In case of severe side affects next dose will be reduced to the previous lower dose.

Based on interim analysis the following dosing approach based on stratification by the initial leukemia burden will be implemented starting November 2019:

• Patients with low disease burden (\<15% blast cells in BM) will receive a lymphodepletion chemotherapy of fludarabine IV (total dose 120mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide IV (total dose 750mg/m2) over 5 days.

CD19 CAR-T cells will be infused IV in dose 1x106/kg on day 0.

• Patients will high disease burden (\>15% blast cells in BM) will receive a lymphodepletion chemotherapy of fludarabine IV (total dose 120 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide IV (total dose 750 mg/m2), cytarabine IV (total dose 900 mg/m2), etoposide IV (total dose 450 mg/m2), dexamethasone IV (total dose 30 mg/m2) over 5 days.

CD19 CAR-T cells 1st dose will be infused IV on day 0 - 0,1x106/kg, 2nd dose will be infused IV between day 7 and 14 - 0,9x106/kg.
