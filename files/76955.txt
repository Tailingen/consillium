Cancer Patients' Performance Status Assessed Using Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing and Wearable Data Generation
The primary objective of this study is to establish the feasibility and value of physical fitness assessment within patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. If successful, this project will establish the groundwork for physical function assessment in larger cancer clinical trials to assist patient selection and evaluation of toxicity and/or response among trial participants.

Physical fitness, whether measured by performance capacity or daily activity, can predict risk of toxicity while helping to evaluate toxicity itself in the course of cancer chemotherapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy causes premature aging and frailty in many cancer patients, so measuring and improving physical function may also limit late morbidity and mortality. Clinician-rated performance status (cPS; e.g., ECOG or Karnofsky PS) with or without concomitant organ function testing is the usual gold standard for risk prognostication and patient selection in most cancer settings, but cPS is subjective, unreliable, and relatively sensitive only for patients with significant functional compromise. Objective evaluations of physical function have the potential to augment or even replace cPS in the cancer treatment setting.
