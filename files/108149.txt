Hypofractionated Proton Beam Radiotherapy for Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This phase II study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated proton beam therapy (PBT) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients in hepatitis B endemic area.

RADIATION: Proton Beam Therapy
local progression - free survival, During PBT, patients were assessed weekly and after comletion of PBT at the 1st month, every 3months for the first 2years, every 6 months up to 5years. the tumor responses were assessed according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria by comparing pre- and posst-PBT CT/MRI scans, and the severity of adverse deffects was graded using the common terminology criteria for adverse events(ver 4.0), Up to 5 year

The primary endpoint is local progression free survival. The trial is a single arm phase II trial with the historical arm. The expected 3-year local progression free survival for patient with HCC patients treated with proton beam therapy would be 80%. With a power of 80% and a type I error level of 10%, evaluable 40 patients are required to reject that the null hypothesis that true 3-year local progression free survival rate is â‰¤65%. Considering the 10% unevaluable patients due to loss of follow up, a total 45 eligible patients will be enrolled.
