Exemestane in Post-Menopausal Women With NSCLC
This is a phase II therapeutic study of adding exemestane therapy in post-menopausal women with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are progressing while on treatment with an immune checkpoint antibody (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Exemestane
Disease Response (RECIST), Initial disease response will be assessed from 6 weeks to 1 year after the start of exemestane using the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 6 weeks
Toxicity Assessment, Toxicity will be assessed from the 1st dose to Post Treatment Day 30, up to 22 weeks. Toxicity severity will be graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4., Post Treatment Day 30|Progression-free Survival, progression-free survival will be assessed until 1 year after study enrollment based on the definitions found in RECIST 1.1, 1 year after enrollment|Quality of Life Assessment, Quality of life will be assessed by use of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29 (PROMIS-29) at baseline, every 3 weeks from the 1st dose to Post Treatment Day 30, up to 22 weeks. Patient's report on a number of subjects on a 0-10 scale. The scores range from 28 to 150. 50 is the average score, 28 is the best health and 150 is the worst health., Baseline, Treatment, End of Treatment, and 1 Month Post-Treatment
