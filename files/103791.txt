Prospective Pilot Study of Multimodal Radiological Evaluation Feasibility During Chemoradiotherapy of Rectal Adenocarcinomas
The objective of the present project is to validate the feasibility of a multimodal radiological pathway while on chemoradiotherapy, in order to validate potentially predictive factors for chemoradiotherapy sensitivity of rectal adenocarcinomas.

The objective of the present project is to validate the feasibility of a multimodal radiological pathway while on chemoradiotherapy, in order to validate potentially predictive factors for chemoradiotherapy sensitivity of rectal adenocarcinomas.

It is based on a structured clinical and radiological pathway for patients, using diffusion MRI and F misonidazole PET.

Validation of these new tools is already needed in clinical practice since future institutional trials will be based on treatment individualisation, using preoperative predicting factors.
