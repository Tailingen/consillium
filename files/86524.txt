A Combination Therapy Including Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy in MSS Rectal Cancer With Resectable Distal Metastasis
Although patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and resectable liver/pulmonary metastasis could benefit from surgery resection, these patients still have a poorer prognosis compared to those without distal metastasis. Based on previous studies, there is no confirmation of whether these patients could benefit from preoperative immunotherapy combined with conventional chemoradiotherapy. This study proposes a combination therapy, preoperative short-course radiotherapy followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, for microsatellite-stable patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and resectable liver/pulmonary metastasis, to assess its impact on tumor retreat, decline of postoperative metastasis and recurrence, and the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients. Besides, this study will provide high-level medical evidence for future clinical treatment of patients with advanced rectal cancer.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: a combination therapy including tislelizumab
NED rate, rate of no evidence of disease for one year, 1 years after treatment
Overall Survival, For patients who still survive when the final analysis takes place, the date of the last 1 contact will be recorded., 5 years after surgery|Disease Free Survival, DFS refers to the period of time between the date of surgery and the day of the patient's tumor recurrence or death (earliest occurrence)., 5 years after surgery|Local Recurrence, The date of recurrence is defined as the date on which an objective examination yields a positive result., 5 years after surgery|Objective Response Rate, Percentage of patients with objective response to primary or metastatic lesions, 5 years after surgery|Tumor Regression Rate, Surgical excision specimens are taken every 1 cm, and the sections are given to at least 2 pathologists for independent scoring, 5 years after surgery|Acute toxicity associated with immunotherapy, According to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 assessment, the proportion of patients with treatment-related acute toxicity developed from the beginning of treatment to 90 days after the end of immunotherapy, from the beginning of treatment to 90 days after the end of immunotherapy
