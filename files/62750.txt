Study of Dosage Exploration and Pharmacokinetics for HA121-28 Tablets
There are 2 phases in this study: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion).

The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of HA121-28 tablets that can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if the dose of HA121-28 tablets found in Phase 1 can help to control advanced cancer.

The safety of HA121-28 tablets will be studied in both phases of the study.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of HA121-28 tablets in Advanced and/or Metastatic Cancer Refractory to Standard Treatment, MTD defined by dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur in the first cycle. DLT defined as any clinically grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity as defined in the NCI CTC v4.0, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Antitumor Efficacy of HA121-28 tablets: RECIST criteria version 1.1., Efficacy evaluation done using RECIST criteria version 1.1., up to 24 weeks
If participants are found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a study group based on when they join this study. Up to 8 groups of up to 20 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 3 groups of up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

If participant is enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of HA121-28 tablets they receive will depend on when they join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of HA121-28 tablets. Each new group will receive a higher dose of HA121-28 tablets than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of HA121-28 tablets is found. If participant is enrolled in Phase 2, they will receive HA121-28 tablets at the low, medium and high doses to select the recommended dose for phase â…¡ clinical trials.
