Icotinib as an Adjuvant Therapy for Patients With Stage IIA-IIIA Adenocarcinoma With EGFR Mutation
Adjuvant therapy has been proved effective in treating earlier stage or less advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib as adjuvant therapy in treating stage IIA-IIIA adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival.
