Phase 1/2 Study of VELCADE® in Combination With Other Drugs to Treat Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Patients
The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with VELCADE, dexamethasone, and Revlimid® (VDR) as well as VELCADE, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, and Revlimid (VDCR) in patients with multiple myeloma who have received no prior treatment. This study will evaluate whether the addition of Revlimid to VELCADE and Dexamethasone will increase the complete response (CR)/ very good partial response (VGPR) rate.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: VELCADE (bortezomib)|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Revlimid (lenalidomide)
Number of Patients With Combined Complete Response and Very Good Partial Response, Complete response requires negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

Very good partial response requires serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \< 100 mg per 24 h, Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression
Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs), Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy, From first dose of study drug through the 30 day post-treatment AE assessment visit|Number of Patients With Overall Response, Overall Response includes complete response and partial response.

Complete response requires negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

Partial response requires at least 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by at least 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hour., Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression|Number of Patients With Stringent Complete Response Rate, Stringent Complete Response is defined as complete response plus normal free light chain (kappa/lambda) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence., Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression|Number of Patients With Complete Response Rate + Near Complete Response Rate, Complete response requires negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

Near Complete response requires positive immunofixation on the serum and/or urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow., Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression|Duration of Response, Duration of response is the time from date of first documented confirmed response to date of first documented progressive disease. A confirmed response is a response that has been observed on at least two consecutive assessments.

Disease progression requires any one or more of the following: serum m-protein increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 0.5 g/dL); Urine m-protein increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 200 mg/24 hr), bone marrow plasma cell percentage increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 10%), new bone lesion or soft tissue plasmacytomas., Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression|Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented progressive disease.

Disease progression requires any one or more of the following: serum m-protein increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 0.5 g/dL); Urine m-protein increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 200 mg/24 hr), bone marrow plasma cell percentage increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 10%), new bone lesion or soft tissue plasmacytomas., Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression|Time to Response, Time to response is defined as time from date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of a confirmed response. confirmed response is a response that has been observed on at least two consecutive assessments., Up to 48 weeks or until disease response|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progressive disease or death.

Disease progression requires any one or more of the following: serum m-protein increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 0.5 g/dL); Urine m-protein increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 200 mg/24 hr), bone marrow plasma cell percentage increase \>= 25% from nadir(absolute increase \>= 10%), new bone lesion or soft tissue plasmacytomas., Up to 48 weeks or until disease progression/death|Probability of 1-year Survival, survival probability at 1 year after randomization|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of death, Up to 48 weeks or until death
