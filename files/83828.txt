CD19 CAR-T Cells With CRS Suppression Technology for r/r CD19+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is a single center,randomized ,two-cohorts, open-label ,phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors treatment for relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|CD19 Positive|Relapse|Refractory
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR-T cells|BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR-T cells with CRS suppression technology
Incidence of severe CRS, The safety of the CD19 CAR-T cells treatment will be evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose will be determined, 30 days after infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells
Overall response of CD19 CAR-T cells treatment who achieve morphology complete remission(CR) and MRD negativity., The efficacy of the CD19 CAR-T cells infusion will be estimated based on the number of participants who have morphology complete remission(CR) and MRD negativity following the CD19 CAR- T cells infusion, 30 days after infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells
Relapsed/refractory CD19 + acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were randomly enrolled in this study to compare the efficacy and safety between two cohorts: 1. CD19 CAR-T cellsï¼› 2. CD19 CAR-T cells with CRS suppression technology.
