Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and the second leading cause of brain metastases (BrM). Despite recent treatment advances, the prognosis of patients with breast cancer BrM remains poor, and the prognosis among those with leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is particularly dire with a median survival of only 2-4 months.

Patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer have a high life-time risk of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, with an approximately 50% lifetime risk. Although the cause of death among patients with breast cancer BrM is challenging to ascertain, approximately 50% of patients with HER2+ BrM are thought to die from central nervous system (CNS) disease involvement. Among patients with LMD specifically, the cause of death is most commonly related to CNS disease.

In an analysis of 430 patients (96 of whom had breast cancer) treated for LMD in the National Cancer Database between 2005 and 2014, those patients treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy had a longer median overall survival of 5 months (3.5 - 6.5 months) compared to patients treated with XRT or chemotherapy alone. In addition, a majority (n=18/26, 69%) of observational studies irrespective of primary tumor site have shown an "improvement or likely improvement" in survival with the use of XRT for LMD, either alone or in combination with systemic therapy. Hence, this proposed study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of XRT followed by systemic therapy (which is considered standard of care) among patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and LMD.
