Modified BEAM Regimen for T Cell Lymphoma Underwent ASCT
A multicenter randomized study on the efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection combined with carmustine, etoposide, and cytarabine (modified BEAM protocol) in the pretreatment of T-cell lymphoma underwent autologous stem cell transplantation
Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation|Conditioning
DRUG: modified BEAM|DRUG: BEAM
relapse rate of T cell lymphoma, relapse rate at three years after transplantation, three years after transplantation
AEs, adverse reactions included gastrointestinal,liver,renal,heart toxicities, from beginning of the conditioning to one month after conditioning|immune reconstruction, the recovery of T, B and NK cells, At 6 months post-transplantation|OS, overall survival, From date of diagnosis until the end of follow-up or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 36 months.|PFS, progression free survival, From date of HSCT until the end of follow-up or the date of disease relapse from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 36 months.
T-cell lymphoma patients with the indication of autologous stem cell transplantation will be divided into two groups，the control group will use BEAM as conditioning regimen and the experiment group will use modified BEAM regimen（included mitoxantrone liposome，then to compare the efficacy and safety of the two conditioning regimens for patients.
