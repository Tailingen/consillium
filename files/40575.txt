An Exploratory Study of Individualized Neo-antigen mRNA Cancer Vaccine InnoPCV in Advanced Solid Tumor Treatment
This is an open-label, prospective, exploratory clinical study, which is divided into two phases: dose escalation phase (Phase Ia) and expansion phase (Phase Ib). After completing the dose-escalation phase (Stage Ia) (5-11 patients), the investigator will select the dose group (RP2D) based on safety, tolerability, and preliminary immune-related characteristics and efficacy data, and choose 2-3 advanced solid tumors to enter the expansion phase (Stage Ib).
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Biological: PD-1|DRUG: Biological: InnoPCV
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Baseline through 90 days after last InnoPCV dose
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Baseline through 90 days after last tislelizumab or sintilimab dose|Neoantigen-specific T cell Response rate, Baseline through 26 weeks after last InnoPCV dose|Objective Response Rate (ORR): Number of Participants with Tumor Response (Partial or Complete), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Baseline through disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria of Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), start of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death and last safety follow-up visit (up to approximately 2 years)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as time from first tumor response (partial or complete) until either radiological disease progression, clinical/symptomatic disease progression or death (whichever is sooner)., Baseline through disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria of Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), start of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death and last safety follow-up visit (up to approximately 2 years)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time between the date of first dose of pembrolizumab and the date of either radiological disease progression, clinical/symptomatic disease progression or death (whichever is sooner)., From baseline to disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria of Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death (up to approximately 2 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time between the date of the first dose of study drug and the date of death due to any cause., From baseline to approximately 2 years
