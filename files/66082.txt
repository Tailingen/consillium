Zanubrutinib-rituximab(ZR) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The proposed study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm and open-ended phase II study in patients over the age of 18 with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma(MCL). The primary objective of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of a new chemo-free treatment pattern zanubrutinib-rituximab(ZR) in newly diagnosed MCL.
Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: zanubrutinib and rituximab|DRUG: zanubrutinib and rituximab|DRUG: BEAM pretreatment|DRUG: zanubrutinib maintenance
Overall Response Rate(ORR) in all patients, The rate of patients who achieved complete response and partial response after ZR combined immunotherapy, At the end of cycle 3 and cycle 5(each cycle is 28 days)|Complete Response Rate(CRR) in all patients, The rate of patients who achieved complete response after ZR combined immunotherapy., At the end of cycle 3 and cycle 5(each cycle is 28 days)|Overall Response Rate(ORR) in patients received ASCT, The rate of patients who achieved complete response and partial response after ASCT., 1 month after ASCT|Complete Response Rate(CRR) in patients received ASCT, The rate of patients who achieved complete response after ASCT., 1 month after ASCT
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be assessed from the first ZR given to date of death or end of follow-up., up to 24 months after the last patient's enrollment.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be assessed from the first ZR given to date of progression, relapse, death or end of follow-up., up to 24 months after the last patient's enrollment.|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-Related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of the therapeutic regimen measured by the incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-Related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events., initiation of study drug until 30 days after last dose.|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), At the end of cycle 5 ZR (each cycle is 28 days) and 1 month after ASCT.
The study will start with an initial 28-days of induction immunotherapy with ZR and 4 cycles of consolidation immunotherapy with ZRï¼Œfollowing imaging examinations to evaluate response rates. Patients who are evaluated as SD and PD will be withdrawn from the trial,while those who achieve PR and CR will be further stratified according to their age and physical status. The older or frail patients who are ineligible for ASCT will take zanubrutinib orally until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who are young and fit for transplantation will receive ASCT consolidation. After ASCT, patients with CR will end therapy and enter the follow-up stage, while patients with PR will continue to take zanubrutinib orally until intolerable toxicity or disease progression.
