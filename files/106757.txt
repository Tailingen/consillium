A Prospective Study of Cabazitaxel in Patients With Non Seminomatous Germ-cell Tumors
Cabazitaxel is a new generation taxane with a high capacity for blood-brain barrier crossing and limited peripheral neuro-toxicity, two major potential advantages in patients with advanced NSGCTs.

Cabazitaxel has a broader in vitro spectrum of activity than docetaxel. Taxanes have demonstrated activity in pre-treated GCTs and are now part of standard treatment, but cabazitaxel has not yet been tested in patients with NSGCT.
Non-seminomatous Germ-cell Tumors
DRUG: Cabazitaxel
Favorable response, To evaluate the favorable response rate of cabazitaxel treatment in patients with highly-pretreated nonseminomatous germ-cell tumors (NSGCT), Assessed every 6 weeks from start of treatment up to 72 months
Response rate on brain metastases, MRI of the brain every 6 weeks only in case of brain metastases detected at baseline and for all patients at the end of the study.

Evaluation will be made using RECIST V1.1, Assessed every 6 weeks after treatment start up to 72 months|Progression free survival, Assessed every 6 weeks from treatment start to progression up to 72 months|Overall survival, Assessed every 3 weeks after treatment start up to 72 months
