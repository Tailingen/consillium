A Research Registry on Aggressive PitNETs
To allow the identification of markers, it is necessary to extend research networks more widely to collect and properly explore aggressive pituitary tumours. The multidisciplinary consultation meeting (RCP), organised by the reference centre for rare diseases of the pituitary gland, dedicated to aggressive pituitary tumours and carcinomas (HYPOcare), which is unique in France and brings together national experts, currently makes it possible to orientate the management of patients with an aggressive pituitary tumour. With more than 80 patient files discussed since its inception, the patient cohort via the HYPOcare RCP is one of the largest both nationally and internationally. At present, this data source is only dedicated to the clinical management of the files without the possibility of carrying out research work
