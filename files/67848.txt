Radioactive Stents for Treatment of Unresectable Biliary Tract Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether radioactive stents and common used plastic stents are effective and safety in the treatment of unresectable biliary tract cancer.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma of the Extrahepatic Bile Duct|Ampullary Carcinoma|Biliary Obstruction
DEVICE: radioactive stent|DEVICE: plastic stent
Tumor Response rate, The investigators will conduct CT test or MRI scan after the implantation of the stents in order to measure the tumor size of each patients and evaluate the best tumor response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0)., 3 months
Progression-free survival, In order to research the progression-free survival, the investigators will check the presence of progression disease for each patients until the date of disease progression or death., 6 months|overall survival, Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization until the date of death., follow-up in interval of stent insertion and death (1 years)|Adverse events, Individual adverse events, 1 year
Patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or ampullary carcinoma) were enrolled and placed with a stent loaded with radioactive seeds (irradiation stent group) or a conventional plastic stent (traditional stent group). After stent placement, the outcomes were compared in terms of tumor response, progression-free survival, overall survival time, and complications related to the procedures.
