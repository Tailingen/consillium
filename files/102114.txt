BDB001-102: Open Label Dose Escalation of BDB001 in Combination w Atezolizumab
A Phase 1 Open-label Dose Escalation Study of BDB001 in Combination with Atezolizumab in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
Tumor, Solid
DRUG: BDB001 (EIK1001)|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Safety and Tolerability: incidence of adverse events and any dose limiting toxicity, Safety and tolerability of BDB001 in combination with atezolizumab as measured by the incidence of adverse events and any dose limiting toxicities (DLT), up to 21 months|Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Determination of the MTD or RP2D by assessing the frequency and severity of adverse events related to BDB001 when given in combination with atezolizumab using CTCAE version 5.0 to categorize adverse event severity, from first dose to 21 days after first dose for each patient
Radiographic Determination of Tumor Response after BDB001 in combination with atezolizumab dosing, Radiographic determination of tumor response in subjects dosed with BDB001 and atezolizumab using irRECIST, At the beginning of Cycle 3 (every cycle is 21 days) up to 30 months after the first dose for each patient
This clinical trial is a study of an experimental drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist that activates the immune system.

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDB001 in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) in subjects with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors who have relapsed or are refractory to standard treatment or for whom there is no approved therapy.

This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1 study of BDB001 in combination with atezolizumab.

The study will be conducted in two separate but independent parts: a dose escalation part with BDB001 and atezolizumab and a dose expansion part of BDB001 in combination with atezolizumab.
