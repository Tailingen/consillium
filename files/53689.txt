Neoadjuvant Study of Pyrotinib and Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in Patients With HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, open-label,multicenter Phase II study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2 positive early stage or locally advanced breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib+Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR), through study completion, an average of 1 year
Event-free survival, Following surgery until Year 3|Disease-free Survival, Following surgery until Year 3|Distance Disease-free Survival, Following surgery until Year 3|Objective Response Rate, Baseline up to cycle 4 (assessed at Baseline, at the time of pre-surgery) up to approximately 12 months
The investigators hypothesized that the experimental group (Pyrotinib+Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+ Carboplatin) could have a higher Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate than the control group (Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+ Carboplatin) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

It is proposed that 268 participants will be enrolled in this study. The target population is women with early breast cancer (stage of T2-3N0-3M0) who are eligible for primary systemic therapy.

The primary objective of the trial is to determine the pCR rate. The secondary objective of the trial is to determine the Event-free survival(EFS), Disease-free Survival (DFS), Distance Disease-free Survival (DDFS), Objective Response Rate (ORR) rate.
