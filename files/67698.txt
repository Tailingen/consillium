Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of CPO102, an Anti-claudin 18.2 ADC in Patients With Advanced Cancers
This Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, single agent, dose escalation and dose expansion study conducted in patients with advanced late stage cancer (pancreatic or gastric including esophageal junction cancers) for which the investigator determines there to be no other standard of care or higher priority therapies available.
Pancreatic Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: CPO102
Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation period., DLTs are assessed during the first cycle (21 days) in each cohort to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)., through study completion, an average of 3 year

This Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, single agent, dose escalation and dose expansion study conducted in patients with advanced late stage cancer (pancreatic or gastric including esophageal junction cancers) for which the investigator determines there to be no other standard of care or higher priority therapies available. All patients must have failed standard first or later lines of systemic therapy.

The study design overview is presented below. The study will consist of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Part A will explore once every 3 weeks (Q3W) dosing per standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Upon attaining a RP2D, Part B will commence in 2 groups, in approximately 15 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and 15 patients with advanced gastric including gastric esophageal junction cancers. Part B will seek to confirm the RP2D and will also seek early signals of efficacy in the selected cancer patient populations.
