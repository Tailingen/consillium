Hyperthermia With Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of deep regional hyperthermia in the context of radiochemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.

Questions it aims to answer are:

* Can surgery be avoided if the tumor completely regresses?
* How high is the Local re-growth rate
* Is the treatment safe?
* Assessment of the Quality of life
* Rate of sphincter-sparing surgery
* Pathological staging, tumor downstaging
* Assessment of continence during the course of therapy

Participants will:

Undergo radiochemotherapy with or without addition of hyperthermia (50:50 randomisation) followed by standard consolidation chemotherapy. After treatment response evaluation surgery or non-operative management takes place.

Two-year TME-free survival (TMEFS), The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of deep regional hyperthermia in the context of radiochemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. As the primary endpoint two-year TME-free survival will be used (TMEFS)., From September 2024 until September 2036
In this prospective, randomized phase III trial "Radiochemotherapy with concomitant deep regional hyperthermia in locally advanced rectal cancer" trial it is hypothesized that with the addition of hyperthermia complete response rates can be further increased resulting in a higher number of patients who can omit surgery in favor of organ preservation and a surveillance protocol. Patients receive radiochemotherapy with 5-FU or capecitabine followed by standard consolidation chemotherapy with 5-FU/folinic acid/oxaliplatin or CAPOX. Hyperthermia will take place based on a 1:1 randomisation. After evaluation of treatment response in week 22 patients will either undergo surgical resection in case of residual tumor or non-operative management when a clinical complete response is seen or repeat evaluation after another 3 months in case of a near clinical complete response. In selected cases endoscopic procedures can be considered as an alternative to radical surgery.The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of deep regional hyperthermia in the context of radiochemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. As the primary endpoint TME-free survival will be used (TMEFS).
