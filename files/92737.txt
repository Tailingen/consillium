Exploratory Study of BO-112 in Adult Patients With Aggressive Solid Tumors
Part 1: 16 to 32 patients with aggressive solid tumors from whom biopsies can be obtained, will receive BO-112 through IT administration.

Injected lesions must be palpable and biopsiable at the time of injection, and biopsied after 7-14 days. Patients will not receive an alternative therapy during the period comprising from first and second biopsy. BO-112 will be administered at a starting dose. Upon confirmation of the safety profile of the starting dose and evaluation of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, three additional dose levels are expected to be tested.

During the course of the study, subjects will be examined for any side effects that may occur (safety and tolerability).

Additionally this study will also study BO-112 biological activity, the innate and adaptive immune system response and signaling pathways, as well as signs of clinical relevance, will be studied.

Part 2: An additional 30 patients with progressive disease while on anti-PD1 treatment for an approved indication, will receive BO-112 through IT administration in combination with the anti-PD1 treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination.

Injected lesions must be palpable and biopsiable at the time of injection. Patients will continue with their anti-PD1 treatment. During the course of the study, patients will be examined for any side effects that may occur (safety and tolerability).

Cancer
DRUG: Part 1: BO-112|DRUG: Part 2: BO-112
Number of subjects with adverse events, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of B0-112 in terms of adverse events at every visit, Part 1: Day 30 after administration of the last dose. Part 2: 12 weeks and for patients who continue up to 1 year
Circulating cytokines including type I IFNs, TNFalpha and IL6 (by ELISA), Part 1: At three independent points during the study. Day 7-1 prior to administration, 24 hours after administration and 7-14 days after administration of the agent. Part 2: 12 weeks|Plasma levels of BO-112, To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BO-112 by measuring the amount in plasma at regular timepoints during the study, Part 1: 0-15-30-240 minutes and 24 hours after administration of the drug. Part 2: 1 day|Anti-tumor activity, Part 2 only: To evaluate the antitumor activity of the combination of BO-112 and anti-PD1 treatment, 12 weeks and for patients who continue up to 1 year
