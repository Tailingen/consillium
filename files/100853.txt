First-in-human Study of Interferon-y PET Imaging to Assess Response to Immunotherapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the use of \[89Zr\]Zr-DFO-emapalumab as an IFN-γ PET imaging agent to detect lesions and response to therapy among treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. PET scans following the imaging agent will be completed prior to and about 30 days after starting immunotherapy.

Participants will be enrolled into the clinical trial once confirmed eligible. Screening activities include, standard of care blood work, medical history and a physical exam.

-Within 14 days of starting immunotherapy, participants will complete PET scans 1-2 hours post-tracer administration, again on the day following tracer administration, and 3-5 days after the tracer administration. This sequence may be repeated 25-45 days after the start of treatment with immunotherapy for a total of two tracer injections and up to six PET scans.
