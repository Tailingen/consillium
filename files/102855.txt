Intratumoral Dendritic Cell Vaccination Combined With Local Radiotherapy in Patients With Recurrent Lymphoma.
The purpose of the study is to gather data on feasibility and on immune and clinical efficacy of intratumoral dendritic cell (DC) vaccination in combination with local radiotherapy in patients with recurrent lymphoma

Lymphoma is extremely sensitive to radiation and is a commonly used therapy. The major issue in application of local radiotherapy is the relative short duration of response and as a consequence is used mainly for palliation. Therefore novel therapies are needed to improve the outcome of patients with lymphomas. The potential specificity of the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumor cells is especially relevant in lymphoma. Immune responses are induced, coordinated and regulated by dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent antigen-presenting cells. Based on the central role of DCs in initiating immune responses, four vaccinations will be administered at intervals beginning two days after low dose radiation is given to the tumor site.
