The Therapeutic Evaluation(Both Short-term and Long-term Outcome) of Minimal Invasive Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy for Left-sided Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Pancreatic cancer is regarded as "the king of cancer". It is extremely malignant, with a low sensibility to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a poor prognosis. Surgical treatment is very important for pancreatic cancer. Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) is a standard method for treating pancreatic cancer at the body and tail of pancreas. In the same surgical approach, the investigators are going to compare and discuss the advantages of laparoscopic and open RAMPS in the RCT study.

Open RAMPS is widely used now to treat pancreatic cancer at the body and tail of pancreas. Meanwhile, laparoscopic surgery is proved to have many advantages in other operations. According to primary retrospective study of open and laparoscopic RAMPS, there was no statistically significant difference in the long-term follow-up situations between these two groups, indicating the safety of both this two surgical approaches. The investigators would like to promote a prospective RCT study, to give more evidences of the superiority of laparoscopic RAMPS.
