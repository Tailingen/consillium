A Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Preliminary Efficacy of the Combination of Ibrutinib With Nivolumab in Participants With Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), follicular cell lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Once the dose is optimized, the combination will be assessed for Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy, further safety in participants with CLL/SLL, FL or DLBCL and in participants with Richter syndrome.

DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Nivolumab
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008: Disease Cohort, ORR is percentage of participants achieving a complete response (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR) or PR. IWCLL 2008 criteria: CR- No lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, no constitutional symptoms, neutrophils \>1.5\*10\^9/L, platelets \>100\*10\^9/L, Hgb \>11 g/dL and absolute lymphocyte count \<4000/mcL; CRi- CR with incomplete recovery of bone marrow; nPR- participants meet criteria for CR, but the bone marrow biopsy shows B-lymphoid nodules, may represent a clonal infiltrate; PR- \>=50% drop in lymphocyte count from baseline or \<=4.0\*10\^9/L with following: \>=50% decrease in sum products of up to 6 lymph nodes, no new enlarged lymph nodes, When abnormal, \>=50% decrease in enlargement of spleen from baseline or normalization and a response in 1 of following: Neutrophils \>1.5\*10\^9/L, Platelets\>100000/mcL and Hgb\>11 g/dL or \>=50% improvement over baseline in all. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arm only., Up to 6 years 11 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), Cheson 2014: Disease Cohort, ORR defined as percentage of participants achieving a CR, CRi, nPR or PR. As per Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Cheson 2014, CR is complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. PR is \>= 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. Progressive disease (PD) \>= 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arms only., Up to 6 years 11 months|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs): Study Cohort, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/ biological agent under study. TEAEs for the treatment phase included events with an onset date/time on or after the start of study intervention through end of study were considered as treatment-emergent., Up to 6 years 10 months
Duration of Response (DoR): Study Cohort, DOR is defined as the interval between the date of initial documentation of a response including partial response with lymphocytosis (PRL) and date of first documented evidence of progressive disease or death or date of censoring. iWCLL 2008 criteria for progressive disease: New enlarged nodes \>1.5 cm, new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other organ infiltrates; \>= 50% increase from nadir in existing lymph node or \>=50% increase from nadir in sum of product of diameters of multiple nodes; \>=50% increase from nadir in enlargement of liver or spleen; \>=50% increase from baseline in lymphocyte count (\>=5\*10\^9/L) unless considered treatment-related lymphocytosis; new cytopenia (Hemoglobin b or platelets) attributable to CLL; transformation to a more aggressive histology., Up to 6 years 11 months|Duration of Stable Disease or Better: Study Cohort, Duration of stable disease or better was defined as duration from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression were met. IWCLL 2008 criteria for progressive disease: New enlarged nodes \>1.5 cm, new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other organ infiltrates; \>= 50% increase from nadir in existing lymph node or \>=50% increase from nadir in sum of product of diameters of multiple nodes; \>=50% increase from nadir in enlargement of liver or spleen; \>=50% increase from baseline in lymphocyte count (and to \>=5\*10\^9/L) unless considered treatment-related lymphocytosis; new cytopenia (Hemoglobin b or platelets) attributable to CLL; transformation to a more aggressive histology., Up to 6 years and 11 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS): Study Cohort, PFS is defined as the duration from the date of first dose of study drug until the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (or relapse for participants who experience CR during the study) or death, whichever comes first. Participants who were progression-free and alive or had unknown status were censored at the last tumor assessment. IWCLL 2008 criteria for progressive disease: New enlarged nodes \>1.5 cm, new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other organ infiltrates; \>= 50% increase from nadir in existing lymph node or \>=50% increase from nadir in sum of product of diameters of multiple nodes; \>=50% increase from nadir in enlargement of liver or spleen; \>=50% increase from baseline in lymphocyte count (and to \>=5\*10\^9/L) unless considered treatment-related lymphocytosis; new cytopenia (Hemoglobin b or platelets) attributable to CLL; transformation to a more aggressive histology., Up to 6 years 11 months|Overall Survival (OS): Study Cohort, OS was defined as duration from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the participant's death., Up to 6 years 11 months|Percentage of Participants With Lymphoma-related Symptoms: Study Cohort, Percentage of participants with lymphoma-related symptoms were reported. These symptoms included B-symptoms, recurrent fever, night sweats, weight loss, other disease-related symptoms, itching, fatigue, physical discomfort and any other., Up to 6 years 11 months
This is an open-label study, which consists of Part A (Dose Optimization Cohorts) and Part B (Expansion Cohorts). Part A consists of two dose optimization cohorts (cohort A1 and cohort A2) will determine the RP2D for the combination based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic assessments in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Part B consists 3 participant populations to further evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab: Cohort B1 (participants with CLL/SLL with del 17p or del 11q), Cohort B2 (participants with FL), Cohort B3 (participants with DLBCL) and Cohort B4 (participants with Richter syndrome). Part A and B will consist of Screening Period (28 days before enrollment), Treatment Period and Follow up Period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). Participants will receive nivolumab intravenously (Day 1 of every cycle) and ibrutinib orally once daily on a 14-day cycle. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) and International Working Group (IWG) for lymphoma guidelines. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study. Further exploration of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and biomarker information will be assessed throughout the trial.
