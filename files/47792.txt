Efficacy and Safety Study of Trastuzumab, Paclitaxel and Carboplatin on HER2+ Preoperative Breast Cancer
To compare the efficacy in terms of the pathological complete response rate (pCR) to preoperative administration of qw or q3w Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Trastuzumab (PCH)
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab QW, Trastuzumab Q3W
Primary Endpoint is efficacy. To compare the efficacy in terms of the pathological complete response rate (pCR) to preoperative administration of qw or q3w Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Trastuzumab (PCH)., Primary Endpoint is efficacy. To compare the efficacy in terms of the pathological complete response rate (pCR) to preoperative administration of qw or q3w Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Trastuzumab (PCH). The primary efficacy variable is the rate of pathological complete response (pCR). Time to recurrence will be measured as the time from when the patient was randomized to the time the patient is first recorded as having disease recurrence or the date of death if the patient dies due to causes other than disease recurrence., 3 years from last patient randomized
Currently Herceptin has moved to Neoadjuvant treatment combined with chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and Carboplatin are two of the best partners with high pCR. The significant efficacy and good safety profile of HerceptinÂ® combination with taxane as adjuvant treatment on EBC are accepted; 1 year of Herceptin as adjuvant treatment is one standard therapy. This study is one small Phase II trial to explore the efficacy and safety of QW and Q3W of PCH as Neoadjuvant treatment, we only plan 60 pts and the trend of the two curves is anticipated
