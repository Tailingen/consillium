A Study of QBI-139 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purposes of this trial are:

* To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of QBI-139 in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of QBI-139 in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors.

Patients will receive QBI-139 by IV infusion over at least one hour once weekly for three weeks. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of QBI-139 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
