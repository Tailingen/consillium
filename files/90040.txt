A Study of Tegavivint (BC2059) in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study will be conducted in 2 parts. The first part is a phase 1 single-agent dose escalation,optimization, and expansion study of tegavivint in patients with advanced HCC after failure of at least one line of prior systemic therapy. In the second part of the study, the combination of tegavivint plus pembrolizumab will be assessed with a limited dose escalation followed by a randomized dose optimization.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Tegavivint|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Cabozantinib
Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Adverse events will be assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, from the date of the first dose of study medication up to 90 days following last dose of study medication or initiation of new systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, an average of 1 year.|Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, Dose limiting toxicities defined as a Grade 3 or greater adverse event as assessed by NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 (excluding toxicities clearly related to the underlying disease \[HCC\], disease progression, concomitant medications, or baseline concurrent medical conditions),and that meets any of the criteria included in Table 6-5., Within a 28-day period after first dose of the study medication as a single agent or in combination with cabozantinib or lenvatinib.|Evaluate efficacy of tegavivint as a single agent, Evaluate efficacy of tegavivint as a single agent in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Tumors will be assessed at baseline and every 8 weeks until end of treatment, an average of 1 year
Evaluate efficacy of combination of tegavivint plus cabozantinib, If sufficient clinical benefit is observed with tegavivint single agent, the efficacy of the combination of tegavivint plus cabozantinib will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Tumors will be assessed at baseline and every 8 weeks until end of treatment, an average of 1 year|Evaluate efficacy of combination of tegavivint plus lenvatinib, If sufficient clinical benefit is observed with tegavivint single agent, the efficacy of the combination of tegavivint plus lenvatinib will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Tumors will be assessed at baseline and every 8 weeks until end of treatment, an average of 1 year
This study will be conducted in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.

Tegavivint will be administered as a single agent first in a dose escalation and optimization design. Single agent dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 design to determine the tegavivint maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Upon completion of the dose escalation design and review of all available safety, efficacy, PK and PD data the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will recommend two dose levels for dose selection optimization. The dose selection optimization will expand the two dose levels to approximately 20 patients randomized (1:1) per dose level (approximately 40 patients total) before declaring the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

If sufficient clinical benefit is observed, the combination of tegavivint plus cabozantinib and tegavivint plus lenvatinib will be explored in the second part of the study. The second part of the study will begin with a brief dose escalation part for each combination (tegavivint plus cabozantinib or tegavivint plus lenvatinib). The starting dose level of tegavivint will be decided by the SRC and will start at either one dose level below the MTD or at a lower dose as defined by the SRC. The dose escalations will follow a standard 3+3 design, and the dose escalation increments for tegavivint will follow the monotherapy dose escalation schedule to determine the combinations MTDs. Upon completion of the combination dose escalations, approximately 12 additional patients will be enrolled in each combination arm at the tegavivint combination MTDs.
