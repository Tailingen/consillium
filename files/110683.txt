Phase III Study of SyB L-0501 in Combination With Rituximab to Treat Recurrent/Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of SyB L-0501 in combination with rituximab in patients with recurrent/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Assess the Efficacy and Safety of SyB L-0501 in Combination With Rituximab in Patients With Recurrent or Relapsed DLBCL
DRUG: Rituximab
Overall Response Rate, Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) Determined on the Basis of Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Revised RC 2007), up to 30 weeks
Complete Response (CR) Rate, Determined on the Basis of Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Revised RC 2007), up to 30 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS = day of the first PFS event - day of start of study treatment + 1, up to 30 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is the period from the date of achieving CR, or PR in the responders to the earliest onset date of any progression events calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The median and the 95% Confidence Interval (CI ) were calculated using Greenwood's formula., up to 30 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Death due to any given cause was defined as an event. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The median and the 95% CI were calculated using Greenwood's formula., up to 30 weeks.
Primary Objective is to determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate on the basis of Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, of SyB L-0501 at 120 mg/m\^2/day on Day 2 and Day 3 in combination with rituximab at 375 mg/m\^2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in patients with recurrent/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
