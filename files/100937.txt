Post-Market Surveillance Study of ALK-Positive Advanced NSCLC Participants Treated With Iruplinalkib
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of participants diagnosed with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are being treated with Iruplinalkib or planned to receive Iruplinalkib treatment in real-world clinical practice.
NSCLC
The incidence of adverse drug reactions in the overall population, At enrollment and every 3 months thereafter (up to 3 years)
The incidence of greater than or equal to grade 3 AEs, SAEs, AEs resulting in dose reduction/interruption/discontinuation, AESIs, and AEs resulting in death in the overall population, At enrollment and every 3 months thereafter (up to 3 years)|Real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) for 1L treatment with Iruplinalkib, From the first administration of Iruplinalkib to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 3 years).|Time to treatment failure (TTF) for 1L treatment with Iruplinalkib, From the first administration of Iruplinalkib to the date of first documentation of discontinuation of Iruplinalkib due to any cause (up to 3 years).|Event to first follow-up treatment or death (TFST) for 1L treatment with Iruplinalkib, From the first administration of Iruplinalkib to the date of first documentation of initiation of next line of treatment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 3 years).
