Low Dose Naltrexone for Metastatic Melanoma, Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer and Renal Cancer
will scientifically evaluate whether Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) has activity in refractory solid tumors within the context of a phase II clinical study
Melanoma|Prostate Cancer|Renal Cancer
DRUG: Naltrexone
Number of Responses to Low Dose Naltrexone for Patients With Advanced Melanoma, Castrate Refractory Prostate Cancer (CRPC) or Renal Cancer Via RECIST, Response will be assessed via RECIST 1.1 criteria utilizing interval CT scans and physical exam after every 3 cycles of treatment (i.e. every 12 weeks)., approximately every 3 months CT, every month physical, up to 6 months
To Assess the Toxicity Associated With Low Dose Naltrexone for Melanoma, CRPC and Renal Cancer., Defined by number of patients who experienced a SAE, 3 months
Three types of solid tumors will be studied in this protocol: Melanoma, castrate resistant prostate cancer and kidney cancer. Systemic chemotherapy may weaken the immune system reducing the potential for response to LDN. Therefore, patients must either have not had previous chemotherapy or patients must not have received more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen which must have been completed at least 6 months prior to LDN. Systemic chemotherapy has at best modest activity in melanoma, CRPC and renal cancer.

* Melanoma will be evaluated since the responding patient at the Miriam Hospital had melanoma. Immunomodulatory agents such as ipilimumab have already demonstrated a survival advantage in melanoma.
* Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC): It is common in CRPC for patients to have rising PSA after failure of androgen deprivation. These patients may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and there is reluctance to initiate treatment with systemic chemotherapy with standard docetaxel since this agent has substantial toxicity and will impair quality of life. Waiting until symptomatic disease progression in patients with CRPC and rising PSA is a commonly utilized strategy. These patients are excellent candidates for a treatment with minimal toxicity such as LDA. The immunomodulatory agent Sipuleucel also improves survival in prostate cancer suggesting that an agent such as LDN could also be helpful.
* Renal cancer will also be studied since this is a disease that has activity with immunomodulants such as IL-2 and interferon. Targeted therapies are generally used for renal cancer. Chemotherapy has minimal activity so most patients are chemotherapy-naive.
