Pegcrisantaspase in Combination With Venetoclax for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML)
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of pegcrisantaspase in combination with venetoclax (Ven-PegC) and estimate the maximum tolerated doses and/or biologically active doses of Ven-PegC in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)

This research study is a non-randomized, open-label Phase Ib clinical trial evaluating venetoclax (Ven) administered orally daily in combination with pegcrisantaspase (PegC) administered IV biweekly, as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML).

The trial will consist of dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ven-PegC and estimate the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and/or biologically active doses (e.g. recommended phase 2 doses \[RP2Ds\]) of Ven-PegC in patients with R/R AML

Venetoclax is an FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved drug, but this combination ( Ven-PegC) has not been approved by the FDA.
