IN10018 in Combination With Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) vs. Placebo in Combination With PLD for the Treatment of Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IN10018 in combination with PLD vs. placebo in combination with PLD in subjects with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers).

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IN10018 in combination with PLD vs. placebo in combination with PLD in subjects with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers).

Approximately 168 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2: 1 ratio to receive IN10018 in combination with PLD treatment (Experimental Arm, N = approx. 112) or placebo of IN10018 in combination with PLD (Control Arm, N = approx. 56). Subjects will be stratified by prior bevacizumab use (yes or no) and platinum free interval (PFI, \< 3 months or 3-6 months).

Subjects will be randomized to one of following treatment arms. The investigator should follow the clinical study protocol, the approved label of these drugs and/or institutional standard of care.

* Experimental Arm: IN10018 100 mg QD orally (PO) plus PLD 40 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks (Q4W) intravenously (IV).
* Control Arm: Placebo of IN10018 100 mg QD orally (PO) plus PLD 40 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks (Q4W) intravenously (IV).
