A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/r With or Without Dasabuvir and With or Without Ribavirin in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 or 4 Infected Adults With Successfully Treated Early Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r), with or without dasabuvir (DSV) coadministered with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in adult patients with genotype 1 or genotype 4 chronic HCV infection and treated early stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma with compensated cirrhosis.
Chronic Hepatitis C Infection
DRUG: ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir|DRUG: ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir|DRUG: ribavirin
Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks Post-treatment (SVR12), SVR12 was defined as plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than the lower limit of quantification \[\<LLOQ\]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Participants with missing data after flanking imputation were imputed as nonresponders., 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug
Percentage of Participants With On-treatment Virologic Failure, On-treatment virologic failure was defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after HCV RNA \< LLOQ during treatment; confirmed increase of \> 1 log(subscript)10(subscript) IU/mL above the lowest value post-baseline in HCV RNA during treatment; or HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ throughout treatment with at least 6 weeks of treatment., Baseline (Day 1) and Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 (end of treatment for 12-week treatment), 16, 20 and 24 (end of treatment for 12-week treatment)|Percentage of Participants With Post-treatment Relapse, Post-treatment relapse was defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants who completed treatment with HCV RNA levels \< LLOQ at the end of treatment., From the end of treatment through 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug|Percentage of Participants With Long Term Clinical Outcomes, The percentage of participants with long term clinical outcomes (de novo hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions, liver decompensation, unexpected liver transplant, liver related death, or any of the above) from first dose of study drug through 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up., up to 48 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Recurrent HCV Infection Post Liver Transplant, The percentage of participants with recurrent HCV infection post liver transplant out of all participants with liver transplant during the study., from liver transplant to 24 weeks post-treatment (up to 48 weeks)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r), with or without dasabuvir (DSV) coadministered with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in adult patients with genotype 1 or genotype 4 chronic HCV infection and treated early stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma with compensated cirrhosis.
