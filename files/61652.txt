DECIDE: Developing Tools for Lung Cancer Screening Discussion Improvement
The purpose of this study is to learn about discussion between clinicians and their patients related to lung screening. Survey answers will be collected from both clinicians and their patients.

Key Components of Shared Decision Making Process That Predict Patient-perceived Lung Cancer Screening Decision Quality, Decisional Quality was measured using the multidimensional Decisional Conflict Scale, a 16-item Likert-response scale that was modified by the investigators for the lung cancer screening context. The total score ranging from 0 to 64. This total score is commonly transformed into a standardized score that falls within a 0 to 100 range. Decisional quality measured on this numeric scale from which lower scores represent lower decisional conflict and, therefore, higher decisional quality. Scores below 25 have been associated with low decisional conflict., at baseline (study enrollment)
