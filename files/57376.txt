Combination ATR and PARP Inhibitor (CAPRI) Trial With AZD6738 and Olaparib in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
Investigational agent, AZD6738 will be given in combination with Olaparib to women with recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant).

This study will determine if using Olaparib in combination with AZD6738 is safe and tolerable and also determine the objective response rate and progression free survival of combination of AZD6738 and Olaparib in women with recurrent ovarian cancer in distinct platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cohorts.
