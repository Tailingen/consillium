Trial of ARQ 197 in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Who Have Failed One Prior Systemic Therapy
This is a global randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded Phase 2 study designed to compare treatment of ARQ 197 versus placebo in patients with unresectable HCC who had radiographic disease progression after systemic first line therapy or were unable to tolerate the therapy.
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ARQ 197|DRUG: Placebo
Evaluate time to progression among all patients treated with ARQ 197 compared to placebo, Patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or another discontinuation criterion is met
Evaluate progression-free survival, overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate among all patients treated with ARQ 197 compared to placebo., Patients will be evaluated for these endpoints every 6 weeks|Evaluate objective response rate in crossover population following radiographic disease progression on placebo., Patients will be evaluated for these endpoints every 6 weeks|Further characterize the safety of ARQ 197 in patients with unresectable HCC, While on therapy, patients will be evaluated for safety every 4 weeks|Further evaluate pharmacokinetics of ARQ 197., Patients will be evaluated monthly for the first 3 months
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ARQ 197 or placebo. The treatment assignment will be stratified based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), and vascular invasion status. The treatment with ARQ 197 or placebo will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion listed in this protocol is met.

After radiographic disease progression is documented, treatment assignment will be unblinded. Patients who were assigned to placebo arm and had documented radiographic disease progression will have the option to receive ARQ 197 and will be evaluated for objective response rate and disease control rate continuously.

The study will continue until 78 total time to progression events are reached. At the end of study, all remaining patients still on treatment will have the option to be rolled over to another study to continue their treatment.
