Knowledge of human papillomavirus, This Spanish-language questionnaire is intended to measure knowledge about HPV. It is structured by 38 questions, distributed in four dimensions: 1) causal agent of HPV (1, 2 and 3); 2) risk factors (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15); 3) signs and symptoms (16, 17, 18, 19 and 20) and 4) prevention, diagnosis and treatment (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38).

The structure for answering each of the questions is through a Likert-type scale, where three possible options are presented: A= true, B= false and C= don't know. To obtain the cut-off points of the instrument, percentiles (zero to 100) will be used, where Percentile 1 (P125) = no knowledge, Percentile 2 (P250) = insufficient knowledge, Percentile 3 (P375) = fair knowledge and Percentile 4 (P4100) = adequate knowledge, 1 month
Personal Motivation, To measure personal motivation (self-determination), the Personal Motivation Questionnaire adapted to the Mexican context. It consists of 13 items, which address the preventive behaviors performed by the homosexual male as a result of an emotional-cognitive process, derived from the values and beliefs related to knowledge of HPV, which are manifested during the nursing consultation, through the intervention "Safe and Protected Sex". The response form is Likert type: 1= Strongly agree, 2=Significantly agree, 3= Agree, 4= Neither agree nor disagree, 5= Disagree, 6= Strongly disagree, 7= Strongly disagree, also the score ranges from 13 to 91 points, however for a better interpretation of the data the values are converted into a scale from 0 to 100, where high scores indicate a higher personal motivation during the nursing consultation.

The validity of the instrument was through eight experts, which yielded a content validity index, 1 month|social motivation, To measure social motivation (controlled behavior), the Social Motivation Questionnaire adapted to the Mexican context . It consists of 15 items, which deal with the actions that the homosexual male has derived from the social support perceived during the nursing consultancy with horizontal methodology, granted through the intervention "Safe and Protected Sex" directed towards HPV. The response form is Likert type: 1= Strongly agree, 2= Strongly agree, 3= Agree, 4= Neither agree nor disagree, 5= Disagree, 6= Strongly disagree, 7= Strongly disagree, also the score ranges from 15 to 105 points, however for a better interpretation of the data the values are converted into a scale from 0 to 100, where high scores indicate a higher extrinsic motivation during the nursing consultation., 1 month
Introduction: The World Health Organization reports a 21% prevalence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in men, with rates reaching 93% among homosexual men. This group exhibits specific characteristics, such as high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to multiple partners and inconsistent condom use, along with limited knowledge about HPV. The intervention "Safe and Protected Sex", using a horizontal methodology, aims to address this health issue.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of the "Safe and Protected Sex" program on HPV knowledge among homosexual men.

Methodology: A quasi-experimental study with a test-retest design and convenience sampling. The sample size was calculated using n'Query Advisor 4.0, resulting in 20 homosexual men per group (n=40).
