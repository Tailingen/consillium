Study Evaluating ISM8207 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to study ISM8207 in participants with advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ISM8207 orally administered in participants with advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma
