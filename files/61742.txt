99mTc-PSMA-I&S Biodistribution in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This exploratory study conducted under the RDRC program studies the biodistribution of 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S in patients with prostate cancer who undergo pelvic lymph node dissection. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radio-guided surgery uses the preoperative intravenous administration of a PSMA-ligand called PSMA-imaging and surgery (I\&S) labeled with the gamma-emitter radioisotope Technetium-99m (99mTc). Giving 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S may detect PSMA-expressing lymph nodes during surgery using a gamma probe and may help guide doctors to detect prostate cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.

DRUG: 99mTc-based PSMA Imaging and Surgery Agent|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
The biodistribution of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S in normal and malignant tissues of patients with prostate cancer will be measured by average and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax), time from injection to imaging (range: 1-46 hours)
99mTc-PSMA-I&S accumulation within tumor lesions observed by in-vivo SPECT (SUVmean and SUVmax) will be correlated with ex-vivo gamma measurements (counts/minute) and level of PSMA expression quantified by histopathology (IHC score), time from injection to imaging (range: 1-46 hours)|The best time-point for 99mTc-PSMA-I&S radioguided surgery will be determined by the tumor-to-background uptake ratio (TBR) using the time-activity curve function, time from injection to imaging (range: 1-46 hours)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To define the biodistribution of 99mTc-based PSMA imaging and surgery agent (99mTc-PSMA-I\&S) in normal and malignant tissues of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) with histopathology validation, when available.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To correlate the 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S accumulation within tumor lesions observed by in-vivo single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ex-vivo gamma measurements and level of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression quantified by histopathology, when available.

II. To define the best time-point for radio-guided surgery (RGS) with the highest tumor-to-background ratio following 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S administration.

OUTLINE:

The first 5 patients receive an initial dose of 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S intravenously (IV) followed by 5 SPECT/CT scans at 3-5, 5-20, 17-21, 25-29, and 40-46 hours later. These 5 patients then receive a second dose of 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S IV and then undergo standard of care surgery. All subsequent patients receive one dose of 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S IV before surgery.
