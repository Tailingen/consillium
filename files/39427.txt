The Value of MRI in Assessing the Status of Retroperitoneal Resection Margin in Colon Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the value of colon MRI in assessing the status of retroperitoneal resection margin (RPRM) for advanced colon cancer.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Concordance between MRI suspected RPRM positive and pathologically confirmed positive.
* Can RPRM-positive patients undergo beyond complete mesocolic excision (CME) surgery in order to achieve R0 resection?

Participants will undergo colon MRI examination and once MRI suspects RPRM positive, they will receive beyond CME surgery.
