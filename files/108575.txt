Impact of a Collaborative Program of Physical Activity of Newly-diagnosed Cancer Patients
During the last twenty years, the cancer overall incidence has been increasing in europe and developed countries, while diagnostic and therapeutic progress have contributes to a reduction in mortality. Currently, almost 4 million people are treated or followed for cancer in France. The physical, psychological and social after-effects are significant.

Adaptated physical activity plays an important role in the rehabilitation process. Overall, meta-analyses carried-out with most frequent cancers demonstrate that physical activity practiced would allow an improvement in quality of life, tolerance to anticancer treatments and survival.
