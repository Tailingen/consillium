A Study of Reduced Radiation Therapy With Chemotherapy in People With HPV-Positive Throat Cancer
The researchers are doing this study is to find out if lower doses (given in fewer treatments over a shorter period of time) of radiation therapy in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy is an effective treatment for people with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive throat cancer and works as well as the standard doses of radiation therapy in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. The chemotherapy drugs used in combination with radiation therapy in this study include cisplatin, carboplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).

Locoregional control, Researchers will test the null hypothesis H0: P=78% vs the alternative hypothesis H1:P=91%, where P represents the 2-year locoregional control (LRC). We will use the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the LRC rate at 2 years and construct a 0.975 1-sided confidence interval in order to achieve a test size alpha = 0.05 (this is based on a finite-sample correction using 100,000 simulations)., 2 years
