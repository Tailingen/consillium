Neoadjuvant Rapamycin in Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy
This study aims to evaluate the effects of rapamycin directly on bladder tumors and the effects of rapamycin on the immune system of patients with bladder cancer.
Invasive Bladder Cancer Stage II
DRUG: Rapamycin
Tissue pharmacodynamic (PD) response to TORC1 inhibition, PD response defined by significant phospho rpS6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) inhibition (comparing post-treatment to baseline)., 30 days
This is a presurgical clinical trial which aims to understand the biologic activity of TORC1 inhibition and safety in patients with bladder cancer. In this presurgical setting, paired PMBCs and tumor tissue is evaluated before and after exposure to rapamycin to address target specificity, drug delivery, physiologic effects on tumor growth and apoptosis, and correlation of biomarkers with clinical activity.
