Examining Techniques on Adenoma Miss Rate in Proximal Colon
The primary aim of this study is

- to explore the usefulness of re-examination and retroflexion on adenoma miss rate (AMR) in the proximal colon.

Other aims include to explore the data below when re-examination or retroflexion is used.

* Adenoma detection rate, ADR
* Polyp miss rate, PMR
* Polyp detection rate, PDR
* Withdrawal time, WT
Colorectal Adenoma|Colorectal Polyp
PROCEDURE: Retroflexion|PROCEDURE: Re-examination
Adenoma miss rate in the proximal colon (AMR), AMR refers to the rate of adenoma missing, calculated as the proportion of adenomas which are missing in the first examination. AMR in the proximal colon is calculated with only the proximal colon concerned., At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour
Adenoma Detection Rate in the proximal colon (ADR), ADR refers to the rate of adenoma detection, calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one adenoma. ADR in the proximal colon is calculated with only the proximal colon concerned., At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour
AMR = number of adenomas missing during the first examination/ total number of adenomas in both examinations = number of adenomas detected only in the second examination/(number of adenomas detected during the first examination + number of adenomas detected only in the second examination)
