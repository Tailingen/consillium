Diet, Exercise and Vitamin D in Breast Cancer Recurrence
The purpose of this study is to reduce breast cancer recurrence and hence increase disease-free survival through a lifestyle program that includes a low glycemic diet, physical activity and vitamin D supplementation in women with breast cancer living in a Mediterranean country.

OTHER: low Glycemic Index Mediterranean diet|OTHER: Mediterranean diet|BEHAVIORAL: Moderate physical activity|BEHAVIORAL: Basic physical activity|DRUG: high level Vitamin D|DRUG: normal level Vitamin D
Recurrence of disease at study end, Disease-free survival (DFS) calculated as the percentage of patients alive without, 33 months
Changes in glycemic markers, blood levels of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, up to 33 months|Changes in hormonal markers, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), estradiol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), upt to 33 months|Changes in cardiovascular risk factors, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, up to 33 months|Changes in epigenetic factors, microRNA, up to 33 months
The aim of this study is to reduce breast cancer recurrence and hence increase disease-free survival through either a high intensity or a lower intensity lifestyle program that includes low glycemic index diet, physical activity and supplementation with vitamin D, for 33 months, in women living in Italy who have been surgically treated for breast cancer (either late stage or early stage but highly proliferative) within the previous 12 months. The objectives of the study are: to determine if the high intensity program is more efficacious than the lower intensity program in: 1) reducing breast cancer recurrence and 2) improving glycemic, hormonal, cardiovascular and cancer-related epigenetic markers.
