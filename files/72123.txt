Study of IBI308 With Advanced/Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma After Failure of First-line Treatment
Efficacy and safety evaluation of IBI308 versus paclitaxel/irinotecan in patients with advanced/metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after failure of first-line treatment: a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: IBI308|DRUG: paclitaxel/ irinotecan
Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Median OS in all participants is presented., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 2-August-2019 (up to approximately 26 months)
Progression-free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Unequivocal progression of non-target leisions and the appearance of ≥1 new lesions were also considered as PD., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 2-August-2019 (up to approximately 26 months)|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of randomized participants who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST1.1 criteria as per investigator assessment., Through Final Analysis data cut-off date of 2-August-2019 (up to approximately 26 months)|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DoR) was defined as the time from the date of the first investigator-assessed response (CR or PR) to the date of subsequent investigator-assessed PD or death, whichever is earlier., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 2-August-2019 (up to approximately 26 months)
