The carbon dose of 67.5 Gy equivalent in 15 fractions was delivered to clinical target volume (CTV). The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as CTCAE grade 3 or higher of non-hematological toxicity (G3). The acute and late toxicities, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were the endpoints.
