Bioinformation Therapy for Gastric Cancer
The aim of this study is the synergistic effect of cancer ablation and life information rehabilitation therapy on unresectable gastric cancer.
Advanced Gastric Cancer
DEVICE: Cancer ablation|DRUG: Life information rehabilitation therapy
Relief degree of tumors, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）, 3 months
Progress free survival（PFS）, The duration between treament and cancer recurrence, 1 year|Overall survival, The duration between treament and patient pass way, 3 years
By enrolling patients with unresectable gastric cancer adapted to enrolled criteria,this study will document for the first time the synergistic effect of cancer according to local relief degree,progress free survival(PFS)and overall survival(OS).
