Study of Aminolevulinic Acid to Enhance Visualization and Resection of Malignant Glial Tumors of the Brain
Tumors of the central nervous system are potentially curable. For tumors of comparable histology and grade, resectability is the most important prognostic factor affecting survival particularly in children. However, the infiltrative nature of the malignant cells produces indistinct borders between normal and malignant tissues, and the lack of easily identifiable tumor margins confounds attempts toward total resection. The investigators propose to identify the borders of tumors intraoperatively using protoporphyrin fluorescence of the malignant cells and thereby provide more complete tumor resection.
Brain Tumors
DRUG: Aminolevulinic Acid
Establish safe dose for oral ALA administration. NCI Common Toxicity Criteria will be used to quantify toxicity following ALA administration., 108 weeks
Compare time-to-progression and survival to that in comparable cases performed without the aid of ALA. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival and TTP will be generated for all study subjects and for patients at the 30 mg/kg dose level alone., 108 weeks
