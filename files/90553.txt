Retrospective Study Evaluating IGF1R And p95HER2 as Prognostic Factors in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Aim of the study is to evaluated the role of IGF1R and p95HER2 on prognosis in radically resected non small cell lung cancer patients

The primary objective is to correlate the expression of IGF1R and p95HER2 with survival.
