About This PDQ Summary










Incidence


Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare
leukemia that occurs approximately ten times less frequently than acute myeloid leukemia in children. The annual incidence is about 1 to 2 cases per 1 million people.[
1
]  JMML is the most common myeloproliferative neoplasm observed in young children, presenting at a median age of approximately 1.8 years. It
occurs more commonly in boys (male-to-female ratio, approximately 2.5:1).

Pathogenesis and Risk Factors


The pathogenesis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)  has been closely linked to activation of the 
RAS
 oncogene pathway, along with related syndromes (see 
Figure 1
).[
1
,
2
]  In addition, distinctive RNA expression and DNA methylation patterns have been reported. These patterns are correlated with clinical factors such as age and appear to be associated with prognosis.[

Syndromes and genetic features associated with an increased risk of developing JMML include the following:[
5
,
6
] 
Neurofibromatosis type
1 (NF1).
 Up to 14% of cases of
JMML occur in children with NF1.[
7
]  
Noonan syndrome.
 Noonan syndrome is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant condition but can also arise spontaneously. It is characterized by facial dysmorphism, short stature, webbed neck, and neurocognitive and cardiac abnormalities.  Germline variants in 
PTPN11
 are observed in children with Noonan syndrome and in children with  JMML.[
8
-
10
] 
Importantly, some children with Noonan syndrome have hematologic features indistinguishable from JMML that self-resolve during infancy, similar to what happens in children with Down syndrome and transient myeloproliferative disorder.[
2
,
10
]
In a large prospective cohort of 641 patients with Noonan syndrome and a germline 
PTPN11
 variant, 36 patients (approximately 6%) showed myeloproliferative features, with 20 patients (approximately 3%) meeting the consensus diagnostic criteria for JMML.[
10
] 
Of the 20 patients meeting the criteria for JMML, 12 patients had severe neonatal manifestations (e.g., life-threatening complications related to congenital heart defects, pleural effusion, leukemia infiltrates, and/or thrombocytopenia), and 10 of 20 patients died during the first month of life. 
Among the remaining eight patients, none required intensive therapy at diagnosis or during follow-up. 
All 16 patients with myeloproliferative features that did not meet JMML criteria were alive, with a median follow-up of 3 years, and no patient received chemotherapy.
Variants in the 
CBL
 gene.
 CBL is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is involved in targeting proteins, particularly tyrosine kinases, for proteasomal degradation. Variants in the 
CBL
 gene occur  in 10% to 15% of JMML cases,[
11
,
12
] with many of these cases occurring in children with germline 
CBL
 variants.[
13
-
15
]
CBL
 germline variants result in an autosomal dominant developmental disorder that is often characterized by impaired growth, developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and a predisposition to JMML.[
13
,
15
]  Some individuals with 
CBL
 germline variants experience spontaneous regression of their JMML but develop vasculitis later in life,[
13
]   whereas patients with only somatic 
CBL
 variants require therapy.[
15
] JMML arising from germline variants is clinically indistinguishable from JMML arising from somatic variants, which necessitates studies of both normal and leukemic tissue.[
15
] 
CBL
 variants are nearly always mutually exclusive of 
RAS
 and 
PTPN11
 variants.[

Genomics of Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML)


In This Section
Molecular Features of JMML
Genomic and Molecular Prognostic Factors
Molecular Features of JMML
The genomic landscape of JMML is characterized by variants in one of five genes of the RAS pathway: 
NF1
, 
NRAS
, 
KRAS
, 
PTPN11
, and 
CBL
.[
1
-
3
] In a series of 118 consecutively diagnosed JMML cases with RAS pathway–activating variants, 
PTPN11
 was the most commonly altered gene, accounting for 51% of cases (19% germline and 32% somatic) (see Figure 2).[
1
] Patients with 
NRAS
  variants accounted for 19% of cases, and patients with 
KRAS
 variants accounted for 15% of cases. 
NF1
 variants accounted for 8% of cases, and 
CBL
 variants accounted for 11% of cases.  Although variants among these five genes are generally mutually exclusive, 4% to 17% of cases have variants in two of these RAS pathway genes,[
1
-
3
] a finding that is associated with poorer prognosis.[
1
,
3
]
The variant rate in JMML leukemia cells is very low, but additional variants beyond those of the five RAS pathway genes described above are observed.[
1
-
3
] Secondary genomic alterations are observed for genes of the transcriptional repressor complex PRC2 (e.g., 
ASXL1
 was altered in 7%–8% of cases). Some genes associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms in adults are also altered at low rates in JMML (e.g., 
SETBP1
 was altered in 6%–9% of cases).[
1
-
4
] 
JAK3
 variants are also observed in a small percentage (4%–12%) of JMML cases.[
1
-
4
] Cases with germline 
PTPN11
 and germline 
CBL
 variants showed low rates of additional variants (see Figure 2).[
1
] The presence of variants beyond disease-defining RAS pathway variants is associated with an inferior prognosis.[
1
,
2
]
A report describing the genomic landscape of JMML found that 16 of 150 patients (11%) lacked canonical RAS pathway variants. Among these 16 patients, 3 were observed to have in-frame fusions involving receptor tyrosine kinases (
DCTN1
::
ALK
, 
RANBP2
::
ALK
, and 
TBL1XR1
::
ROS1
 gene fusions). These patients all had monosomy 7 and were aged 56 months or older. One patient with an 
ALK
 gene fusion was treated with crizotinib plus conventional chemotherapy and achieved a complete molecular remission and proceeded to allogeneic bone marrow transplant.[

Genomic and Molecular Prognostic Factors
Several genomic factors affect the prognosis of patients with JMML, including the following:
Number of non–RAS pathway variants.
 A predictor of prognosis for children with JMML is the number of variants beyond the disease-defining RAS pathway variants.[
1
,
2
]
One study observed that zero or one somatic alteration (pathogenic variant or monosomy 7) was identified in 64 patients (65.3%) at diagnosis, whereas two or more alterations were identified in 34 patients (34.7%).[
2
] In multivariate analysis, variant number (2 or more vs. 0 or 1) maintained significance as a predictor of inferior event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). A higher proportion of patients diagnosed with two or more alterations were older and male, and these patients also demonstrated a higher rate of monosomy 7 or somatic 
NF1
 variants.[
2
]
Another study observed that approximately 60% of patients had one or more additional variants beyond their disease-defining RAS pathway variant. These patients had an inferior OS compared with patients who had no additional variants (3-year OS rate, 61% vs. 85%, respectively).[
1
]
A third study observed a trend for an inferior OS for patients with two or more variants compared with patients with zero or one variant.[
3
]
RAS pathway double variants.
 Although variants in the five canonical RAS pathway genes associated with JMML (
NF1
, 
NRAS
, 
KRAS
, 
PTPN11
, and 
CBL
) are generally mutually exclusive, 4% to 17% of cases have variants in two of these RAS pathway genes.[
1
,
2
] This finding has been associated with a poorer prognosis.[
1
,
2
]
Two RAS pathway variants were identified in 11% of JMML patients in one report, and these patients had a significantly inferior EFS rate (14%) compared with patients who had a single RAS pathway variant (62%). Patients with Noonan syndrome were excluded from the analyses.[
2
]
Similar findings for RAS pathway variants were reported in a second study. This study observed that patients with RAS pathway double variants (15 of 96 patients) had lower survival rates than did patients with either no additional variants or with additional variants beyond the RAS pathway variant.[
1
]
DNA methylation profile.
 
One study applied DNA methylation profiling to a discovery cohort of 39 patients with JMML and to a validation cohort of 40 patients. Distinctive subsets of JMML with either high, intermediate, or low methylation levels were observed in both cohorts. Patients with the lowest methylation levels had the highest survival rates, and all but 1 of 15 patients experienced spontaneous resolution in the low methylation cohort. High methylation status was associated with lower EFS rates.[
5
]
Another study applied DNA methylation profiling to a cohort of 106 patients with JMML. The study observed one subgroup of patients with a hypermethylation profile and one subgroup of patients with a hypomethylation profile. Patients in the hypermethylation group had a significantly lower OS rate than did patients in the hypomethylation group (5-year OS rate, 46% vs. 73%, respectively). Patients in the hypermethylation group also had a significantly poorer 5-year transplant-free survival rate than did patients in the hypomethylation group (2.2%; 95% CI, 0.2%–10.1% vs. 41.2%; 95% CI, 27.1%–54.8%).  Hypermethylation status was associated with two or more variants, higher fetal hemoglobin levels, older age, and lower platelet count at diagnosis. All patients with Noonan syndrome were in the hypomethylation group.[
3
]
A study examined 33 patients with JMML who had 
CBL
 variants. The study identified 31 patients with low methylation and 2 patients with intermediate methylation.  Both of the children with intermediate methylation relapsed after undergoing HSCT.   Because treatment, which included observation only, varied among the 31 patients with low methylation, the impact of the methylation profile on therapeutic decisions and outcomes could not be fully assessed. However, the methylation status was not prognostic of spontaneous resolution.[
6
]
LIN28B
 overexpression.
 
LIN28B
 overexpression, which is present in approximately one-half of children with JMML, identifies a biologically distinctive subset of JMML. LIN28B is an RNA-binding protein that regulates stem cell renewal.[
7
]
LIN28B
 overexpression was positively correlated with high blood fetal hemoglobin level and age (both of which are associated with poor prognosis), and it was negatively correlated with presence of monosomy 7 (also associated with inferior prognosis). Although 
LIN28B
 overexpression identifies a subset of patients with increased risk of treatment failure, it was not found to be an independent prognostic factor when other factors such as age and monosomy 7 status are considered.[
7
]
Another study also observed a subset of JMML patients with elevated 
LIN28B
 expression. The study identified 
LIN28B
 as the gene for which expression was most strongly associated with hypermethylation status.[
3

Clinical Prognostic Factors


 Historically, more than 90% of patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)  died despite the use of chemotherapy.[
1
] However, with the application of hematopoietic stem cell transplant, survival rates of approximately 50% are now observed.[
2
] Patients appeared to follow  three distinct clinical courses:
Rapidly progressive disease and early demise.
Transiently stable disease followed by progression and death.
Clinical improvement that lasted up to 9 years before progression or, rarely, long-term survival.
Favorable prognostic factors for survival after any therapy include the following:[
3
,
4
]
Age younger than 2 years.
Platelet count greater than 33 × 10
9
/L.
Low age-adjusted fetal hemoglobin levels.
In contrast, being older than 2 years and having high blood fetal hemoglobin levels at diagnosis are predictors of poor outcome.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer


Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.[
2
]  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
 Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on 
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
3
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the 
NCI website

Treatment of JMML


In This Section
Chemotherapy Before HSCT
HSCT
Approaches to Recurrence After HSCT or Refractory JMML
Treatment options for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)  include the following:
Chemotherapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
.
HSCT
.
Chemotherapy Before HSCT
Previous efforts to use chemotherapy before curative-intent HSCT have had a mixed and overall unsatisfactory impact on survival. However, control of symptoms has been aided by various lower- and higher-intensity regimens.[
1
,
2
]
Evidence (chemotherapy before HSCT):
In an attempt to cytoreduce leukemic burden, the combination of fludarabine and cytarabine with isotretinoin alone was given for two cycles before planned HSCT in 34 of 87 evaluable children with JMML in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) 
AAML0122
 trial.[
3
]
In this group, the overall response rate (partial response [PR] and complete response [CR]) was 68%. However, achieving a CR before HSCT did not significantly improve overall survival, event-free survival (EFS), or  relapse risk.
A phase II, single-arm, open-label trial included 18 children with newly diagnosed JMML who received single-agent azacitidine, given for 7 days in 28-day cycles.[
4
] 
The study found that 61% of patients had partial remissions after three cycles of treatment. 
Responding patients, defined using the International JMML response criteria,[
5
] tended to be younger and had low-to-medium methylation classifications. 
Six patients became platelet-transfusion independent, and all responders had reductions in splenomegaly. 
Seventeen of the 18 patients received an HSCT at a median of 5.5 months after diagnosis. Of these 17 patients, 14 remained leukemia-free at last follow-up (median, 23.8 months after HSCT).[
4
] 
Partially based on this trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the approved indications for azacitidine to include children with newly diagnosed JMML.
HSCT
HSCT currently offers the best chance of cure for JMML.[
1
,

-
9
]
Evidence (HSCT):
A report from the European Working Group on Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes included 100 transplant recipients at multiple centers treated with a common preparative regimen of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan, with or without antithymocyte globulin. Recipients had been treated with varying degrees of pretransplant chemotherapy or differentiating agents, and some patients had a splenectomy.[
7

The 5-year EFS rate was 55%  for children with JMML who underwent HSCT using HLA-identical matched family donor cells and 49% for children with JMML who underwent HSCT using  unrelated donor cells.
The multivariate analysis showed no effect on survival of previous acute myeloid leukemia–like chemotherapy versus low-dose chemotherapy or no chemotherapy.
 No effect on survival was observed for splenectomy pretransplant or difference in spleen size.
No difference in outcomes was found based on related versus unrelated donors.
Only  age older than 4 years and female sex were shown to be poor prognostic factors for outcome and increased risk of relapse (relative risk [RR], 2.24 [1.07–4.69]; 
P
 = .032 for older age; RR, 2.22 [1.09–4.50]; 
P
 = .028 for females).[

In one study, cord blood transplant produced the following results:[

Level of evidence C2

The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 44%.
 Outcomes were improved in children younger than 1.4 years at diagnosis, those with nonmonosomy 7 karyotype, and those receiving 5/6 to 6/6 HLA-matched cord units.
This suggests that cord blood can provide an additional donor pool for this group of children.
The use of reduced-intensity preparative regimens to decrease the adverse side effects of transplant have also been reported in small numbers of patients, generally for patients ineligible for myeloablative HSCT.[

The COG conducted a randomized trial in children with JMML that compared a standard-intensity preparative regimen (busulfan/cyclophosphamide/melphalan) with a reduced-intensity regimen (busulfan/fludarabine).[
13
]
The trial closed to enrollment early when an interim analysis revealed a higher frequency of relapse/disease persistence (7 of 9 patients) in children who received the reduced-intensity regimen than in children who received the standard-intensity regimen (1 of 6 patients).
 
The role of conventional antileukemia therapy in the treatment of JMML is not defined.  Determining the role of specific agents in the treatment of JMML is complicated because of the absence of consensus response criteria.[
14
] Some agents that have shown antileukemia activity against JMML include etoposide, cytarabine, thiopurines (thioguanine and mercaptopurine), isotretinoin, and farnesyl inhibitors, but none of these have been shown to improve outcome.[

Approaches to Recurrence After HSCT or Refractory JMML
Disease recurrence is the primary cause of treatment failure for children with JMML after HSCT and occurs in 30% to 40% of cases.[
6
-
8
] While the role of donor lymphocyte infusions is uncertain,[
19
] reports indicate that approximately 50% of patients with relapsed JMML can be successfully treated with a second HSCT.[
20
]
In a prospective study, four children with relapsed JMML after stem cell transplant were treated with azacitidine. Three patients responded to azacitidine and were able to proceed to a second transplant.[
21
]
In a prospective study, ten children with relapsed or refractory JMML were treated with oral trametinib (an MEK inhibitor) daily for up to 12 28-day cycles. Five patients had objective responses (three clinical PRs and two clinical CRs) within five cycles. Two patients had stable disease. All seven patients remained alive at a median follow-up of 24 months, including three who continued to receive trametinib off study (for 6, 24, and 24 months, respectively) without proceeding to HSCT. The four patients who underwent HSCT remained in CR at a median of 24 months of follow-up. The RAS pathway variants were no longer detected in the four patients who underwent HSCT, whereas the three other patients continued to have detectable variants without progressive disease while receiving trametinib. No severe adverse events were reported.[

Latest Updates to This Summary (12/10/2024)


The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above.
Treatment of Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML)
Revised 
text
 to state that previous efforts to use chemotherapy before curative-intent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have had a mixed and overall unsatisfactory impact on survival. However, control of symptoms has been aided by various lower- and higher-intensity regimens (cited Wintering et al. as reference 2).
Added 
text
 to state that in an attempt to cytoreduce leukemic burden, the combination of fludarabine and cytarabine with isotretinoin alone was given for two cycles before planned HSCT in 34 of 87 evaluable children with JMML in the Children's Oncology Group AAML0122 trial. In this group, the overall response rate was 68%. However, achieving a complete response before HSCT did not significantly improve overall survival, event-free survival, or  relapse risk.
Added 
Approaches to Recurrence After HSCT or Refractory JMML
 as a new subsection.
