Clinical Study of PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody SHR-1210 and Apatinib in Advanced NSCLC, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, and Uterine Cancer
In this one-arm study, histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, uterine malignancies, and soft tissue sarcoma will be enrolled to investigate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 monoclonal antibody SHR-1210 and apatinib, at the same time, peripheral circulating blood tumor cells (CTC) detection and CTC-based PD-L1 antibody immunofluorescence detection will be performed.
Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Uterine Cancer|Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor|DRUG: Apatinib
Objective remission rate (ORR), Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|The number of Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC), 2 years|Analysis of PD-L1 expression on Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) and tumor tissue, 2 years
Duration of response(DOR), Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|Disease control rate(DCR), Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years
Primary outcome:

1. Analysis of baseline levels of CTC and CTC PD-L1 and prognosis efficacy of patients: Objective remission rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS);
2. Dynamic monitoring of CTC and CTC PD-L1 at baseline before treatment, after two cycles of treatment, and as the disease progresses.
3. Consistency analysis of PD-L1 and CTC PD-L1 expression in tissue specimens.

Secondary outcome:

Duration of response(DOR), Disease control rate(DCR), Safety of the combination therapy.
