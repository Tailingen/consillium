Myocet Plus Endoxan for Older Patients With Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and effect on quality of life of liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide as first or second line treatment of older patients (â‰¥ 70 years old) with metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy of the combination will be correlated with the functional status of patients according to the comprehensive geriatric assessment

Elderly individuals make up a large part of the breast cancer population. When treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease they derive similar benefits to their younger counterparts. Anthracyclines are associated with a cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy with increased rate in patients over the age of 70. Liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by reducing significantly the cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer
