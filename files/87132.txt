A Validation Study to Determine Concordance of Liquid Biopsy and Breast Cancer Diagnosis
This study evaluates whether a special type of blood analysis, called liquid biopsy (LBx), correlates with mammography results and/or diagnosis of breast cancer.
Breast Carcinoma
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Assess the sensitivity and specificity of LBx as a screening method for breast cancer, LBx results using peripheral blood samples will be compared to a pathological diagnosis of breast cancer within 1 year of the liquid biopsy test., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the sensitivity of LBx for the presence of breast cancer in patient cohorts II. Determine the specificity of LBx for the presence of breast cancer in all patient cohorts.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo blood sample collection and have their medical records reviewed on study.
