Study of 19(T2)28z1xx TRAC-Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells in People With B-Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this research is to evaluate if study therapy, 19(T2)28z1xx TRAC-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, may be an effective treatment for people with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma. Researchers will also evaluate if this study therapy is safe, and to look for the highest dose that causes few or mild side effects in participants.
