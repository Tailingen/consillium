A Study of a Plant-Based Diet in People With Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) or Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM)
This study will test whether a plant-based diet is practical (feasible) for overweight people with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The researchers will decide how practical the diet is by looking at how much weight participants lose and how well they are able to stick to the diet. The researchers will also determine whether the diet is effective in preventing multiple myeloma in participants. In addition, they will look at how safe the plant-based diet is for participants, and see if the diet affects participants' quality of life.
