A Study of AL2846 Versus Zoledronic Acid in Subjects With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Bone Metastasis
AL2846 is a multi-target tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor with obvious selective to c-met, suggesting that its anti-tumor effect mainly inhibits the activation of key downstream oncogenic pathways by inhibiting expression of c-met, tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell migration.
