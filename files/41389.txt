Study of Onivyde With Talazoparib or Temozolomide in Children With Recurrent Solid Tumors and Ewing Sarcoma
The phase I portion of this study is designed for children or adolescents and young adults (AYA) with a diagnosis of a solid tumor that has recurred (come back after treatment) or is refractory (never completely went away). The trial will test 2 combinations of therapy and participants will be randomly assigned to either Arm A or Arm B. The purpose of the phase I study is to determine the highest tolerable doses of the combinations of treatment given in each Arm.

In Arm A, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called Onivyde and talazoparib. Onivyde works by damaging the DNA of the cancer cell and talazoparib works by blocking the repair of the DNA once the cancer cell is damaged. By damaging the tumor DNA and blocking the repair, the cancer cells may die. In Arm B, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called Onivyde and temozolomide. Both of these medications work by damaging the DNA of the cancer call which may cause the tumor(s) to die.

Once the highest doses are reached in Arm A and Arm B, then "expansion Arms" will open. An expansion arm treats more children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors at the highest doses achieved in the phase I study. The goal of the expansion arms is to see if the tumors go away in children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. There will be 3 "expansion Arms". In Arm A1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm A2, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, whose tumors have a problem with repairing DNA (identified by their doctor), will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm B1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and temozolomide.

Once the highest doses of medications used in Arm A and Arm B are determined, then a phase II study will open for children or young adults with Ewing sarcoma that has recurred or is refractory following treatment received after the initial diagnosis. The trial will test the same 2 combinations of therapy in Arm A and Arm B. In the phase II, a participant with Ewing sarcoma will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment given on either Arm A or Arm B.

ONITT (ONIvyde, Talazoparib, Temozolomide) is a phase I/II study which will evaluate two treatment regimens; nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRN, Onivyde) plus talazoparib (TAL) and Onivyde (ONI) plus temozolomide (TMZ) for the treatment of recurrent or refractory (RR) Ewing sarcoma. A dose finding phase I study will be open to patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Patients will be assigned to receive either ONI plus TAL (Arm A) or ONI plus TMZ (Arm B). Once the recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of Arm A and Arm B are determined, expansion cohorts (A1, B1) will open at the RP2Ds for enrollment of non-Ewing sarcoma solid tumor patients. There will be an additional Arm A expansion cohort (A2) for patients with homologous recombination repair defects. Concurrently, the phase II study will open to patients with RR Ewing sarcoma. In the phase II study, patients with RR Ewing sarcoma will be randomized to receive either ONI plus TAL or ONI plus TMZ. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival (PFS). PFS of both treatment arms in the phase II study will be compared to one another by using a two-arm non-inferiority design when superiority is expected.

Phase I The phase I portion of the study will include 2 separate treatment arms, Arms A and B. Arm A will evaluate Onivyde plus talazoparib (ONI + TAL). Arm B will evaluate Onivyde plus temozolomide (ONI + TMZ). Both phase I studies will be open to patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors who meet eligibility criteria. In Arm A, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral talazoparib twice on Day 1 and then daily on Days 2-6. In Arm B, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral temozolomide daily on Days 1-5. Pharmacokinetic testing will take place during Cycle 1. Therapy may continue for up to 24 months. Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and repeated after cycles 2, 4, 6 and then every 4 cycles thereafter to assess disease status. If at any designated disease evaluation time point a patient develops a response that is better than the prior response (i.e. SD at Cycle 2 evaluation, then PR at Cycle 4 evaluation), an interim disease evaluation is recommended after 28 days to confirm response. Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of disease progression or drug-related dose limiting toxicities requiring removal from treatment. Safety and tolerability will be monitored continuously throughout study participation.

Phase II Following the completion of the phase I dose finding studies, patients with recurrent or refractory Ewing sarcoma that meet eligibility criteria will be eligible for randomization into the phase II study. Arm A will evaluate Onivyde plus talazoparib (ONI + TAL). Arm B will evaluate Onivyde plus temozolomide (ONI + TMZ). In Arm A, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral talazoparib twice on Day 1 and then daily on Days 2-6. In Arm B, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral temozolomide daily on Days 1-5. Pharmacokinetic testing will take place during Cycle 1. Therapy may continue for up to 24 months. Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and repeated after Cycles 2, 4, 6 and then every 4 cycles thereafter to assess disease status. If at any designated disease evaluation time point a patient develops a response that is better than the prior response (i.e. SD at Cycle 2 evaluation, then PR at Cycle 4 evaluation), an interim disease evaluation is recommended after 28 days to confirm response. Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of disease progression and/or any other condition(s) occur that do not allow treatment continuation or similar toxicities requiring removal from the trial. Safety and tolerability will be monitored continuously throughout study participation.

Sample size: In the dose escalation phase I study, approximately 18 patients per arm will be enrolled for a total of 36 patients. The dose expansion phase I study will include 3 treatment cohorts. Arm A will have 2 dose expansion cohorts including 1) a non-ES solid tumor cohort (A1) and 2) a DNA repair defects/mutations cohort (A2). Arm B will have 1 dose expansion cohort including non-ES solid tumors (B1). Approximately 12 patients will enroll per expansion treatment cohort for a total of 36 patients. In the phase II study, 44 patients will be enrolled on each arm for a total of 88 patients.
