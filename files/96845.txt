Athermal Nerve-sparing During Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using a Hemostatic Matrix.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a hemostatic gelatine-thrombin matrix during athermal nerve-sparing prostate resection compared to conventional hemostasis using electrocautery in patients with localized prostate cancer and to investigate effects on postoperative erectile function and continence.
