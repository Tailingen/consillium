The HIFUB Study (HIFU in Breast Cancer)
High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a new method of treating solid tumours by thermally ablating them. It has been used in a number of different types of cancers but there is little information on its use in invasive breast cancer (IBC). The investigators aim to assess the efficacy and safety of HIFU in the treatment of IBC.

In this study, fifteen otherwise healthy women diagnosed with small, early stage IBC will be treated with HIFU prior to conventional surgical treatment. The effects of HIFU on the resected tumour will be analysed pathologically and correlated with radiological findings. Immune response and participant experience will also be evaluated
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) to the Breast Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy of the HIFU treatment in achieving cancer ablation, Volume of tumour ablation on histological examination of the surgically excised specimen expressed as a percentage of pretreatment tumour volume on MRI scan., 1 month following intervention
To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of post-HIFU MRI in assessing HIFU efficacy when compared with histological evaluation of the resected specimen, Volume of tumour ablation on histological examination of the surgically excised specimen and volume of tumour ablation on post-treatment MRI expressed as a percentages of pretreatment tumour volume on MRI scan., 1 month following intervention|Assessment of the safety and toxicity of HIFU ablation, Using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAC) Grading Guideline (which scores any occurring adverse events with grades between 1 to 5, where higher grades indicate worse outcomes), 1 month following intervention|To evaluate patient acceptance of HIFU treatment, Using 1 to 1 qualitative interviews with participants., 1 month following intervention
