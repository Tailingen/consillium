Clinical Utility of CTC Test in Medicare-Eligible Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
The objective of the registry study is to demonstrate the clinical utility of the CELLSEARCH® CTC Test among the Medicare-Eligible metastatic Breast Cancer (mBC) patients in the United States. The objective of the present registry is to demonstrate the impact on patient management of the CELLSEARCH® CTC Test among the Medicare-eligible mBC patients. Hereto the hypothesis that the availability of CTC information provides clinicians important, timely information and impacts treatment decisions, will be tested.

This study is IDE-exempt since CELLSEARCH® CTC Test is a legally marketed device in the US, and is being used in accordance with its labeling.
