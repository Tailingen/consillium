A First-in-human Study of HRS2398 Tablets in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Tumors
The study is being conducted to determine the dose limited toxicity(DLT) and maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose(RP2D) of HRS2398 in subjects with advanced malignant tumor ; The second objectives is to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy and PK profile of HRS2398 in subjects with advanced malignant tumor ; Exploratory cohort is to explore the relationship between gene mutation and efficacy and resistance mechanisms.
