A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Effects of Fluconazole and Atorvastatin on the Pharmacokinetics of TAK-385 in Healthy Subjects
This is a nonrandomized, open-label, fixed-sequence, 2-arm study designed to assess the effect of multiple doses of fluconazole or atorvastatin on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of TAK-385 in healthy adult subjects.

Number of Participants With at Least 1 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (AE), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., First dose of study drug through the end of the study (22 days ± 3 days)|Number of Participants With Clinical Significant Changes in Vital Signs, Vital sign measurements included oral temperature, heart rate, supine (after 3 to 5 minutes in this position) and standing (after 3 to 5 minutes in this position) measurements of diastolic and systolic blood pressure., Baseline and First dose of study drug through the end of the study (22 days ± 3 days)|Number of Participants With Clinical Significant Changes in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings, A 12-lead ECG was administered on Days 1,9,10,11,15., Baseline and First dose of study drug through Day 15|Number of Participants With Clinical Significant Changes in Laboratory Tests, Blood samples were collected for analysis of clinical chemistry and hematological parameters and urine samples were obtained for urinalysis. Clinical laboratory evaluations were performed at central and /local laboratories., Baseline and First dose of study drug through the end of the study (22 days ± 3 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration of TAK-385, Tmax is the time to reach the maximum concentrations (Cmax), equal to time (hours) to Cmax., Days 1 and 10 (Predose and multiple time points up to 120 hours postdose)|AUC (0-120): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to 120 Hours of TAK-385, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 120 hours after study drug administration., Days 1 and 10 (Predose and multiple time points up to 120 hours postdose)|Terminal Disposition Half-life (t1/2) of TAK-385, Terminal disposition half-life (T1/2) is the time required for half of the drug to be eliminated from the plasma., Days 1 and 10 (Predose and multiple time points up to 120 hours postdose)|Apparent Total Body Clearance (CL/F) of TAK-385, Days 1 and 10 (Predose and multiple time points up to 120 hours postdose)|Fraction Excreted Unchanged (Fe) of TAK-385, Fraction of TAK-385 excreted in the urine unchanged., Days 1 and 10 (Predose and multiple time points up to 120 hours postdose)|Plasma Trough Concentrations for Fluconazole, Blood samples for fluconazole trough levels were collected predose (before dosing with fluconazole and before breakfast) on Days 8 through 12., Days 8 to 12 Predose|Plasma Trough Concentrations for Atorvastatin, Blood samples for atorvastatin trough levels were collected predose (before dosing with atorvastatin and before breakfast) on Days 8 through 12., Days 8 to 12 Predose
The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-385. TAK-385 was being tested to assess if the way it is processed the body changes when it administered with other medications (fluconazole or atorvastatin). This study looked at lab results in people who took TAK-385.

The study enrolled 40 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

* TAK-385 40 mg and fluconazole 400 mg on Day 6 and 200 mg on Days 7 to 14
* TAK-385 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg on Days 6-14

Participants in the fluconazole arm were administered TAK-385 on Days 1 and 10 and fluconazole on Days 6 through 14. Participants in the atorvastatin arm were administered TAK-385 on Days 1 and 10 and atorvastatin on Days 6 through 14.

This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 4 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including one 16-day period of confinement to the clinic, and a final visit 7 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
