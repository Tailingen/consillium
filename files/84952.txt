A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Envafolimab Combined With Cetuxima-βand mFOLFOX6 in Patients With MSS, RAS/BRAF Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
This is a prospective randomized controlled Phase Ⅱ/Ⅲ Clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Envafolimab combining with Cetuximab -β and mFOLFOX6 in Patients With MSS, RAS/BRAF Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
DRUG: Cetuxima-β|DRUG: Envafolimab|DRUG: mFOLFOX6
Progressin Free Survival，PFS, Progression-free survival based on RECIST v1.1, Time Frame: from the first dose until firstly confirmed and recorded disease progression or death (whichever occurs earlier),assessed up to 3 years
OS，Overall survival, from the date of first dose unitl the date of death from any cause，assessed up to 3 years|ORR， Objective response, Objective response rate based on RECIST v1.1, up to 3 years|DCR， Disease control rate, the proportion of patients with the best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), up to 1 year|NED Rate， No Evidence of Disease Rate, The proportion of participants with no evidence of disease after treatment, as determined by current assessments (pathological, imaging, and molecular biology). NED includes complete response (CR), R0 resection, or other local treatments, such as radiofrequency, microwave, or cryoablation (which can be combined with surgery), that eliminate the tumor., up to 3 years|Safety(Adverse Event (AE) Incidence), Adverse Event (AE) Incidence, up to 3 years
Patients diagnosed with unresectable, microsatellite - stable (MSS), RAS/BRAF wild - type metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma who have not received prior systemic anti-neoplastic therapy for metastatic or recurrent lesions will be included in this study.

In the Phase II study, approximately 186 patients will be enrolled, with 93 assigned to the experimental group and 93 to the control group. In the Phase III study, around 404 patients will be recruited, with 202 allocated to the experimental group and 202 to the control group.

Eligible patients will undergo a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by a treatment period consisting of 2 - week cycles for a maximum duration of 2 years. Subsequently, a follow - up period will be implemented, which includes a safety follow - up and survival follow - ups conducted every 12 weeks.
