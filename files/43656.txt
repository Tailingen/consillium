Adjuvant Targeted-therapy for Patients With Resected High-risk EGFR-mutant Stage IB-IIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
This is a single-armed study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant targeted-therapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive stage IB-IIA non-small cell lung carcinoma and high-risk of recurrence following complete tumor resection.

The primary endpoint: 2-year DFS rate; The second endpoint: DFS
NSCLC|EGF-R Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Furmonertinib
Disease Free Survival (DFS) rate at 2 years, Assess the Efficacy of Adjuvant Furmonertinib as Measured by 2-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) rate., From date of receiving therapy until date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), up to approximately 4 years. Assessed at 2 years.
