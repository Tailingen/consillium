FORAGER-1: A Study of LOXO-435 (LY3866288) in Participants With Cancer With a Change in a Gene Called FGFR3
The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of LOXO-435 by itself or when it is combined with other standard medicines that treat cancer. LOXO-435 may be used to treat cancer of the cells that line the urinary system and other solid tumor cancers that have a change in a particular gene (known as the FGFR3 gene). Participation could last up to 30 months (2.5 years) and possibly longer if the disease does not get worse.

Phase 1a: To determine the recommended dose of LOXO-435: Safety, number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Number of participants with DLTs, Minimum of the first 21-day cycle of LOXO-435 treatment|Phase 1b: To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Overall response rate (ORR), ORR per investigator assessed RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years|Number of Participants with One or More Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Event(s) (SAEs) Considered by the Investigator to be Related to Study Drug Administration, A summary of TEAEs and SAEs regardless of causality, will be reported in the Reported Adverse Events module, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years
To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LOXO-435: Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), PK of LOXO-435: AUC, Up to 2 months|To assess the PK of LOXO-435: Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), PK of LOXO-435: Cmin, Up to 2 months|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR per investigator assessed RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years]|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Duration of response (DoR), DOR per investigator assessed RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Time to response (TTR), TTR, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS per investigator assessed RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Disease control rate (DCR), DCR per investigator assessed RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-435: Overall survival (OS), OS, Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years|Change from baseline in bladder-related symptoms, measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bladder (FACT-Bl) subscale (BlCS), The BlCS has 12 items with a total score range of 0 to 48, with higher scores representing better bladder-related symptoms. A ≥ 4-point score change from baseline will be considered as clinically meaningful improvement in bladder-related symptoms, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1 (28 day cycles)|Change from baseline in physical function, measured by FACT- Physical Well-being Scale (PWB) subscale, The PWB subscale has 7 items with a total score range of 0-28, with higher scores representing better physical function. A ≥ 3-point score change from baseline for a participant will be considered as clinically meaningful improvement in physical function., Up to approximately 30 months or 2.5 years
This is an open-label, multi-center, phase 1 study in participants with FGFR3-altered advanced solid tumor malignancy including metastatic urothelial cancer (UC). The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1a dose escalation (Cohort A1) and dose optimization (Cohort A2) and Phase 1b dose expansion. Phase 1a will assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of LOXO-435 to determine the optimal dose for further expansion.

Phase 1b will include 6 dose expansion cohorts to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LOXO-435 as monotherapy or in combinations with pembrolizumab with or without enfortumab vedotin.
