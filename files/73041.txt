OBJECTIVES:

* To collect preliminary data to determine the extent to which there is impairment in quality of life of young adult survivors of hematologic malignancies.
* To identify the most common areas of concern in these survivors.
* To explore patterns of quality-of-life impairment associated with age, gender, and type of treatment (transplant vs non-transplant) in these survivors.

OUTLINE: Patients are assessed in a telephone interview using a brief demographic and clinical data form. Patients then undergo quality-of-life assessment by the Cancer Patient/Cancer Survivor Version questionnaire via telephone.
