Study of Radium-223 Dichloride Versus Placebo and Hormonal Treatment as Background Therapy in Subjects With Bone Predominant HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) Negative Hormone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of radium-223 dichloride in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2 negative) hormone receptor positive breast cancer with bone metastases treated with hormonal treatment background therapy
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223)|DRUG: Placebo (saline)|OTHER: Background hormonal therapy
Symptomatic Skeletal Event Free Survival (SSE-FS), Time from date of randomization to occurrence of one of the following, whichever happened earlier: 1) an on study SSE, which was defined as the use of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to relieve skeletal symptoms, the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or nonvertebral), the occurrence of spinal cord compression, a tumor related orthopedic surgical intervention; or 2) death from any cause, Up to approximately 51 months
Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause, Up to approximately 51 months|Time to Opiate Use for Cancer Pain, Interval from the date of randomization to the date of opiate use, Up to approximately 51 months|Time to Pain Progression, Time from randomization to the first date a participants (only in participants with baseline WPS ≤8) experiences pain progression based on worst pain score (WPS) ranging from 0 to 10 and analgesic use. Pain progression is defined as an increase of 2 or more points in the "Worst pain in 24 hours" score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart or an increase in pain management (IPM) with respect to baseline, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 51 months|Pain Improvement Rate, The percentage of participants (baseline WPS\>=2) with confirmed pain improvement at any time point. Confirmed pain improvement is defined as a 2 point decrease in worst pain score (WPS) from baseline over 2 consecutive assessment periods conducted at least 4 weeks apart, Up to approximately 51 months|Time to Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Time from the date of randomization to the date of the first cytotoxic chemotherapy, Up to approximately 51 months|Radiological Progression-free Survival (rPFS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of first radiological progression or death (if death occurs before progression), Up to approximately 51 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Any event arising or worsening after the start of study drug administration until 30 days after the last study medication intake, Up to approximately 7 months|Number of Participants With Post-treatment Adverse Events Including Additional Malignancies and Chemotherapy Related Adverse Events, AEs related to the study drug, all occurrences of additional malignancies, febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage in subjects receiving chemotherapy, bone fractures and bone associated events (regardless of severity and relationship to study drug), and some symptoms needed for the characterization of an symptomatic skeletal event, From 30 days after the last dose of study treatment until the end of study, assessed up to approximately 44 months
The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of radium-223 dichloride in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2 negative) hormone receptor positive breast cancer with bone metastases treated with hormonal treatment background therapy
