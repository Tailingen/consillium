A Combination Therapy Including Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy in Rectal Cancer With Refractory Distal Metastasis
Though surgical resection remains the primary choice for advanced rectal cancer, about 80% are considered unresectable due to the number, size, or location of metastases. The overall prognosis of patients who accepted traditional treatment methods is still poor. Therefore, the investigators designed a combination therapy, short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy with target therapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. This study implement the combination therapy in patients with rectal cancer who are initially unresectable in the locally advanced stage with multiple liver/pulmonary metastases, to evaluate whether they can improve the objective response rate, the conversion rate of radical surgery and prolong the overall survival of patients, and strive to provide high-level medical evidence for the clinical treatment.
