A Study of RC48-ADC Combination Therapies as First-line Treatment in Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer
This is a Phase II/III, randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of RC48-ADC combine with Toripalimab and chemotherapy or RC48-ADC combine with Toripalimab and Trastuzumab as first-line treatment in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expression participants with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: RC48-ADC|DRUG: Trastuzumab Injection|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin injection|DRUG: Capecitabine
Objective remission rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation by the investigator will be performed)., Up to approximately 2 years
Safety(adverse event), to evaluate safety including adverse event rate and adverse event grade., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by the investigator, Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the date of death of the subject., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of relief (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, Up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR is the proportion of subjects with optimal overall response to achieve objective remission or stable disease over the course of the study, Up to approximately 2 years
This is a Phase II/III, randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of RC48-ADC combine with Toripalimab and chemotherapy or RC48-ADC combine with Toripalimab and Trastuzumab as first-line treatment in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expression participants with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. The HER2-expression is defined as: the HER2 IHC 3+ or 2+, or 1+.
