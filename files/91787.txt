Billroth II With Braun Anastomosis After Radical Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
The primary aim of this trial is to rigorously evaluate the comparative benefits and potential risks associated with Billroth II reconstruction with Braun anastomosis versus Billroth II reconstruction alone following distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. This assessment focuses on delineating the therapeutic efficacy, safety profile, and overall clinical outcomes of these two surgical approaches in treating this condition.
