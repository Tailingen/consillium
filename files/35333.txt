Study Comparing the Bioavailability of TAS-102 Tablets to an Oral Solution Containing Equivalent Amounts of FTD and TPI
The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability of TAS-102 tablets to an oral solution containing equivalent amounts FTD and TPI.
Advanced Solid Tumors (Excluding Breast Cancer)
DRUG: TAS-102 tablets|DRUG: TAS-102 oral solution
Extent of absorption of FTD and TPI following oral administration of TAS 102 tablets or oral solution (Cmax), Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|Extent of absorption of FTD and TPI following oral administration of TAS 102 tablets or oral solution (AUC0-last), Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|Extent of absorption of FTD and TPI following oral administration of TAS 102 tablets or oral solution (AUC0-inf ), Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3
Tmax of FTD, TPI, and metabolites of FTD following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|T1/2 of FTD, TPI, and metabolites of FTD following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|CL/F of FTD and TPI following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|Vd/F of FTD and TPI following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|Cmax of metabolites of FTD following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|AUC0-last of metabolites of FTD following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|AUC0-inf of metabolites of FTD following administration of TAS 102 tablet and oral solution, Pharmacokinetic samples are taken on Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3., Day 1 of Periods 1, 2, and 3|Safety monitoring including adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, Standard safety monitoring and grading using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used., Through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment|Tumor assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Every 8 weeks during the extension period through Cycle 6 (ie, through 24 weeks). Thereafter, assessments will be performed at least every 12 weeks according to site standard of care, until at least one of the treatment discontinuation criteria is met.
This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 3-period crossover study evaluating the relative bioavailability of TAS-102 tablets compared to an oral solution in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2 parts. The crossover bioavailability part will be followed by an extension conducted with TAS-102 tablets only.
