Clinical Study on CAR-T Targeting Igβ Targets in Refractory Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Aim of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) targeting Igβ targets in patients with Igβ-positive refractory relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a group of malignant neoplasms of the lymphatic system originating from B or T cells, of which 60-70% of patients have B-cell-derived lymphoma (B-NHL). Although rituximab in combination with chemotherapy has significantly improved the prognosis of B-cell lymphoma, some patients still have primary resistance or relapse. In recent years, breakthroughs have been made in the treatment of B-cell tumors with Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cells (CART), the investigators therefore constructed CAR-T cells targeting Igβ to investigate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cells with this target for the treatment of r/r B-NHL.
