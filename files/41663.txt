Mirena® IUD's Effect on Fallopian Tube Fimbriae and Ovarian Cortical Inclusion Cyst Cell Proliferation
Combination-type oral contraceptives (COCs) have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (IEOC); this protective effect may be achieved to a large extent through COCs ability to reduce cell proliferation in the fallopian tube fimbriae (FTF). The progestin-releasing Mirena® intra-uterine device (IUD) is an increasingly popular method of contraception, but it is not known if its use will reduce a woman's risk of IEOC. Mirena® use does not block ovulation in most women but it may release sufficient progestin to also reduce cell proliferation in the FTF. This study aims to evaluate the effects of the Mirena® IUD on cell proliferation in the FTF as a possible biomarker of protection against IEOC.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
DEVICE: Mirena® intra-uterine device (IUD)
Cell Proliferation in the Fallopian Tube Fimbriae as Measured by Ki-67%+, Women will be deemed evaluable for this primary outcome if they successfully underwent placement of the Mirena® IUD, received a RRSO or RRS as planned, and had a P4 value ≤1 ng/ml., 1 year
