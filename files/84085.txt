A Phase III Trail of Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Versus Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trail comparing adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Paclitaxel and carboplatin) to adjuvant radiotherapy in patients undergoing radical esophagectomy for pathologic lymph node positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

The overall survival, To evaluate the 3 years overall survival of two groups., 3 years
Disease-free survival, To evaluate the 3 years disease-free survival of two groups., 3 years|Adverse Events, Number and degree of Adverse Events based on Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects(CTCAE) 4.0, 1 year|Scores of Quality of life, Assess the quality of life based on FACT-E, 1 year
Patient Population: Age: 18-70y; Thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer undergoing radical esophagectomy; Clinical stage T1-4, N1-3, M0; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score: 0-1; The patients are randomized to 2 arms. Arm A: Adjuvant radiotherapy (50.4gray/28fraction) followed by chemotherapy (Paclitaxel and carboplatin) 4 cycles. Arm B :Adjuvant radiotherapy (50.4gray/28fraction) only
