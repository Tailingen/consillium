Phase 2 Poor Risk DLBCL of TLI and ATG Followed by Matched Allogeneic HT as Consolidation to Autologous HCT
The purpose of this study is to determine if double autologous then allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant may offer an improved treatment option for patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not likely to be cured by the conventional transplantation regimen.

PROCEDURE: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT)|PROCEDURE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)|PROCEDURE: Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Filgrastim|DRUG: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)|DRUG: Cyclosporine|DRUG: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Acetaminophen|DRUG: Diphenhydramine|DRUG: Hydrocortisone|DRUG: Methylprednisolone
Event-free Survival (EFS) Per Protocol, Event-free survival (EFS) through 4 years, as assessed in participants with poor-risk recurrent or primary refractory DLBCL treated with TLI and ATG followed by matched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation as a consolidation to HCT. Event is defined as tumor progression or death., 48 months
Median Time to Neutrophil Engraftment After Autologous Transplant, Reported as neutrophil engraftment after autologous transplant, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 500/µL, counting from the day of transplant., within 1 month|Median Time to Platelet Engraftment After Autologous Transplant, Reported as platelet engraftment after autologous transplant, defined as platelet count \> 20,000/µL, counting from the day of transplant., within 1 month|Median Time to Neutrophil Engraftment After Allogeneic Transplant, Reported as neutrophil engraftment after allogeneic transplant, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 500/µL, counting from the day of transplant., within 1 month|Median Time to Platelet Engraftment After Allogeneic Transplant, Reported as platelet engraftment after allogeneic transplant, defined as platelet count \> 20,000/µL, counting from the day of transplant., within 1 month|Incidence of Chronic Graft vs Host Disease (GvHD), The incidence of chronic graft vs host disease (GvHD) is reported as any events within 3 years. Note that GvHD was assessed per investigator judgement. There was no protocol-specified criteria of GvHD., 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the overall and transplant related mortality rate, reported as the number of subjects remaining alive 3 years after transplant., 3 years
This study tests a tandem transplant approach that starts with transplantation of the participant's own hematopoietic (blood) cells, eg, autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto-HCT) as preparation for an subsequent matched-donor allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT).

Participants will be have progenitor cells (stem cells) mobilized into the peripheral blood with rituximab, chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or etoposide), and filgrastim (G-CSF); undergo apheresis to collect autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC, aka hematopoietic cells); and be re-infused with ≥ 3 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg (auto-HCT). Subsequently, participants will receive therapeutic, non-myeloablative chemotherapy (carmustine + cyclophosphamide + etoposide), then transplant conditioning \[total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) + anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)\] followed by ≥ 2 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg allogeneic PBSC obtained from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched or HLA single allele / antigen-mismatched donor (allo-HCT). Donors will be mobilized with 16 µg/kg filgrastim. Participant allo-HCT transplant is to occur within 150 days of auto-HCT. Post-allo-HCT infusion treatment includes cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)

Subject's participation ends if a suitable matched donor is not identified within the 150 days.

Pre-medication treatments administered during this study may include acetaminophen; diphenhydramine; hydrocortisone; and methylprednisolone.
