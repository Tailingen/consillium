Chemotherapy Related Anemia
This study is investigating darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in patients with non-myeloid cancers who are receiving chemotherapy. Darbepoetin alfa is a recombinant protein that stimulates the production of red blood cells. In this study, darbepoetin alfa will be administered as either an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) or directly into a vein (intravenously).
