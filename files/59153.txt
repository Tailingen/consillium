A Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Study of GH56 Capsules in Subjects With MTAP-Deleted Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of GH56 Capsule in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed or are intolerant in standard treatment, or have no standard therapy. The clinical trial will be carried out in two parts: phase Ia study (dose escalation study) and phase Ib (dose expansion study).
