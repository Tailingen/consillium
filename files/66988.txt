Study of Selinexor (KPT- 330), Lenalidomide, & Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is an open-label, randomized clinical study with two stages to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), efficacy, and safety of selinexor, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (SLd) in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM). The stages are dose escalation (Phase 1) and expansion (Phase 2).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor in the combination SLd in patients with RR MM, as determined by dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), efficacy, and safety, 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), According to the International Myeloma Working Group \[IMWG\] criteria, Overall Response Rate (ORR) includes: stringent complete response \[sCR\], complete response \[CR\], very good partial response \[VGPR\], and partial response \[PR\], 12 months
In Phase 1 (Dose Escalation), patients will be randomized to either once-weekly (Arm A) or twice- weekly (Arm B) dosing with selinexor. Dose escalation will be performed within each arm for both lenalidomide and selinexor to determine the selinexor MTD for that arm. Each arm will be expanded until approximately 17 patients have been treated at the MTD in each arm. The Sponsor and Investigator will review the MTD, efficacy, and safety data from Phase 1 to determine which dose schedule (Arm A or B) to be used as the RP2D dose in the Expansion Phase.

In Phase 2 (Expansion), patients who had received the MTD dose that was nominated for RP2D will continue at the same dose. Patients who did not receive the RP2D for that arm will stay on their Phase 1 dose. Additional patients will be accrued, as needed, to achieve the target population size of approximately 34 patients at the RP2D.
