A Nature-Based Virtual Reality (VR) Intervention in Family Caregivers of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Recipients
Background:

People who receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) require long-term care at home afterwards. Their caregivers often experience high levels of stress, which can lead to symptoms such as depression, anxiety, poor sleep, fatigue, and difficulties with concentration and memory.

Objective: To explore whether a nature-based immersive virtual reality (VR) program helps reduce stress in people who care for HSCT patients.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 and older who are primary caregivers of HSCT patients.

Design:

This is a two-phase study. Participants will be enrolled for 4 weeks. They will have 2 clinic visits.

Participants will have a physical exam at the beginning of the study. They will be asked to provide a saliva sample in Phase 1, and saliva and blood samples in Phase 2.

Participants will be given a VR headset. This is a device that looks like a pair of goggles worn over the eyes. They will be asked to wear the headset for 20 minutes per day. They will see 360 (Infinite) high-definition videos of nature and hear nature sounds.

Participants will record the time they spend using the VR headset in a daily diary. They will take surveys with questions about any stress and symptoms they feel once a week. This will take up to 5 minutes. Participants will have a short regular follow-up visit by phone one week after starting their participation.

At the end of the intervention study, participants will return for another physical exam. They will give saliva and/or blood samples again.

Researchers will also look at the medical records of the HSCT patients; the HSCT patients must consent to this.

Study Description:

This is an interventional protocol to decrease stress and symptoms with a four-week nature-based VR intervention in family caregivers of allogeneic HSCT recipients. This study is a two-phase study: Phase I will be a single-arm pre-post design focused on assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the four-week nature-based immersive VR program. Phase II will be a prospective randomized controlled group design to examine the effectiveness of the four-week nature-based immersive VR program (Active VR) on stress and symptoms compared to a four-week nature-based non-immersive VR program (Sham VR) in the target population.

Objectives:

Phase I

Primary Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the nature-based immersive VR program in HSCT caregivers.

Secondary Objectives: To examine the level of perceived restorativeness, perceived stress, and symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment) in HSCT caregivers participating in the nature-based immersive VR program.

Exploratory Objectives: To examine relationships among variables including but not limited to perceived stress, symptoms, HSCT caregiver characteristics, HSCT recipient characteristics, and biomarkers.

Phase II

Primary Objective: To examine whether HSCT caregivers participating in Active VR demonstrate improved levels of perceived stress compared to those participating in Sham VR.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To examine whether HSCT caregivers participating in Active VR demonstrate improved levels of symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment) compared to those participating in Sham VR.
2. To examine the acceptability of Active and Sham VR programs in HSCT caregivers.

Exploratory Objectives: To examine relationships among variables including but not limited to perceived stress, symptoms, HSCT caregiver characteristics, HSCT recipient characteristics, and biomarkers.

Endpoints: Phase I

Primary Endpoints: Feasibility (recruitment, retention, and adherence rates) and acceptability (satisfaction, usability) measured at Time 4 (Day 28); acceptability (safety) from Time 0 (Baseline; Day 0) to Time 4

Secondary Endpoints: Perceived restorativeness measured at Time 4; changes in perceived stress from Time 0 to Time 4; changes in symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment) from Time 0 to Time 4

Phase II

Primary Endpoint: Changes in perceived stress from Time 0 to Time 4

Secondary Endpoints: Changes in symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment) from Time 0 to Time 4; acceptability (satisfaction, usability) measured at Time 4; acceptability (safety) from Time 0 to Time 4
