Optimal Prostate Study
To compare the toxicity, rate of local control, biochemical failure rate and quality of life of three different radiotherapy techniques (moderate hypofractionation, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and standard radiotherapy plus 2 fractions of SBRT (BOOSTER)
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Optimal SBRT|RADIATION: Optimal Booster
local control, the rate of local control as determined on PSMA scanning, 12 months post radiotherapy
Biological failure rate, The rate of biochemical failure defined as Nadir+2.0 biochemical failure defined as Nadir+2.0, 3 year and 5 year|late toxicity, Late Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary Toxicity (modified RTOG scale), more than three months after treatment completion.|Markerless tracking technology, Markerless tracking algorithms will be assessed for accuracy against marker-based localisation by masking the markers and directly comparing the determined trajectories, During radiotherapy treatment|Accuracy of the various intrafraction guidance methods, Accuracy of various intrafraction guidance methods will be determined against triangulation of kilovoltage (kV) and Megavoltage (MV) projections, During radiotherapy treatment
Participants must have histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, good performance status and suitable for high dose radiotherapy. There are two groups of participants:

Group 1: eligible participants will be randomised to have either moderate hypofractionation or standard radiotherapy plus SBRT (BOOSTER). Participants in this group must be able to have MRI, prostate fiducial markers (gold markers)and hydrogel insertion. Fiducial markers will be used to locate the prostate accurately during radiation treatment. Hydrogel is a temporary gel being injected into the space between the prostate and rectum to reduce the dose of radiation received by the rectum to minimise side effects from the treatment.

Group 2: eligible participants will be randomised to have either moderate hypofractionation or SBRT.

Participants will be reviewed for side effects. A Safety Committee will be formed containing multi-disciplinary team members. All serious adverse will be reported to the principal investigator and Human Research Ethics Committee within 24 hours.
