A Phase 1 Study of Acalabrutinib in Japanese Adult Patients With Advanced B-cell Malignancies
This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study of acalabrutinib, a selective and irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in Japanese adult patients with advanced B-cell malignancies. This study is divided into 3 parts: Part 1 (dose-confirmation phase), Part 2 (dose-expansion phase) and Part 3 (dose-confirmation phase for combination therapy).
Part1: Advanced B-cell Malignancies|Part2: r/rCLL and r/rMCL|Part3: Untreated CLL
DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) as a measure of safety and tolerability., Acalabrutinib is considered as safe and tolerable if ≦1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT., From the first dose of study treatment to data cut-off date defined as 2 years after last subject enrolled. In Part 1, DLT will be evaluated in Cycle 1 (28 days). In Part 3, DLT will be evaluated in Cycle 2 (28 days).
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters will be derived using standard non-compartmental methods., From the date of first dose to Cycle 3 Day 28.|Free Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) not occupied by acalabrutinib, Free BTK not occupied by acalabrutinib is measured and BTK occupancy at each timepoint is calculated relative to the predose timepoint. The signal of the predose sample represents 100% free BTK (0% occupied BTK), while each sample incubated with 1 μM exogenous acalabrutinib represents 0% free BTK (100% occupied BTK)., From the date of first dose to end of treatment visit, up to 80 months|Overall response rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a response., From the start of acalabrutinib therapy to earlier of the first documentation of objective disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first up to 80 months|Duration of Response, Defined as the interval from the first documentation of response to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause., From the start of acalabrutinib therapy to earlier of the first documentation of objective disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first up to 80 months|Progression free survival, Defined as the interval from the start of acalabrutinib therapy to the earlier of the first documentation of objective disease progression or death from any cause., From the start of acalabrutinib therapy to earlier of the first documentation of objective disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first up to 80 months|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), PK parameters will be derived using standard non-compartmental methods., From the date of first dose to Cycle 3 Day 28|Time to Cmax (tmax), PK parameters will be derived using standard non-compartmental methods., From the date of first dose to Cycle 3 Day 28
