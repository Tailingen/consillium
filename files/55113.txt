Serum Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Lung Cancer Diagnosis
The study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of serum exosome noncoding RNA as a biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer
Lung Cancer (Diagnosis)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: collect samples
The expression levels of serum exosome long non-coding RNA, the first day subjects are enrolled the outcome will be assessed；up to three years after the completion of the study|the expression levels of tumor biomarkers such as CEA, NSE, SCC, CYFR2A-1, the first day subjects are enrolled the outcome will be assessed；up to three years after the completion of the study|the CT scans of the lung for the patients, the first day subjects are enrolled the outcome will be assessed；up to three years after the completion of the study
Conventional tumor markers for non-invasive diagnosis of Lung cancer (LC) exhibit insufficient sensitivity and specificity to facilitate detection of early lung cancer (ELC). The investigators aimed to identify ELC-specific exosomal lncRNA biomarkers that are highly sensitive and stable for the non-invasive diagnosis of ELC.Hence, in the present study, exosomes from the plasma of five healthy individuals and 30 LC patients and from culture media of four human bronchial epithelial cells and four cancer cells were isolated. Exosomal RNA profiling was performed using RNA sequencing to identify LC specific exosomal lncRNAs.
