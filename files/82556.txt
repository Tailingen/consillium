Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation or Crisis With Efgartigimod
This study plans to learn more about if the drug efgartigimod can be used in the hospital to treat exacerbations in participants with myasthenia gravis (MG). Efgartigimod has been approved by the FDA for ongoing (chronic) treatment of generalized MG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive but has not been studied in the treatment of worsening weakness requiring hospital admission (known as "exacerbation"). This investigation aims to see if using efgartigimod in this way improves symptoms and recovery from exacerbation, and how it affects certain MG markers in the blood. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is efgartigimod effective as a hospital-administered acute therapy for participants with worsening MG (MG exacerbation) who require hospitalization?
* Will efgartigimod lead to clinical improvement with a similar reduction in validated research scales, such as the Quantitative MG (QMG) scale, as standard of care therapies?

Participants will receive 4 doses of efgartigimod over the course of 4 weeks with an additional follow-up visit at the clinic.

Efgartigimod is thought to work by reducing circulating IgG antibodies, including the antibodies that cause MG. One of the currently used treatments for MG exacerbation, called plasma exchange (PLEX), is also thought to work by reducing antibody levels by filtering blood through a machine similar to those used in dialysis for kidney failure. Because of the similarities between how these two treatments work, there is reason to believe that efgartigimod may also be helpful in treating MG exacerbation.
