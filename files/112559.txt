Prevention of UV-induced Carcinogenic Skin Alterations in Immunosuppressed Solid Organ Transplanted Patients
The purpose of this trial is to investigate the prevention of actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas by local application of MD-3511356 in comparison to standard sun protection measures in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients.
Actinic Keratoses|Squamous Cell Carcinomas
DEVICE: MD-3511356|OTHER: Standard Sun Protection Measures
Number of New Clinically Diagnosed Actinic Keratoses or Squamous Cell Carcinomas, 2 Years
Number of Patients With New Actinic Keratoses, Squamous Cell Carcinomas or Basal Cell Carcinomas, 2 Years
This open-label multicenter, randomized, inter-individual comparative, prospective clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MD 3511356 sunscreen in preventing AK and SCC in post transplant immune-suppressed patients compared to standard of care.

The present multicenter trial is intended to contribute to the evidence that daily sun protection will have a prophylactic effect in this high risk population of chronically immune compromised patients.
