CAR-T CD19 for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia With t 8:21 and CD19 Expression
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) engineered T cells against the CD19 protein have been shown to be effective against acute lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia and are approved by the US (FDA), European (EMA) and Health Basel.

However, little information exists on using CD19CAR for treatment of recurrent or irresponsible to previous treatment acute myeloid leukemia.

The proposed study will include patients with recurrent disease or those with disease irresponsible to common treatments and they will be treated with CAR-T CD19.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T CD19
The change in the peripheral blood counts and differential, Will be evaluated by Coulter counter, Within two years from the introduction of the CAR-T CD19|The change in the antigen expression on the leukemic blasts, Will be evaluated by FACS, Within two years from the introduction of the CAR-T CD19|The change in the measurable residual disease, Will be evaluated by PCR, Within two years from the introduction of the CAR-T CD19|The change in the chromosomal translocations and aberrations, Will be evaluated by cytogenetics and FISH, Within two years from the introduction of the CAR-T CD19
