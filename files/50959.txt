Contrast Enhanced Mammography in the Evaluation of Cancer of Unknown Primary Syndrome
This study aims to evaluate the role of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) in identifying the primary tumor site in patients presenting with Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) syndrome. By integrating functional and anatomical imaging, the study explores CEM's diagnostic value compared to standard imaging modalities in a single-center setting.

Detection Rate of Primary Tumors using Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) in Patients with CUP Syndrome, The primary outcome of this study is the detection rate of primary tumors in patients presenting with Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) syndrome using Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM). The detection rate will be determined by comparing the CEM findings with histopathological results from biopsies or surgical specimens. This will allow us to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CEM in identifying occult primary tumors, particularly in the context of breast cancer., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months
Sensitivity, Specificity, and Diagnostic Accuracy of CEM compared to Standard Imaging Modalities (Ultrasound, MRI, Mammography), This secondary outcome aims to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of CEM in detecting primary tumors compared to other conventional imaging techniques, including ultrasound, MRI, and standard mammography. These metrics will be analyzed to determine the relative effectiveness of CEM as a diagnostic tool., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Correlation of CEM Findings with Histopathological Results, This measure aims to correlate the CEM findings with the histopathological results from biopsy or surgical specimens. This will assess how well the CEM images match the final diagnosis of primary tumors based on tissue analysis., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months
The study of CUP syndrome was conducted with MRI, but we propose the study with CEM
