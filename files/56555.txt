Ruxolitinib in Primary Myelofibrosis and Secondary to Essential Thrombocythemia or Polycythemia Vera
The study is observational multicenter retrospective and prospective cohort study of patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis who have initiated therapy with ruxolitinib, prescribed as part of the normal course of care and completely independent of study participation. The primary purpose is to determine the impact of clinical and laboratory characteristics of myelofibrosis on the prognosis of patients treated with ruxolitinib, understood as long-term survival.

Significance of peripheral blasts, To assess correlations between amount of peripheral blasts and response to treatment, leukaemic transformation, drug withdrawal and survival., 10 years|Prognostic value of High Molecular Risk (HMR) mutations., To assess the prognostic value of HMRs (via NGS) in MF patients treated with ruxolitinib and to develop a prognostic model that can be applied to patients before and during ruxolitinib therapy., 10 years|To validate the use of the MTSS score, To validate the use of the MTSS score to assess post-ASCT survival of patients with MF, 10 years|Incidence of adverse events, To assess the incidence of adverse events in patients with myelofibrosis treated with ruxolitinib: thrombosis, haemorrhage, second neoplasms, blastic evolution., 10 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To assess the toxicity of ruxolitinib therapy in the total cohort, 10 years
The study is observational multicenter retrospective and prospective cohort study of patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis who have initiated therapy with ruxolitinib, prescribed as part of the normal course of care and completely independent of study participation. Laboratory tests and histological, cytogenetic, molecular, and radiological investigations performed by the patient and collected for study will be conducted in accordance with clinical practice, independent of the patient's participation in the study. In particular. data on systemic symptoms and splenomegaly will be collected at diagnosis and disease reassessments performed in the context of normal clinical practice. The minimum planned duration of individual patient observation is 3 months and the planned duration of the study is 10 years.
