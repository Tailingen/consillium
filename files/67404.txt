ICIs Neoadjuvant Therapy in Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The proposed study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative administration nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable NSCLC, and will facilitate a comprehensive exploratory characterization of the tumor immune milieu and circulating immune cells and soluble factors in these patients. Data obtained in this study will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting.
High-Risk Resectable NSCLC
DRUG: Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Toripalimab, Sintilimab, Sintilimab, Tislelizumab, Durvalumab
Safety and Adverse effects, Safety will be measured by drawing safety labs. (CBC and a Chemistry Panel will be drawn at 2 week intervals during Nivolumab administration). Grade 3 and 4 lab abnormalities will be recorded from both participating sites. Safety will also be measured by recording Grade 3 and 4 CTCAE 4.03 listed adverse events that occur while a subject is participating in the study., 8 weeks
Rate of Enrollment, Feasibility will be measured by the rate of enrollment of the 40 subjects at the 2 sites., 8 weeks|Pathologic Response, To assess pathologic response to neoadjuvant nivolumab in resected tumor and lymph nodes. The rate of major pathologic response, defined as \<10% residual viable tumor cells in the resection specimen will be compared to historic data with neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 6 weeks|Radiographic Response, To assess radiographic response to neoadjuvant nivolumab using RECIST 1.1., 5 weeks
The proposed study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative administration nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable NSCLC, and will facilitate a comprehensive exploratory characterization of the tumor immune milieu and circulating immune cells and soluble factors in these patients. Data obtained in this study will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting. Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.
