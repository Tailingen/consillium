A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Selinexor Plus Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Advanced/Metastatic Solid Malignancies
This is a single-centre, phase 1a (dose escalation) and 1b (dose expansion) study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Selinexor in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
Advance Solid Malignancies|Metastatic Solid Malignancies
DRUG: Selinexor in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab
Objective disease response assessment, to be made according to standard, international RECIST 1.1 criteria for solid tumors., 3 years|progression free survival (PFS), the time interval from the starting date of combination treatment to the date of disease progression on treatment, 3 years|duration of response (DOR), is defined as the time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression, 3 years|Duration of stable disease, is defined as the time from first RECIST assessment scan documenting stable disease by RECIST criteria, to disease progression, 3 years
Primary Objectives

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of selinexor in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

Secondary Objectives

* To determine Selinexor pharmacokinetics (PK) in Asian patients
* To describe anti-tumor responses with the combination in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

Exploratory Objectives

* To assess the immunomodulatory effects of selinexor in solid tumour malignancies and circulating immune cells
* To identify biomarkers of response to the combination of selinexor and nivolumab + ipilimumab. We will explore changes in PDL1 expression, T cell infiltration (including CD4 and CD8 positive cells), gene expression profiles on serial tumor biopsies pre-selinexor, post-selinexor alone, and after the combination of selinexor and ipilimumab + nivolumab where feasible.
