A Study of Robot-Assisted Bronchoscopy in Chinese Participants With Lung Lesions
Robot-assisted bronchoscopy biopsy procedure will be conducted for all eligible subjects under general anesthesia status by trained investigators in hospital.
Lung Neoplasms
DEVICE: Robot-assisted Bronchoscopy (Monarch Platform)
Navigation Success Rate, Navigation success rate is defined as the percentage of successful navigation to the targeted lung lesion (lesion localization) as confirmed by radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) imaging through Monarch Platform during bronchoscopy procedure., Intraoperative
Time to R-EBUS Confirmation, Time to R-EBUS confirmation is defined by the time from the robotic bronchoscope inserted into the oropharynx to the localization of the targeted lesion confirmed by R-EBUS., Intraoperative|Time to the Tissue Acquisition, Time to the tissue acquisition is defined by the time the robotic bronchoscope is inserted into the oropharynx until the tissue acquisition is confirmed by the Rapid On-site evaluation (ROSE)., Intraoperative|Total Procedure Time, Total procedure time is defined by the time the robotic bronchoscope is inserted into the oropharynx until the robotic bronchoscope is removed., Intraoperative|Number of Conversion to Conventional Bronchoscopic Procedure, Number of conversion to conventional bronchoscopic procedure is defined as the number of procedures converted to other diagnostic modality due to inability of the Monarch platform to complete the intended bronchoscopy., Intraoperative|Number of Participants with Pneumothorax Requiring Intervention, Number of participants with pneumothorax requiring intervention (rated as greater than \[\>\] Grade 1 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] scale) will be reported., Up to 7 days post procedure|Number of Participants with Device or Procedure Related Bleeding Requiring Medical Intervention, Number of participants with device or procedure related bleeding requiring medical intervention (rated as \>Grade 1 according to the CTCAE scale) will be reported., Up to 7 days post procedure|Number of Participants with Device or Procedure Related Respiratory Failure, Number of participants with device or procedure related respiratory failure (rated as \>Grade 3 according to the CTCAE scale) will be reported., Up to 7 days post procedure
Robot-assisted bronchoscopy biopsy procedure will be conducted for all eligible subjects under general anesthesia status by trained investigators in hospital.
