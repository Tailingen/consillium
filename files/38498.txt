Multivisceral Resections for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to assess whether the postoperative course and survival of patients subject to multivisceral resections for locally advanced gastric cancer (cT4b) were affected by the extent of surgery. An electronic database of 1476 patients with non-metastatic gastric cancer treated between January 1996 and December 2020 will be reviewed. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy or partial colectomy affect postoperative complications
* What factors affect prognosis of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer
