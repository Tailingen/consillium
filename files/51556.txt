A Study of Aflibercept Administered in Combination With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in Participants With Advanced Carcinoma
The purpose of the study was to determine whether the combination of aflibercept, pemetrexed and cisplatin is safe and effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Advanced Carcinoma|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Aflibercept|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cisplatin
Phase 1: Recommended Dose of Aflibercept for Phase 2, Recommended Dose was defined as the highest combination dose at which fewer than 33 percent (%) of participants experienced dose limiting toxicity during the first cycle of therapy., Phase 1: Baseline up to 315 Days
Phase 2: Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking the Baseline sum LD as reference., Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to end of study (Day 972)|Phase 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time in days from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the modified RECIST. Median time of PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to end of study (Day 972)|Phase 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs., Phase 1: Baseline up to 751 Days; Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to 972 Days|Phase 1 and 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Aflibercept, The AUC0-inf was estimated by determining the total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity., Phase 1 and 2: Pre-dose up to Day 22 post-dose|Phase 1 and 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Pemetrexed, The AUC0-inf was estimated by determining the total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity., Phase 1 and 2: Pre-dose up to Day 1 post-dose, Day 2 post-dose (only in Phase 1)|Phase 1 and 2: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Aflibercept and Pemetrexed, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Phase 1 and 2: Aflibercept: Pre-dose up to Day 22 post-dose; Pemetrexed: Pre-dose up to Day 1 post-dose, Day 2 post-dose (only in Phase 1)|Phase 1 and 2: Total Body Clearance of Aflibercept, Clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes., Phase 1 and 2: Pre-dose up to Day 22 post-dose|Phase 1 and 2: Total Body Clearance of Pemetrexed, Clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes., Phase 1 and 2: Pre-dose up to Day 1 post-dose, Day 2 post-dose (only in Phase 1)|Phase 1 and 2: Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of Aflibercept, Terminal half-life was defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of drug to decrease 50 percent in the final stage of its elimination., Phase 1 and 2: Pre-dose up to Day 22 post-dose|Phase 1 and 2: Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of Pemetrexed, Terminal half-life was defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of drug to decrease 50 percent in the final stage of its elimination., Phase 1 and 2: Pre-dose up to Day 1 post-dose, Day 2 post-dose (only in Phase 1)|Phase 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Positive Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) of Aflibercept, Serum samples were analyzed by a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay to detect the presence of ADA., Phase 1: Baseline up to 315 Days; Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to Day 739|Phase 1 and 2: Number of Participants With All Grade Glucose Abnormalities, Phase 1: Baseline up to 751 Days; Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to 972 Days|Phase 1 and 2: Number of Participants With All Grade Hematology Abnormalities, Phase 1: Baseline up to 751 Days; Phase 2: Baseline (Day 421) up to 972 Days
The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, patients with advanced cancer received different doses of aflibercept in combination with approved doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin. The objective of phase 1 was to determine the safest dose of the combined study medications. This dose was administered to patients with previously untreated NSCLC in phase 2. The phase 2 portion of the study determined if the combination is effective in treating NSCLC.
