A Study of FX-909 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies, Including Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the safety and tolerability in all advanced solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma.

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Is FX-909 safe and tolerable
* What is the right dose level for patients

Participants will be asked to take FX-909 daily , in tablet form and record any outcomes from taking the drug. Participants will also be asked to return for multiple site visits for various blood tests and to collect blood and tumor samples as well as have regular CT/MRI scans

This is an open-label Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of FX-909 given orally (PO) in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Initially, FX-909 will be given in a dose-escalation phase (Part A) to determine the preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part B will proceed in a 2-stage design that will investigate 2 dose arms of FX-909 in Stage 1; with a single arm in Stage 2 envisioned. Pat B will look to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of FX-909 in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) and metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Throughout the study patients will be treated in 28-day cycles.
