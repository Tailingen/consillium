Serum Immunological Profiles in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Receiving Curative Radiotherapy
The purpose of the study is to investigate the clinical usefulness of serum levels of immunologic profiles including pro/anti-inflammatory interleukins, other detectable serum biomarkers including transforming growth factor b1 (TGFb1) or soluble major histocompatibility complex Class I chain-related peptide A (sMICA), and leukocyte subpopulations in head and neck cancers patients receiving curative radiotherapy, as prognostic biomarkers for disease recurrence and survival.
