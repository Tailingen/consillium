Dose-dense ABVD First Line Therapy in Early Stage Unfavorable Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Prospective, multicenter, Phase II trial designed to assess whether intensification of ABVD (dd-ABVD) is feasible and can improve the outcome of patients with early stage Hodgkin Lymphoma.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: dose dense ABVD
Feasibility, Proportion of patient with a dose intensity reduction (lower than 85% of planned dose), After 4 dd-ABVD cycles (12 weeks after starting treatment)|Activity, Percentage of FDG PET negativity after 2 dd-ABVD cycles will be considered as primary endpoints., After 2 dd-ABVD cycles (6 week after starting treatment)
Overall accuracy of each interim PET interpretation criteria after a minimum follow-up of three years, Concordance between pet results and patients prognosis, After 3 years of follow-up|PFS, Progression free survival estimate (prognosis outcome), 2 years from the activation of therapy in the last patient enrolled onto the study.|OS, Overall survival estimate (prognosis outcome), 2 years from the activation of therapy in the last patient enrolled onto the study.|Toxicity, Proportion of early and late toxicities (G3/4 acute toxicities, secondary malignancies, cardiovascular and pulmonary events, infertility), 2 years from the activation of therapy in the last patient enrolled onto the study.|Predictive Value of each interim PET interpretation criteria after a minimum follow-up of three years, Concordance between pet results and patients prognosis, After 3 years of follow-up
Dose-density has been shown to be an important factor for complete remission rate and longterm survival in lymphomas.

The aims of this study were to find out whether intensification of ABVD (dd-ABVD) is feasible and can improve the outcome of patients with early stage Hodgkin Lymphoma. In view of emerging data on the role of early PET in defining prognosis in Hodgkin Lymphoma patients, the percentage of FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) negativity after two cycle was chosen as the parameter to evaluate dd-ABVD activity.
