Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Relapsed Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, or Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Have Undergone Stem Cell Transplant
This phase II trial studies how well azacitidine works in treating patients with relapsed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have undergone stem cell transplant. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To improve overall survival in patients with post-transplant relapse of myeloid malignancies.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
