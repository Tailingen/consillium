Pain Comparison Whit Visual Analog Scale (EVA) Between Four Analgesic Methods During Trans Rectal Prostatic Biopsy
Define the best analgesic method between peri prostatic blockage, analgesic suppository, oral analgesic and topic anesthetic gel, during trans rectal prostate biopsy
Cancer of Prostate
Ultrasound Transducer, Evaluation of the discomfort or pain in the introduction of the trans rectal ultrasound transducer determined at the end of the procedure with Visual Analog Scale for Pain, which is a psychometric measuring instrument designed to assess the pain intensity experienced by each patient individually. Was employ for first time in 1921 and referred as a "graphical rating method", which has the characteristic of being able to achieve a rapid classification (statistically measurable and reproducible) of the severity of pain experience.

The analogous visual scale used for this study measures from 0-10 the intensity of the pain with a series of "faces" that show the intensity in the pain experimentation with categories like "No pain" approximately 0-1, mild, annoying in number 2, nagging in number 4, distressing in number 6, intense in number 8 and worst possible in number 10., Interview 15 to 30 minutes at the end of the procedure
Biopsy, Evaluation of the discomfort or pain at the moment of the biopsy, that is, when the needle is inserted to take the samples in a 12-cylinder minimum or as needed, determined at the end of the procedure with Visual Analog Scale for Pain, The analogous visual scale used for this study measures from 0 to 10 the intensity of pain with a series of "faces" that show the intensity in the pain experimentation with categories such as "No pain" approximately 0-1, mild, annoying in number 2, annoying in number 4, distressing in number 6, intense in number 8 and worse in number 10.

Comparison between four analgesic methods during trans rectal prostatic biopsy.

OBJECTIVE: To define the best analgesic method between the peri-prostatic block, the analgesic suppository, the oral analgesic, the final anesthetic gel, during the trans rectal prostate biopsy determined at the end of the procedure with a visual analogue scale for pain (VAS pain) in a Interview 15 to 30 minutes at the end of the procedure.

METHODS: experimental, retrospective, longitudinal, comparative, during May to July 2017, 350 trans rectal prostate biopsies were performed, all cases were randomly assigned to one of the four study groups. The data analysis will be performed by calculating measures of central tendency and dispersion for quantitative variables and ANOVA test, for qualitative variables Chi square to determine statistical differences between the three moments of pain in the parameters of introduction of the ultrasound transducer, sampling of Prostate of the minimum 12 biopsies and discomfort in general of the procedure
