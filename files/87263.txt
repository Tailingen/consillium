BAY86-9766 Plus Gemcitabine Phase I Study in Asian
This is an open-label, uncontrolled, Phase Ib study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BAY86-9766 when given as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine in Asian patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.Blood samples for PK (pharmacokinetics) analyses will be collected after a single dose of BAY86-9766, multiple doses of BAY86-9766, and combination treatment of gemcitabine and BAY86-9766.

Safety evaluation will include adverse events assessment, vital signs, laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG ECG (electrocardiography), cardiac function test, and ophthalmologic examination at various time points during the study.
