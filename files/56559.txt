Abraxane, Avastin, and Gemcitabine as First-Line Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The investigators hypothesize that the combination of Gemzar®, Abraxane® and Avastin will increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with first line metastatic breast cancer and in patients who received neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy present with definable metastatic disease, 6 or more months after primary treatment.

Median Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival will be measured from the first dose date to the earliest date of documented evidence of progressive disease or the date of death due to any causes, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months
Rates of Partial Response (PR), Complete Response (CR) and Overall Response (ORR) in Study Participants, Rates of partial response (PR), complete response (CR) and overall response (PR+CR = ORR) in study participants according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0., After two cycles, about 60 days|Rate of Toxicity in Study Participants, Determination of safety and side effect profile of the protocol therapy including the rate of toxicity in study participants. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 will be utilized for adverse event reporting., Over the course of study treatment.|Relationship Between Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and Disease Progression as Measured by Presence of CTC at Baseline and Over the Course of Study Treatment, Exploration of the relationship between circulating tumor cells (CTC) and disease progression, by measuring CTC at baseline and over the course of treatment., Baseline, over the course of Treatment, about 1 year|Relationship Between SPARC Expression and Response to Protocol Therapy., Relationship between SPARC expression and response to this chemotherapy combination and relation to progression free survival., Baseline, over the course of treatment, about 1 year
This is a phase 2, single arm study. Participants will be treated with combination Gemzar, Abraxane and Avastin therapy until disease progression. Each treatment cycle is 28 days.
