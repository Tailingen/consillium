A Multi-omics Study of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This study aims to analyze the multi-omics results between epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patient with different FIGO stages and pathological subtypes. The multi-omics profiles include whole exome sequencing, analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics. A comprehensive multi-omics will reveal the invasiveness and tumorigenesis of EOC.
