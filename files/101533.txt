bTAE-HAIC Combined With Lenvatinib and Sintilimab for Infiltrative Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of blank- microsphere transcatheter arterial embolization-hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (bTAE-HAIC) plus Lenvatinib and Camrelizumab for patients with infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma.

PROCEDURE: bTAE-HAIC|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Sintilimab
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, 6 months
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression or death due to any cause., 6 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until death from any cause., 12 months
Blank-microsphere transcatheter arterial embolization (bTAE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin are effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib is non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Sintilimab, a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, is effective and safe in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated bTAE-HAIC plus Lenvatinib and Sintilimab. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find out it.
