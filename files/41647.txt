Phase III Study of Nazartinib (EGF816) Versus Erlotinib/Gefitinib in First-line Locally Advanced / Metastatic NSCLC With EGFR Activating Mutations
This is a phase III, open label, randomized controlled multi-center global study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent nazartinib (EGF816) compared with investigator's choice (erlotinib or gefitinib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who are treatment naïve and whose tumors harbor EGFR activating mutations (L858R or ex19del).

DRUG: EFG816|DRUG: erlotinib or gefitinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Blinded independent review committee (BIRC), PFS using central BIRC assessment according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression (as assessed by BIRC per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 3 years
