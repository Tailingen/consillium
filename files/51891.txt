Nab-paclitaxel Plus S-1 in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) plus S-1 as first-line treatment in Chinese patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel|DRUG: S-1
Objective response rate, Percentage of patients who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Measure at every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles)
Progression-free survival, Measure of time from study treatment to disease progression or death., up to 15 months|Overall survival, Measure of time from study treatment to patient's death or lost to follow-up., up to 2 years|Disease control rate, The sum of rates of partial response, complete response and steady disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Measure every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles)|Safety and tolerability, Percentage of patients who experience adverse events during this study., up to 18 month
Advanced PDA is a lethal disease with a approximately 6 months of median survival. Gemcitabine is always the only approved single agent. The recent results of the phase III trial MPACT (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial) demonstrated an improvement in overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone. Thus, the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine became one of a standard treatment in metastatic PDA. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine, and shown to be non-inferior to gemcitabine on OS for unresectable pancreatic cancer, and also demonstrated non-inferior, and even superior to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy. This single-arm study is to explore the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 as first-line treatment in Chinese patients with local advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
