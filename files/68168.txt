Swallowing assessment with the Functional Oral Intake Scale, Swallowing was assessed using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). Scores ranged from one (no oral intake) to seven (normal diet with no change in texture), with a high score indicating good swallowing function., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Aesthetic evaluation, A subjective patient assessment of the aesthetic result was carried out using the appearance subcategory of the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL v4). There are five possible responses, each scored at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100. A score of 0 represents the worst possible aesthetic result, and a score of 100 the best possible result., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Quality of Life assessment using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (version 3.0) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head & Neck 43 questionnaires., The QLQ-C30 is a general quality-of-life questionnaire specific to oncological pathology and intended for all cancer patients regardless of location.

It comprises a central questionnaire for assessing 5 functions (physical, cognitive, social, limitations in daily activities and psychological), 9 symptoms and overall health. To this questionnaire can be added modules specific to a cancer site, such as the EORTC QLQ-H\&N43 for head and neck cancers.

Responses to both questionnaires are then transformed to produce a score ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health scale, a high score represents a good level of functioning, while a high score on the symptom scales indicates a high level of symptoms and/or problems., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, Functional assessment of the upper limb was performed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.

Higher scores indicate an inability to perform tasks, great difficulty in doing them, or significant symptoms., through study completion, an average of 2 years
