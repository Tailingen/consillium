Circulating Tumor DNA Study in Patients With Endometrial Cancer
The objective of this study is to identify a population at risk of early recurrence after oncologic resection surgery of a primary uterine tumor based on the detection of ctDNA

Recurrence-free survival, 3 years|Frequency of ctDNA detection based on established prognostic parameters, Frequency of ctDNA detection based on established prognostic parameters: histological type (endometrioid, non-endometrioid), grade (low grade, high grade), stage (localized to the uterus stages I-II or stage III with nodal involvement), lymphovascular invasion (present/absent), and molecular group (low risk: POLE, intermediate risk: MSI/NSMP, high risk: TP53)., 3 years|Frequency of ctDNA detection in other prognostic groups, Frequency of ctDNA detection in other prognostic groups according to the 2021 ESGO-ESTRO-ESP classification, 3 years|Frequency of ctDNA detection based on the recurrence profile, Frequency of ctDNA detection based on the recurrence profile : anatomical (locoregional versus distant; abdominal versus extra-abdominal; visceral or nodal) or dynamic (aggressive recurrence (progression-free survival post recurrence \<6 months) or non-aggressive (\>6 months)), 3 years
Despite early management, the risk of recurrence in non-metastatic endometrial cancer (FIGO I-III) is approximately 10-20%. The challenge is to identify the most high-risk cases for relapse in order to adapt surgical and medical management.

The development of digital PCR methods in nano-droplets, detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with high sensitivity, could help to better specify the prognosis of patients with localized endometrial cancer and to identify a population with residual disease, the source of this ctDNA.

The investigators established a universal methylation signature in the laboratory based on analysis of endometrial cancer-specific DNA methylation using in silico analysis of public data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, validated in an independent cohort, with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity.

A prospective biological cohort was established between the gynecology and medical oncology departments and the Cochin Hospital biological resources center (CARPEM-OncoCentre collection).

This is a prospective monocentric biological collection study.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of pre- and post-operative ctDNA detection in stage I-III endometrial cancer.
