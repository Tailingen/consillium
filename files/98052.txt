To Study the Concentration Level of, Doxil, and Doxorubicin at Various Time Frames
Doxil or Doxorubicin to be administered was administered in a dose of 50 mg/m2 as infusion over 15 minutes. Blood samples to be obtained at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours
Lymphoma Leukemia
DRUG: Doxorubicin
Bioavailability of Doxil versus Doxorubicin, Intravenous Doxil versus Doxorubicin of 50mgm/m2 over 15 minutes and plasma concentration will be measured at time Frame: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cycle is defined as 28 days.

Maximum observed plasma concentration of doxorubicin versus Doxil in participants at time Frame: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cycle is defined as 28 days., 72 hours . Cycle defined as 28 days
Comparison of AUC in a single dose of Doxorubicin vs single dose of Doxil \[ Time Frame: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cycle is defined as 28 days) The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic equivalence of Doxorubicin and Doxil as a single dose in patients with carcinomas, lymphomas and leukemia's. The outcome measure will be determined by analyzing the concentration from each patient at pre-specified time points and calculating Area under the curve (AUC) and Peak Plasma Concentration (C max)to determine % variability between doxorubicin and Doxil within each patient.
