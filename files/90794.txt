SCT200 in Combination With SCT-I10A/Paclitaxel/Docetaxel in Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The study is to explore the efficacy and safety of SCT200 with SCT-I10A or SCT200 combined with paclitaxel/docetaxel in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma
DRUG: SCT-I10A|DRUG: SCT200|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: docetaxel
Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by the overall best response rate (assessed according to RECIST version 1.1)., From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months
Disease control rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST version 1.1, From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response(DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first response to first disease progression or death, From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the time between the date of first dose and the date of first documented disease progression (as assessed by RECIST version 1.1) or death from any cause., From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival(OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first drug administration to death from any cause., From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months|Correlation of PD-L1 expression level with efficacy and prognosis, For cohort1、2-1 and 3, evaluating correlation of PD-L1 expression level with efficacy and prognosis, From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months
Occurrence of Study Treatment Related Adverse Events, Related adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0. An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical product., From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months|Immunogenicity, Serum anti-SCT200 antibody and anti-SCT-I10A antibody levels before and after administration, From date of the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of receiving new antitumor therapy or date of withdraw informed consent or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months
This multicenter, open phase Ib study focused on evaluating the objective response response rates of SCT200 in combination with SCT-I10A or SCT200 in combination with paclitaxel/docetaxel in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had previously received different treatments.
