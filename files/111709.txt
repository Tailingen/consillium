Dual Specificity CD19 and CD22 CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for CD19+CD22+ Relapsed and Refractory Lymphoma
Patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma often develop resistance to chemotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CART) therapy showed promising effect in B-cell malignancies these years. CD19 and CD22 are proteins expressed on the surface of the lymphoma cells in patients with CD19+CD22+ lymphoma. The CAR enables the T-cells to recognize and kill the tumor cell through recognition of CD19 and CD22. This is a phase 2 trial to study the safety and efficacy of dual specificity CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cell immunotherapy for CD19+CD22+ relapsed and refractory lymphoma.
