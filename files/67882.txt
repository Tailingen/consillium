Viral & Host Factors Associated With Hepatitis B Virus-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Adult liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The major risk factor for liver cancer is hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The purpose of the study is to sequence the HBV genome in patients with chronic HBV infection, and in patients with liver cancer resulting from chronic HBV infection. The goal is to identify mutations in the HBV genome that predisposes these high risk individuals to the development of liver cancer.
