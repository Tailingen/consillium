Characteristics of Gut Microbiota in Patients With Colon Cancer of Different Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndromes
Guided by the idea of combining disease differentiation with syndrome differentiation in traditional Chinese medicine, this study used the form of questionnaire to summarize the changes of TCM syndromes, TCM constitution types in colorectal cancer patients before and after surgery. The Next-generation sequencing technology was used to explore the changes and differences of intestinal microorganisms before and after surgery. The correlation between changes of TCM syndromes, TCM constitution types, intestinal microbial evolution and tumor biological characteristics in colorectal cancer patients before and after surgery was analyzed. To explore the rationality of TCM in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer recurrence and metastasis in order to guide the individualized treatment and dietary regulation of TCM.
