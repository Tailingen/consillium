Safety and Efficacy of Fruquintinib Plus Chidamide and Sintilimab in the Third and Later Line Treatment of MSS/pMMR Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The prognosis of most patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poor despite the advancements in chemotherapy and target therapy.

CAPability-01 trial investigated the potential efficacy of combining the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody sintilimab with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) chidamide with or without the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody bevacizumab in patients with unresectable chemotherapy-refractory locally advanced or metastatic microsatellite stable/proficient mismatch repair (MSS/pMMR) colorectal cancer.

Based on the previous findings of CAPability-01, we will further evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab and chidamide in combination with fruquintinib in the same setting.
