A Study on Early Removal of Urinary Catheter After Gastric Cancer Surgery Applying ERAS Protocols
This study compared the immediate removal of urinary catheter and early removal of urinary catheter after radical gastrectomy to explore the feasibility of immediate removal of urinary catheter after radical gastrectomy, especially in the incidence of urinary retention, whether immediate removal is not inferior to early removal.
Urinary Catheter Removal After Surgery
PROCEDURE: immediate urinary catheter removal|PROCEDURE: early removal of urinary catheter
postoperative urinary retention incidence, From urinary catheter removed to 6 hours after removal
postoperative urinary tract infection incidence, from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 7|anxious status, measured by Kolcaba scale, Kolcaba scale scores from 30 to 112, higher scores mean the patients feel more comfortable during hospitalization (a better outcome)., postoperative day 1|comfort status, measured by hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD scale), HAD scale scores from 0 to 20, a higher score means the patients feel more stressful during hospitalization (a worse result)., postoperative day 1
