In this study, effects of γδT cells on human breast cancer (her2-, er-,pr-) in combination with tumor reducing surgery, for example cryosurgery going to be investigated.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: DC-CIK|BIOLOGICAL: γδ T Cell|BIOLOGICAL: Combination
Reduced size of the tumors, Up to one year
Breast tumor will be removed using tumor reducing surgery such as cryosurgery. PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cell and DC-CIK, they will be infused to the patients as immunotherapy.
