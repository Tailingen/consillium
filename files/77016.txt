SHP2 Inhibitor ET0038 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ET0038 in patients with advanced solid tumors. It is anticipated that approximately 34 subjects will be enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the study. ET0038 will be administered orally once daily (QD) in 21-day treatment cycles.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ET0038
Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ET0038, MTD based on Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation phase. A DLT is defined as any toxicity not attributable to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation, which occurs before the end of Cycle 1 (21 days as a cycle), Approximately 2 years|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D may be the same dose level or lower than the determined MTD., Approximately 2 years|Number of participants with adverse events, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, cardiac imaging and ophthalmological assessments, Approximately 2 years
Area under the curve, Area under the plasma concentration time curve of ET0038, Approximately 2 years|Cmax, Highest observed plasma concentration of ET0038, Approximately 2 years|Tmax, Time of highest observed plasma concentration of ET0038, Approximately 2 years|T1/2, Half life of ET0038, Approximately 2 years|Objective response rate, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (CR+PR), Approximately 2 years|Duration of response, DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy, to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate, DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved remission (PR+CR) and stabilization (SD) after treatment in evaluable cases., Approximately 2 years|progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time between the onset of randomization and the onset (of any aspect) of tumor progression or death (from any cause)., Approximately 2 years|overall survival, OS is defined as the time between the beginning of randomization and the death of the patient from any cause, Approximately 2 years
Changes in phospho-ERK levels, Blood will be collected at pre-dose at screening and d on-treatment biopsy (between C2D1 and C3D1) to assess the extent of target engagement, Approximately 2 years|NGS test of RTK/MAPK pathway genes, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) test will be performed with the tumor tissues or plasma ctDNA collected before ET0038 treatment, to detect gene alterations within the RTK/MAPK pathway. Detected gene alteration data (including but not limited to mutation, insertion, deletion, amplification, translocation...) will be further analyzed for correlation with the anti-tumor activity of ET0038., Approximately 2 years
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of oral ET0038 monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors. The study will include 2 components: 1) a Dose-Escalation Component for participants with advanced solid tumors and 2) a Dose-Expansion Component for participants with advanced solid tumors harboring certain specific mutations/rearrangements that result in hyperactivation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Participants will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.
