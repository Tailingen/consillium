Safety and Effect of Pertuzumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Which Has Progressed After Prior Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug pertuzumab is effective in treating patients with advanced lung cancer that has recurred following prior chemotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pertuzumab
Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD), A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 1 year)
Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD) With HER2 Phosphorylation + or - Tumors, A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
