Potentiation of Cetuximab by Tregs Depletion With CSA in Advanced Head & Neck Cancer
This is a feasibility study to assess the effectiveness of cetuximab when administered with low dose oral cyclophosphamide. Patients with metastatic squamous cell cancer of head and neck who have progressed on first line chemotherapy other than a cetuximab containing regimen will be treated with standard of care weekly cetuximab and twice daily low dose oral cyclophosphamide for 12 weeks.

Progression, The number of patients without disease progression two years out from study enrollment. Progression of disease is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and is as at least a 20% increase in size of the lesion(s) being followed and/or the appearance of one or more new lesions., At 2 Years
Aggregate Ratio of Tregs to Effector Cells for All Participants, The ratio of Tregs to effector cells (NK cells, CD 8+ lymphocytes, macrophages/monocytes) in tumor tissue as measured by immune-histochemistry (IHC) of tumor tissue for all Participants. Measure of central tendency was collected but the data is not accessible anymore because PI left institution and did not respond to requests for data., 6 Weeks Post Treatment with Cyclophosphamide|Aggregate Ratio of Tregs to Natural Killer (NK) Cells for All Participants, the Ratio of Tregs to NK cells in peripheral blood as measured by flow cytometry for all Participants. Measure of central tendency was collected but the data is not accessible anymore because the PI left institution and did not respond to requests for data., 6 Weeks Post Treatment with Cyclophosphamide|Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells in Tumor Tissue, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumor tissue as measured by immune-histochemistry (IHC), Week 6|Quality of Life Scores, Comparison of health related quality of life scores as measured by FACT-G: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (constitutes the core of all subscales; the FACT-G can be used with patients of any tumor type)questionnaire.

At this point, the data is not able to be analyzed because the PI left the institution and did not respond to requests for data., Comparison from Baseline to Week 6 and Week 12|Overall Survival, Defined as the number of patients alive two years out from study enrollment., 2 years
In this study, patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will be given low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with standard of care cetuximab. Tumor biopsies will be collected before and six weeks after treatment for measurement of tumor infiltration by effector cells, including CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. In addition, the proportion of Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) to effector cells will be measured in peripheral blood at the same time points.
