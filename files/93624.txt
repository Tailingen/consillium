Hypofractionated Radiotherapy With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Single center, single arm, Phase II study designed to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated IMRT to 62.5 Gy in 25 fractions (2.5 Gy/fraction) with 4D PET/CT-based radiation treatment planning and concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel in Stage IIIA or Stage IIIB NSCLC subjects.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: 2.5 Gy/fraction|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Acute and late toxicities assessed based on the common toxicity criteria for adverse events version 3.0 (CTCAEv5.0), Acute toxicities (toxicity during and within 90 days of radiation therapy) and delayed toxicities will be measured using CTCAE criteria, version 5.0. Acute toxicities are defined as those toxicities occurring during and within 90 days from the completion of radiotherapy and delayed toxicities are those that develop at least 90 days after the last dose of radiation, During and within 90 days of radiation therapy
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival will be measured from the last day of radiation treatment until evidence of local or distant disease progression., year 0 - year 2|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be measured from the last day of radiation treatment until death., year 0 - year 5|Local control, Assessment of local control after treatment with radiotherapy combined with Carboplatin and Placlitaxel, year 0 - year 2
This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated IMRT to 62.5 Gy in 25 fractions (2.5 Gy/fraction) with 4D PET/CT-based radiation treatment planning and concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel in Stage IIIA or Stage IIIB NSCLC subjects.

Hypofractionated IMRT allows escalation of the biological effective dose (BED) to the tumor and reduces the radiation treatment duration to 5 weeks. Increasing the BED without protracting the RT course may be a more effective means of dose escalation than simply increasing the total dose but using only 2 Gy/fraction, as was tested in RTOG 0617.

Investigators require the use of advanced treatment planning techniques, including 4D CT simulation, volume delineation utilizing PET/CT to identify gross disease and IMRT to minimize the total volume of normal tissue receiving a high dose of radiation.

As minimal published work has evaluated hypofractionated RT regimens for Stage III NSCLC with concurrent chemotherapy, investigators selected a moderately escalated dose/fraction of 2.5 Gy for evaluation in combination with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel.
