Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T Cells Targeting CD123 in Patients With Acute Leukemia
This is a single arm, open-label, phase 1 study, to determine the safety and efficacy of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in treating patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia in a dose-escalation way.
Acute Leukemia|Acute Leukemia in Relapse|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia
DRUG: anti-CD123 CAR-T treatment
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, 28 days|Incidence of adverse events, assessed by NCI CTCAE version 4.0, Day 1-60 months after injection|Disease response (CR or CRi), Day 1-60 months after injection
Survival, Day 1-60 months after injection|Minimal residual disease, Day 1-60 months after injection
This is a dose-escalation study of autologous anti-CD123 CAR-T cells. Patients receive fludarabine phosphate(300 mg/m\^2) and cyclophosphamide (30 mg/m\^2) IV on days -5 to -3, and then Patients receive autologous anti-CD123 CAR T cells IV over 20 minutes on day 0 (20% of total dose), day2 (30% of total dose) and day6 (50% of total dose, according to the side-effects occured). The total dose of CAR-T cells used in dose-escalation study is 0.5x10\^6- 2.0x10\^6 CAR-T cells/kg.
