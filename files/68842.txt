Reolysin Combined With Docetaxel and Prednisone or Docetaxel and Prednisone Alone in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if giving Reolysin in combination with docetaxel and prednisone can offer better results than standard therapy with docetaxel and prednisone.

Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of Reolysin when given together with docetaxel and prednisone.
