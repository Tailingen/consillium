A Study of Amivantamab Subcutaneous (SC) Administration for the Treatment of Advanced Solid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of subcutaneous (SC) administration of amivantamab based on safety and pharmacokinetics and determine a dose, dose regimen and formulation for amivantamab SC delivery.
Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: Ami-LC-MD|DRUG: Ami-LC|DRUG: Ami-HC|DRUG: Ami-HC-CF|DRUG: Lazertinib
Observed Amivantamab Serum Concentration Immediately Prior to the Next Dose Administration (Ctrough), Ctrough is the observed amivantamab serum concentration immediately prior to the next drug administration., Up to Day 29|Amivantamab Steady-state Area Under the Curve (AUCss), AUCss is defined as the area under the curve for amivantamab at steady state., Cycle 4 (28 days)|Number of Participants with Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the drug. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product., Up to 4 years 1 month|Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be assessed., Up to Day 28|Number of Participants with Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) abnormalities will be assessed., Up to 4 years 1 month
Number of Participants with Anti-amivantamab and Anti-rHuPH20 antibodies, Number of participants with anti-amivantamab and anti-rHuPH20 antibodies will be assessed., Up to 4 years 1 month|Part 3: Plasma Concentration of Lazertinib, Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of lazertinib using a validated method., Up to 4 years 1 month|Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Concentrations, EGRF concentrations markers will be assessed., Up to 4 years 1 month|Mesenchymal-Epidermal Transition Tyrosine Kinase Receptor/Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (cMET) Markers, cMET markers will be analyzed., Up to 4 years 1 month|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of participants with partial response (PR) or better according to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 4 years 1 month|Part 2: Maximum Amivantamab Dosing Interval Between Time Zero to Steady State, Maximum amivantamab dosing interval Between time zero to steady state will be assessed., Up to 4 years 1 month
The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of subcutaneous (SC) administration of amivantamab based on safety and pharmacokinetics and determine a dose, dose regimen and formulation for amivantamab SC delivery.
