The Children and Adolescents Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Survivor Study
The Children and Adolescents Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Survivor Study will investigate the long-term effects of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and its associated therapies. A prospective and retrospective cohort study will be conducted through a multi-institutional collaboration. This project will study children and adolescents exposed to specific therapeutic modalities, including radiation, chemotherapy, and/or surgery, who are at increased risk of late-occurring adverse health outcomes. A group of sibling controls will be identified and data collected for comparison purposes.
NPC Patients
Overall survival(OS), The OS was defined as the duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 5 years
Progress-free survival(PFS), Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site or death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up, 5 years|Locoregional failure-free survival(LRFS), The LRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit, 5 years|Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit, 5 years|Short-term toxic effects assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0), The shortterm toxic effects were assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0), 3 months

The study will focus on the following objectives:

* Characterize survivors' health with respect to disease- and treatment-related factors.
* Investigate the consequences of various intensities of exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation on health outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular, reproductive, second cancers, etc...).
* Compare the mortality experience of survivors with the general population.
* Characterize the health-related behaviors, patterns of medical care, and medical follow-up needs of survivors.
* Describe patterns of familial aggregation of cancer, including known (and variations of) cancer family syndromes.
* Collect and store biologic samples (saliva, blood, second tumor tissue) to correlate with health outcomes and use for future research.
