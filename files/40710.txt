Pharmacokinetic Study of BAY43-9006 and Taxotere to Treat Patient With Prostatic Cancer
The purpose of the trial is to determine the most effective dose of BAy 46-9003 associated to taxotere for first-line treatment of patient with prostatic cancer.

BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and VEGFR inhibitor, which is orally available and has a favorable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors. This, together with the antitumor activity observed after treatment with BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB), provides a rationale for further evaluation in patients with advanced cancer. The recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) for future studies is 400 mg bid as a continuous dosing schedule.
Primary Disease|Prostate Cancer
DRUG: sorafenib (200 or 400mg bid) and taxotere iv
Determine the recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) in combination with docetaxel in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients as first line treatment in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer., after the first 24 patients

This study propose to treat patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory prostatic cancer in first intention. There is no limits of age from 18 years old. A new inhibitor of angiogenesis (Sorafenib) is associated to the standard treatment in this type of pathology.

Patients have to demonstrate radiologically a disease progression and also a progression based on increase of psa level.

The main objective is to Determine the recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 in combination with docetaxel in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients as first line treatment in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
