Adherence to Survivorship Care Guidelines in Health Care Providers for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Colorectal Cancer Survivor Care
This clinical trial studies adherence to survivorship care guidelines in health care providers for non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer survivor care. The completion of an educational intervention by health care providers may increase compliance and adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for survivorship care.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate adherence of oncology health care providers to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for cancer survivorship care in colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cancers.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To develop and assess a targeted educational initiative to improve compliance with NCCN CRC and NSCLC survivorship guidelines for oncology health care providers in academic and community practice.

II. To evaluate the impact of this educational initiative on documented adherence and compliance with NCCN guidelines for NSCLC and CRC survivorship care by oncology health care providers.

OUTLINE:

Health care providers complete an educational intervention based on NCCN guidelines in CRC and NSCLC survivorship care comprising a power point presentation reviewing evidence and guidelines; a USB drive of the NCCN guidelines with paper copy of pages addressing survivorship care; an electronic and paper copy of a sample survivorship clinic template note with prompts for addressing survivorship care components; and an electronic paper copy sample survivorship care plan that can be adapted and distributed at each participating site.
