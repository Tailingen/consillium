CyBeR Association in Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL
Forty percent of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have primary refractory or relapsed disease (R/R). For these fit patients, standard treatment in second line therapy is high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In 48% of DLBCL no ASCT is possible due to progressive disease. For these patients or ineligible to transplantation patients, salvage therapy is often rituximab-gemcitabine-oxaliplatine regimen with an overall response rate (ORR) about 50%.

Bendamustine in combination with rituximab, used as a single agent in the setting of R/R DLBCL patients, have shown an ORR of 62.7% and 45.8% with a good safety profile.

Bendamustine and cytarabine (BAC) showed high synergy in inducing cell death in mantle cell lymphoma and DLBCL cell lines. In a recent phase II study, the combination of cytarabine with Rituximab and Bendamustine (R-BAC) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who were previously untreated, refractory or relapsed was evaluated.

The efficacy and safety of the R-BAC association will be evaluated in this phase II trial enrolling 78 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Cytarabine
treatment response, established with 1999 Cheson criteria on CT-scan, up to 20 weeks (at the end of the treatment)
overall survival, 2 years|progression free survival, 2 years
Participants will received 6 cycles every 21 days with a follow-up period of 24 months.

CT-Scan after 3 cycles and at the end of the treatment will be used to assess treatment response, established with Cheson criteria in 1999.

Principal objective is to obtain an overall response rate of 60% (corresponding to an increased of 15% of the rituximab-gemcitabine-oxaliplatine regimen's overall response rate).

Secondaries objectives are to value toxicity, progression free survival and overall survival.
