LCAR-B38M Cells in Treating Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Multiple Myeloma
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase 1/2 study, to determine the safety and efficacy of LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells in treating patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (r/r MM).

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a usually incurable malignancy of plasma cells. Current therapies for multiple myeloma often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse and die, an clear unmet clinical needs. As early as mid-2014, the investigators have started to develop a series of proprietary CAR-T products to target B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a cell surface molecule which the investigator believes to be a desirable target antigen for multiple myeloma. All pre-clinical data and CMC data for LCAR-B38M CAR-T cell technology has been established by mid-2015 and a phase I proof-of-concept clinical trial has been planned since then.
