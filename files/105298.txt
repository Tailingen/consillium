Effects of Octreotide Acetate on Circulating Levels of Chromogranin A in Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients
The present study will provide information on whether the somatostatin analog, octreotide acetate, could have an inhibitory effect on circulating chromogranin A. The demonstration of an antisecretory effect of somatostatin analogs could offer a rationale for a large scale randomized study.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Octreotide LAR
Time to 25% decrease in chromogranin A plasma level (evaluation every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks and every 12 weeks after)
PSA response (decrease > 50% or increase > 25% from baseline)|Time to symptomatic progression (bone pain increase, deterioration of ECOG performance status)|Change in circulating IGF-1, VEGF, IL-6, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine and serum calcium every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks and every 12 weeks after
