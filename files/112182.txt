Second-line Treatment With Icotinib in Esophageal Carcinoma Patients With EGFR Overexpression (IHC 3+) or Positive FISH
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib in treating advanced carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction and esophagus with EGFR overexpression (IHC 3+) or positive FISH, the primary endpoint is objective response rates.
Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction|Esophageal Carcinoma
DRUG: Icotinib
Objective response rates, Number of participants who achieve complete response or partial response. Either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will be evaluated by RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., 2 months
Progression Free Survival, A duration from randomization date to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death. If a participant are known to have progressed, the time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known not to be progressed., 5 months|Overall survival, Overall Survival is assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant is known to have died, the time to death is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive., 9 months
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is critical for cancer cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis.EGFR is overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies and therefore makes an attractive therapeutic target.This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib in treating advanced carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction and esophagus with EGFR overexpression (IHC 3+) or positive FISH, the primary endpoint is objective response rates. Secondary endpoints include progress-free survival, overall survival, safety and so on.
