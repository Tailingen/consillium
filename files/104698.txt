* If there is an absence of pain in the treated hands/feet
* If there is an absence of nail changes in the treated hands/feet, 13 weeks
Women with breast cancer receiving paclitaxel will complete the Brief Pain Inventory(BPI), Neuropathic Pain Syndrome Inventory (NPSI)while a member of the research team will conduct an assessment of their nails. Once complete, cryotherapy will be administered 15 minutes prior to the paclitaxel infusion, continuously during and then 15 minutes after completion of the paclitaxel for a total of 90 minutes. Cyrotherapy will be delivered using Elasto-gel mitts and Rapid relief slippers. These items will be changed 45min after initiation to ensure coldness.

There will be two arms of the study. One arm will include subjects who will wear one slipper/one mitt on their foot/hand while the other foot/hand will serve as a control. The other arm will include subjects who will have cryotherapy to both hands and feet. . This process will be repeated for a total of 12 times in conjunction with 12 doses of paclitaxel. At time point 13, during a routine visit to their oncologist, the subjects nails will be reassessed along with completion of the BPI and NPSIA total of 25 subjects will be enrolled in each arm.
