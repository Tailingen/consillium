A Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Atezolizumab Administered in Combination With Hu5F9-G4 to Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This Phase Ib study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab when given in combination with Hu5F9-G4 to patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Hu5F9-G4
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of participants with at least one adverse event., Up to approximately 13 months after first participant enrolled|Complete Remission (CR), The CR rate is assessed as the percentage of participants who achieve a CR, complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) (as defined by the IWG 2003 and ELN 2010 criteria) after up to six cycles of combination therapy., Up to approximately 3 months after first participant enrolled|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the initial response (CR, CRp, CRi, CRh, or partial remission \[PR\]) to the time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 3 months after first particpant enrolled
