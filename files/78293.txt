Positive Imaging Study for Distant Metastases in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The primary purpose of this research is to describe patient characteristics predictive of an imaging study positive for distant metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and no known distant metastases.
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Occurrence Measured in Time of an Image Showing Positive for M1 (Metastatic Disease) at Baseline to Registration, The primary endpoint for the study will be the occurrence of an imaging study at baseline that is positive for M1 (yes or no) among all patients in the primary analysis population.The primary analysis population consists of patients who had a current diagnosis of having non metastatic (M0) disease at baseline. These patients underwent imaging scans at baseline and were assessed for metastatic (M1) versus non metastatic (M0) disease., Each enrolled subject will be evaluated at baseline for the occurrence of metastatic disease by positive imaging scan.
