Active Surveillance vs in Office Fulguration for Low Grade Bladder Cancer Tumors
Biological behabiour of low grade bladder cancer tumors is well known. They have a very high rate of recurrences during their follow up but very low (less than 1%) risk of progression.

Until now, the gold standard of any bladder recurrence for this patients is performing an immediate transurethral ressection of the tumor.

This surgery has risk of complications and, due to the low risk of these subgroup of tumors, sometimes it becomes an overtreatment for the patients.

This is the reason why new conservative or less invasive surgeries are proposed to follow up and treat these patients.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic fulguration
Progression rate, Number of patients that progress during the follow up, two years|Complications rate, Number and grade of complications in both arms. Clavien Dindo Scale will be used, two years
recurrence rate, number of recurrences, two years|quality of life measured with CAVICAVENMI questionnaire, quality of life of the patients in both subgroups. CAVICAVENMI questionnaire will be used, two years
