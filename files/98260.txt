When ocular muscles are involved, ptosis, diplopia and other symptoms may occur. When the laryngopharyngeal muscles are involved, the patient may develop dysarthria, dysphagia and other symptoms. However, when the respiratory muscles are involved, patients will have difficulty in breathing, and some patients may develope myasthenia crisis, and artificial assisted respiratory therapy is often needed.

This study is a prospective observational study, in which patients are continuously enrolled, basic information of patients is collected, and biological samples are collected. The purpose of this study is to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of myasthenia gravis patients.
