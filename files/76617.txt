Efficacy and Safety of Letrozole vs. Letrozole Plus Zoledronic Acid as Endocrine Therapy Before Surgery in Postmenopausal Patients With Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety/efficacy of zoledronic acid when given by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks in addition to letrozole as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients with hormone responsive breast cancer
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Zolendronic Acid
Tumor Response Rate (Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)) Based on MRI- or Mammography and/or Sonography According to Modified RECIST Criteria at Month 6, Sum of longest diameter for all target lesions was reported as baseline sum LD. Baseline sum LD was used as reference to characterize objective tumor response. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors has 4 response categories. CR (complete response) = disappearance of all target lesions, PR (partial response)= 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, PD (progressive disease) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and SD(stable disease)=small changes that do not meet criteria. Analysis was underpowered due to insufficient recruitment rate., 6 months
Best RECIST Response Based on Central Review at 6 Mos, Best response is defined as the best response the patients has reached during the 6 months of treatment. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) has 4 response categories. CR (complete response) = disappearance of all target lesions, PR (partial response) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, PD (progressive disease) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and SD (stable disease) = small changes that do not meet criteria., 6 Months|Number of Patients With Breast Conserving Surgery at 6 Months, Every 6 months|Change From Baseline in Tumor Size (Longest Diameter) at Month 6, Tumor size (sum of longest diameter)was analyzed based on the diameters values provided with the central review., Baseline, Month 6|Mean Changes From Baseline in FACT-B Total Score at 6 Months (ITT, Data as Observed), The FACT-B total score is calculated by summing all five unweighted subscale scores, with total scores in the range of 0-144.To Derive a FACT-B total score: all sections added together The higher the score the better the QoL

Open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial over approx 6.5 months of neoadjuvant treatment with letrozole with or without zoledronic acid in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer. A total of approximately 850 patients were originally planned to be enrolled; primary study endpoint was the objective response rate (according to modified RECIST criteria) after 6 months of treatment. After the core study, patients willing to participate were followed-up for further 5 years.
