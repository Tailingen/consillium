Ph II Trial of a Novel Anti-angiogenic Agent in Combination With Chemotherapy for the Second-line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of CT-322 comparative to bevacizumab, both in combination with irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin in the second-line treatment of subject with metastatic colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

Progression free survival based on tumor assessments (CT/MRI), Every 6 weeks until documented progressive disease, initiation fo subsequent therapy for colorectal cancer, or withdrawal of consent
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time the subject is randomized until death, in each arm, every 12 weeks|Objective tumor response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of randomized subjects in each arm whose best response is CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) using RECIST guidelines as determined by the site investigator, every 6 weeks|Safety in the CT-322 plus irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin arm as measured by incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events, significant laboratory evaluations and significant physical examination findings in subjects, weekly
