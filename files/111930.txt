Allogeneic NK T-Cells Expressing CD19 Specific CAR in B-Cell Malignancies
This study is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety of KUR-502 in subjects with refractory/relapsed B-cell NHL or leukemia (ALL or CLL).

GENETIC: KUR-502
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate and grade of single dose of Kur-502, Incidence rate and the grade (severity) of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) based on adverse events (AEs) reported according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, 4 weeks post T cell infusion
KUR-502 will be manufactured from leukapheresis products from healthy donors. Subjects will be enrolled into 2 parallel cohorts (Cohort A \[non-ALL\] and Cohort B \[ALL\]). Each cohort will undergo dose escalation independently.

Three (3) dose levels will be evaluated in the ANCHOR and ANCHOR2 studies combined (1×107/m2, 3×107/m2, 1×108/m2). Dose levels are defined based on the number of transduced KUR-502 cells. Body surface area (BSA) will be capped at 2.4 m2. Subjects will receive \<1×104 allogeneic T cells/kg at any dose level.

The MTD will be determined once dose escalation is completed, and all subjects are evaluable for DLT. If there is no DLT that determines an MTD, a maximum dose level will be declared. Dose escalation will stop when 6 subjects have been treated at the MTD or highest dose level.
