Study to Test the Safety and Tolerability of PF-07257876 in Participants With Selected Advanced Tumors.
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, multiple dose, dose escalation and dose expansion study intended to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and potential clinical benefit of PF-07257876, a CD47-PD-L1 bispecific antibody, in participants with selected advanced or metastatic tumors for whom no standard therapy is available. The study contains 2 parts, single agent Dose Escalation (Part 1) to determine the recommended dose of PF-07257876, followed by Dose Expansion (Part 2) in selected tumor types at the recommended dose.
