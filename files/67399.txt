Transarterial Chemoembolization vs CyberKnife for Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Primary Objective:

To compare the efficacy of TACE vs. CyberKnife SBRT in the treatment of locally recurrent HCC after initial TACE.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine the progression-free survival of TACE vs. CyberKnife SBRT
2. To determine the overall survival of TACE vs. CyberKnife SBRT for locally recurrent HCC
3. To determine the toxicities associated with TACE or CyberKnife SBRT for the treatment of recurrent HCC.
