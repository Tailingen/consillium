A Study of ABBV-428, an Immunotherapy, in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-428 when administered as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors Cancer
DRUG: ABBV-428|DRUG: Nivolumab
Number of participants with adverse events, First dose of study drug through at least 100 days after end of treatment; up to 2 years after last participants first dose|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) of ABBV-428 when administered as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, If a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, the RPTD of ABBV-428 will not be a dose higher than the defined MTD, and will be selected based on the type(s) and occurrence(s) of dose limiting toxicities which occur in addition to the MTD. If a MTD is not reached, then the RPTD will be defined based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data., 1 day of study drug administration within the 28-day cycle at the designated cohort dose|Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of ABBV-428, Up to 30 days after a 24-month treatment period|Terminal half-life (t1/2) of ABBV-428, Up to 30 days after a 24-month treatment period|Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-428, Up to 30 days after a 24-month treatment period|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABBV-428 when administered as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, The highest dose level at which less than 2 of 6 participants or less than 33% of (if cohort is expanded beyond 6) participants experience a dose limiting toxicity., Up to 2 years|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of ABBV-428, Up to 30 days after a 24-month treatment period
Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the initial objective response to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 30 days after a 24-month of treatment period|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR defined as the proportion of subjects with a confirmed partial response (PR), complete response (CR), or stable disease for at least 24 weeks to the treatment., Up to 30 days after a 24-month of treatment period|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS time is defined as the time from the first dose of ABBV-428 to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, Up to 30 days after a 24-month of treatment period|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a confirmed partial or complete response to the treatment., Up to 30 days after a 24-month of treatment period
This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-428 when administered as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
