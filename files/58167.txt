A Study of Olaparib With Concomitant Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced/Unresectable Soft-tissue Sarcoma
A phase Ib study of Olaparib with concomitant radiotherapy in locally advanced/unresectable soft-tissue sarcoma.
Soft-tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Olaparib|RADIATION: Concomitant Radiotherapy
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Olaparib evaluated up to six weeks after end of radiotherapy, Until to six weeks after end of radiotherapy
Non-progression defined as CR, PR as per RECIST 1.1, 6-month|Objective defined as CR or PR as per RECIST 1.1, 6-month|Best objective response under treatment as per RECIST v 1.1, End of treatment,an average of 6 months|Best response under treatment as per RECIST 1.1, End of treatment,an average of 6 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) as per RECIST 1.1, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), 1 year|Functional assessment graded using the Muskuloskeletal Tumour Society Rating Scale (Enneking, 1987), Day 1, Week 8|Pharmacokinetics PK measurements expressed as the AUC of Olaparib, Weeks 1, 2, 5|Pharmacokinetics PK measurements expressed as half-life of Olaparib, Weeks 1, 2, 5|Pharmacokinetics PK measurements expressed as the concentration peak of Olaparib, Weeks 1, 2, 5
This is a multicenter, prospective phase Ib trial based on a dose escalation study design (3+3 traditional design) assessing four dose levels of Olaparib given with concomitant radiotherapy, followed by an expansion cohort.
