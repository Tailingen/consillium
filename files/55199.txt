An Exploratory Trial to Assess the Improvement of Adverse Events in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Patients Treated With Imatinib When Switched to Nilotinib Treatment
The purpose of this exploratory study will be to examine changes in chronic low grade chronic adverse events, measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading, when patients are switched from imatinib to nilotinib therapy.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Nilotinib
Percentage of Participants With Improvement in Imatinib Related Chronic Low Grade Non Hematologic Adverse Event (AE) After Switch to Treatment With Nilotinib at End of Cycle 3, A patient was considered improved if 50% or more of the chronic imatinib-related chronic low grade nonhematologic AEs showed improvement (a decrease in CTCAE \[Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\] grade or complete resolution)., End of Cycles 1, 2, and 3
Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) After Switching to Nilotinib for Participants Not Reporting CCyR at Baseline, Time to complete cytogenetic response is defined as time from baseline to first time of CCyR as documented by bone marrow cytogenetics. Cytogenetic response was assessed as applicable by bone marrow cytogenetics 6, 12, and 18 months after starting imatinib therapy. Assess CCyR by bone marrow cytogenics, Cycles 1, 2, 6, 9, and 12|Percentage of Participants Achieving Major Molecular Response (MMR) After the Switch in the Therapy for Participants Not Reporting MMR at Baseline, Major Molecular Response (MMR) value at Molecular MD is designated a percentage, which is equivalent to a 3-log reduction from a standardized baseline value from the International Randomized Interferon versus STI571 (IRIS) study or 0.1% per International Scale (IS). Time to MMR is defined as time from baseline to first time of MMR as documented by RQ-PCR, Cycles 1,2,3,6,9,12|Log Change in BCR-Abl Transcript Level From Baseline After the Switch Therapy, Levels of BCR-ABL transcripts were determined by quantitative RQ-PCR testing of peripheral blood and analyzed at a central testing laboratory. Log reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts levels from the standardized baseline value will be calculated for each sample from the reported percent ratio of BCR-ABL transcripts versus control gene transcripts converted to a reference standard., Cycles 1,2,3,6,9, and 12|Duration of Complete Cytogenetic Response, Duration of Complete Cytogenetic Response is defined as the time from first CCyR to first loss of CCyR as documented by bone marrow cytogenetics, or by FISH assay, whichever is earlier. The duration of CCyR begins on the day of enrollment for patients reporting CCyR at baseline., 18 months of follow up from the first documented response|Time to Complete Cytogenetic Response in Participants Not Reporting at Baseline, For time to CCyR, an event is defined as achievement of CCyR documented by bone marrow cytogenetics., Cycle 12|Duration of Major Molecular Response, Duration of Major Molecular Response is defined as the time from first MMR to first loss of MMR as documented by RQ-PCR. The duration of MMR begins on the day of enrollment for patients reporting MMR at baseline., 18 months of follow up from the first documented response|Time to Major Molecular Response (MMR) in Participants With MMR Absent at Baseline, For time to MMR, an event is defined as achievement of MMR documented by RQ-PCR. Patients with MMR at the Screening RQ-PCR assay are counted as having time to MMR equal to 0., Cycles 1,2,3,6,9,12|Time to Optimal Imatinib-related Adverse Event Improvement, Time to optimal improvement is defined as the time when the sum of the total CTCAE toxicity grades for a patient's chronic low-grade imatinib-related adverse events reaches its minimum value., 18 months of follow up from the date of the first dose of study drug to the time to maximum decrease in CTCAE grade of these events
