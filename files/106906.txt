Olfactory Change After Chemo-radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is an observational cohort study aimed to explore the changes of olfactory function at multiple time points from baseline to 1 year after radiotherapy among the local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Change in bjective olfactory function, Objective olfactory function was assessed was assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by TDI-score according to the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory function test., 1.5 years
Change inSubjective olfactory function, The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) will be used during the assessment from baseline to 1 year after radiotherapy., 1.5 years
Newly-diagnosed patients with stage III or IV non-metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (AJCC 8th) will be recruited. Olfactory function of consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory function test and by The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) as well as a patient symptom visual analogue scale. The change in olfactory function and it's influence factors in NPC patients who receiving induction chemotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy will be investigated.
