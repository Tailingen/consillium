Prospective Observational Study of Adjuvant Hormone Treatment in Estrogen-receptor Positive Premenopausal Early Breast Cancer Patients
This will be a prospective, multicenter, observational study. The primary objective is to record the choice, in clinical practice, of adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen, tamoxifen + LhRh, aromatase inhibitors + LhRh) in premenopausal patients with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.

The secondary objective is to correlate adjuvant hormone therapy choices with biological characteristics of the tumor (T size, lymph node status, grade, receptor level, Ki67, HER2 status) and patient characteristics (age, prior chemotherapy treatment).
Early Breast Cancer
OTHER: None intervention (observational study)
To record the choice, in clinical practice, of adjuvant hormone therapy., Patients will be divided in groups according to type of adjuvant hormone therapy received:

1. tamoxifen
2. tamoxifen + LhRh
3. aromatase inhibitor + LhRh Differences between groups will be evaluated with Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test., 21 months
