Feasibility of Virtual Reality Assistance in Prostate Biopsy Under Local Anesthesia.
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the impact of Virtual Reality (VR) assistance for anxiety management of patients undergoing prostate biopsies in local anaesthesia.

The main question it aims to answer:

- Is there a significant decrease on anxiety level thanks to VR-assistance?

Participants will be equipped with VR headset providing an immersive visual experience accompanied with a hypnoses oriented audio during the entire procedure.

Researchers will compare standardised anxiety scores with a control group.
