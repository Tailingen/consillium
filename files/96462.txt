Dose Escalation Study of OMP-54F28 in Combination With Sorafenib in Patients With Hepatocellular Cancer
This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of OMP-54F28 when combined with sorafenib. OMP-54F28 will be administered IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The planned dose levels of OMP-54F28 are 5 and 10 mg/kg. Depending on safety in this study, additional lower or intermediate dose levels may be evaluated.
Hepatocellular Cancer|Liver Cancer
DRUG: OMP-54F28 with Sorafenib
Safety and tolerability of OMP-54F28 in combination with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular cancer, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in patients treated with OMP-54F28 in combination with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular cancer, Subjects will be treated and observed for DLT through the end of the first cycle (from Day 0 - 21)
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of OMP-54F28 and sorafenib when administered in combination to patients with hepatocellular cancer, Apparent half life, AUC, clearance, volume of distribution, OMP-54F28 will be administered IV on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Plasma sample for Parmacokinetics (PK) analysis to be obtained at various time points, 30 minutes after end of OMP-54F28 infusion and before sorafenib treatment
Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in this study. Alternative dosing schedules of OMP-54F28 may be explored based on emerging nonclinical and clinical data for safety, PD, PK and efficacy. The starting dose for a new dosing schedule will be chosen to result in an AUC equivalent to the highest dose level that cleared on the previously studied dosing schedule. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be allowed within a dose cohort. Sorafenib 400 mg will be given orally twice daily (PO BID). Sorafenib dosing schedules with a total daily dose \<800 mg (e.g. Sorafenib 400 mg once daily) may be evaluated in this study depending on emerging safety data from this study.
