A Dose Escalation Study of Proton and Carbon Ion Irradiation for HER2 Positive and Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Adjuvant radiotherapy is the standard treatment for early breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. Molecular subtypes was significantly associated with the risk of local recurrence of breast cancer. Nguyen et al found that the overall 5-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 0.8% for luminal A, 1.5% for luminal B, 8.4% for HER2 positive, and 7.1% for triple negative breast cancer after lumpectomy and radiotherapy. Her2 positive and triple negative breast cancers may be inherently radioresistant.

Therefore, for HER2 positive and triple negative breast cancer with high local recurrence and radiation resistance, proton combined with carbon ion is proposed after breast conserving surgery.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer|HER2-positive Breast Cancer
RADIATION: proton plus carbon ion radiotherapy
Acute toxicity, Treatment related acute toxicity assessed by CTCAE v4.03, 3 months after the completion of CIRT
Local regional recurrence, The Ipsilateral breast and regional lymph nodes recurrence, within 5 years after radiotherapy.|Cosmetic outcome as measured by Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale, Cosmetic outcome will be evaluated by Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale filled out by patients., within 5 years after radiotherapy.|Cosmetic outcome as measured by BCCT.core software, Patients' photographs of the breasts will be taken. With the use of BCCT.core software from The Breast Research group (INESC TEC) cosmetic outcome will be assessed., within 5 years after radiotherapy.
