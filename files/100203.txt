Background Pancreaticobiliary malignancy (PBM) is a group of cancers affecting pancreas and bile duct. The diagnosis is often late and with fatal outcomes. Here, investigators study the clinicodemographic profile of the patients with suspected PBM undergoing Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) at a tertiary care center in Nepal.
