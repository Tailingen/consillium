The Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) hopes to establish a unique collection of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data, medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) from thousands of patients with cancer or at risk of having cancer. Their hope is to, over time, facilitate new clinical trials, technology, informatics solutions, and personalized medicine to each cancer patient.
