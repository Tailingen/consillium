A Study to Learn About the Effect of Avelumab First-Line Maintenance in Canadian People With Advanced Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine (called avelumab) for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer.

This study is including participants who:

* Participated in the Canadian avelumab patient support program
* Have been diagnosed with advanced bladder cancer
* Have been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy without their disease progressing All participants in this study have previously received avelumab first-line maintenance for the treatment of their advanced bladder cancer.

Pfizer will examine the experiences of people receiving the study medicine. This will help determine the efficacy and safety of the study medicine for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Avelumab was approved by Health Canada in December 2020 for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (LA/mUC) whose disease has not progressed following first-line (1L) platinum-based chemotherapy. As the urothelial carcinoma treatment landscape evolves with novel indications for previously existing medicines and novel agents entering the market, additional insights are needed to assist in guiding treatment decision making. No observational studies of treatment patterns and outcomes for patients in Canada treated with avelumab first-line maintenance (1LM) have been conducted. The purpose of the current study is to conduct an analysis of patient and disease characteristics and treatment patterns to further elucidate the clinical effectiveness and impact of avelumab 1LM therapy for patients with LA/mUC in Canada.

The primary research objective is to assess effectiveness outcomes in a clinical setting for Canadian patients with LA/mUC treated with avelumab 1LM therapy, specifically overall survival (OS) from the date of avelumab 1LM initiation to the date of death from any cause and progression-free survival (PFS) from the date of avelumab 1LM initiation to the date of progression or death from any cause. Selected secondary objectives include describing treatment patterns, describe AEs explicitly attributed to avelumab among patients with LA/mUC treated with avelumab 1LM and response rates from date of avelumab 1LM initiation, and separately, from the date of chemotherapy initiation, and duration of response (DOR) from date of best overall response in each line of therapy.
