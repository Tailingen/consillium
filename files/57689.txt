Reduce Sedentary Behavior During Cancer Treatment - the RedSedCan Study
Summary

Reducing sedentary behavior during treatment is important to reduce the risk of future health problems in individuals undergoing cancer treatment. Therefore, the goal of this project is with a multicenter randomised controlled design investigate whether a digital self-management program during ongoing neo- or adjuvant cancer treatment for breast, prostate or colon cancer is effective in reducing sedentary lifestyle and improving well-being in the short and long term.

BEHAVIORAL: Digital self-management program
Sedentary behavior time, The Axivity accelerometer is used for measuring the primary outcome of sedentary time, i.e. mean time spent in sedentary behavior/day., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Axivity is worn for 7 consecutive days at each measurement point.
Sedentary behavior bouts, The Axivity accelerometer is used for measuring sedentary bouts, i.e. mean number of bouts/day and mean bouts time/day., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Axivity is worn for 7 consecutive days at each measurement point.|Physical activity, The Axivity accelerometer is used for measuring physical activity mean time/day and mean time spent in low-, moderate and high intensity physical activity., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Axivity is worn for 7 consecutive days at each measurement point.|Health-related quality of life, Patient reported health related quality of life will be assessed with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C 30 and diagnose specific modules BR23, PR26 and CR29., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Health-related quality of life, Patient reported health related quality of life will be assessed with EQ5D, and used for calculation of Quality Adjusted Life Years., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Cancer related fatigue, Patient reported outcome cancer related fatigue is measured with Brief Fatigue Inventory., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Fear of movement, Patient reported outcome Fear of movement is assessed with Cancer specific Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Changes in health, Patient reported outcome Changes in health is assessed with Patient Global Impression of Change Scale., At 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Work ability, Selected and adapted questions from Work Ability Index are used for assessing patient reported outcome work ability., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Self-efficacy for reducing sedentary behavior, Study specific question is used for assessing patient reported outcome of Self-efficacy for reducing sedentary behavior., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Perceived support from peers, Study specific question is used for assessing patient reported outcome of Perceived support from peers., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.
Demographic variables, Study specific questions, Baseline|Diagnoses, Data regarding cancer diagnose and if any, co-morbid conditions, are gathered from medical records or Swedish national quality registers., At baseline|Cancer treatment, Data regarding planned and received oncological and surgical cancer treatment (type, dose, treatment start and end date of treatment) and any treatment related side-effects are gathered from medical records and Swedish quality registers., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Health care costs, Data regarding outpatient visits, hospitalization and prescribed medication is gathered from Swedish national quality registers., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Costs of intervention, Data regarding cost of application use and any cost for physical activity is gathered from study records and patient reported by study specific questions., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Sick leave, Data regarding sick leave, i.e. total number of days being on sick leave gathered from the Swedish insurance fund (data on sick leave more than 14 days) and patient reported study specific questions (data on sick leave less than 14 days). Data will be gathered from 6 months prior baseline (study specific questions are administered at baseline and register data will be gathered at baseline but will include any data 6 months prior baseline)., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Adherence, Adherence to the intervention is assessed by Axivity accelometer and patient reported study specific questions., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.|Green house gas emissions, Green house emissions will be compared between the intervention and control group and estimated using a life cycle analysis of the technology used in the intervention, self-reported changes in climate behavior, and emissions from healthcare., At baseline, 3-months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.
Description of the project

This project is about investigating the effect of a digital self-management program to reduce sedentary behavior in people with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer during neo- or adjuvant cancer treatment. The self-management program has been developed with patients and researchers and consists of existing high-quality technology that provides support for setting and following goals. The people who use the self-help program also receive support from a physiotherapist to set goals for reduced sedentary time and get to choose which activities will replace the time spent sedentary.

The goal of the project

The goal of the project is to investigate the effects of a digital self-management program on reduced sedentary and well-being during ongoing cancer treatment, both in the short and long term. In addition, the project will study the health-economic effects, and climate benefits of using the digital self-management program. By focusing on reducing a sedentary lifestyle and replacing it with daily activities and/or physical activity, the health of individuals is expected to be positively affected in the short term through, for example, increased well-being and reduced side effects from cancer treatment, and the long term through a reduced risk of developing complications and new illness related to the cancer treatment, such as cardiovascular disease.
