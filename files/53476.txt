Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (Tests) for Bladder Cancer Participants Undergoing Radical Cystectomy
This study focuses on providing an educational program for people/participants with bladder cancer who plan to have a cystectomy (surgery) as part of their standard care. Participants in this study will watch videos designed to teach them strategies to help lower their risk of experiencing negative side effects (such as mobility problems, issues with taking medication, and poor quality of life) before and after they have surgery. They will also be asked to fill out questionnaires.

Survey responses from participants who completed some or all of educational program, Assess the acceptability of an educational program designed for participants undergoing radical cystectomy by measuring/surveying the number of study participants who completed at least some of the intervention., 90 days|Number of self-reported interventions/strategies used among participants after watching educational videos, Assess the adoptability of an educational program designed for participants undergoing radical cystectomy by measuring the number of self-reported interventions that participants reported after the educational program, 90 days|30-day Hospital Readmission Rates Among All Participants, Assess impact of educational program by comparing the differences between hospital readmission rate at 30 days between both study cohorts., 30 days|90-day Hospital Readmission Rates Among All Participants, Assess impact of educational program by comparing the differences between hospital readmission rate at 90 days between both study cohorts., 90 days|Complication Rates Reported Among Participants, Assess impact of educational program by comparing the differences between complication rates reported among study participants in both groups., 90 days
This study focuses on providing an educational program for participants/people with bladder cancer who plan to have a cystectomy (surgery) as part of their standard care. Participants in this study will watch videos designed to teach them strategies to help lower their risk of experiencing negative side effects (such as mobility problems, issues with taking medication, and poor quality of life) before and after they have surgery. The goal of this study is to educate people with bladder cancer and ask them to also fill out questionnaires about the education program and if they used any of the strategies that learn during the study.

Participants in this study will be divided into two different study groups (one group that watches educational videos before surgery and one group that watches educational videos before surgery and also receives geriatric services and follow up visits after surgery). Each participant will be randomized (randomly assigned) to one of two study groups. That means that there is a 50/50 chance (like flipping a coin) that each participant will end up in either group.
