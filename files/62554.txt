A Study of ARRY-334543 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced solid tumors will receive a new formulation of investigational study drug ARRY-334543. Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. The patients will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. In addition, the effect of food on the new formulation will be evaluated. Approximately 24 patients from Canada will be enrolled in this study (Active, not recruiting).
