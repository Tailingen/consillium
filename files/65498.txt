Study of KW-0761 in Subjects With CCR4-positive Peripheral T/NK-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of KW-0761 intravenously administered eight times at one-week intervals in patients with CCR4-positive peripheral T/NK-cell lymphoma. The primary objective is to assess the antitumor effect in terms of best overall response, while the secondary objectives are to assess the antitumor effect in terms of best response by disease lesion, to assess the progression-free survival and to assess the overall survival. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of KW-0761 will be also evaluated.
