Efficacy and Safety of IMAB362 in Combination With the EOX Regimen for CLDN18.2-positive Gastric Cancer
The purpose of the trial is to assess the therapeutic effects and the safety profile of IMAB362 combined with EOX (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine) as first-line treatment for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach, the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction compared to EOX alone.

Furthermore, sufficient binding of IMAB362 to the target cells is necessary for antitumoral activity. Thus, two dose levels ensuring a serum level above the in vitro predicted clinical efficacy threshold will be investigated.

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression (based on central reading) or death from any cause (as assessed by the independent reviewer). Participants without documented progression or death will be censored as of the last tumor evaluation determining lack of progression., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 31JAN2019; maximum time on follow-up was, 68.2, 47.2 & 59.6 months in the EOX, EOX+Zolbetuximab 600 mg, and EOX+Zolbetuximab 1000 mg treatment groups respectively.|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unintended or undesirable, noxious or pathological change, compared to pre-existing conditions, experienced by a participant during a clinical study or the follow-up period, regardless of relationship to study medication. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) are those AEs that started or worsened after the first dose of study medication., From the first dose of study drug administration up to 30 days after the last study medication administration (up to 1791 days).
Clinical PFS, Clinical PFS (CPFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression, either confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scans or by clinical evaluation, or death from any cause (as assessed by the independent reviewer with clinical PD considered as an event). Participants without documented progression or death will be censored as of the last tumor evaluation determining lack of progression., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 31JAN2019; maximum time on follow-up was, 68.2, 47.2 & 59.6 months in the EOX, EOX+Zolbetuximab 600 mg, and EOX+Zolbetuximab 1000 mg treatment groups respectively.|Overall Survival Rate at 12 Months, Overall survival rate at 12 months after therapy initiation is defined as a proportion of participants alive after 12 months from first dose of any study drug., Up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause or last contact (if alive)., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 31JAN2019; maximum time on follow-up was, 68.2, 47.2 & 59.6 months in the EOX, EOX+Zolbetuximab 600 mg, and EOX+Zolbetuximab 1000 mg treatment groups respectively.|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression (based on central reading as assessed by the investigator reviewer). Participants without documented progression will be censored as of the last tumor evaluation determining lack of progression., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 31JAN2019; maximum time on follow-up was, 68.2, 47.2 & 59.6 months in the EOX, EOX+Zolbetuximab 600 mg, and EOX+Zolbetuximab 1000 mg treatment groups respectively.|Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the fraction of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (as assessed by the investigator reviewer). CR according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph node must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm, disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level should occur as well as no simultaneous appearance of new lesions. PR according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the screening sum longest diameter and no simultaneous increase in the size of any lesion or the appearance of new lesions., Up to week 94|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the fraction of participants with CR or PR or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 (as assessed by the investigator reviewer). SD according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started, measurements must meet the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval not less than 6 weeks, no simultaneous increase in the size of any lesion or the appearance of new lesions should occur, evaluable lesions must remain stable or regress for this category., Up to week 94|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be determined as the time when criteria for CR or PR are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death occurs (as assessed by the independent reviewer)., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 31JAN2019; maximum time on follow-up was, 68.2, 47.2 & 59.6 months in the EOX, EOX+Zolbetuximab 600 mg, and EOX+Zolbetuximab 1000 mg treatment groups respectively.
