Surgery and Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma
RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to light to kill cancer cells. Combining photodynamic therapy with surgery may be an effective treatment for malignant mesothelioma.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining photodynamic therapy with surgery in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.
Malignant Mesothelioma
PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|DRUG: porfimer sodium
Feasibility, 1 month, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years|Comparison of results from this regimen to historical controls, At completion of study|Toxic effects, 1 month, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility of adjuvant photodynamic therapy with large diffuser fibers in patients with malignant mesothelioma undergoing surgery.
* Compare results of this regimen in these patients to historical controls.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo pleurectomy or pleuropneumonectomy followed by intracavitary photodynamic therapy on day 3.

Patients are followed at 1 month, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
