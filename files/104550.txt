Long-term Outcomes of Duodenal Adenocarcinoma From a Large Cohort
The investigators will conducted a hospital-based cohort study in our 15-year experience with DA aimed at investigating the long-term outcomes of the patients with DA, along with analyzing the impact of the tumor characteristics, operations and adjuvant therapy on survival outcomes.
Gastrointestinal Disease
PROCEDURE: Radical operation and perioperative therapy
Median overall survival time, Median survival is the time it takes half of the individuals in a given study population to reach or exceed a particular end event, calculated from the time an event occurred. Median survival is a statistical index describing the distribution of survival time., 2009.10-2023.06|3-year overall survival rate, Three-year survival rate, also known as survival rate, refers to the number of patients with a disease who are still alive at the end of three years of follow-up as a percentage of the number of cases observed, 2009.10-2023.06|5-year overall survival rate, Five-year survival rate, also known as survival rate, refers to the number of patients with a disease who are still alive at the end of five years of follow-up as a percentage of the number of cases observed, 2009.10-2023.06
Numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have delved into the treatment of DA, yet the majority of the studies retrospective, single-center, and small sample size series, particularly in China. To bridge this knowledge gap, the investigators will conduct a hospital-based cohort study designed to investigate the long-term survival outcomes of the participants with the non-ampulla duodenal adenocarcinoma, and the effects of tumor characteristics, surgery, and adjuvant therapy on survival outcomes.
