Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in Combination With Y-90 SIRT for Intermediate Stage HCC
A Phase II study of immunotherapy with Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Tremelimumab in combination with Y-90 SIRT for intermediate stage HCC
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable|HCC
DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Durvalumab|PROCEDURE: Y-90 SIRT|PROCEDURE: DEB-TACE
Objective response rate (ORR) [according to RECIST 1.1] at 6 months., Proportion of allocated subjects with best response of complete or partial response, 6 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of first observed disease progression (investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause., Time from the date of randomization to the date of first observed disease progression or death (approx. 42 months)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be determined as time from the date of treatment allocation to the date of death., From the date of treatment Date of enrollment until date of death if applicable (up to 42 months until Study Closure)|Treatment related SAEs, Treatment related serious adverse events rate (SAE) will be determined. All observed toxicities and side effects will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 for all patients and the degree of association of each with the study treatment assessed and summarized., From first patient included until study closure (approx. 42 months after First Patient Included)|Overall response rate (ORR) as best overall response (BOR) during therapy, ORR as BOR during therapy will be defined as the proportion of allocated subjects with best response of complete or partial response from date of randomization until disease progression or death from any cause occurs., 13 months|Overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months, ORR at 6 months for patients who received single treatment of TACE/SIRT, 6 months|Quality of Life (QoL), Quality of life will be assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire) and will be evaluated based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual in its most current version at time of data analysis., 24 months
Translational research, Exploratory: Correlation analysis between selected molecular parameters and clinical data to identify molecular biomarkers predictive for outcome are not fully defined at the time this protocol is written. The optional translational research program will consider the latest research data available at the time of analysis. Analysis might comprise (but is not limited to) staining for PD-L1 protein expression on tumor cells using the commercially available IVD Kits (22C3 pharmDx assay, DAKO North America) and lymphocytes, testing for expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2, Immune cell infiltrates (IGHM, CD3, CD8, FOXP3, CD68, CD205), Chemokines (CXCL9. CXCL10, CXCL13) and invasion markers (MMP7, MMP9) and assessing circulating nucleic acids and tumor specific transcripts., 3 months
The IMMUWIN phase II will test the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab with Y-90 SIRT.
