Study: Treatment of Relapsed Lymphoid Malignancies With an Anti-Angiogenic Approach
1.1 To determine the efficacy of a combination treatment of VP-16, chlorambucil, dexamethasone, and vincristine in patients with relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies.

1.2 To determine the toxicity profile of the above regimen in this patient population.

1.3 Evaluate the effect of low dose administration of chemotherapy on angiogenesis, and correlate this with tumor responses.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Sum of Complete and Partial Responses, Solid tumor response is per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (ver 1.0).

For CLL: complete remission (CR) requires the following for\>=2 months 1) no symptoms attributable to CLL, 2) normal physical examination, 3) absolute lymphocyte count\<4,000/µL, 4) ANC\>1,500/µL, 5) platelets\>100,000/µL, 6) hemoglobin\>11 g/dL, 7) bone marrow lymphocytosis\<30%, 8) no nodules in bone marrow. Partial response (PR) requires the following for \>=2 months 1) decrease in previously enlarged nodes, spleen, and liver by \>=50%, 2) ANC\>=1,500/µL or platelets\>=100,000/µL, 3) hemoglobin\>=11 g/dL, 4) 50% improvement over pre-therapy reductions in hemoglobin and/or platelets.

For MM, CR is no monoclonal protein (M-protein) in blood and urine and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow on \>=2 determinations \>=6 wk apart \& stable bone disease \& calcium levels. PR is\>50% and \>90% decreases in serum \& urine M-protein, respectively, on \>=2 occasions for \>=6 wk, stable bone disease \& calcium., Up to 6 months after first on-study treatment
Toxicity, End of 2 cycles (cycle = 28 days)
The purpose of the study is to see how effective the combination of chemotherapy drugs VP-16, chlorambucil, dexamethasone, and vincristine is for patients who have blood cancers that have returned or not responded to prior treatment. Some patients may also receive a medication called rituximab if their doctor thinks it is appropriate. This drug combination will be given to study participants in a low dose continuous basis. The study will also collect information about the side effects of the above drug combination on patients with these types of cancers. Previous studies on patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma indicate that some patients treated with this drug combination achieved a high response. The aim of this study is to test this drug combination in a controlled setting.
