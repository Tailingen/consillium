FES Imaging to Optimize Tamoxifen for Metastatic Breast Cancer
Despite broad advancements in endocrine therapy for ERα+ breast cancer, resistance ultimately develops. A common driver of resistance are known ESR1 mutations that lead to constitutively active receptor signaling and transcriptional regulation that is always "turned on" despite the absence of estrogen. Patients with ESR1 mutations are expected to have decreased binding affinity for tamoxifen and thus may be underdosed on standard therapy. \[18F\]-fluoroestradiol Positron Emission Tomography/Computed tomography (FES-PET/CT) imaging is a novel functional imaging technique that can non-invasively measure ERα expression and inhibition in metastatic ERα+ breast cancer. The proposed a pilot study uses FES-PET/CT imaging to measure ERα blockade to determine the optimal dose of tamoxifen in patients with ESR1 mutations.
ERα+ Breast Cancer|ESR1 Gene Mutation
DRUG: Tamoxifen|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: FES PET/CT
Rate of FES Blockade at each dose level to determine the Optimal Tamoxifen Dose, Reduction in FES uptake will be described and analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Rates or proportion of responses at each dose level will be provided in data listings. If the SUVmax for all 5 target lesions have decreased by \> 75% or all 5 lesions have SUVmax\<1.5 on the second scan, then these participants will be prospectively defined as having complete FES blockade. If the SUVmax for any of the 5 lesions has not decreased by \> 75% or if any new lesions arise with SUVmax ≥1.5, then these subjects will be defined as having incomplete FES blockade., up to 6 weeks to compare baseline and treatment images
FES uptake at each dose level: SUVmax, FES uptake will be quantified on 5 target lesions using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements including SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, Tumor-to-Normal (T/N) tissue ratio, and Tumor-to-Blood Pool ratios., up to 6 weeks to compare baseline and treatment images|FES uptake at each dose level: SUVmean, FES uptake will be quantified on 5 target lesions using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements including SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, Tumor-to-Normal (T/N) tissue ratio, and Tumor-to-Blood Pool ratios., up to 6 weeks to compare baseline and treatment images|FES uptake at each dose level: Tumor-to-Normal tissue ratio, FES uptake will be quantified on 5 target lesions using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements including SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, Tumor-to-Normal (T/N) tissue ratio, and Tumor-to-Blood Pool ratios., up to 6 weeks to compare baseline and treatment images|FES uptake at each dose level: Tumor-to-Blood Pool ratio, FES uptake will be quantified on 5 target lesions using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements including SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak, Tumor-to-Normal (T/N) tissue ratio, and Tumor-to-Blood Pool ratios., up to 6 weeks to compare baseline and treatment images|Objective Response Rate at each dose level, The objective response rate is the proportion of all participants with confirmed Partial Response or Complete Response according to RECIST 1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment)., up to 6 months|Safety: Number of Participants Experiencing Grade 3 or higher Adverse Events, All grade 3-4 adverse events occurring between cycle 1, day 1 to cycle 2 day 1 and at least possibly related to therapy will be reviewed by the principal investigator prior to starting enrollment in the next dose cohort. If 2 or more of the 3 participants in any cohort experience grade 3-4 adverse events, then dose escalation will be halted., Up to 21 days on treatment (up to 6 weeks on study)
