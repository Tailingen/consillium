Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) play important roles in constituting the immune suppressive environment promoting cancer development and progression. While previous studies had shown that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could induce MDSC differentiation and maturation, the very poor solubility and fast metabolism of the drug limited its applications as an immune-modulator for cancer immunotherapy

HF1K16 is an investigational pegylated liposome formulation with great ATRA dose loading capacity and sustained drug release property. In preclinical studies, HF1K16 was shown to be able to remodel the host systemic immune homeostasis as well as modify tumor microenvironment (TME). It promotes MDSCs maturation into DCs and facilitates immune responses against cancer cells.
