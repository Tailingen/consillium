A Study of LY3039478 in Combination With Dexamethasone in Participants With T-ALL/T-LBL
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3039478 in combination with dexamethasone in participants with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL/T-LBL).
T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
DRUG: LY3039478|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Placebo
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was an Adverse Event(AE) observed during the first 28 day cycle that is determined by the investigator to be at least possibly related to LY3039478 according to CTCAE v 4.0 and fulfills any of the following criteria: CTCAE Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity with a few exceptions, any other significant toxicity deemed to be dose limiting (eg, any toxicity that is possibly related to the study medication that requires the withdrawal of the patient from the study during Cycle 1)., Cycle 1 (Up To 28 Days)|Recommended Dose of LY3039478 in Combination With Dexamethasone, A DLT was an Adverse Event(AE) observed during the first 28 day cycle that is determined by the investigator to be at least possibly related to LY3039478 according to CTCAE v 4.0 and fulfills any of the following criteria:CTCAE Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity with a few exceptions, any other significant toxicity deemed to be dose limiting.A dose-limiting equivalent toxicity (DLET) was defined as an AE occurring between Day 1 and Day 28 of any cycle (other than Cycle 1) for a patient enrolled in the Phase 1 portion or in any cycle (including Cycle 1) for a patient enrolled in the Phase 2 portion that would have met the criteria for DLT if it had occurred during Cycle 1 for a patient enrolled in the Phase 1 portion., Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Number of Participants Who Achieve Complete Remission (CR) or CR With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi): Overall Remission Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieved a best overall response of either complete remission (CR) or incomplete remission (CRi). The ORR (CR and CRi) is the sum of patients achieving a CR or a CRi divided by the total number of patients randomized in that arm. CR is defined as the number of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete remission (CR), out of the total number of participants randomized in that arm., Baseline to Objective Disease Progression (Up To 2 Months)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC[0-∞]) of LY3039478 in Combination With Dexamethasone in Day 1, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC\[0-∞\]) of LY3039478 in Combination with Dexamethasone in Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose, 1-2, 3-4,6-8,24-30 hours|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC[0- 48]) of LY3039478 in Combination With Dexamethasone in Day 8, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC\[0- 48\]) of LY3039478 in Combination with Dexamethasone in Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 8: Predose, 1-2, 3-4,6-8,24-30 hours|Number of Participants With CR or CRi and Notch-1 or FBXW7 Mutations, ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieved a best overall response of either complete remission (CR) or incomplete remission (CRi). The ORR (CR and CRi) is the sum of participants achieving a CR or a CRi divided by the total number of participants randomized in that arm. CR is defined as the number of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete remission (CR), out of the total number of participants randomized in that arm., Baseline to Objective Disease Progression (Up To 12 Months)|Phase 2: Number of Participants Who Achieve CR, CRi or Partial Remission (PR): Overall Remission Rate (ORR) Plus PR, Baseline to Objective Disease Progression (Up To 12 Months)|Phase 2: Number of Participants Who Achieve PR, Baseline to Objective Disease Progression (Up To 12 Months)|Phase 2: Duration of Remission (DoR), Date of CR, CRi, or PR to Date of Relapse or Death from Any Cause (Approximately 1 Year)|Phase 2:Relapse Free Survival (RFS), Date of CR to Relapse or Death from any Cause (Approximately 1 Year)|Phase 2: Event Free Survival (EFS), Baseline to Objective Disease Progression or Death from Any Cause (Approximately 1 Year)|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), Baseline to the Date of Death from Any Cause (Approximately 1.5 Years)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia-General (FACT-Leu-G) Score, Baseline, End of Study (Approximately 1.5 Years)
