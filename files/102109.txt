High Resolution Imaging for Analysis of MVNT
MVNT (multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor of the cerebrum) is a benign, recently discovered, neuronal lesion, the incidence of which is unknown.

It seems to predominate in the temporal lobes and presents a characteristic MRI appearance: multiple subcortical nodules, developed at the white substance / gray substance junction, of variable size, well limited, in iso-hyposignal T1, hypersignal T2 and hypersignal FLAIR.

The articles describing this entity report the lack of scalability in MRI during patient monitoring, going in the direction of the benignity of the lesion.

The diagnosis sometimes remains uncertain with current MRI sequences, and the patient risks undergoing invasive surgery to remove a lesion that is actually benign. Hence the importance of developing the most precise diagnostic criteria possible. The contribution of advanced MRI techniques, such as ultra-high resolution sequences in the characterization of these lesions, has not yet been studied.
