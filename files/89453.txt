Sequential Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Transarterial Chemoembolization and Local Ablation or External Radiation
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can present itself in many forms (size, number of lesions) for the treatment of which a therapeutic panel can be elaborated and layered. If a curative treatment cannot be considered in case of an HCC classified in an intermediate stage, a Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) can be proposed. In case of a partial response or the treatment of some lesions of a multifocal HCC, a combined treatment by stereotaxic radiotherapy (CK), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) may be initiated in accordance with a decision of the multidisciplinary consultation meeting.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of HCC receiving MWA, RFA or CK after downstaging with TACE.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Lesion Response, Lesion response after combined treatment, 4-6 weeks after BWA or RFA or 3-6 months after CK
Delayed Lesion Response, Lesion response a year after combined treatment, 1 year after BWA, RFA or CK
