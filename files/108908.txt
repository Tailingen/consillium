Safety and Tolerability of Ziftomenib Combinations in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The safety, tolerability, and antileukemic response of ziftomenib in combination with standard of care treatments for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia will be examined with the following agents: FLAG-IDA, low-dose cytarabine, and gilteritinib.
