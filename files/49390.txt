Assessment of Ability of Breath Hold for Left-sided Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy to Reduce Side Effects to Heart
The purpose of this research study is to demonstrate that Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (DIBH), the technique used at the University of North Carolina (UNC) for left-side breast cancer radiation therapy, can reduce side effects to the heart.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Cardiac SPECT perfusion scan
Changes in cardiac perfusion, Cardiac perfusion will be assessed using SPECT cardiac perfusion scans pre- and 6 months post-radiation. Any post-radiation summed-rest score (SRS) \> 0 will be counted as a perfusion defect in the calculation of the perfusion defect rate., 6-months post radiation
Wall-motion abnormalities, The incidence of wall-motion abnormalities will be assessed using SPECT in the same 12 segment scoring system used to quantify perfusion. Wall-motion abnormalities will be recorded as present or absent in each cardiac segment. When present, wall-motion abnormalities wil be classified as gypokinetic, akinetic, or dyskinetic. The extent of wall involvement (small or large portion) will be described as mild or severe., 6-months post-treatment
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the rate of radiation-associated regional myocardial perfusion defects in patients 6 months after breast/chestwall radiation with DIBH for left-sided breast cancer. Cardiac perfusion will be assessed using SPECT cardiac perfusion scans pre- and 6 months post-radiation.
