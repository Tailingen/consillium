Descartes-08 CAR-T Cells in Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (MG)
This is a Phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Descartes-08 CAR T-cells in patients with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
DRUG: Descartes-08
Proportion of patients with MG Composite improvement of ≥5 points., In Part 3, the primary objective is to compare the effect of Descartes-08 versus placebo, as measured by the change in MGC score from baseline to Week 12. In Part 1, up to three ascending doses of Descartes-08 will be administered to each of 3 to 6 patients; the patients will be staggered at least 21 days apart and will complete a safety review between each dose. In Part 2, patients will receive up to 6 doses in three different schedules depending on the arm they were enrolled into and will be monitored for up to 1 year to assess the safety and tolerability of a repeated dosing schedule., Day 0 to Day 85
Comparison on Descartes-08 versus placebo on QMG and MG ADL, The proportion of patients achieving a ≥6-point change from Baseline at each posttreatment follow-up in the MG ADL score and QMG score (all parts), and the difference between this proportion in the treatment arm compared to placebo at Day 85., Day 0 to Day 85|Comparison on Descartes-08 versus placebo on MG assessments in crossover patients, The proportion of patients initially randomized to placebo who then cross over to Descartes-08 and achieve a ≥5-point reduction in MGC score from Crossover Day

1 to Crossover Day 85., Day 0 to Day 85|Change in titer of myasthenia specific autoantibody titers, Determine the change from baseline over a period of 24 weeks in the titer of myasthenia specific autoantibody titers, e.g. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (anti-nAChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase autoantibody (anti- MusK or anti-Low-Density-Lipoprotein-Related-Protein4 (anti-LRP4) or anti-AChR cluster antibody and the 4 Immunoglobulin types (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE) following single or multiple infusions of Descartes-08 in MG auto-antibody seropositive patients (Parts 1 and 2 only), Day 0 to Day 168|Effect of single or multiple infusions of Descartes-08 on patients by standard clinical assessment scales, Quantify the clinical effect of single or multiple infusions of Descartes-08 on patients by standard clinical assessment scales (MG ADL, QMG, MG QoL 15R, MG PIS, MG Composite) over a period of 24 weeks in MG auto-antibody seropositive and seronegative patients together and separately (all parts)., Day 0 to Day 168
