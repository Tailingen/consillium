Bevacizumab and Carboplatin/Paclitaxel and Radiation in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is being done to learn what effects (good and bad) bevacizumab in conjunction with carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiation therapy has on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
To examine the time to progression of the novel regimen in stage III patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
Response rate, overall survival, and patterns of failure and toxicity of the novel therapy.
* There are three phases of treatment 1)chemoradiation, 2) consolidation and 3)maintenance therapy.
* The chemoradiation phase is from week 1 to week 7. The following will occur during this phase: Daily chest radiation starting on day 1; pre-medication for paclitaxel; weekly intravenous administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin; intravenous administration of bevacizumab once weekly every three weeks starting on day 1.
* During weeks 8-9, patients will undergo a PET/CT scan for restaging.
* The consolidation phase is from week 10 to week 16. The following will occur during this phase: Pre-medication for paclitaxel; intravenous administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin twice weekly every 3 weeks; intravenous administration of bevacizumab once weekly every 3 weeks.
* The maintenance phase is from week 17 to week 52. The following will occur during this phase; intravenous administration of bevacizumab once a week every three weeks for 1 year; PET/CT scan every three months.
* The following evaluations will occur during treatment: 1)Patients will be evaluated weekly by the study doctor, 2) Weight, difficulty or discomfort in swallowing, shortness of breath and over well-being will be recorded, 3) Weekly lab test will include CBC, chemistries, and liver function tests. 4) Followed through each cycle of chemotherapy and every 6-8 weeks for the duration of the study.
* The following evaluations will occur after treatment: 1)Every 6-8 weeks assessed for response with a CT or PET/CT scan for one year, 2) Toxicity will also be assessed at each follow-up interval.
