A Study to Compare Tivozanib (AV-951) to Sorafenib in Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with advanced RCC. The study is designed to compare the PFS, OS, ORR, DR, safety and tolerability, and kidney specific symptoms/health outcome measurements of tivozanib and sorafenib.
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: tivozanib (AV-951)|DRUG: Sorafenib
Progression-free Survival (PFS) of Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression (progressive disease) or death due to any reasons whichever comes first. Disease progression per RECIST 1.0 criteria is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first. Disease progression was assessed every 8 weeks.
Overall Survival (OS) of Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored at the last date the subject is known to be alive. Subjects lacking data beyond randomization will have their survival times censored on the date of randomization., Date of randomization to date of death|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects who have at least a 30% reduction in the sum of diameters per RECIST (Version 1.0)., Every 8 weeks from date of randomization until disease progression|Duration of Response (DR) of Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, Duration of response (DR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of tumor progression per RECIST 1.0 or to death due to any cause., Assessed every 8 weeks from date of randomization until date of progression|Safety and Tolerability of Tivozanib and Sorafenib, Dose reductions and interruptions were allowed for subjects taking tivozanib or sorafenib. Any modification of study drug administration, and the reason for such action, was clearly noted on the subject's eCRF., From start of treatment therapy to completion of treatment therapy, an average of 11 months|To Compare Kidney-specific Symptoms and Health Outcome Measurements in Subjects Randomized to Treatment With Tivozanib or Sorafenib, The Disease Related Symptom Scale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Advanced Kidney Cancer Symptom Index (FKSI-DRS) measured kidney specific symptoms on a 0-36 scale, with lower scores corresponding to worse overall QOL and higher scores corresponding to better overall QOL. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) measured general wellbeing scored on a 0-108 scale, with lower scores corresponding to worse overall QOL and higher scores corresponding to better overall QOL. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) measured patient health related quality of life scored on a 0-1 scale, with 0 being worse health state and 1 being perfect health state. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scales (EQ-5D VAS) measured patient health related quality of life on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best. These scales were self-administered by patients at the start of the visit., At Day 1 of each 28 day cycle throughout the course of the study, for an average of 11 months per subject|Pharmacokinetics (Serum Concentrations) of Tivozanib, Samples for tivozanib serum concentrations will be collected at the following time points: Cycle 1, Day 1 (prior to dosing), Cycle 1, Day 15 (prior to dosing), Cycle 2, Day 1 (prior to dosing), and Cycle 2, Day 22-28. The serum concentrations of tivozanib were tabulated for individual subjects and summarized by nominal time using standard descriptive statistics (concentrations presented in ng/mL)., Cycle 1, Day 1 (prior to dosing), Cycle 1, Day 15 (prior to dosing), Cycle 2, Day 1 (prior to dosing), and Cycle 2, Day 22-28
This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm trial comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with advanced RCC. The study is designed to compare the PFS, OS, ORR, DR, safety and tolerability, and kidney specific symptoms/health outcome measurements of tivozanib and sorafenib.

Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib and stratified by geographic region (North America/Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, or rest of the world); number of prior treatments (0 or 1); and number of metastatic sites/organs involved (1 or â‰¥ 2).
