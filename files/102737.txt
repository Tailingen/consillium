A Study for Patients That Have Been Previously Been Treated in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia or Multiple Myeloma
To determine whether further study of single-agent enzastaurin is warranted in patients with previously treated Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia or Multiple Myeloma based on response.
Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Enzastaurin
Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) and Minimal Response (MR) or Minor Response (MinR): (Response Rate), European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) Response Criteria (RC) used for MM. CR: no serum/urine M protein for 6 weeks (wk), \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow (PCBM), no lytic bone lesions (LBL) size/number increase, no soft tissue plasmacytomas (STPC); PR: met some CR criteria plus maintain for 6 wk ≥50% serum monoclonal paraprotein (SPEP) and PCBM decrease, either decrease of ≥90% or \<200 mg light chain excretion (LCE), ≥50% STPC size decrease; MR: met some PR criteria plus maintain for 6 wk, a decrease of: 25-49% SPEP, 50-89% 24 hour urinary LCE, 25-49% PCBM, 25-49% STPC size. International Workshop on WM (IWWM) RC used for WM. CR: no serum M protein, malignant cells in BM, or lymphadenopathy/organomegaly; PR: ≥50% immunoglobulin M (IgM) and adenopathy/organomegaly (A/O) decrease; no new symptoms of WM. MinR: ≥25% to \<50% IgM decrease, no A/O progression; no cytopenias or clinical symptoms of WM., Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 40.51 months
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as elapsed time from the first evidence of CR, PR, MR or MinR until date of progression of disease (PD). EBMT RC used for MM. CR: no serum/urine M protein for 6 wk, \<5% PCBM, no LBL size/number increase, no STPC; PR: met some CR criteria plus maintain for 6 wk ≥50% SPEP and PCBM decrease, either decrease of ≥90% or \<200 mg LCE, ≥50% STPC size decrease; MR: met some PR criteria plus maintain for 6 wk decrease of: 25-49% SPEP, 50-89% 24 hour urinary LCE, 25-49% PCBM, 25-49% STPC size. PD: \>25% increase in SPEP, 24 hour urinary LCE, PCBM, STPC size increase, new bone lesion or STPC. IWWM RC used for WM. CR: no serum M protein, malignant cells in BM, or lymphadenopathy/organomegaly; PR: ≥50% IgM and A/O decrease; no new WM symptoms. MinR: ≥25% to \<50% IgM decrease, no A/O progression; no cytopenias or clinical of WM symptoms. PD: \>25% IgM increase, progression of clinical findings or symptoms. For participants who had no PD, DOR was censored at their last contact., Time of response to time of measured progressive disease up to 38.37 months|Time to Progressive Disease, Time to progression is defined as the elapsed time from the date of study enrollment to the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD). European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) Response Criteria was used for MM. PD: \>25% increase in serum monoclonal paraprotein (SPEP), 24 hour urinary light chain excretion (LCE), plasma cells in bone marrow (PCBM), soft tissue plasmacytomas (STPC) size increase, new bone lesion or STPC. International Workshop on WM (IWWM) Response Criteria was used for WM. PD: \>25% immunoglobulin M (IgM) increase, progression of clinical findings or symptoms. For participants who had no PD, time to PD was censored at their last contact., Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 40.51 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (Safety and Adverse Events), Data are presented as number of participants who experienced serious adverse events or all other nonserious adverse events during the study including the 30-day follow-up period. A summary of serious adverse events and other nonserious adverse events is located in the Reported Adverse Event section. Safety data were collected up to 24 cycles plus 30 days of follow-up for a total up to 23.40 months., Treatment start to 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment up to 23.40 months
Number of Participants Who Died Due to Progressive Disease During the 30 Days Following Discontinuation From Study Treatment, Study treatment discontinuation up to 30 days post study treatment discontinuation
To determine whether further study of single-agent enzastaurin is warranted in patients with previously treated Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia or Multiple Myeloma based on response.
