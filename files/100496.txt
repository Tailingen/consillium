Toxicity profile of the EpCAM targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0, Observe and handle the toxicity profile of the EpCAM targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0, up to 24 months
Survival time of anti-EpCAM CAR T cells in vivo, Detect the existence of CAR-T cells in the blood of participants through flow cytometry, up to 24 months|Anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T therapy by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-T therapy for patients with EpCAM positive cancers was assessed by RECIST v1.1, up to 24 months
This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting EpCAM in treating patients with EpCAM positive cancer. In the research, the investigators design a novel CAR consists of a EpCAM targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. The infusion dose is (1-10)Ã—106 EpCAM-CAR positive T cells/kg, and the specific cells numbers depends on the situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation. The way of infusion is vascular interventional mediated or endoscopy, and the cells perfusion process would lasts 15min to 30min, and the specific time depends on patent's tumor-burdened state. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
