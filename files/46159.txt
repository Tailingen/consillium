The aims of this study are to compare the effect of two stress and symptom management programs tailored for patients with neurofibromatosis on quality of life and psychosocial functioning. We will also examine the degree to which treatment-dependent improvements in quality of life are mediated by improvements in depression, anxiety, distress, mindfulness, gratitude, social support, empathy, optimism, coping, pain intensity and pain interference.
