Emerging From the Haze for Gynecologic Cancer Survivors
At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the investigators have developed a novel curriculum for a 6-week psycho-educationally-based, cognitive behavioral program to help patients with subjective cognitive complaints after cancer treatment, titled Emerging from the Haze™ (Haze). Each series meets once a week for 2-2.5 hours for 6 weeks.

The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of a trainee-taught Emerging from the Haze course on gynecologic cancer survivors' self-report of cognitive changes based on the change of FACT-Cog score.

BEHAVIORAL: Emerging from the Haze class
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Cognition (FACT-Cog) Survey, Measure the change in score from baseline to each of three time points: last day of class (6 weeks), 6 months, and 1 year after class, First day of class (baseline), last day of class (6 weeks), 6 months and 1 year after class
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Cognition and General Concerns Survey, Measure the change in score from baseline to each of three time points: last day of class (6 weeks), 6 months, and 1 year after class, First day of class (baseline), last day of class (6 weeks), 6 months and 1 year after class|UCLA Loneliness Scale Survey, Measure the change in score from baseline to each of three time points: last day of class (6 weeks), 6 months, and 1 year after class, First day of class (baseline), last day of class (6 weeks), 6 months and 1 year after class
Comparison of trainee-taught vs non-trainee taught class, To compare the impact of a trainee-taught Emerging from the Haze course on gynecologic cancer survivors' self report of cognitive changes based on change of the FACT-Cog compared to the impact of an ongoing non-trainee-taught Emerging from the Haze course on breast cancer survivors' self report of cognitive changes based on the change in FACT-Cog score from first day of class (baseline) to last day of class (6 weeks) in these two groups, First day of class (baseline), last day of class (6 weeks)
