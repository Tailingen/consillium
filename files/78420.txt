Brigatinib in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients With ALK+ ALCL, IMT or Other Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, phase I-II dose-escalation and expansion study designed to define the recommended dose of brigatinib as monotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+ ALCL, IMT or other solid tumors and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), (long-term) safety, and efficacy of brigatinib in these children.
Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, ALK-Positive|Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor|Other Solid Tumor
DRUG: Brigatinib
Phase 1: assess the MTD/RP2D regimen, Phase 1:

• To assess the MTD/RP2D regimen of brigatinib monotherapy when administered in pediatric and AYA patients with ALK+ ALCL or ALK+ solid tumors.

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first course of therapy.

The RP2D is defined as the dose that results in equivalent (approximately ±20% of the adult values) PK exposure to 180 mg QD with a 7 day lead in of 90 mg QD in adults and with 0 or 1 DLT in 6 patients., 2 years|Phase 1: to characterize the PK of brigatinib, Phase 1:

• To characterize the PK of brigatinib administered as monotherapy in pediatric and AYA patients with ALK+ ALCL or ALK+ solid tumors:

o maximum observed concentration (Cmax),, 2 years|Phase 1: to characterize the PK of brigatinib, Phase 1:

• To characterize the PK of brigatinib administered as monotherapy in pediatric and AYA patients with ALK+ ALCL or ALK+ solid tumors:

o area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast)., 2 years|Phase 1: to characterize the PK of brigatinib, Phase 1:

* To characterize the PK of brigatinib administered as monotherapy in pediatric and AYA patients with ALK+ ALCL or ALK+ solid tumors:

  * time of first occurrence of maximum observed concentration (Tmax), T ½., 2 years|Phase 2: ORR in IMT, • B1, ALK+ IMT:

To establish the activity (ORR by RECIST 1.1, best response) of single agent brigatinib when administered to children with ALK+ IMT:

Best response, defined as the percentage of patients with CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 as best response during brigatinib treatment., 2 years|Phase 2: EFS in ALCL, • B2, ALK+ ALCL: To establish the efficacy (EFS) of single agent brigatinib when administered to children with ALK+ ALCL for a duration of 2 years, without SCT in consolidation.

EFS, defined as the time between start of study treatment and first event being progressive disease (according to IPNHL criteria), relapse, death of any cause and second malignancies., 2 years
This is an open-label, phase I-II dose-escalation and expansion study designed to define the recommended dose of brigatinib as monotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+ ALCL, IMT or other solid tumors and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), (long-term) safety, and efficacy of brigatinib in these children.

Phase 1 part will be a dose escalation part using a rolling-6 design, aiming to accrue a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 18 evaluable patients in two dose-levels (and minus 1), at least 2/3 of included patients will be ≤18 years.

Phase 2 will be the tumor cohort expansion part of the study to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity/efficacy of brigatinib as monotherapy in two tumor-specific cohorts:

* Cohort B1: ALK+ IMT Planned sample size for Phase 2 is 12 patients with IMT. Patients who are included in the monotherapy Phase 1 IMT dose-escalation portion of the study will be included in the expansion cohort analysis if they receive the RP2D, and will count towards the total sample size of 12 patients.
* Cohort B2: ALK+ ALCL Planned sample size for Phase 2 is 22 patients with ALCL. Patients who are included in the monotherapy Phase 1 ALCL dose-escalation portion of the study will be included in the expansion cohort analysis if they receive the RP2D, and will count towards the total sample size of 22 patients.
