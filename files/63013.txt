TraceIT Tissue Marker to Mark the Primary Resection Bed Margins of Oropharyngeal Cancers
The purpose of this research study is to look at how using an injectable marker called TraceIT can help with the radiation treatment planning process. TraceIT is a gel that dissolves in the body over time and can be injected and is visible on many types of images that can be used in the treatment planning process. If the exact edges of negative tumor margins can be marked before treatment planning, it is thought that the area receiving radiation can be more personalized, thus potentially reducing unnecessary radiation to areas that are cancer-free.
Oropharyngeal Cancer
DEVICE: TraceIT Tissue Marker
Percent Change in Total Mean Clinical Target Volumes (CTV) Between the Standard of Care Treatment Plan and the Treatment Plan Based on the TraceIT Hydrogel Markers, -The mean total dose of each targeted site was totaled from the standard of care treatment plan and the TraceIT tissue marker treatment plan. The percent change in CTV was measured by standard field in cGy minus marker based in cGy = percent change in CTV (in cGy). The sites included left \& right submandibular, left \& right parotid, left \& right pharynx constrictor, oral cavity, lips, larynx, and spinal cord., At the treatment planning (2-5 weeks after TraceIT hydrogel placement)
Percentage of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event Related to TraceIT Injection, From time of injection through surgery (day 1)|Anatomic Localization Related to Standard Treatment Fields Based on Anatomy as Measured by Number of Participants That Had Markers Visible, At the treatment planning (2-5 weeks after TraceIT hydrogel placement)
