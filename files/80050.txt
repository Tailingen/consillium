Post Mortem Tissue Donation of Pediatric Tumor Tissues and Cells
The objective of this study is to utilize all donated pediatric tumor tissues and cells obtained from autopsy to prospectively develop novel patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models as well as in vitro cell culture model systems for pediatric cancers, and also provide tissue samples to other researchers and organizations (eg, CBTN, DIPG Registry, COG).
Pediatric Cancer
OTHER: Collection of post mortem tissue donation
Procurement of pediatric cancer and non-cancer tumor tissue during autopsy with signed consent, Procurement of pediatric cancer and non-cancer tumor tissue during autopsy with signed consent. Tissue will be collected through a research tissue collection autopsy of the original tumor and other sites that are appropriate. Samples of both tumor and normal cells will be collected in addition to body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, bone marrow, and skin biopsies for genomic testing., Up to 5 years from procurement
The objective of this study is to utilize all donated pediatric tumor tissues and cells obtained from autopsy to prospectively develop novel patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models as well as in vitro cell culture model systems for pediatric cancers, and also provide tissue samples to other researchers and organizations (eg, CBTN, DIPG Registry, COG).

This model system will then be subjected to 1) comprehensive histopathological and molecular characterizations during serial in vivo sub-transplantations; 2) cryopreserved for long term preservation of tumorigenicity; and 3) used for future biological studies and preclinical drug testing.
