DAANCE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUROPATHY
Up to 80% of breast cancer survivors experience chemotherapy-induced neuropathy that impairs quality of life and increases fall risk long into survivorship, yet treatment options for neuropathy remain limited. The successful treatment will target neurophysiologic mechanisms for restoring function while addressing patient-reported symptoms and participation in treatment. Toward this end, the investigators propose to study a noninvasive, social sensorimotor intervention - Adapted Argentine Tango - which targets motor control restoration, symptom alleviation, and treatment participation in concert.
Cancer of the Breast|Chemotherapy-induced Neuropathy
BEHAVIORAL: Tango
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) - CIN sensation, Sensation of numbness/tingling on 0-10 scale; minimum value 0 (no numbness/tingling); maximum value 10 (worst numbness/tingling), 4 weeks|Dual-task function, Ability to move and think at the same time as measured by time to complete the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test with concurrent cognitive task (i.e., counting backward by some number while completing a defined movement task), 4 weeks
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) - hot/cold sensation, Sensation of hot and/or cold (11 point Likert scale)., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|EORTC-CIPN 20, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms inventory (CIPN 20),, mid-intervention (4weeks); post -intervention (8 weeks); 1 month follow up post intervention|Brief Fatigue Inventory, The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a short questionnaire used to quickly assess the severity of fatigue, particularly in cancer patients, by measuring both the level of tiredness and how much fatigue interferes with daily activities, allowing for rapid evaluation in clinical settings or research studies; it consists of nine items where patients rate their fatigue on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue severity., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|Brief Pain Inventory, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported questionnaire used to assess the severity of pain and how much it interferes with a person's daily activities, including aspects like mood, work, sleep, and social interactions. It measures pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) across different timeframes (current, average, worst pain) while also evaluating the impact of pain on various life functions on a similar 0-10 scale; it comes in both short and long forms, with the long form including more detailed questions about pain characteristics and treatment history., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The PRO-CTCAE assessment, which stands for "Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events," is a measurement system designed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to capture and evaluate the symptomatic side effects experienced by cancer patients during clinical trials, allowing patients to self-report on the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptoms like pain, fatigue, nausea, and skin reactions, providing a more patient-centric perspective on treatment toxicity compared to clinician-based assessments alone., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|Physical Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), The PHQ-2 asks how often a patient has experienced depressed mood or anhedonia in the last two weeks, 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire, Each question has a 4-point scale, ranging from 1, "not at all", to 4, "nearly every day"., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|Falls, Report of whether you have fallen or lost your balanced since we last spoke with you, 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks; 6 months following intervention end|The Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (MiniBEST), The Mini-BESTest (Balance Evaluation Systems Test) is a 14-item test that measures balance, functional mobility, and gait by assessing dynamic balance, anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait., 4 weeks (Control group); 8 weeks (Intervention group)|Biomechanical measures of postural control, Postural sway while standing still with eyes closed., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks|Six minute walk test (6mwt), A "6 minute walk test" (6MWT) is a medical assessment where a person walks as far as they can in a designated area for six minutes, with the primary goal of measuring their functional exercise capacity, usually used to evaluate patients with conditions affecting their breathing or mobility, like heart failure or lung disease; the distance walked during those six minutes is the key measurement recorded as the "6-minute walk distance" (6MWD), 4 weeks; 8 weeks|Gait stability, Stability between gait strides over the period of the 6mwt., 4 weeks; 8 weeks|Upper Extremity Function, We assess upper extremity function using the "back scratch test" which measures upper body flexibility and shoulder mobility. Participants reach both hands toward each other behind their backs and staff measure the distance remaining between their fingertips., 4 weeks; 8 weeks; 12 weeks
Brain Activity, Electroencephalography (EEG)-based measures of brain activity during performance of functional activities (e.g., walking standing, thinking). We will analyze Alpha and Gamma frequencies with regard to amplitude and timing of peak activity., 4 weeks (Control group); 8 weeks (Intervention group)|Blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IRN-gamma, MCP-1, 4 weeks (Control group); 8 weeks (Intervention group)|Blood-based biomarkers of neurotoxity, Neurofilament chains, light density (NfL), 4 weeks (Control group); 8 weeks (Intervention group)|Blood-based biomarkers of neuroplasticity, BDNF and GFAP. These will be measured using the same units of measurement, 4 weeks (Control group); 8 weeks (Intervention group)
This study will investigate a noninvasive, social, sensorimotor intervention which targets motor control restoration, symptom alleviation, and treatment participation in concert: partnered Adapted Argentine Tango (Tango). This project will expand the investigators' pilot work (R21-AG068831) into a multicenter clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of social dance on sensory relief, functional restoration, and key mechanisms of action among a diverse cohort of BC survivors suffering from chronic chemotherapy-induced sensorimotor deficits.
