Study of Vitespen (HSPPC-96, Oncophage Â®) for Immune Response Assessment in Participants With Resectable Renal Cell Carcinoma at Intermediate Risk of Recurrence
The primary objective of the study is to determine whether participants exhibit a measurable immune response after multiple administrations of HSPPC-96 (heat shock protein-peptide complex 96), as assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: HSPPC-96
Number of Participants With Positive Immunological Response Using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISPOT) Assay, The ELISPOT assay was not developed for this study and no immunogenicity data are available., 6-7 weeks post surgery up to Week 14
The study consists of two parts: Part 1 with Part 1a (Assessment of Immune Variation) and Part 1b (Assay Standardization), and Part 2 (Immune Monitoring Study). The study was terminated early with 12 participants enrolled only in Part 1a and Part 1b. Part 2 of the study involved randomization after 8 doses of HSSPC-96. After the 8 doses of HSSPC-96 administered in Part 2, the participants were to be randomized to the treatment extension arm or the placebo extension arm. There were no participants enrolled in Part 2 since the study was terminated early. Therefore, no randomization occurred in the conduct of this study and only a single arm was enrolled.
