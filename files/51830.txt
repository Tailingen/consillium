Selinexor (KPT-330) and Liposomal Doxorubicin For Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The main purpose of this study is to determine the recommended doses of selinexor in combination with liposomal doxorubicin and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. In addition, the study will assess whether this combination with effective for patients with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: Liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D): Selinexor on Days 1, 8 and 15 when given in combination with Lipodox 20 mg/m\^2 and Dexamethasone 40 mg.

Dose level 1: 40 mg in combination with Lipodox and Dexamethasone.

Dose level 2: 80 mg (D1,8,15) in combination with Lipodox and Dexamethasone.

Dose level 2m: 80 mg (D1,8,15) in combination with Lipodox and Dexamethasone.

Dose level 3m: 80 mg (D1,3,8,10) in combination with Lipodox and Dexamethasone., Up to 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - All Participants, ORR per the modified uniform response criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), partial response and better. Partial Remission (PR): \>/= 50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>/= 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hours; Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR): Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100 mg per 24 hours; Complete Remission (CR): Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \</= 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Stable Disease: Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease. Minimal response: Less than 50% decrease in M protein. Not evaluable: Cannot be measured because enough information has not been collected., Up to 24 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) -All Participants Treated at Recommended Phase 2 Dose, Determine the overall response rate per the modified uniform response criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), partial response and better. Partial Remission (PR): \>/= 50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>/= 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hours; Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR): Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100 mg per 24 hours; Complete Remission (CR): Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \</= 5% plasma cells in bone marrow., Up to 24 months
