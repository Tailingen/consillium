Cabozantinib in Women With Metastatic Hormone-Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
The study drug cabozantinib works by inhibiting several different proteins which are believed to be involved in breast cancer tumor growth, its ability to spread, and its ability to form new blood vessels. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent cancer growth.

The single agent portion of this study is now closed to accrual. This research study is now examining the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with fulvestrant for treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to bone.

DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Bone Scan Response Rate, Bone scan response rate will be defined as the percentage of patients experiencing a complete resolution of bone lesions or partial response in the isotope bone scan per Bone Scan Time Point Response Criteria, as defined in the protocol. Complete resolution is defined as the disappearance of all areas of radiotracer uptake attributable to metastatic disease, and a partial response is defined as significant improvement in radiotracer uptake in areas attributable to metastatic disease, but not meeting the criteria for CR., 2 years
Overall Response Rate by RECIST v 1.1, The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients experiencing a complete response or partial response on PET imaging per mRECIST (modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors), as defined in the protocol. A complete response is defined as resolution of all areas of FDG uptake attributable to metastatic disease. A partial response is defined as significantly decreased FDG uptake in areas attributable to metastatic disease, but not meeting the criteria for a complete response., 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the difference between the date of a patient's enrollment onto this study until the date of death. Patients who are alive at last contact will be censored for OS at this date., 5 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the difference between the date of a patient's enrollment onto this study until the earlier of the date of progression or the date of death. Patients who are alive and progression-free at last contact will be censored for PFS at this date., 5 years
Cabozantinib will be taken orally once a day in cycles of 28 days (4 weeks). Fulvestrant will be given intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent cycles.

On Day 1 of each cycle subjects will have the following tests and procedures:

* Performance status
* Physical exam
* Vital signs
* Routine blood samples
* Blood and urine samples to look at bone markers (Cycle 1 through 6 only)

Subjects will also have the following additional tests and procedures:

* Tumor assessment by Computed Tomography (CT) scan and bone scan at Cycle 3, then every 12 weeks
* Blood or urine pregnancy test (if applicable) on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, then every 12 weeks
* Urine sample and blood test for thyroid function (Cycle 1, 3, 5, then every 6 weeks)
* Blood test for breast cancer tumor marker (Cycle 1 and 4, then every 6 weeks)
* Pain questionnaire and painkiller medication diary at 7-day intervals during Week 3, Week 6, and every 6 weeks thereafter.
