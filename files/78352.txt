Abscopal Effect from the Low-dose Radiotherapy in Polymetastatic Cancer Patients Receiving Stereotactic Radiotherapy
Recently, MD Anderson Cancer Center reported the phase II trial to investigate high-dose radiotherapy (HDRT, 20-70 Gy) and low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT, 1-10 Gy) for metastatic cancer patients who had undergone immunotherapy. HDRT or HDRT+LDRT was conducted in two respective groups and the treatment group was determined according to the disease status of participants, not randomization. Immunotherapy was maintained in this clinical study. Therefore, we aim to investigate this abscopal effect from adding LDRT to HDRT, irrespective of previous immunotherapy, in this multicenter, single-arm study.
