Long-term Heart-specific Mortality in the Presence of Competing Risks Among Patients With Non-metastatic Gastric Adenocarcinoma Undergoing Resection and Chemotherapy
In this population-based cohort study, data on patients diagnosed with nmGaC in 2004 through 2016, managed with resection and chemotherapy, followed up until the end of 2016, and surviving ≥1 month were retrieved from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-18 Program. Cumulative mortality functions were calculated. Prognostic factors for heart-specific mortality were evaluated using both multivariable-adjusted Fine-Gray subdistribution and cause-specific hazard functions.
Long-term Heart-specific Mortality in the Presence of Competing Risks Among Patients With Gastric Adenocarcinoma Undergoing Resection and Chemotherapy
PROCEDURE: Resection and chemotherapy
Cumulative mortality, Cumulative incidence functions (CIFs), which, unlike the standard Kaplan-Meier method, allow for estimation of the incidence of the occurrence of an event while taking competing risks from other causes of death into account, were computed and plotted for cause-specific mortalities., Jan 12, 2020-Mar 5, 2021|Prognostic factors for disease-specific mortalities, Evaluated using both multivariable-adjusted Fine-Gray subdistribution and cause-specific hazard functions., Jan 12, 2020-Mar 5, 2021
