Efficacy of Docetaxel, Capecitabine, Cisplatin, and Bevacizumab in Patients With Unresectable Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether docetaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin, and bevacizumab are effective in the treatment of unresectable advanced gastric cancer.
Advanced Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel, Capecitabine, Cisplatin, Bevacizumab
R0 resection rate, R0 resection means complete resection of tumor., Up to 4 weeks after surgery
Overall survival, Overall survival will be measured from the start of study treatment to documented death of any cause., Up to 3 years|Progression-free survival, Time to progression will be measured from the start of study treatment to documented tumor progression., Up to 3 years|Adverse Event, Treatment toxicities are evaluated according to the NCI common toxicity criteria version 3.0, Up to 28 days after end of treatment|Angiogenetic biomarkers, cluster of differentiation 31, microvessel density, platelet derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Neuropilin 1 and phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class F, Baseline and 6 weeks after treatment
In our previous phase II study of neoadjuvant docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy, patients with unresectable gastric cancer because of invasion to adjacent organs or metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes received benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Based on these results and reports that bevacizumab enhances response rate, we planned docetaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin, and bevacizumab as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with local invasion or para-aortic node metastasis alone.
