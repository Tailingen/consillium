Targeted Alpha Therapy With 225Actinium-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-I&T of Castration-resISTant Prostate Cancer (TATCIST).
The treatment regimen will consist of 4 doses of FPI-2265
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: FPI-2265
To evaluate the effect of FPI-2265 on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in participants with mCRPC., Frequency and proportion of participants with PSA50, defined as ≥ 50% decline in PSA level by 12-weeks after the first treatment., From start of treatment until 12 weeks after the first treatment.
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FPI- 2265., * Frequency, duration and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0).
* Changes in clinical laboratory, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and physical examinations compared to baseline., From first treatment dose to up to 24 months after last treatment.|To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of FPI-2265., * Maximum % PSA decline.
* PSA progression free survival (PFS).
* Time to best PSA response
* Objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).
* Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1.
* Duration of response (DoR) based on RECIST v1.1/Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.
* Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per PCWG3 criteria.
* Overall survival (OS)., From first treatment until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months after last treatment.|To assess the impact of FPI-2265 on participant reported outcomes., * The frequency and proportion of participants with an improvement in bone pain levels.
* Change in quality of life (QoL) over time., From first treatment until 24 months after last treatment.
The treatment regimen will consist of 4 doses of FPI-2265, administered at 8 ± 1 week intervals, with an initial activity of 100 kilobecquerel (kBq)/kg (±10%).

Additional doses will be administered at 100 kBq/kg (±10%) with the following exceptions:

* Participants who experience dose-modifying events.
* Participants with a confirmed decline in PSA\>=50%.
