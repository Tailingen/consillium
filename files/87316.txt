Bevacizumab, Gemcitabine, and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin works in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: bevacizumab|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: oxaliplatin
Survival at 6 months, at 6 months
Objective response rate as measured by RECIST criteria, Up to 5 years|Median survival, Up to 5 years|Progression-free survival, Up to 5 years|Time to treatment failure, Up to 5 years|Overall survival, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the 6-month survival of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with bevacizumab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin.

Secondary

* Determine the objective response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.
* Determine median survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on days 2 and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 courses of therapy beyond CR.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.
