Chemotherapy and Maximal Tumor Debulking of Multi-organ Colorectal Cancer Metastases
The purpose of this study is to compare overall survival rates of colorectal cancer patients with multi-organ metastases with an indication for first line systemic treatment randomized for treatment with combination chemotherapy or treatment with combination chemotherapy and additional maximal tumor debulking including surgical tumor resection, RFA, (DEBIRI-)TACE and SBRT, depending on best clinical judgement according to a standardized treatment algorithm. Our hypothesis is that maximal tumor debulking in addition to systemic treatment with chemotherapy and biologicals will provide an improvement in progression free and overall survival in this patient group.
Multi-organ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: XELOX regimen according to standard procedures|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen according to standard procedures|PROCEDURE: Surgery|OTHER: radiofrequency ablation (RFA)|OTHER: transarterial chemo-embolization using irinotecan drug-eluted beads ((DEBIRI-)TACE)|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)|DRUG: Bevacizumab|PROCEDURE: tumor biopsy
Overall survival, from date of study inclusion until the date of death or until the end of follow up, assessed up to 10 years
Progression free survival rates, date of study inclusion to the first event defined as local recurrence or progression, distant recurrence or death from any cause assessed up to 10 years|Response rates, assessed every 3 months, after a follow up of 3 years assessed every 6 months|Safety and efficacy of the additional local treatment measured by number of serious adverse events., assessed after inclusion of 25, 50 and 100 patients, after 30% of the patients are included in the study for 12 months and after the end of follow up, assessed up to 10 years
