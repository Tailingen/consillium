A Study of Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel and Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase 1 (the first phase in testing a new drug, to see how safe a new drug or new indication/population ) and phase 2 (the second phase in testing a new drug or new indication/population to see how effective the drug is) study of neoadjuvant (treatment before the main treatment) with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) and gemcitabine and radiation therapy before surgery and then gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel after surgery in patients with pancreatic cancer that has grown to involve one of the major artery branches.

Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel are chemotherapy drugs that are currently approved by Health Canada for use in combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a neoadjuvant treatment prior to gemcitabine and radiation is experimental. Surgery to remove or reconstruct the major artery is also experimental.
