The Vitamin D Dose-Response Relationship
The purpose of the study is to determine the importance of the UV intensity and the UVB dose on the Vitamin D response after UVB.
Vitamin D Status
RADIATION: UVB|RADIATION: UVB|RADIATION: UVB|RADIATION: UVB
Vitamin D (nmol/l), Vitamin D measured in a blood sample to define the dose-response relationship between UVB dose, UV intensity and Vitamin D production in the skin after UVB exposure., 2 days after exposure
Other parameters, To invesitage whether other parameters like sex, BMI, Diet etc. influences the vitamin D production after UVB exposure., 2 days after radiation
The work is addressing vitamin D production after UVB exposure and explore the importance of UVB dose and UV intensity. Four different UVB doses and four different UV intensities are used to explore these relationships.

Many assumptions have been made concerning the vitamin D production after UVB exposure but only few studies exist.
