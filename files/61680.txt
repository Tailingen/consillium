A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Golcadomide in Combination With Rituximab (Golca + R) vs Investigator's Choice in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma (GOLSEEK-4)
The study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, open label Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of golcadomide in combination with rituximab vs investigator's choice in participants with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have received at least one line of prior systemic therapy.
