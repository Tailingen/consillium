Discriminant Capacity and Thresholds of Salivary Cortisol in Chemiluminescence in the Diagnosis of Hypercorticisms
Automated immunodosage methods (Roche Elecsys cortisol and IDS cortisol dosing kits) offer a simple and inexpensive technology routinely used in a medical biology laboratory. They can be used to define robust diagnostic thresholds for salivary cortisol for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and pseudo-Cushing combining the three tests performed as part of the patient's usual management. (ie two urinary free cortisol (UFC), the dexamethasone suppression test, and Diurnal variation of plasma cortisol).
