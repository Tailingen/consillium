This is a phase Ib/II, open, dose-escalation and expansion study of an anti-PD1/TIM3 bispecific antibody，LB1410 in combination with an anti-Claudin18.2/IL-10 fusion protein, LB4330 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: LB1410|DRUG: LB4330
Safety and tolerability (Adverse Event reported per NCI-CTCAE v5.0), Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-related adverse events reported per NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 60 days following last dose|Incidence and severity of serious adverse events (SAEs) and other special interest (immune-related AEs), According to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 60 days following last dose|Incidence of Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), The DLT for this study is defined per CTCAE 5.0 and will be evaluated in the Cycle 1 of treatment in the dose escalation part. If dosing delay occurs, the DLT evaluation should be correspondingly extended to 14 days after the second dosing., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Maximum tolerance toxicity (MTD) and recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D) definition, MTD and RP2D based on the safety data collected during the dose escalation phase (Phase I), up to 1 year|Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of patients whose best overall response is either a Complete Response or a Partial Response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria over the total number of evaluable patients, From first participant until last participant assessment, an average of 8 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of patients whose best overall response is either a Complete Response, a Partial Response or Stable Disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria over the total number of evaluable patients., From first participant until last participant assessment, an average of 8 months|Duration of overall Response (DoR) by RECIST version 1.1, Time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or the date of death due to underlying cancer., From first participant until last participant assessment, an average of 8 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by RECIST version 1.1, Time from the first infusion of LB1410 and LB4330 to the date of first documented tumor progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first over evaluable patients., From first participant until last participant assessment, an average of 8 months|DDC, Time from the date of first documented CR, PR or SD to the date of first documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or the date of death due to any cause., From first participant until last participant assessment, an average of 8 months|Overall Survival (OS) duration, Time from first LB1410 and LB4330 infusion to the date of death due to any cause over evaluable patients., From first participant until last participant assessment, an average of 1 year

The phase Ib/II clinical study in Chinese patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), anti-tumor efficacy, and biomarkers of LB1410 in combination with LB4330.

The study will include 2 parts: dose escalation (Phase Ib) and dose expansion (Phase II). Repeated intravenous infusion of LB1410 in combination with LB4330 in patients with metastatic or advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and endometrial carcinoma.
