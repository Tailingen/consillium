A Phase 2 Trial of Neoadjuvant Modified FOLFIRINOX Chemotherapy for Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Within the next decade, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is expected to rise to the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. To increase the survival, various peri-operative treatments have been tested, and adjuvant FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus capecitabine is now standard of care after surgical resection for localized PDAC. Even with superior survival among various disease extent of PDAC, resectable PDAC still shows poor outcomes with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This phase II study is investigating the role of modified-FOLFIRINOX as neoadjuvant treatment for resectable PDAC.

overall survival, overall survival is defined as time interval from cycle 1 day 1 to tumor death/last follow-up., up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as time interval from cycle 1 day 1 to tumor progression/death/last follow-up, up to 2 years|disease-free survival, disease-free survival is defined as time interval from operation day to tumor progression/death/last follow-up, up to 2 years|Objective response rate, Objective response rate is defined as rate of patients with complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) based on RESIST1.1., 3 months
This phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified FOLFIRINOX as neoadjuvant treatment for resectable pancreatic cancer.
