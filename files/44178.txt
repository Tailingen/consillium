Genes in Predicting Outcome in Patients With Esophageal Cancer Treated With Cisplatin, Radiation Therapy, and Surgery
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at genes to see if they can predict outcome in patients with esophageal cancer treated with cisplatin, radiation therapy, and surgery.
Esophageal Cancer
GENETIC: loss of heterozygosity analysis|GENETIC: polymerase chain reaction|GENETIC: polymorphism analysis
Comparison of pretreatment clinical tumor staging vs post-treatment pathologic staging (at resection), 1 month
OBJECTIVES:

* Correlate patient outcomes with neoplastic cell genotypes, specifically 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 major genes involved in platinum metabolism and disposition and DNA repair, in patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection on clinical trial ECOG-1201.
* Correlate patient outcomes with neoplastic cell genotypes, specifically loss of heterozygosity, in these patients.
* Correlate patient outcomes with normal (germline) cell genotypes, specifically SNPs related to platinum metabolism and disposition and DNA repair.
* Compare the predictive ability of neoplastic vs germline cell genotypes.

OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, cohort, multicenter study.

Neoplastic and normal (germline) cells are collected from pretreatment and post-treatment specimens using laser-capture microdissection. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are examined by real-time PCR. Loss of heterozygosity is assessed by analyzing short tandem repeat markers in neoplastic and germline tissue.
