A Phase 1/2, Open-label Study of Valemetostat in Combination With Rituximab and Lenalidomide in Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma
To find a recommended dose of valemetostat that can be given in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide to patients with follicular lymphoma. The safety and effects of this drug combination will also be studied
Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Valemetostat
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
