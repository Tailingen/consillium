Evaluation of dAroLutamide Addition to anDrogen Deprivation Therapy and radIatioN Therapy in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer With Pelvic Lymph Nodes Metastases
Prospective, multicenter, comparative, randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trial - patients with hormone-naÃ¯ve prostate cancer and pelvic lymph nodes metastases
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Darolutamide 300 mg|DRUG: Placebo of Darolutamide
Failure-free survival FFS, The failure-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to clinical (new cancer-related symptoms), biochemical (PSA rising) or radiological (local relapse or new metastases) progression, death, end of 3-year follow-up period or lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first., 3 years
Metastasis-free survival rates, To evaluate the metastasis-free survival rates, 3 years|Progression free survival rate, To evaluate the progression free survival rates, 3 years|PSA response levels, PSA response is defined by the rate of patients having a decrease of \> 50% of their PSA level, as measured every 3 months from the date of randomization to the date of a documented biochemical relapse., 3 years|Overall survival rates, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented death from any cause, end of 3-year follow-up period or lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first, 3 years|Cancer-specific survival rates, Cancer-specific survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented death from prostate cancer or complication from the treatment, end of 3-year follow-up period or lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first, 3 years|Time to pain progression, Time to pain progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented pain, end of 3-year follow-up period or lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first, 3 years|Toxicities, To evaluate toxicities (CTCAE v5.0) due to treatements, 3 years|Quality of life of the patient, Quality of life will be assessed using self-administered questionnaires (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire : EORTC QLQ-C30 v2), 3 years|Quality of life of the patient, Quality of life will be assessed using self-administered questionnaires (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire : EORC QLQ-PR25 V3), 3 years|Quality of life of the participants, Quality of life will be assessed using self-administered questionnaires (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire : EORTC QLQ-PR253) by patients, 3 years
Standard of care for patients with prostate cancer (PC) with pelvic lymph nodes metastases is radiotherapy (RT) with long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). . Darolutamide improves survival in men with castration-refractory non metastatic prostate cancer. We hypothesize that adding Darolutamide to ADT and RT could improve FFS for these high-risk patients.
