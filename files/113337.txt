Efficacy of Multi-waved Locked System Laser Versus Cold Compression Therapy on Breast Cancer-related Lymphoedema
This study was conducted:

* To investigate the effect of MLS Laser in the management of patients with unilateral BCRL regarding lymphatic flow, volumetric measurement and HRQL assessment.
* To investigate the effect of CCT in the management of patients with unilateral BCRL regarding lymphatic flow, volumetric measurement and HRQL assessment.
* To compare the effect of MLS Laser versus CCT in the management of patients with unilateral BCRL regarding lymphatic flow, volumetric measurement and HRQL assessment.

DEVICE: Multi-waved Locked System Laser|DEVICE: Cold Compression therapy|OTHER: complete decongestive therapy
Evaluation of the change in lymphatic flow using lymphoscintigraphy pre and post treatment, Interpretation of the results of the lymphoscintigraphy and using the contralateral limb as a healthy control with normal lymphatic function can differentiate the lymphatic flow abnormalities into 7 stages, Baseline|The change of Volumetric measurement of the arm pre and post treatment, Precise arm volume measurement is capital in the follow-up of breast cancer patients, as an early detection of BCRL can reduce the incidence of irreversible stages, Baseline
The change of Lymphedema Life Impact Scale scores pre and post treatment, The Lymphedema Life Impact Scale is a lymphedema-specific tool which measures physical (pain, heaviness, tightness, strength...), psychosocial (body image, socializing, intimate relations...) and functional (duties at home, duties at work, recreational activities...) impact upon the patients' lives, the maximum score is 68 while the minimum score is 0, where a higher score indicates a worse outcome., Baseline
