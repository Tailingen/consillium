Capecitabine Versus S-1 in Elderly Advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC): Randomized Trial
A significant proportion of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) occurs in individuals 65 years of age and older. In addition, patient delay in seeking care for symptoms results in diagnosis at a more advanced stage than that seen in younger individuals. However, clinical trials on gastric cancer rarely have been available to the elderly. Recently oral 5-FU pro-drugs, which have been reported to have clinically significant response rates and survival with mild or negligible toxicities, have been widely used for the patients with AGC. However, few studies have been conducted in elderly patients.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: Capecitabine
Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Progressive disease (PD), \>20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Insufficient change to qualify for PR or PD

Response rate is defined as the proportion of patients who showed OR., Up to 2 years
Number of Patients With Adverse Events, Per National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0, up to 2 years, Up to 2 years
