Dose Optimization Study of Idelalisib in Follicular Lymphoma
The primary objective of this study is to establish a safe and effective dosing regimen of idelalisib in participants with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have no other therapeutic options.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Idelalisib
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants who achieve a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). PR criteria: No evidence of new disease, a ≥50% decrease from baseline in sum of products of diameters (SPD) of index lesions, no increase in non-index disease, no increase in liver/spleen size and no new liver/spleen enlargement. Persistence of bone marrow involvement in a participant who meets other criteria for CR based on the disappearance of all nodal and extra-nodal masses. CR criteria: No evidence of new disease, regression of all index nodal lesions to normal size (≤1.5 cm in longest dimension (LD) for large nodes and ≤1.0 cm in LD, ≤1.0 cm in longest perpendicular dimension (LPD) for small nodes), regression to normal of all nodal non-index disease, disappearance of all detectable extra-nodal index and non-index disease, normal spleen and liver size, no new liver/spleen enlargement, morphologically negative bone marrow., Randomization up to end of treatment (maximum duration: 73.5 months)|Number of Participants With Grade 4 or Higher Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs were defined as 1 or both of any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug, or any AEs with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than the last exposure date after permanent discontinuation of the study drug. TEAEs severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0. Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Fatal. Participants were counted at the highest AE grade experienced., First dose date up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (maximum 64.6 months)
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR: interval from first documentation of CR/PR to earlier of first documentation of disease progression (PD) by independent review committee (IRC)/death from any cause. PR:No evidence of new disease,≥50% decrease from baseline in SPD of index lesions,no increase in non-index disease, no increase in liver/spleen size,no new liver/spleen enlargement; Persistence of bone marrow involvement in participant who meets other CR criteria. CR: No evidence of new disease,regression of all index nodal lesions to normal size (large nodes:≤1.5 cm in LD;small nodes:≤1.0 cm in LD,≤1.0 cm in LPD), regression to normal of all nodal non-index disease,disappearance of all detectable extra-nodal index,non-index disease,normal spleen and liver size, no new liver/spleen enlargement; PD: New node of \>1.5 cm or \>1.0 to ≤1.5 cm in LD, \>1.0 cm in LPD, new/unequivocal reappearance of resolved extra-nodal lesion,new non-index disease,increase by 50% in SPD of index lesions,LD of individual node/extra-nodal mass., From first documentation of CR or PR until PD or death from any cause (maximum duration: 73.5 months)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Week 24, ORR by Week 24 is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a PR or CR by Week 24.

PR criteria: No evidence of new disease, a 50% decrease from baseline in SPD of index lesions, no increase in non-index disease, no increase in liver/spleen size and no new liver/spleen enlargement. CR criteria: No evidence of new disease, regression of all index nodal lesions to normal size (≤1.5 cm in LD for large nodes and ≤1.0 cm in LD, ≤1.0 cm in LPD for small nodes), regression to normal of all nodal non-index disease, disappearance of all detectable extra-nodal index and non-index disease, normal spleen and liver size, no new liver/spleen enlargement, morphologically negative bone marrow., First dose date up to Week 24|Number of Participants With Any TEAE, Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs, Serious TEAEs, Idelalisib-related TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Interruption or Discontinuation of Idelalisib, TEAEs were defined as 1 or both of any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug, or any AEs with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than the last exposure date after permanent discontinuation of the study drug. TEAEs severity was graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Fatal. Participants are counted at the highest AE grade experienced., First dose date up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (maximum 64.6 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities, Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality was defined as an increase of at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline at any time postbaseline up to and including the date of last study drug dose plus 30 days. Laboratory abnormalities included hematology and serum chemistry parameters. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 for severity as Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), or Grade 4 (life threatening). The number of participants with any post-baseline abnormal laboratory value in Grade 1-4 categories are reported., First dose date up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (maximum 64.6 months)|Time to Onset of Adverse Events of Interest (AEIs), Time to onset of AEIs is defined as the interval (in months) from the start of idelalisib treatment to the first documentation of start of AEI. AEIs included grade ≥ 3 diarrhea/colitis, rash, febrile neutropenia, infection, and any grade of: Pneumonitis, bowel perforation, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and organizing pneumonia., First dose date up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (maximum 64.6 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval (in months) from randomization to the earlier of the first documentation of PD by IRC or death from any cause. PD criteria: New node of \>1.5 cm or \>1.0 cm to ≤1.5 cm in LD, \>1.0 cm in LPD, new/unequivocal reappearance of resolved extra-nodal lesion, new non-index disease, increase by 50% in SPD of index lesions, LD of individual node/extra-nodal mass., Randomization up to PD or death from any cause (maximum duration: 73.5 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval (in months) from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization up to death from any cause (maximum duration: 73.5 months)|Trough Plasma Concentration of Idelalisib, Predose on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, and 48|Peak Plasma Concentration of Idelalisib, 1.5 hours postdose on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, and 48
