Study Testing the Biologic Activity and Safety of a Immunotherapeutic in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Stage Kidney Cancer in Combination With a Marketed Renal Cell Carcinoma Treatment
Study to investigate an anticancer cellular immunotherapeutic, AGS-003, when used in combination with sunitinib in subjects with previously untreated advanced stage RCC.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: AGS-003|DRUG: Sunitinib
Clinical antitumor activity will be assessed as an objective tumor response as defined by RECIST. Tumor response is documented using standard definitions of CR and must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met., 24 weeks
The monitoring of clinical activity, immune response and safety across multiple doses., 24 weeks
The purpose of this study is to investigate an anticancer immunotherapeutic, AGS-003, when used in combination with sunitinib (the treatment regimen) in a single-stage, Phase II design in subjects with previously untreated advanced stage RCC after nephrectomy/excisional biopsy/metastasectomy. AGS-003 is formulated using mature DCs co-electroporated with CD40L IVT RNA and autologous total tumor RNA
