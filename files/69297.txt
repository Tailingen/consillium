BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CD19 CAR T-cells
Protocol Feasibility, To describe feasibility of delivering point-of-care manufactured CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy to patients with relapsed / refractory B-lineage leukaemia / lymphoma by assessing number and percentage of enrolled patients who have successful manufacturing of CAR T-cell product, and number and percentage of enrolled patients who go on to receive the CAR T-cell product., 3 years
Overall Response Rate, To evaluate percentage of patients with complete response or partial response at 28 days, 3 months and 6 months post-infusion of the CD19-directed CAR T-cells., 6 months|Toxicity Evaluations, To evaluate overall incidence (percentage of infused patients) of toxicities post-infusion of CAR T-cells, in particular cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, and percentage with Grade 3 and above CRS and neurotoxicity following ASTCT definition and severity grading, and other toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 6 months
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II feasibility study to deliver point-of-care manufactured CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy to patients with relapsed / refractory B-lineage leukaemia / lymphoma.

The study consists of the following phases:

1. Screening phase: Eligibility; enrolment
2. Preparatory phase: Bridging therapy (if required); leukapheresis; CAR T manufacturing; lymphodepletion.
3. Treatment phase: Infusion of single dose of anti-CD19 CAR T-cells
4. Follow-up Phase: Efficacy and safety monitoring up to 24 months
