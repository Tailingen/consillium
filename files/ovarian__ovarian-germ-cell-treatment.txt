Incidence and Mortality
Germ cell tumors of the ovary are uncommon but aggressive tumors, seen most often
in young women and adolescent girls. These tumors are frequently unilateral and are
generally curable if found and treated early.  The use of combination chemotherapy
after initial surgery has dramatically improved the prognosis for many women
with these tumors.[

]
Dysgerminomas
One series found a 10-year survival  rate of 88.6% following conservative surgery for patients with dysgerminoma confined to the ovary; smaller than 10 cm in size; with
an intact, smooth capsule unattached to other organs; and without ascites.[
4
]  A
number of patients had one or more successful pregnancies following unilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.[
4
]  Even patients with incompletely resected
dysgerminoma can be rendered disease free following chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)
or a combination of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin.[
5
]
Other Germ Cell Tumors
A report of 35 cases of germ cell tumors, half of which were
advanced stage or recurrent or progressive disease, demonstrated a 97%
sustained remission at 10 months to 54 months after the start of a combination of BEP.[
1
] 
Two Gynecologic Oncology Group trials reported that
89 of 93 patients with stage I, II, or III disease who had completely
resected tumors were disease free after three cycles of BEP.[
1
,
3
]
Endodermal sinus tumors of the ovary are
particularly aggressive.  A review of the literature in 1979 prior to the
widespread use of combination chemotherapy found only 27% of 96 patients with
stage I endodermal sinus tumor alive at 2 years after diagnosis.  More than 50% of the patients died within a year
of diagnosis.
Patients with mature
teratomas usually experience long-term survival, but survival for patients with immature teratomas after surgery only is related to
the grade of the tumor, especially its neural elements.  In a series of 58
patients with immature teratoma treated before the modern chemotherapeutic era,
recurrence was reported in 18% of the patients with grade 1 disease, 37% of the patients with
grade 2 disease, and 70% of the patients with grade 3 disease.[
6
]  Similar findings have
been reported by others.[
7
]
Some studies have found that size and histology were the major factors determining
prognosis for patients with malignant mixed germ cell tumors of the ovary.[
6
,
8
] 
Prognosis was poor for patients with large tumors when more than one-third of the tumor was
composed of endodermal sinus elements, choriocarcinoma, or grade 3 immature
teratoma.  When the tumor was smaller than 10 cm in
diameter, the prognosis was good, regardless of the composition of the tumor.[

Stage Information for Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors
In This Section
The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) Staging
In the absence of obvious metastatic disease, accurate staging of germ cell
tumors of the ovary requires laparotomy with careful examination of the following:
Entire
diaphragm.
Both paracolic gutters.
Pelvic nodes on the side of the ovarian
tumor.
The para-aortic lymph nodes.
The omentum.
The contralateral ovary
should be carefully examined and biopsied if necessary.  Ascitic fluid should
be examined cytologically.  If ascites is not present, it is important to
obtain peritoneal washings before the tumor is manipulated.  In patients with
dysgerminoma, lymphangiography or computed tomography is indicated if the
pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were not carefully examined at the time of surgery.
Although not required for formal staging, it is desirable to obtain serum
levels of alpha fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin as
soon as the diagnosis is established because persistence of these markers in the
serum after surgery indicates unresected tumor.
The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) Staging
The  FIGO and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) have designated staging to define ovarian germ cell tumors; the FIGO system is most commonly used.[

Treatment Option Overview for Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors
Treatment options for patients with ovarian germ cell tumors include:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy.
Radiation therapy.
High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant (under clinical evaluation).
Patients may be treated with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
All patients except those with stage I, grade I immature teratoma and stage IA
dysgerminoma require postoperative chemotherapy.  With platinum-based
combination chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with endodermal sinus
tumors, immature teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas, and mixed
tumors containing one or more of these elements has improved dramatically.[
1
] As
new and more effective drugs are developed, many of these patients will be
candidates for newer clinical trials.

Treatment of Stage I Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors
In This Section
Dysgerminomas
Other Germ Cell Tumors
Current Clinical Trials
Dysgerminomas
Treatment options for stage I dysgerminomas include:
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymphangiography or computed tomography (CT).
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by observation.
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
For patients with stage I dysgerminoma, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
conserving the uterus and opposite ovary is accepted treatment of the younger
patient who wants to preserve fertility or a pregnancy. 
Postoperative lymphangiography or CT is indicated before
treatment decisions are made for patients who have not had careful surgical and
pathological examination of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes during surgery.
Patients who have been completely staged and have stage IA tumors may be
observed carefully after surgery without adjuvant treatment.  About 15% to 25%
of these patients will relapse, but they can be treated successfully at the time of recurrence with a
high likelihood of cure.
Incompletely staged patients or those with higher
stage tumors should probably receive adjuvant treatment.  Options include
radiation therapy or chemotherapy.  A disadvantage of the former is loss of
fertility resulting from ovarian failure.  Experience with adjuvant chemotherapy is
limited, but considering the effectiveness of chemotherapy in tumors other than
dysgerminoma and in advanced stage dysgerminoma, adjuvant chemotherapy is likely to be very
effective and to allow recovery of reproductive potential in patients with an
intact ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus.[

Other Germ Cell Tumors
Treatment options for patients with other stage I germ cell tumors include:
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy.
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by observation.
For patients with stage I germ cell tumors, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
should be performed when fertility is to be preserved.  For all patients with tumors other
than pure dysgerminoma and low-grade (grade I) immature teratoma, chemotherapy
is  usually given postoperatively, although a series demonstrated excellent
survival for patients with all types of stage I tumors managed by surveillance, reserving
chemotherapy for cases in which postsurgery recurrence is documented.[

Level of evidence C1
]
There is considerable experience with a combination
of vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) given in an adjuvant
setting. However, combinations containing cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin
(BEP) are now preferred because of a lower relapse rate and shorter treatment
time.[
3
]  While a prospective comparison of VAC versus BEP has not been
performed, in well-staged patients with completely
resected tumors, relapse is rare following platinum-based
chemotherapy.[
3
]  However, the disease will recur in about 25% of well-staged
patients treated with 6 months of VAC.[
4
]
Evidence suggests that second-look laparotomy is not beneficial in patients     
with initially completely resected tumors who receive cisplatin-based           
adjuvant treatment.[

Current Clinical Trials
Dysgerminomas
Treatment options for patients with stage II dysgerminomas include:
Total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
Unilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy.
Clinical trials.
For patients with stage II dysgerminoma, total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are usually performed.  For the
younger patient who wants to preserve fertility, a unilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered standard therapy, depending on the age of the patient, and  adjuvant
chemotherapy should be given.
These patients should receive adjuvant treatment.  Options include radiation
therapy or chemotherapy.  A disadvantage of the former is loss of fertility resulting from  ovarian failure.  Experience with adjuvant chemotherapy is limited, but
considering the effectiveness of chemotherapy in tumors other than dysgerminoma
and its effectiveness in advanced-stage dysgerminoma, adjuvant chemotherapy is likely to be effective and to allow
recovery of reproductive potential in patients with an intact ovary, fallopian tube, and
uterus.  Thus, adjuvant chemotherapy with the combination of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) has replaced
radiation therapy except in the rare patient in whom chemotherapy is not
considered appropriate.
Other Germ Cell Tumors
Treatment options for patients with other stage II germ cell tumors include:
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy.
Second-look laparotomy.
Clinical trials.
For patients with stage II germ cell tumors other than pure dysgerminoma,
unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be performed when fertility is to be
preserved.  Although there is considerable experience with the combination of vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC), especially when given in an
adjuvant setting, BEP is more effective.[
1
-
3
]  Patients who do not respond to a
cisplatin-based combination may still attain a durable remission with VAC as
salvage therapy.[
4
]  Recurrence after three courses of BEP as adjuvant therapy is
rare.[
4
]  All patients who do not respond to standard therapy are candidates
for clinical trials.  When there is residual disease or elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein or human chorionic gonadotropin after maximal surgical debulking, three or four courses of BEP combination
chemotherapy are indicated.[

]
Evidence suggests that second-look laparotomy is not beneficial in patients
with initially completely resected tumors who receive cisplatin-based adjuvant
treatment.[
6
]  Second-look surgery may be of benefit for a minority of patients
whose tumor was not completely resected at the initial surgical procedure and
who had teratomatous elements in their primary tumor.[

of residual masses detected by clinical examination, by radiographic
procedures, or at re-exploration should be undertaken since reversion to germ
cell tumor has been described.

Dysgerminomas
Treatment options for patients with stage III dysgerminomas include:
Total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy.
Clinical trials.
For patients with stage III dysgerminoma, total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are recommended with removal of as much gross
tumor as can be done safely without resection of portions of the urinary tract
or large segments of the small or large bowel.  Patients who want to preserve
fertility may be treated with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy if chemotherapy
is to be used.[

Combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) can cure most of these patients.  In a report of results from two Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
trials, 19 of 20 patients with incompletely resected tumors who were treated
with BEP or cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) were disease free at a median follow-up of 26 months.[
1
]  When
there is bulky residual disease, it is common to give three  to four  courses of a
cisplatin-containing combination such as PVB or BEP.[
6
-
8
]  A randomized study
in testicular cancer has shown that bleomycin is an essential component of the
BEP regime when only three courses are given.[
9
]  Because chemotherapy with
BEP appears to be less sterilizing than wide-field radiation, combination
chemotherapy is the preferred treatment in the patient who wants to preserve fertility.[

Treatment options for patients with other stage III germ cell tumors include:
Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Second-look laparotomy.
Clinical trials.
For patients with stage III germ cell tumors other than pure dysgerminoma,
total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended
with removal of as much tumor in the abdomen and pelvis as can be done safely
without resection of portions of the urinary tract or large segments of the small

Treatment of Recurrent Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors
In This Section
Dysgerminomas
Other Germ Cell Tumors
Current Clinical Trials
Dysgerminomas
Treatment options for patients with recurrent dysgerminomas include:
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been used effectively for patients with
recurrent dysgerminoma with and without adjuvant radiation therapy.[
1
]
Patients with recurrent pure
dysgerminoma of the ovary are candidates for clinical trials.  Some consideration should be
given to the use of high-dose regimens with rescue.
Other Germ Cell Tumors
Treatment options for patients with other recurrent germ cell tumors include:
Patients with recurrent germ cell tumors of the ovary other than pure
dysgerminoma should be treated with chemotherapy, the type of which is
determined by previous treatment.[

]  Radiation therapy is not effective in
this setting.  Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is effective.[

Patients who do not respond to a cisplatin-based combination may still attain a
durable remission with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide and cisplatin as salvage therapy.[

] 
Newer potential treatments include an ifosfamide combination [

] or high-dose
chemotherapy and autologous marrow rescue.[

]  Although the role of secondary
cytoreductive surgery for patients with recurrent or progressive ovarian germ
cell tumors remains controversial, it may have some benefit for a select group
of patients, particularly those with immature teratoma.[

]  After maximal
effort for surgical cytoreduction, chemotherapy should be considered.
Patients with recurrent germ cell tumors of the ovary are candidates for clinical trials.  Some consideration should be
given to the use of high-dose regimens with rescue.
