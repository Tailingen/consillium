An Experimental Study to Compare Treatment Response and Toxicities of Concurrent Chemoradiation With Weekly Cisplatin and Three Weekly Cisplatin in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer.
The aim of this study is to compare treatment responses and toxicities of concurrent chemo-radiation with weekly and three weekly Cisplatin in locally advanced Head \& Neck Cancer. Half of the participants received Cisplatin (40 mg/m2) weekly with radiotherapy, while the other half received Cisplatin (100 mg/m2) thrice weekly with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy continued five days per week for six and half weeks.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin 40 mg/m2|DRUG: Cisplatin 100 mg/m2
Loco-regional tumor control after completion of treatment, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was used to measure outcome:

1. Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
2. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.
3. Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.
4. Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., 6 months|Treatment related toxicities during and after treatment, National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Advanced Events (version 4.03) was used measure toxicities., 8 months
