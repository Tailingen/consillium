Sirolimus in Kidney Transplant Patients With Squamous Cell Skin Carcinoma
Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) have a 3-5x increased occurrence of cancer in contrast to the general population with basal and squamous cell skin cancer. The use of immunosuppressant or anti-rejection drugs that are needed after SOTR is known to increase the risk of developing certain kinds of cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out how well Sirolimus (also known as Rapamune) works at treating squamous cell carcinoma in renal transplant patients.
Squamous Cell Skin Carcinoma
DRUG: Sirolimus
Measure of Squamous Cell Skin Carcinoma in Patients, Baseline: Measuring of squamous cell skin carcinoma, Week 5: Measuring and surgical removal of squamous cell skin cancer with microscopic evaluation, and in 1 year., Baseline, time of surgical removal (5 weeks) and 1 year.
Evaluation of Skin Tumor for Squamous Cell Skin Carcinoma, Tumor will be analyzed at baseline and time of surgical removal by both laboratory and microscopic testing., At baseline and time of surgical removal (5 weeks).
This is a Phase II randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of Sirolimus in treating and preventing squamous cell skin cancer carcinoma using a Simon's 2-stage design. As part of the study, after the biopsy results of the skin cancer show squamous cell carcinoma and consent had been obtain, the participant will begin taking Sirolimus. The calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) will be discontinued once the transplant doctors find that the participants Sirolimus is therapeutic by checking blood tests once a week x 3 weeks. Approximately 5 weeks after starting Sirolimus, the squamous cell skin cancer will be removed by a surgeon. Participant next follow up visit for the study is scheduled one year post-operatively. .The study will look at your squamous cell skin cancer under the microscope to see if sirolimus had any effect at treating your squamous cell skin cancer.
