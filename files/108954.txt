A Phase I Study of SIM0388 in Participants With Malignant Ascites.
Malignant Ascites is a common complication of malignant tumor. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of intraperitoneal perfusion with Docetaxel Polymeric Micelles (SIM0388) for injection in patients with malignant ascites
Malignant Ascites
DRUG: SIM0388|DRUG: SIM0388
Dose escalation:Dose limited toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), DLT observation period (up to 35 days)|Dose escalation phase: Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse events will be assessed by investigator(s) according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Dose expansion phase：ORRa(Objective response rate in ascites), Ascites ORRa assessed according to WHO criteria, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Dose expansion phase：TTPa (Time to progress in ascites), Ascites TTPa assessed according to WHO criteria, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Dose expansion phase：PuFS (Puncture/drainage -free survival), PuFS, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
The study starts with a dose escalation part followed by a dose expansion part. The primary objective of the dose escalation part is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SIM0388 peritoneal perfusion, and determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose(s) (RD) of SIM0388 peritoneal perfusion.

The primary objective of the dose expansion part is to evaluate the efficacy of SIM0388 intraperitoneal perfusion in the treatment of malignant ascites.
