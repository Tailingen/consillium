A Study for CTC Expression and cfDNA/RNA Assessment in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this research is to learn if the CellSearch Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) test can help doctors in making decisions about treatment and monitoring of breast cancer. The test consists of diagnostic CTC counts (enumeration) and expression of biomarkers Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2), Estrogen Receptor (ER), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cell free DNA/RNA (cfDNA/RNA) analysis.

A prospective, multicenter, observational study of CellSearch CTC enumeration, CTC HER2, ER, and PD-L1 expression, and MSearch cfDNA/RNA results in subjects with histologically proven MBC. Treatment for MBC will be chosen and performed by treating physicians/providers. Eligible subjects will be enrolled after signing the ICF. Subjects will receive CTC enumeration, CTC HER2, ER, PD-L1 expression and, and MSearch cfDNA/RNA assessments at baseline and first restaging as part of Standard of Care (SoC). Subjects will receive any additional cfDNA/RNA assessments as part of research collection. For all subjects 4 to 6 tubes will be collected at baseline and minimally before the first restaging visit. For any subsequent restaging visits a total of 3 to 4 tubes will be collected.
