Educational Intervention for the Promotion of Knowledge and Preventive Health Behaviors Related to Personal Air Pollution Exposure, The Air Study
This clinical trial will conduct an educational intervention to promote knowledge of and preventive health behaviors related to personal air pollution exposure. Air pollution is n ubiquitous environmental exposure that is associated with harmful health effects including lung cancer. The educational intervention is comprised of 2 educational videos that include information regarding air pollution, health effects, and personal preventive health behaviors to reduce air pollution exposure and the use of a wearable air pollution sensor. The knowledge gained from this study may inform future research that will be designed to promote awareness of air pollution and its health effects.

OTHER: Educational Intervention|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Changes in knowledge regarding air pollution, Will calculate the proportion of the items that were answered correctly. McNemar's tests will be used to calculate differences in the proportion of participants answering air pollution knowledge items correctly at baseline and at week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in air pollution preventive health behaviors, Will calculate summary scores for air pollution preventive health behaviors and paired t-test to determine intervention effectiveness at baseline and at week 5., At baseline and week 5
Changes in perceived barriers, Summary scores for perceived barriers (guided by the Health Belief Model) will be calculated from participant questionnaire responses by summing the scores across the relevant scale. Paired t-tests will determine changes in perceived barriers at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in perceived benefits, Summary scores for perceived benefits (guided by the Health Belief Model) will be calculated from participant questionnaire responses by summing the scores across the relevant scale. Paired t-tests will determine changes in perceived benefits at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in perceived susceptibility, Summary scores for perceived susceptibility (guided by the Health Belief Model) will be calculated from participant questionnaire responses by summing the scores across the relevant scale. Paired t-tests will determine changes in perceived susceptibility at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in perceived severity, Summary scores for perceived severity (guided by the Health Belief Model) will be calculated from participant questionnaire responses by summing the scores across the relevant scale. Paired t-tests will determine changes in perceived severity at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in self-efficacy, Summary scores for self-efficacy (guided by the Health Belief Model) will be calculated from participant questionnaire responses by summing the scores across the relevant scale. Paired t-tests will determine changes in self-efficacy at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in cues to action, Will calculate frequencies for each cue to action (guided by the Health Belief Model). McNemar's tests will be used to calculate differences in the proportion of participants regarding each cue to action at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5|Changes in air pollutant levels measured using the Flow 2 personal air quality sensor, Paired t-tests will determine changes in air pollutant levels at baseline and week 2 vs. week 4 and week 5., At baseline and week 2 vs. week 4 and week 5|Intervention feasibility (accessibility), Will report descriptive statistics for intervention accessibility based on responses to the relevant questionnaire items at week 5., At week 5|Intervention feasibility (acceptability), Will report descriptive statistics for intervention acceptability based on responses to the relevant questionnaire items at week 5., At week 5|Intervention feasibility (demand), Will report descriptive statistics for intervention demand based on responses to the relevant questionnaire items at week 5., At week 5|Intervention feasibility (uptake, sensor upload completion), Will report descriptive statistics the proportion of participants completing sensor uploads., At baseline through week 5|Intervention feasibility (uptake, educational video viewing), Will report descriptive statistics for the proportion of viewing educational videos at week 3., At week 3|Intervention feasibility (uptake, questionnaire completion), Will report descriptive statistics for the proportion of completing the questionnaires at baseline and week 5., At baseline and week 5
OUTLINE:

Participants watch 2 educational videos during week 3 regarding air pollution, health effects, and personal preventive health behaviors to reduce air pollution exposure. Participants complete questionnaires at weeks 1 and 5.
