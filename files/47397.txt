This first-in-human (FIH) study consists of a placebo-controlled, sequential, dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 7HP349 following single and multiple oral dose administration to healthy male subjects, with a separate, open-label food effect cohort at the optimal pharmacokinetic dose (OPD). The study will be carried out in 3 parts.

Part A: This is a placebo-controlled, within-cohort randomized, double-blind, sequential, single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and PK of 7HP349 following administration of single oral doses in healthy male subjects, and to define the OPD of 7HP349.

Part B: This is a placebo-controlled, within-cohort randomized, double-blind, sequential, multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and PK of 7HP349 following up to 5 once daily oral doses in healthy male subjects.

Part C: This is a randomized, open label, two-treatment, three-period, crossover study to evaluate the effect of the fed or fasting prandial state on the single dose PK of 7HP349.
