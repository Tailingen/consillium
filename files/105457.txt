Combination of the Hedgehog Inhibitor, LDE225, With Etoposide and Cisplatin in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC)
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of study drug LDE225 at different dose levels. The investigators will be testing three different dose levels and the dose will depend on when the patients enters the study and which dose is being tested at that time. At the same time, the investigators will also be testing the safety of LDE225 in combination with etoposide and cisplatin.

The investigators also want to learn more about how to manage side effects the patient may develop during chemotherapy. Cancer patients may develop side effects during treatment, such as nausea, pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, or shortness of breath. These symptoms may be due to the cancer itself, or due to treatments. Doctors and nurses often ask patients about their symptoms, because an important part of cancer treatment is to make patients feel as well as possible. If patients do not feel well, the investigators may need to change the way they are treating the patients or prescribe therapies that will decrease their symptoms.

The best way to find out how the patient is feeling is to ask them directly. The investigators are interested in developing new ways to ask patients about how they are feeling, using the Internet. A special new website called STAR ("Symptom Tracking and Reporting for Patients") has been developed to help patients record this information, so that their doctors and nurses can review it during clinic appointments. This study is designed to help us see if STAR is a helpful way for us to keep track of information about patients' symptoms and quality of life. The information from STAR is going to be placed on a very secure Internet site. This will provide your doctor with all of the information needed to determine if this drug combination is safe enough for you and whether to continue it.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: LDE225, Etoposide and Cisplatin
MTD, A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be used in order to determine MTD. Two proposed dose levels of LDE225 will be tested with etoposide and cisplatin (400 mg and 800 mg; one additional dose (200 mg) is reserved for de-escalation. Patients will be evaluated for DLT after 2 cycles on therapy., 1 year
safety, tolerability, All patients who receive at least one dose of LDE225 with etoposide and cisplatin will be included in the descriptive analysis of safety and toxicity. Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0 and tabulated individually., 1 year|pharmacokinetic profile, Blood samples for the determination of LDE225 pharmacokinetics (PK) and its active metabolite(s) will be collected from all patients during the study. Blood samples will be collected prior to the administration of LDE225 on day 1 of cycles 1 through 9., 1 year|efficacy, Patients on study will be followed and assessed for response as per RECIST 1.1. Complete and partial response must be confirmed by a subsequent tumor assessment. Unconfirmed partial response will be classified as stable disease., 1 year|patient-reported outcomes (toxicity-related symptoms), According to CTCAE version 4.0 using wireless touchscreen laptop computers in the outpatient clinics via the MSKCC STAR system and evaluate the extent to which clinicians will concur with these and how clinicians will use this information for dose-finding in a phase I clinical trial., 2 years
