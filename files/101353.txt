Study of Pembrolizumab and Ramucirumab in Pts With Progressive TCC After Treatment With an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor
This study is designed to evaluate response and survival of treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab and ramucirumab in patients with progressive metastatic TCC after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab and Ramucirumab
Overall response rate (ORR), The objective overall response rate (ORR) is the proportion of enrolled patients who have received any amount of either study drug, have at least 1 post baseline tumor image, and achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR will be assessed based on RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST., Up to 24 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment until the date of the first observed radiographically documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier., Up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), including 1- and 2- year survival rates, is determined from the date of first study treatment until death due to any cause. If the patient was alive at the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis (or was lost to follow-up), OS will be censored on the last date the patient was known to be alive., Up to 24 months
This is a phase II, non-randomized single center study designed to evaluate response and survival of treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab and ramucirumab in patients with progressive metastatic TCC after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

The primary and secondary objectives are as follows:

Primary:

* Objective: To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) in patients treated with pembrolizumab and ramucirumab
* Hypothesis: The ORR will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone

Secondary Objectives:

* Objective: To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with pembrolizumab and ramucirumab
* Hypothesis: The PFS will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone
* Objective: To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients treated with pembrolizumab and ramucirumab
* Hypothesis: The OS will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone
* Objective: To evaluate differences in ORR, PFS and OS in patients treated with pembrolizumab and ramucirumab stratified by Bellmunt criteria.
* Hypothesis: Patients with high Bellmunt criteria scores will have lower rates of ORR, PFS and OS.
