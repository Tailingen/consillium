Linifanib in Treating Patients With Advanced, Refractory Colorectal Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well Linifanib works in treating patients with advanced, refractory colorectal cancer expressing k-Ras mutations. Linifanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Overall Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) With a Target of at Least 15%, Per Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v. 1.1: measurable lesions: complete response (CR) disappearance of target lesions, partial response (PR) \> 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) \> 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions, stable disease (SD) neither sufficient decrease nor increase of the sum of smallest sum of the LD of target lesions. Defined as the CR + PR recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence, the exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported., Baseline and every 8 weeks, up to 2 years
Progression-free Survival, Estimated probable duration of life without disease progression, from on-study date to earlier of progression date or date of death from any cause, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring. Disease progression is defined under RECIST v1.1 as \>=20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions., Every 3 months, up to 2 years|Overall Survival, Estimated probable duration of life from on-study date to date of death from any cause, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring., Every 3 months, up to 2 years|Number of Patients With Each Worst-Grade Toxicity, Count of patients according to the worst-grade toxicity experienced by each, where worst-grade toxicity is per NCI common toxicity criteria: grade 1= mild; grade 2 = moderate; grade 3 = severe; grade 4 = life-threatening; grade 5 = death

Assessed: days 1 \&15 of cycle 1; day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle; at 30-day follow-up for two years, date on-study up to 2 years following final dose of study
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To achieve an overall response rate of 15% or more.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine progression free survival. II. Determine overall survival. III. Evaluate toxicity profile of ABT 869 (linifanib) in this patient population.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive Linifanib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
