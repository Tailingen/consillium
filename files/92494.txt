Neoadjuvant Tremelimumab and Durvalumab With Gem/Cis in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to test feasibility and safety of the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin as a neoadjuvant treatment bridge patients to a curative resection in treatment naïve borderline resectable, or resectable with high risk for recurrence intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* What is the rate of conversion of unresectable tumor to resectable cancer?
* What are the side effects of this treatment combination?

Participants will undergo an initial tumor biopsy, imaging and laboratory studies prior to starting treatment with durvalumab, tremelimumab, gemcitabine and cisplatin. Participants will continue for 4 cycles and if the tumor is found to be resectable then they will undergo surgical resection. If the tumor is unresectable (can't be surgically removed) after 4 cycles, then participants will receive 4 more cycles and repeated imaging. If the tumor remains unresectable then the participant will be treated with capecitabine for up to 8 cycles and durvalumab for up to 12 months.
Borderline Resectable Carcinoma|Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection
Rate of Conversion from unresectable to resectable, Rate of conversion of unresectable tumor to resectable cancer after neoadjuvant durvalumab + tremelimumab + gemcitabine + cisplatin after 4 or 8 cycles. Surgical evaluation will be done in joint by institutional radiology and hepatobiliary surgery using clinical data (CT/MRI imaging, patient performance status, labs, etc.) If among the evaluable 24 patients, 9 or more (45%) patients undergo such conversion, the investigational treatment will be considered as promising/feasible. The resectable rate will be estimated with its 95% exact confidence interval., 8 Cycles, 21 day cycles|Incidence of related treatment emergent adverse events, Number of participants with related treatment emergent adverse events, 36 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be estimated with its 95% exact confidence interval based on RECIST v1.1, 36 months|Pathological complete response (pCR), 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier method is used to represent secondary outcome OS., 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Kaplan-Meier method is used to represent secondary outcome of PFS, 36 months|Rate of R0 resection, R0 resection rate will be estimated with its 95% exact confidence interval, 8 Cycles, 21 day cycles|Relapse free survival (RFS), Kaplan-Meier method will be used to analyze RFS, 36 months|Patient Reported outcomes (PRO) decline, As measured by qualify of life changes per EORTC QLQ-BIL-20 questionnaires. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., 8 Cycles, 21 day cycles|Event Free Survival (EFS), 36 months
