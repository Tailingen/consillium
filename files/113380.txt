Association of Genetic Polymorphisms With Docetaxel-based Chemotherapy Toxicities in Chinese Solid Tumor Patients
Taxanes are one of the most active agents in the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors, mainly including paclitaxel and docetaxel. However, variability in toxicity and response remains a major problem for patients receiving taxanes. It is general that there are many factors for individual differences of drugs in clinical application, of which genetic factors accounted for more than 20%. Toxicities of docetaxel, such as myelosuppression, neurotoxicity or mucositis, were evaluated for possible relationship with pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in several candidate gene and genome-wide association studies. Due to the levels of evidence of those studies are low and lack of sufficient research data of Chinese, it has the important significance in studying individual differences of docetaxel in toxicities, through the pharmacogenomics research.

The aim of this study is to evaluating the association genetic polymorphisms with docetaxel-based chemotherapy toxicities in chinese solid tumor patients. By detecting the gene polymorphism, investigators intend to study the pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomics (PK-PG) correlation of docetaxel and provide scientific basis for precise medication guide for people to use docetaxel.

Incidence of severe hematological toxicity, The toxicity induced by docetaxel-based chemotherapy during observation time will be estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.03. Patients with grade 3-4 adverse events will be considered as having severe toxicity. At the end of each cycle (each cycle is 21 days) the grade will be scored. And the severest grade will be recorded and used for analysis. Hematological toxicity includes neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia., At 1 year
Incidence of other severe toxicities, The other toxicities induced by docetaxel-based chemotherapy during observation time, including gastrointestinal toxicity, neurotoxicity etc., will be estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.03. Toxicities with grade 3-4 will be considered as severe toxicity, except for severe neurotoxicity (grade 2-3). At the end of each cycle (each cycle is 21 days) the grade will be scored. And the severest grade will be recorded and used for analysis., At 1 year|Genotyping, Collect blood specimen, then detect genotype by next generation sequencing., Before chemotherapy|The kinds of the metabolites, Determine the metabolic profiles of docetaxel. This outcome is not applicable to patients retrospectively collected., Pre-dose and 6 hours post-dose in the first cycle|Area under the curve [AUC], Determine the AUC of docetaxel and its metabolites. This outcome is not applicable to patients retrospectively collected., Pre-dose and 6 hours post-dose in the first cycle
