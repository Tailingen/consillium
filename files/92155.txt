Study of Endostar Combined With TP Regimen for Esophageal Cancer
a randomized controlled trial of endostar combined with TP regimen(liposomal paclitaxel-carboplatin) for chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(Ⅱ-Ⅲ)
Patients With Esophageal Cancer(Ⅱ-Ⅲ)
DRUG: endostar+chemoradiotherapy|OTHER: chemoradiotherapy
objective response rate(ORR), complete response(CR)+partial response(PR) according to RECIST 1.1, Time Frame: approximately 18 months|progression-free survival(PFS), progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of first document disease progression or death from any cause, Time Frame: approximately 36 months
adverse event(AE), adverse event according to NCI CTCAE V4.0, Time Frame: approximately 36 months|overall survival (OS), overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, Time Frame: approximately over 3-5 years
This study was a controlled clinical trial.A total of 402 patients with pathologically confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma would be enrolled.Patients were randomly divided into two group ,with 201 in the treatment group and 201 in the control group.The treatment group was treated with endostar,chemotherapy (liposomal paclitaxel-carboplatin)and concurrent radiotherapy.The control group was treated with chemotherapy (liposomal paclitaxel-carboplatin)and concurrent radiotherapy .The efficiency and safety would be evaluated. The objective response rate and progress free survival would be analyzed.This data of this study might provide a more effective treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
