The objective was to evaluate the use and outcomes of robotic proctectomy compared to open and laparoscopic approaches for rectal cancer in the elderly. A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS; 2006-2013) was performed. All cases were restricted to age 70 years old or greater. The incidence of robotic proctectomy from 2006 - 2013 both as a whole as well as divided into approach was analyzed. Each approach was compared for both primary and secondary outcomes.
