Standard Systemic Therapy Combined With High/Low-dose Radiotherapy Plus Toripalimab for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
TORCH-M is a prospective, single-arm, two-cohort, investigator-initiated phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of standard systemic therapy in combination with high/low-dose radiotherapy plus toripalimab in paitents with microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS mCRC). Eligible patients will be assigned to two cohorts according to previous treatment: a first-line cohort A and a second-line cohort B. Patients in both arms will first receive one cycle of standard systemic therapy and toripalimab, followed by high/low-dose radiotherapy, and then continue with standard systemic therapy and toripalimab.The survival benefits, response rates, and adverse effects will be analyzed.
Microsatellite Stable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: standard systemic therapy combined with high/low-dose radiotherapy plus toripalimab
PFS, Defined as the time from initiation of treatment to PD or death from any cause., Up to 2 years
OS, Defined as the time from initiation of treatment to death from any cause., Up to 3 years|ORR, The percentage of patients with objective response in all metastatic lesions., Up to 1 year|DCR, The percentage of patients with disease control in all metastatic lesions. Disease control is defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST after treatment., Up to 1 year|Adverse events, The percentage of patients with treatment-related acute toxicities as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0, from treatment initiation until 90 days upon completion of immunotherapy., Up to 3 years
First-line standard systemic therapies in cohort A include: FOLFOX/XELOX+ bevacizumab, FOLFOX/XELOX+cetuximab (KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT and left-sided tumors only), FOLFIRINOX+ bevacizumab.

Second-line standard systemic therapies in cohort B include: FOLFOX/XELOX+ bevacizumab, FOLFOX/XELOX+cetuximab (KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT), FOLFIRI/irinotecan+raltitrexed/irinotecan/+bevacizumab, FOLFIRI/irinotecan+raltitrexed/irinotecan/+cetuximab (KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT), based on the previous first-line chemotherapy and adverse events.

Toripalimab will be delivered at 240 mg q3w. Radiotherapy regimes include 4-8 fractions of 4-12Gy via SABR or hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and 5 fractions of 0.5-2Gy via LDRT.
