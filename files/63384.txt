First-line Combination Treatment Based on Anlotinib
The aim of this study is to explore safety and therapeutic efficacy of anlotinib combined with erlotinib/chemotherapy/IBI308 as first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients. The primary endpoints of the study are safety and objective response rate (ORR);the secondary endpoints are disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Lung Cancer|Advanced Stage
DRUG: Anlotinib，Erlotinib，IBI308，Pemetrexed，gemcitabine，carboplatin
Safety will be assessed according to common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4.0 (CTC AE 4.0), from initiation of treatment to 90 days after the treatment finished|ORR, Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1). The percentage of patients who achieved CR and PR was defined as objective response rate (ORR), at the time of 8 weeks (2 cycles after treatment)
DCR, Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1) and the percentage of patients who achieved CR, PR and SD was defined as disease control rate (DCR)., at the time of 8 weeks (2 cycles after treatment)|PFS, PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first date of disease progression or death from any cause., From date of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 20 months|OS, OS is calculated from diagnosis to death or last follow-up time., From date of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 50 months
