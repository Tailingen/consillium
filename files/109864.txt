Role of ImmunoscoreÂ® in Stage II-III Colorectal Cancer
The proposed study is a bidirectional analytical study, composed of a retrospective and a prospective cohorts. Patients with stage II - III colorectal cancer undergoing oncological surgery will be analyzed. The study will include a convenience sample of 100 individuals. Fifty cases will be included retrospectively and fifty prospectively.

The study aims to evaluate the benefit of using the Immunoscore test as a predictor of recurrence in patients with operated stage II-III colon tumors. It will also be evaluated the impact on oncologic decision and costs.
