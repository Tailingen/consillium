A Study of Emactuzumab and RO7009789 Administered in Combination in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic activity of emactuzumab and RO7009789 administered in combination in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are not amenable to standard treatment. This study will be conducted in two parts: a dose-finding stage (Part I) and an expansion stage (Part II).
