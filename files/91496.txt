Comparative Study of Diagnostic and Prognosis Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer in Liquid Biopsy
Constitution of a biological collection within the framework of the establishment of a diagnostic, prognostic and active surveillance test for prostate cancer from long non-coding RNA biomarkers, in 3 cohorts of patients, with cancer of the prostate, with suspected cancer without biopsy confirmation or with prostatic hyperplasia and healthy donors.

This biological collection will also be used as a support for further researches on the identification of biomarkers and genetic markers to improve the prognosis and diagnostic management of patients with prostate pathologies.

OTHER: Urine sampling
Extracting extravesicular particles and RNA from urine fluids, Criteria will be a minimum of 10ng of total RNA extracted per sample total RNA sequencing and greater than 10 million unique reads mapping to the Gencode V32 reference genome., Baseline
Extracting extravesicular particles and RNA from blood, Criteria will be a minimum of 10ng of total RNA extracted per sample total RNA sequencing and greater than 10 million unique reads mapping to the Gencode V32 reference genome., Baseline
Multicenter, RIPH 2 study, evaluating on 3 patient cohorts the feasibility of setting up a diagnostic test, prognosis and active surveillance of prostate cancer using long non-coding RNA biomarkers.

For patients agreeing to participate in the study and having signed a consent form, during their routine care consultation in the urology department, will have a blood sample and a urine sample after prostate massage as part of the study, and if necessary, a tissue sample as part of the treatment.

Patients with prostate cancer will be followed as part of their care at least annually, and their follow-up data will be collected as part of the study, without additional sampling.

A blood sample and a urine sample after prostate massage will be carried out during a single consultation at the CIC Henri Mondor for
