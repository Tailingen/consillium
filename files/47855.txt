The Predictive Role of HPV Integration in HSIL and Cervical Cancer
The stratified analysis by the level of HPV DNA integration in HSIL and cervical cancer will be drawn to explore whether the status of HPV integration makes any difference in the progression of cervical cancer. The purpose of the research is to reduce the miss of cervix lesions and prove that HPV integration detection is sensitive in cervical cancer precise screening.
