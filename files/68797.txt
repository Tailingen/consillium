Hypofractionated vs. Conventionally Fractionated Concurrent CRT for LD-SCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine whether hypofractionated concurrent chemo-radiotherapy has the same efficiency as conventionally fractionated concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in Limited Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Carcinoma, Small Cell|Lung Neoplasms
RADIATION: hypofractionated concurrent chemoradiotherapy|RADIATION: conventionally fractionated concurrent chemoradiotherapy
overall survival, 2 years
disease free survival, 2 years|local-regional failure (Incidence of tumor recurrence in local or regional area), Incidence of tumor recurrence in local or regional area, 2 years|toxicity (Incidence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy induced toxicities assessed by CTCAE v 4.0), Incidence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy induced toxicities assessed by CTCAE v 4.0, 2 year
For patients with Limited Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer, 45Gy/15F of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy will be used in experimental arm. While 60Gy/30F of radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy will be used in the control arm. Both survival and toxicity of the two arms will be observed and compared.
