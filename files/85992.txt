Clinical significance was determined by the investigator. Number of participants with clinical significant abnormalities in ECG parameters reported here., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, assessed up to 53.1 weeks

CR: Complete Response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. Partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of target lesions recorded since treatment started., Up to 2 years
