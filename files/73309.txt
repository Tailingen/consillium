A Clinical Research of CD20-Targeted CAR-T in B Cell Malignancies
The main purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of B cell malignancies.
Leukemia|Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CD20-CAR-transduced T cells
Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment, Determine the toxicity profile of the CD20 targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 2 years
In vivo existence of Anti-CD20 CAR-T cells, 2 years|Reaction Rate of Treatment, 2 years
The anti-CD20 antibody has been broadly used in the treatment of B cell malignancies and exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Other targets aimed CAR-T is in need. Therefore we constructed CD20-targeted CAR-T cells and hope to start a clinicaltrial to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted CAR-T cells in the treatment of B cell malignancies.
