Continuous Infusion of Campath-1H Followed by Subcutaneous Injections in Previously Treated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving CAMPATH-1H first as an injection into a vein, then as an injection under the skin can shrink or slow the growth of the disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have already received standard therapy. Another goal is to learn if the side effects related to CAMPATH-1H treatment are less severe by giving the drug first as an injection into a vein then as an injection under the skin.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Campath-1H
Response Rate (CR+PR) to CAMPATH-1H, Rate is number of patients with CR+PR response to CAMPATH-1H where CR is Complete Response and PR is Partial Response RECIST., 3 months
The purposes of this trial are:

1. To evaluate the response rate (CR+PR) to CAMPATH-1H given as continuous infusion followed by subcutaneous injection in patients with previously treated CLL who have failed fludarabine therapy.
2. To evaluate whether CAMPATH-1H, given as a continuous infusion followed by subcutaneous injections to patients with previously treated CLL will improve tolerability of the agent and permit higher doses to be delivered through that route.
3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CAMPATH-1H when given as a 24 hour continuous infusion followed by a subcutaneous injection.
