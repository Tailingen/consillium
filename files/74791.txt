SG1906 for CLDN18.2-Positive Solid Tumors
This is a Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of SG1906 in Patients with CLDN18.2-Positive Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: SG1906
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Number and percentage of AE which is calculated by worst CTCAE grade by CTCAE 5.0, Through study completion, an average of one year|MTD/MAD/ RP2D, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for intravenous (IV) administration of SG1906 in patients with CLDN18.2-positive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.; To preliminarily determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SG1906 given intravenously in patients with CLDN18.2-positive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors., Through study completion, an average of one year
Pharmacokinetics (PK): AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration., Through study completion, an average of one year|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Cmax, Cmax to maximum drug concentration., Through study completion, an average of one year|Pharmacokinetics (PK):limination half-life (T1/2), limination half-life (T1/2) of the drug after administration., Through study completion, an average of one year|receptor occupancy (RO), receptor occupancy (RO) of CD47 on the surface of peripheral blood cells;, Through study completion, an average of one year|Immunogenicity endpoints:, levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (tested in ADA-positive samples only)., Through study completion, an average of one year|Efficacy endpoints:, objective response rate (ORR)., Through study completion, an average of one year
After a screening period of up to 28 days for each study phase, qualified patients will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose of SG1906, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W), until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, starting of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up, death, or end of the study, whichever occurs first.

Phase Ia: Dose-escalation Stage The study population in Phase Ia includes patients with CLDN18.2-positive histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumor who have relapsed after standard therapy, have failed standard therapy, are intolerant to standard therapy, are not eligible for standard therapy, or refuse standard therapy. Phase Ib: Dose-expansion Stage The study population in this phase will include patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed CLDN18.2-positive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic G/GEJ cancer or PC who have failed to respond to standard therapy, have relapsed after standard therapy, or are intolerant to standard therapy; and who have disease progression as confirmed by the Investigator or documented by medical history.
