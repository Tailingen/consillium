FACBC Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET/CT) Used in the Diagnosis of Primary Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this research project is to test if a compound (chemical substance) has a natural tendency to go to prostate cancer. This compound has a small amount of radioactivity attached to it and is called a radiotracer. The name of the radiotracer is FACBC and can be detected on a special imaging device called a PET scanner (positron emission tomography). The radiotracer is treated in the body much like an amino acid which is a nutrient required for normal functioning. Tumors also use these nutrients. Earlier studies have shown that this radiotracer may be able to detect prostate cancer.

The investigators will perform a study with 20 patients in whom they know have prostate cancer after a biopsy and who are scheduled for an operation in which the prostate is removed and the nearby lymph nodes are examined. This operation is called prostatectomy. The investigators think that this radiotracer can help us determine where exactly the prostate cancer is present in the prostate or if it has spread. This information may be useful in the future to help with other non-surgical therapy such as radiation beam therapy.

The investigators will compare the results of the FACBC PET scan to the results of the pathology analysis of the removed prostate. In this way the investigators can determine how good a test FACBC PET is for finding out where and if prostate cancer is located in the prostate or nearby lymph nodes. The investigators will also do more advanced analysis on the biopsy samples to see if they can tell why FACBC goes into prostate cancer cells.

This radiotracer has been tested in over 100 human subjects without incident. It has also been chosen by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a promising radiotracer. The NIH is funding this study.
Prostate Cancers
DRUG: anti [18F]FACBC
Diagnostic Performance Per Sextant at Each Time Point by Visual Analysis, Each of 12 sextants per prostate (for a total of 120 sextants for the 10 patients) were analyzed separately at 4, 16, 28 and 40 min post-injection for the presence or absence of focal activity suspicious for tumor.

Sensitivity: Proportion of people with a disease who have a positive test result

Specificity: The proportion of people without disease who have a negative test result Positive Predictive Value (PPV):The probability that a person who has a positive test result has the disease for which the test was conducted.

Negative Predictive Value (NPV): The probability that a person who has a negative test result does not have the disease for which the test was conducted

Accuracy: Ability of the test to differentiate between disease and non-disease.

Note: 'n=' is the denominator used to compute each parameter., At 4, 16, 28 and 40 minutes post-injection of FACBC
Mean SUVmax of Low Versus High Gleason Groups, To determine id radiotracer uptake correlates with gleason score, 4 minutes,16 minutes,28 minutes and 40 minutes
