Isotretinoin Plus Interferon in Treating Patients With Recurrent Cancer
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of isotretinoin may be an effective way to prevent cancer or stop cancer from growing. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining isotretinoin and interferon may be an effective treatment for some recurrent cancers.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa plus isotretinoin in treating patients with recurrent cancer.
Cervical Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Lung Cancer|Non-melanomatous Skin Cancer|Penile Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: recombinant interferon alfa|DRUG: isotretinoin
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rates to treatment with daily subcutaneous interferon alpha plus oral isotretinoin in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the following body sites: head and neck, cervix, skin, esophagus, lung, and penis. II. Determine the toxicities and side effects of this treatment.

OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy with Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Isotretinoin, 13-CRA, NSC-329481; with Interferon alpha (Schering or Hoffmann-La Roche), IFN-A, NSC-377523 or NSC-367982.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14-50 patients per tumor category (and any other tumor location, if available) will be enrolled. If none of the first 14 patients in any tumor category responds, or if only 1/22, 2/30, 3/37, 4/44, or 5/50 respond, the treatment will be considered ineffective for that tumor type.
