Eliminating Breast Surgery for Breast Cancer Patients With Clinical Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy
Phase II multicenter prospective study on the safety of eliminating surgery for triple negative or HER2 positive breast cancer patients with clinical response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy combined with Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy
5-year EFS, 5 years event-free survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 60 weeks
b-pCR, Whether combined neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy can improve breast pathological complete response rate (bpCR: ypT0), 18 weeks|OS, overall survival after completing of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 60 weeks
The main purpose: To explore the safety of eliminating surgery for triple negative or HER2 positive breast cancer patients with clinical response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Secondary study objective: To explore predictive molecular biomarkers of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and investigate whether ctDNA can predict pCR or survival outcome.

Primary endpoint: 5-year event-free survival (5-year EFS). Secondary end points: Whether combined neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy can improve breast pathological complete response rate (bpCR: ypT0), overall survival (OS), patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and safety
