Open Label, Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Study of IM or Oral Exemestane (Aromasin) in Postmenopausal Women
The purpose of this study is to find out if the two different formulations of exemestane (Aromasin), oral and injectable, are equivalent in terms of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, i.e., if ultimately both formulations have the same efficacy in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer who have failed previous antiestrogens therapy and are equally safe.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: exemestane
To determine the pharmacodynamic equivalence at steady state of the IM formulation of exemestane with the oral formulation in terms of plasma estrone sulphate inhibitory effect in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.
to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of the two formulations in terms of estrogens, androgens, and sec hormone binding globulin|to characterize the pharmacokinetics of exemestane and 17 hydroexemestane after administration of the two formulations|to evaluate the relationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after intramuscular and oral administration of exemestane|to evaluate the efficacy (as tumor response)|to evaluate the incidence and severity of systemic toxicities and of the local tolerability of the injectable formulation|to evaluate the effect on serum bone turnover markers
