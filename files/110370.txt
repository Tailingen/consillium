Attenuated SOX as First-line Treatment in Elderly Patients With Relapsed or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
Stomach cancer is the most common malignant disease and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the Korea. The elderly are primarily affected by the disease with most gastric cancer-related deaths occuring in patients aged 65 years or older. Systemic chemotherapy improves the quantity and quality of life in patients with gastric cancer when compared with best supportive care. However, elderly cancer patients often present with concomitant co-morbidities and age-associated physiologic problems that make the selection of optimal treatment difficult. There is also uncertainty about the use of systemic palliative chemotherapy in elderly patients because of under representation of this age group in clinical trials. Therefore, this phase II trial was planned to investigate efficacy and toxicities of combination chemotherapy with attenuated dose of S-1 and oxaliplatin (attenuated SOX)in patients with elderly AGC
Elderly|S-1|Oxaliplatin|First-Line|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: S-1 (TS-1) and Oxaliplatin (Oxalitin)
To evaluate response rate of attenuated SOX as first-line chemotherapy in elderly patients with relapsed or metastatic AGC, every 2 cycles
To evaluate progression free survival, overall survival, and toxicities of aSOX-regimen, every 2 months
Treatment scheme

* S-1 60mg/m2/day (D1-14) Oxaliplatin: 85mg/m2 + 5DW 250mL MIV over 2-hours

Each cycle is repeated every 3 weeks

Response evaluation will be performed every 2 cycles

Repeated cycles of treatment will be given for this study unless there is confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
