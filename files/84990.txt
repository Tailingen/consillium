A Maintenance Therapy Study of Odetiglucan With CDX-1140 in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
The primary objective of this maintenance therapy study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/ or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of odetiglucan in combination with CDX-1140 in patients with metastatic PDAC with evidence of response or stable disease following a minimum of 16 and no more than 32 weeks of chemotherapy.

Up to 45 patients will be enrolled and dosed (30 patients in Part A and 15 in Part B).

This is a multiple institution, open-label, 2-part Phase 1b study to determine the MTD (and/ or RP2D), safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the combination of odetiglucan and CDX-1140 for the treatment of patients with metastatic PDAC with evidence of response or stable disease during a minimum of 16 and no more than 32 weeks of therapy immediately prior to study enrollment. Part A will identify the MTD and/ or RP2D in two cohorts of patients enrolled per ABA status (Cohort 1=ABA+ and Cohort 2=ABA-) and Part B will assess an alternative dosing regimen of RP2D in an anti-beta glucan antibody ABA+, ABA- or ABA mixed population (ABA+ and ABA-) based on observations in Part A.

Product: Odetiglucan and CDX-1140 5 Protocol/Amendment No.: PGG-PAN2111, Amd.0010 Confidential - HiberCell Inc.

In Part A, a 3 + 3 de-escalation design will be used to determine the MTD of CDX-1140 when administered in combination with odetiglucan (the starting dose for CDX-1140 is that anticipated to be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on prior Phase 1 clinical assessment). Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled (ABA+ and ABA-) and proceed independently through the 3+3 de-escalation assessment; up to 30 patients will be enrolled. The following 2 treatment cohorts will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy:

* ABA+: Patients with ABA value â‰¥20 mcg/mL ABA
* ABA-: Patients with ABA value \<20 mcg/mL ABA

Both cohorts will initiate at Dose Level 1 and de-escalate to Dose Level -1 based on the respective 21-day DLT period:

* Dose Level 1: Odetiglucan 4 mg/kg IV plus CDX-1140 1.5 mg/kg
* Dose Level -1: Odetiglucan 4 mg/kg IV plus CDX-1140 0.72 mg/kg Treatment will be administered in 3-week cycles. Odetiglucan will be administered weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle followed \~15-30 minutes later by administration of CDX-1140 1.5 mg/kg or 0.72 mg/kg IV Day 1 of each cycle.

Part B, if opened, will enroll up to 15 patients to receive odetiglucan 4 mg/kg plus the CDX-1140 RP2D identified in Part A. As in Part A, treatment will be administered in 3-week cycles, however, both odetiglucan and CDX-1140 will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle (no odetiglucan administration on Days 8 and 15 as in Part A). If the RP2D differs between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 at the end of Part A, the Sponsor in consult with the SMC, may select a single RP2D to investigate or investigate both RP2Ds. If a larger total enrollment is required, the protocol will be amended to support.
