Plasma EBV DNA Monitoring in Post-treatment NPC Patients
Continuous regular monitoring of plasma EBV DNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after treatment have rarely been investigated. The investigators try to analyze the long-term observational results (role in early relapse detection and impact on survival) in NPC patients after curative treatment.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|NPC|EBV|Radiotherapy
Time interval from the date of abnormal blood test to the date of clinically documented tumor relapse, From the end of treatment to any time when abnormal blood test is fund, Five years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival was calculated from the day of enrollment until death or the last follow-up visit, Five years|Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival was calculated from the day of enrollment until the date of first occurrence of tumor relapse (local, regional, or distant failures) or the last follow-up visit, Five years
The investigators enrolled 441 NPC patients who had finished finished curative radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy and no recurrence/metastasis before entry this study from five hospitals in Taiwan. Blood samples were collected on the day of enrollment and monitored once every 2-3 months for plasma EBV DNA measurement. After long-term observation, we analyze the impact of continuous plasma EBV DNA monitoring on the early dection of tumor relapse and do risk grouping for survival analyses according to the blood test results.
