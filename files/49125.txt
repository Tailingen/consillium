A Study of a Live Intranasal Influenza Vaccine in Children With Cancer
Eligible research subjects will be randomized to receive either FluMist or inactivated influenza vaccine then stratified by age and necessity to receive either one or two immunizations. Subjects requiring one immunization will be immunized at Day 0. Subjects requiring two immunizations will be immunized at Day 0 and Day 28. Subjects will be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination and given a diary card to record symptoms after each vaccination.
Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: FluMist|BIOLOGICAL: Inactivated influenza vaccine
The primary objective of this study is to describe the immune response of FluMist compared with inactivated influenza vaccine in mild to moderately immunocompromised children with cancer, 6 months
Immunization response, To examine the association between immunization response (seroconversion or seroprotection) and baseline clinical factors (age, type of malignancy, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, serum IgA, IgG and IgM levels)., 10/31/2010|Flumist safety, Describe the safety of FluMist and inactivated influenza vaccine., 2 years|Viral Replication, Describe the incidence and duration of viral replication following immunization with FluMist., 1 year
The secondary objectives of this study are to:

1. Describe the safety of FluMist and inactivated influenza vaccine.
2. Describe the incidence and duration of viral replication following immunization with FluMist.
3. To examine the association between immunization response (seroconversion or seroprotection) and baseline clinical factors (age, type of malignancy, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, serum IgA, IgG and IgM levels).
