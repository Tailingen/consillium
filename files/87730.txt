Iconographic Registry of Pancreatobiliary Endoscopy Procedures
The aim of the TAILOR-EUS study (Iconographic Registry of Bilio-Pancreatic Endoscopic Ultrasound Procedures) is to establish a clinical registry comprising images and videos generated during endoscopic procedures conducted for the investigation of pancreatic diseases (PD). The study will compile historical, pathological, and imaging data from approximately 12,000 patients (2,000 retrospectively and 10,000 prospectively) who underwent endoscopic ultrasound procedures for inflammatory pancreatic conditions (e.g., acute, recurrent, chronic pancreatitis), autoimmune bilio-pancreatic diseases (e.g., autoimmune pancreatitis), neoplastic bilio-pancreatic conditions, and screenings for individuals at high risk of developing such diseases at the Bilio-Pancreatic Endoscopy and Endoscopic Ultrasound Unit of the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital between 2000 and 2027.

Participants have undergone or will undergo the standard diagnostic pathway appropriate for their conditions as part of routine clinical practice. All instrumental examinations and endoscopic ultrasound procedures are integral to the standard diagnostic and therapeutic approach for pancreatic diseases.

Registry for images and videos, Establishment of a registry for images and videos captured during Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) procedures, aimed at enhancing clinical data collection to improve patient diagnoses and advance the quality of Clinical Pathways for pancreatic diseases. The future goal of this initiative is to identify potential characteristics that could enhance the diagnostic yield of this technique and predict patient outcomes., Through study completion, an average of 5 years
