Safety Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus to Treat Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapy; tumors may include malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. These tumor types were selected because evidence of biological activity was observed in these tumor types in a Phase I study of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered by intratumoral injection in patients with metastatic disease to the liver. Patients will receive treatment at one of five dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating design.
Melanoma|Lung Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Recombinant Vaccinia GM-CSF; RAC VAC GM-CSF (JX-594)
Maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum-feasible dose (MFD) of JX-594 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, 4 weeks|Safety/Toxicity: Incidence of treatment-related adverse events; treatment-related serious adverse events; treatment-related Grade 3/4 toxicities; and clinically-significant, treatment-related changes from baseline in routine laboratory parameters, 4 weeks
Determine the JX-594 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics over time following IV infusion, 4 weeks|Determine the immune response to JX-594 following IV infusion, 4 weeks|Determine the delivery of JX-594 to, and concentration within, solid tumors following IV infusion, 4 weeks
