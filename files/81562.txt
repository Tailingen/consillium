NP-101 (TQ Formula) with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Advanced or Metastatic Extra-pulmonary Neuroendocrine Carcinomas
A pilot study to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of this novel combined regimen (NP-101 TQ Formula plus nivolumab and ipilimumab) in the second-line setting for EP-NECA. NP-101 (TQ Formula) (TQ, C10H12O2) is the main bioactive component of the black seed (Nigella sativa, Ranunculaceae family) and has anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenic effects.

DRUG: NP-101 (TQ Formula)|DRUG: Nivolumab (3mg/kg)|DRUG: Ipilimumab (1mg/kg)
Antitumor activity of NP-101 (TQ Formula) plus nivolumab and ipilimumab in subjects with advanced and/or metastatic EP-NECAs who progressed on first line therapy, Antitumor activity will be measured by the number of participants that have a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). CR is defined as the complete disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed by repeat assessments at no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response is first met. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. SD is defined as neither sufficient decrease to qualify for a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease., Up to 6 months from the start of treatment
Safety profile/toxicity of combining NP-101 (TQ Formula) with nivolumab and ipilimumab., Number of participants who experience a Grade 3 or greater drug-related adverse events., Up to 2 years from the start of treatment|Time to progression (TTP), To determine the time to progression (TTP) using NP-101 (TQ Formula) plus nivolumab and ipilimumab combined regimen in subjects with EP-NECAs, Up to 6 months from the start of treatment
The purpose of this study is to find out if NP-101 (TQ Formula) given with the immunotherapy drugs called nivolumab and ipilimumab helps with neuroendocrine carcinoma who have progressed on at least one first line standard therapy. NP-101 (TQ Formula) black seed oil tablet is an investigational (experimental) drug that may enhance the effect that immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab and ipilimumab have on neuroendocrine carcinoma.
