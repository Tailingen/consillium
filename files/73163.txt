Phase IV Randomization to On-Going Treatment to Evaluate Sustained Sorafenib
The purpose of this study is to see if taking interferon or gemcitabine along with sorafenib will stop the advanced renal cell cancer from becoming worse in some people. To do this, sorafenib along with gemcitabine or interferon will be compared to treatment with gemcitabine or interferon alone. More safety information on sorafenib will be also collected. About 260 patients with progressed renal cell cancer will be in this study.
