CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B Cell ALL
This phase 1 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a CAR-T cell therapy directed against two B cell antigens (CD19 CD20) and produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions using the closed system CliniMACS Prodigy device in B ALL.

Number of Adverse Events after CAR 20/19-T Cell Infusion., Adverse events will be measured and recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Occurrence of adverse events, defined as either CRS related Grade 3/4 toxicity or other NCI CTCAE version 5 non-hematologic â‰¥ grade 3 signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities and clinical events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment at any time from the infusion until day +28 post CAR-T infusion., 28 days after infusion
This is a phase 1, interventional, open label, treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of CAR-20/19-T in subjects with B cell ALL who have relapsed after prior therapies or refractory disease and are not candidates for curative intent standard therapy. There will be two phases of this study. First, a dose escalation phase will determine the safe CAR-20/19-T cell dose in patients B-cell ALL. Once the desired dose has been identified there will be a six-patient dose expansion phase at the specified dose level.
