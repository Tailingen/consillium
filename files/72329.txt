A Study of YL-17231 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 open label multicenter study to evaluate the maximum tolerance, safety, tolerance and PK of oral YL-17231 in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS mutation, so as to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose of YL-17231 and obtain the preliminary efficacy information of patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS mutation.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: YL-17231
DLTs, Dose limited toxicities, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|TEAEs, Treatment emergent adverse events, From day 1 after taking the investigational product till 30 days after withdrawal from the study
Cmax, Peak plasma concentration, From day 1 to the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|AUC, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, From day 1 to the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Tmax, Time to maximum plasma concentration, From day 1 to the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|T1/2, Elimination half-life, From day 1 to the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|The overall response rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) will be estimated based on the proportion of evaluable patients whose overall response (ORR) during study treatment is CR or PR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, From date of screening until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|DOR, Duration of response, From date of screening until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Disease control rate, DCR, The percentage of cases with remission (PR+CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment, From date of screening until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Progression free survival, PFS, PFS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to first documented progression, From date of screening until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Overall survival, OS, The time from randomization to death for any reason, From date of screening until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months
The study will be conducted in China to provide safety, efficacy and PK data. A dose escalation part 1 will be conducted to determine the MTD, DLTs, and part 2 will confirm the safety/tolerability of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), of YL-17231 given twice daily, in patients with advanced solid tumors to obtain preliminary efficacy information. PK samplings at single dose stage Day 1 and at steady-state conditions (Cycle 1, Day 14) will be performed.
