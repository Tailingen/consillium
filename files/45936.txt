Phase I Clinical Study of E7389
The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of E7389 in patients with solid tumors. The secondary objectives are to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, estimated recommended dose, and anti-tumor effects (in evaluable cases) of E7389 in patients with solid tumors.
