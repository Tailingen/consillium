Time to Surgery - the Impact of Waiting Time on Outcome After Colorectal Cancer Treatment
We aim to perform a register-based, observational cohort study to investigate whether it is safe to delay start of treatment with a curative intention after a colorectal cancer diagnosis. Our hypothesis is that delaying start of treatment until 4-8 weeks is as safe as starting treatment within four weeks after a colorectal cancer diagnosis.
