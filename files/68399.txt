Trial of mFOLFOX6 + Trastuzumab + Avelumab in Gastric and Esophageal Adenocarcinomas
The initial intent of the study was to be a multi-center single-arm open-label Simon's two-stage Phase II clinical trial of first-line mFOLFOX6 + trastuzumab + avelumab in metastatic HER2-amplified gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas.

Accrual will halt after completion of Stage I (enrollment of 18 patients). This decision is not due to safety issues. Subjects currently on treatment will continue until criteria as defined in the protocol is met.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Esophageal Adenocarcinoma|Metastasis|HER-2 Gene Amplification
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5 fluorouracil|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Avelumab
Best Objective Response Rate (bORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter(LD) of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.

The bORR will be defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response by 24 weeks are either a CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1. For confirmed response, PR or CR need to be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks. Otherwise, it will be considered as an unconfirmed response., 24 weeks
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Per RECIST 1.1: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter(LD) of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from the start date of treatment to the date of documented progression as determined by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death, up to a maximum of 11 months.|Progression Free Survival by iRECIST(iPFS), Immune-RECIST Criteria(iRECIST): Complete Response(iCR), Disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable lesions; Partial Response (iPR), \>=30% decrease in tumor burden relative to baseline; Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (iUPD), \>= 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Confirmed Progressive Disease (iCPD), confirmation of iUPD (by further growth) at the next assessment; Stable Disease (iSD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.

iPFS will be defined as the time from the start date of treatment to the date of documented progression as determined by iRECIST criteria or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death, up to a maximum of 11 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) will be defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of death from any cause, or date of last contact (censored)., Time of treatment start until death or date of last contact, up to a maximum of 20 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) will be defined as the total number of patients whose best responses are either a CR, PR, or SD divided by the number of response evaluable patients. Patients with best response of SD will need to maintain SD by 24 weeks to be considered to have received clinical benefit from the treatment regimen., Up to a maximum of 11 months.|Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Treatment Related Adverse Events, The frequency and severity of all grade 3-4 treatment related adverse events are reported by CTCAE v5., AE had been recorded from time of signed informed consent until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug(s) and/or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first, up to a maximum of 20 months.
