To Evaluate KC1036 in the Patients with Advanced Digestive System Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of KC1036 in participants with advanced recurrent or metastatic digestive system tumors.
Digestive System Tumors
DRUG: KC1036
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 year.
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start date of study drug to the date of the first radiologically documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause., approximately 2 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 year.|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from first documented response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) to the date of first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, among patients with a confirmed PR or CR per RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 year.|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: Cmax, Parameters: Peak Plasma Concentration, approximately 2 year.|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: Tmax, Parameters: Time to reach the maximum plasma concentration, approximately 2 year.|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: T1/2, Parameters: Terminal half-life, approximately of 2 year.|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: AUC, arameters: Area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve., approximately of 2 year.|Adverse events (AEs), Incidence of treatment-related AEs, approximately of 2 year.
This is an open label, non-randomizedï¼Œphase 1b/2 study to explore the preliminary antitumor activity of KC1036 in patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic digestive system tumors under BID or QD regimen.

The study will consist of two parts:

Part 1: QD regimen

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of KC1036 in the treatment of advanced recurrent, unresectable and / or metastatic digestive system tumors under 60mg QD regimen.

Part 2: BID regimen

Dose-Escalation part : To explore the safety of KC1036 under 20mg BID, 30mg BID and 40mg BID in patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic digestive system tumors.

Dose-Expansion part : According to the results of Dose-Escalation, an appropriate BID regimen was selected for Dose-Expansion to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of KC1036 in patients with advanced recurrent, unresectable and / or metastatic digestive system tumors.
