Minimally-invasive Stabilization of Pelvic Metastases With Photodynamic Nails: A Multi-center Prospective Study of Functional Outcome
Determine whether patients exhibit early functional improvement after minimally-invasive placement of Illuminoss photodynamic nails for peri-acetabular pelvic metastasis at 3 months following procedure
Pelvic Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Photodynamic nails
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion, up to one year
Primary Objectives

1. Evaluate whether patients exhibit early functional improvement after minimally-invasive placement of Illuminoss photodynamic nails for peri-acetabular pelvic metastasis at 3 months following procedure

Secondary Objectives

1. Evaluate whether the procedure relieves pain
2. Evaluate radiographic stability of the implant
3. Evaluate functional outcome at earlier time points (2 weeks or 6 weeks) and at 6 months and possibly later time points
4. Evaluate reoperation rate and complications
