Adipose-Induced Regeneration of Breast Skin to Treat Post-Mastectomy Radiation Injury in Breast Cancer Patients
Researchers are trying to identify the therapeutic effect of injection into the subcutaneous tissue to treat radiation-induced skin injury of post mastectomy in patients with breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Fat grafting
Increase in skin quality, Number of subjects to show reverse radiation-induced skin injury, 18 months|Physical Well-Being Using the BREAST-Q Reconstruction Module, Change in BREAST-Q patient-reported questionnaire to assess quality of life and patient satisfaction by using questions pertaining to the function and participation in activities after fat grafting. Subjects are asked to answer 16 questions on how often they experienced each symptom, using a score of 1 to 5, where 1 was none of the time and 5 was very often. Answers from these questions were combined to provide a total physical well-being score (for a total possible range of 16-80). Lower scores reflected fewer symptoms and higher satisfaction where higher scores reflected more symptoms and less satisfaction., 12 months, 18 months|Effects of skin disease on quality of life, Change in patient-reported Skin-16 questionnaire used to assess skin condition after fat grafting by using 16 questions on how often subjects skin condition has bothered them during the past week, using a score of 0 to 6, where 0 is never bothered and 10 is always bothered., 12 months, 18 months|Skin Toxicity Costs, Change in patient-reported skin toxicity costs questionnaire used to assess the economic impact of skin changes due to radiation after fat grafting by using 7 questions asking subjects to report total costs and itemized spending on specific items related to post procedure care., 12 months, 18 months
