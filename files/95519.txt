Acute and Long-term Impact of Cancer Treatment on Head and Neck Cancer Patients: FIT4TREATMENT
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer. Most cases are diagnosed in locally advanced stages, with treatment involving multimodal approach with combinations of radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy. The aggressive nature of HNSCCs and treatment modalities are associated with important acute and late toxicities that often promote temporary or definitive treatment interruption and may compromised the capability to tolerate subsequent treatments. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the acute and long-term impact of cancer treatment on quality of life, physical and cognitive function of HNSCC patients diagnosed with a locally advanced disease.

A progression (local, regional or distant) will be assumed accordingly to the imaging evaluation and/or histopathologic confirmation., 2 years follow-up|Overall survival, Defined as the time from the beginning of treatment to the date of death from any cause, for patients who do not die, it will be censored at their last follow-up date., 2 years follow-up|Capability of tolerating subsequent treatments, Defined as the proportion of patients that complete the first cycle of the first line palliative chemotherapy after a documented progression (considering all patients with a formal indication)., 2 years follow-up
Potential cases will be identified at the multidisciplinary head and neck group meeting. If the case meets eligibility an informed consent will be presented to the patient. Interested participants will be scheduled for baseline assessment before the beginning of treatment (M0). At the end of CRT patients will be submitted to a second assessment (M1). Follow-up assessments will occur 16th to 18th weeks after the treatment is completed (M2). Patients proposed to surgery or induction chemotherapy will also be submitted to an additional assessment before the beginning of CRT (Mc / Mic).
