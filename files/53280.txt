Heat Therapy and Cardiometabolic Health in Obese Women
Traditional medical treatments are often based on research done exclusively in males, and recent research efforts in the physiology community have highlighted critical sex differences in disease presentation and progression. For example, the relative risk of fatal heart disease is 50% greater in obese, diabetic women as compared to their male counterparts, and women appear to respond differently to lifestyle interventions such as exercise compared with men. Chronic passive heat exposure (hot tub use) provides alternative or supplemental therapeutic potential for improving cardiovascular and metabolic health in obese women. In addition, passive heat exposure may offer specific cellular protection from stresses like a lack of blood flow (ischemia), which is the primary cause of fatal coronary heart disease. This study is investigating the possible cardiovascular and metabolic health benefits of chronic passive heat exposure, and whether regular hot tub use (3-4 days per week for 8-10 weeks) may reduce obese womens' cardiometabolic risk. The investigators are examining cardiovascular health through blood pressure, blood vessel stiffness, sympathetic ('fight or flight') activity, and responsiveness to stresses like increased or decreased blood flow. The investigators are also examining metabolic health through an oral glucose tolerance test and a subcutaneous fat biopsy. The goal of this research is to develop a therapy targeted toward the specific health needs and complications of obese women, in an effort to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health and provide therapeutic alternatives in this high-risk population.
