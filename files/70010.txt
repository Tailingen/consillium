A Phase 1 Trial of TST of PD 0332991 Followed by Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone for Adults With Relapsed and Refractory Acute Leukemias and High-Risk Myelodysplasia
1.1 Primary Objectives

* To determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxicities of administering the selective CDK 4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991 prior to the combination of ara-C and Mitoxantrone for adults with relapsed and refractory acute leukemias and high risk myelodysplasias (MDS), including primary refractory disease
* To determine the direct cytotoxic effects of single agent PD 0332991 on malignant blasts
* To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of PD 0332991 in timed sequential combination with ara-C and Mitoxantrone
* To determine if the timed sequential combination of PD 0332991 with ara-C and mitoxantrone can induce clinical responses in adults with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias and high-risk MDS

1.2 Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the ability of PD 0332991 to directly induce apoptosis in malignant cell populations in vivo
* To obtain pharmacodynamic (PD) data regarding the ability of PD 0332991 to arrest malignant cells in the G 1 phase of cell cycle, followed by synchronized release of those cells into S phase upon discontinuation of PD 0332991 and resultant enhanced ara-C cytotoxicity
Relapsed Acute Leukemia|Refractory Acute Leukemia|High-Risk Myelodysplasia
DRUG: PD 0332991
The Toxicities of Administration of PD 0332991 in Combination With Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone., The number of participants experiencing toxicities of administration of PD 0332991 in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone will be measured according to NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, 42 days
To Determine the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PD 0332991 in Timed Sequential Combination With Ara-C and Mitoxantrone, Dose escalation decisions will be based on nonhematologic toxicities in Cycle 1 (28 days) and hematologic toxicities, in the case of an aplastic marrow through Day 56, For cytopenias including ANC \< 500/mm3 or platelets \< 50, 000/mm3 a bone marrow will be performed between days 42 and 49.. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be measured according to NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, 42 days
