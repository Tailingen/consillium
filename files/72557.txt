Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Efficacy of ONC 841 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I open label, dose-escalation study of intravenous (IV) infusion of ONC-841 as a single agent in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. The study will evaluate seven dose levels of ONC-841 starting from 0.03 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ONC-841
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The number of subjects who have Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) as defined by protocol DLT criteria during the first cycle of study drug, ONC-841, administration., 28 Days|Maximum Toxicity Dose (MTD), Maximal tolerable dose (MTD), the study drug, ONC-841, dose level that has two out of six subjects who have DLT., 28 Days
Cmax of ONC-841, The highest Serum concentration of ONC-841 after IV infusion at cycle 1 and cycle 3 from different timepoints (within 60 minutes before dosing, 60 minutes post-dose, 6 hours post-dose, 24 hours post dose, day 8, 15 and 21 post-dose) after drug administration., 84 days|The serum half-life of ONC-841, To determine the drug concentration in serum samples that are taken in various timepoints (Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: within 60 minutes before dosing, 60 minutes post-dose, 6 hours post-dose, 24 hours post dose, day 8, 15 and 21 post-dose. Cycle 2 and Cycle 4-13: within 60 minutes before dosing and 60 minutes post-dose) during the treatment in order to calculate drug half life., 84 days
ONC-841 is an investigational drug being developed as an anti-tumor treatment. ONC-841 is an antibody drug that binds to immune cells inside the tumor mass. The target molecule is Siglec10, mostly expressed on neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. ONC-841 binds to Siglec10 to block the "do not eat me" signals that cancer cells give to immune system, which allow macrophages and neutrophils to "eat" the tumor cells. The study will use ONC-841 alone for cancer treatment. The study will evaluate seven dose levels of ONC-841 starting from 0.03 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg, given once every 4 weeks.
