CAR-T-cell Treatment for Untreated High Risk MANtle Cell Lymphoma
First-line CAR-T-cell consolidation after an abbreviated induction with 2 cycles of Rituximab and Ibrutinib prior to CAR-T-cell treatment and followed by 6 months of maintenance with Ibrutinib in patients with high risk MCL.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: KTE-X19|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Failure Free Survival, Time from randomization to any discontinuation of the per protocol treatment due to stable or progressive disease during induction, stable disease at the end of induction, progressive disease at any time after end of induction treatment and death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Stable disease at end of induction is defined as failure event because it represents a regular indication for salvage treatment in MCL., From Randomization to any to any discontinuation of the per protocol treatment due to stable or progressive disease
Progression-free survival (PFS), from the date of response (CR or PR within 6 months from randomization) to progression or death from any cause|Complete remission (CR) rate, 6 months from randomization until end of trial|Time to first response, date of randomization to the date of first response (CR or PR)|Overall survival, day 1 after randomization until end of trial
This phase II clinical trial will compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of first-line treatment with KTE-X19 after a shortened induction with Rituximab and Ibrutinib to conventional immunochemotherapy and Ibrutinib followed by ASCT in younger patients in high-risk MCL patients or immunochemotherapy plus BTKi for elderly, but still fit patients (need to be CAR-T-cell eligible). As primarily the potential of CAR-T-cell treatment is evaluated within this trial, in case of failure to achieve a partial response will be treated with 2 additional cycles of R-CHOP, which can be omitted in case of sufficient response to Ibrutinib-based treatment.
