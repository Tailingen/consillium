Safety/Efficacy Study of Immunoconjugate With Docetaxel in Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
This randomized phase II clinical trial evaluates the combination of a monoclonal antibody-based drug (SGN-15) with a chemotherapeutic agent compared to chemotherapy given alone in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior systemic therapy. The objective of the study is to determine the safety and clinical benefit, as measured by tumor response and quality of life, to the combination regimen.

Monoclonal antibody therapy has been used in other types of cancer to target therapy to the tumor, thereby allowing for the chemotherapeutic agent to have a lesser effect on normal, healthy tissue.
