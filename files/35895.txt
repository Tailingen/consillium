The Use of a Morcellator in Operative Hysteroscopy for Benign Intracavitary Lesions: a Feasibility Study
Polyps, intracavitary myomas and retained products of conception (RPOC) are common benign intracavitary lesions of the uterus and frequently cause abnormal uterine bleeding or pain. In general, intracavitary lesions are treated by operative hysteroscopy with bipolar resectoscopic removal under general anaesthesia, performed in the theatre (OR). Potential problems with this approach are thermal damage and impairment of visibility due to loose tissue fragments necessitating multiple entries for tissue removal.

Recently, lesion morcellation by hysteroscopy has been introduced as an alternative technique. Compared to the resectoscopic approach, morcellation is reportedly associated with a shorter total procedure time, smaller fluid deficit and number of insertions. A few trials also registered a higher success rate in completeness of resection.

No significant differences in odds of surgical complications have been reported.

Most hysteroscopic morcellators have diameters up to 8 mm, for which cervical dilation under general anaesthesia is usually needed.

Recently, companies have developed hysteroscopic morcellators with smaller diameters, e.g. 6.3 mm for the 19 Fr. intrauterine BIGATTI Shaver (IBS速). This means less need for cervical dilation, and potential use without anesthesia.

At this moment, there are no prospective studies available on feasibility of the 19 Fr. intrauterine BIGATTI Shaver (IBS速). Before implementing hysteroscopic morcellation in our department, we need a feasibility study assessing the method in standard conditions in the operation room or in ambulatory setting under sedation.

Trial objectives:

Assessment of the feasibility of hysteroscopic morcellation of benign uterine intracavitary lesions. The primary objective is to assess the completeness of hysteroscopic resection in patients undergoing the procedure under general anesthesia or sedation.

Secondary objectives are to assess perioperative parameters as operation time, need for cervical dilation, adverse events, pain, operator satisfaction; to assess quality of tissue for histological examination; to assess postoperative complications and pain.
