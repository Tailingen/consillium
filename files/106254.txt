Trial of Belotecan/Cisplatin in Chemotherapy Naive Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient
Belotecan (Camtobell, CKD-602, Chong Kun Dang Pharm., Korea) is a new camptothecin derivative, that exhibits anticancer effects by inhibiting topoisomerase I. The investigators will have a randomized prospective multicenter trial of Belotecan/Cisplatin versus Etoposide/Cisplatin in patients with previously untreated, extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

Primary endpoints

* to assess Response Rate

Secondary endpoints

* to assess Overall response duration, Time to progression, Overall survival
