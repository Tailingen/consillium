Phase 1 Study of FS-1502 in Patients With HER2 Expressed Advanced Solid Tumors and Breast Cancer.
The study comprises two phases: Phase 1a and Phase 1b. The purpose of the study is to observe the safetyï¼Œ tolerability and efficacy of FS-1502.
Solid Tumor|Breast Cancer
DRUG: FS-1502
DLT of first single dose of FS-1502., DLT is defined as a dose-limiting toxicity event occurring during the DLT observation period that, as determined by the Investigator and/or Sponsor to be at least possibly related to FS-1502, is classified using NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 as conforming to AE or laboratory anomalies specified in the protocol., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days or 21 days) in Phase Ia.|MTD of single dose of FS-1502, MTD was defined as the maximum dose of \< 33% DLT events observed in patients with evaluable DLT events (i.e., 1 in 6 patients at most or 0 in 3 patients)., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days or 21 days) in Phase Ia.|Recommend Phase 2 Dose(RP2D) of single dose of FS-1502, If the MTD is not observed, the appropriate therapeutic exposure dose or RP2D is determined based on the antitumor efficacy evaluation, safety data, and PK data., Throughout the Phase Ia|Overall response rate (ORR) assessed by IRC, Percentage of patients with confirmed CR or PR as evaluated by RECIST version 1.1, Approximately 2 years in Phase Ib.

The study is designed as an open label, single arm, Phase 1a/1b study with a dose-escalation phase to evaluate FS-1502 in patients with HER2 expressed advanced malignant solid tumors (phase 1a) and an expanded cohort (phase 1b) to evaluate FS-1502 in patients with metastatic, HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary aim of the phase 1a portion of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of FS-1502. The primary aim of the phase 1b portion is to demonstrate efficacy.
