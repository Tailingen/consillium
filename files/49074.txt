Infusional Carfilzomib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called carfilzomib. It is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor. Proteasome breaks down proteins that are no longer useful to the cell. When the proteasome is turned off by a drug (like carfilzomib), useless proteins cannot be broken down. Instead the proteins build up and cause the cell to die. Myeloma cells make a lot of protein and are especially in need of a functional proteasome to survive.

Carfilzomib is not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration to treat myeloma. It is considered an experimental drug. Previous studies have shown that carfilzomib is safe to use. This study will look at what the effects, good and/or bad, carfilzomib has on myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib
To Evaluate the Best Overall Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI and/or CT: Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progression of Disease (POD); POD, 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions, 2 years
