Phase 1b/2 Study to Evaluate ABT-101 in Solid Tumor and NSCLC Patients
A Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter study to determine the recommended phase 2 (RP2D) of ABT-101in solid tumor and to explore antitumor activities of ABT-101 in patients with HER 2 mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Advanced Solid Tumor|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|HER2 Mutations
DRUG: ABT-101
Determine the recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ABT-101 in Part 1, Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of ABT-101 based on Dose Limiting Toxicities, 18 months|Determine antitumor activity based on Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Part 2 in patients with NSCLC with targeted mutation, Patients response according to RECIST 1.1, 36 months
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) ABT-101, Plasma concentration of ABT-101, 48 months|Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of ABT-101, Measure of AUC, 48 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the length of time between first response and the date of objectively documented progression of disease or death, 48 months|Progression- free survival (PFS), Measure of the time from study entry to disease progression or death due to any cause, 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Measure of overall survival, 36 months|Objective response rate (ORR) in Part 1, Objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a CR, PR, or SD., 36 months
This study will be conducted in two parts:

Part 1: Dose- Escalation, Phase 1b, is designed to determine the RP2D. Patients with solid tumor will be enrolled into a dose finding study scheme with the assessment of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). DLT assessment will be conducted during treatment cycle 1

Part 2: Dose- Expansion, Phase 2, will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-101 at the dosage and dosing regime determined in Phase 1b. Phase 2 will enroll NSCLC patients with HER2 mutations

Study participation for all patients includes screening period, treatment period and safety/ follow-up period. Patient will received study treatment until progressive disease or any other discontinuation or withdrawal criterion is met
