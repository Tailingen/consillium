Phase II Study DCVAC/OvCa Plus Carboplatin Gemcitabine Relapsed Platinum (Pt)-Sensitive Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether DCVAC/OvCa added to chemotherapy (carboplatin and gemcitabine as second line chemotherapy) may result in prolongation of progression free survival (PFS).
