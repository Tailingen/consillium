Phase I Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of Pazopanib in a Population of Frail Elderly Patients According SIOG Criteria
This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial to determine the MTD (Maximal Tolerated Dose) of Pazopanib in a population of frail elderly patients, selected according to the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG)classification (Group 2).

It is expected that a total number of 30 patients maximum will be enrolled in the study on 30 months : 18 months accrual - 12 months follow up.

Eligible patients will be enrolled into a standard 3+3 design with a starting dose of Pazopanib administered orally at 400 mg per day, in 28-day cycles. Then, further dose levels will be explored.

Toxicity of the schedule will be assessed during the first cycle. Patients will receive study medication until disease progression. After treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed during one year.
Metastatic Cancer (Different Solid Tumour Types)
DRUG: Pazopanib
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) incidence (according DLT definition) during the first treatment cycle with pazopanib (28 days), The MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) is defined as the highest dose level for which 6 patients were treated with a maximum of 1 patient presenting a DLT during the first cycle of treatment, 7.5 years
Safety and tolerability assessments using the descriptions and grading scales found in the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4.0 NCI, 7.5 years|Measure of Pazopanib plasma concentration during treatment period (objective : assessment of pharmacokinetics of Pazopanib in this population), Plasma concentrations of pazopanib will be determined using a validated LC-MS-MS method -, .8 time points (cycle 1 Day 1), 3 time points (cycle 1 D15) and 1 pre dose time point each day 1 of the following cycles (over a period of 7.5 years for measures in all patients)|Geriatric criteria measured by comprehensive geriatric assessment which evaluate medical, functional and psychosocial aspects of elderly patients, The impact of treatment on the geriatric assessment will be done using :

* G8 : screening test
* ADL: Activities Daily Living
* IADL: Instrumental Activities Daily Living
* MMSE: Mini-mental State Examination
* SPPB: Short Physical Performance Battery
* MNA: Mini-nutritional Assessment
* CAM: Confusion Assessment Method
* GDS-15: Geriatric Depression Scale
* CIRS-G: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics,, 7.5 years|Rate of objective response according to RECIST criteria, Tumor assessment will be performed at screening visit, every 2 cycles and at the end of study visit and anytime if clinically indicated, 7.5 years
