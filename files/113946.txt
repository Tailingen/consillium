This Study is a FIH Study Which is Required to Understand the PK Characteristics, MTD, RP2D and Safety Profile.
This study is a first-in-human (FIH) study which is required to understand the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of RJK-RT2831 injection in patients with hematologic malignancies
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: RJK-RT2831 dose-escalation phase Ia|DRUG: RJK-RT2831 Dose Expansion Phase Ib
phase Ia and phase Ib: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, All AEs (except for CRS and TLS) will be graded according to NCI CTCAE V5.0, a common standard term for AE.

CRS and TLS will be graded according to ASCTC Consensus (2019) and Cairo-Bishop grading system (Howard revised) respectively., The summary of all AEs was dominated by adverse events that occurred during treatment, including any AE that occurred from the first administration of the study drug until 28 ± 7 days after the last administration.|phase Ia: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RJK-RT2831 in patients with hematologic malignancies., From the first administration of the study drug until 28 days after the first dose|phase Ia: Recommended Doses for Expansion (RDEs), To determine the recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) in patients with hematologic malignancies., From the first administration of the study drug until 28 ±7 days after the last administration and prior to the initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy|phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with hematologic malignancies., From the first administration of the study drug until 28 ±7 days after the last administration and prior to the initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy

This is the first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose expansion phase study to investigate the safety, Tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of RJK-RT2831 injection in patients with hematologic malignancies. About 70 subjects with malignant blood tumors will be recruited. The specific tumor type will be determined based on the results of the Phase Ia trial and may be expanded to other malignant blood tumor types.The primary goal of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD),determine the recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with hematologic malignancies.
