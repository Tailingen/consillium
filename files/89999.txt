MP470 in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumor or Lymphoma
RATIONALE: MP470 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of MP470 in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic refractory solid tumor, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Lymphoma|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor MP470|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study|PROCEDURE: positron emission tomography
Safety|Response to treatment according to RECIST criteria|Pharmacodynamic assessments (e.g., changes in phosphorylation of ERK, Rad51 expression, number of CTCs, and tumor glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and define the safety profile of multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor MP470 in humans.

Secondary

* Estimate the therapeutic response rate for patients receiving MP470.
* Define the human pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of MP470 capsules
* Evaluate PK-PD relationships.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor MP470 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses are carried out to determine changes in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Rad51 expression, number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and tumor glucose metabolism measured by 2-\[18F\]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
