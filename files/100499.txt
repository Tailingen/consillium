Changes in Reproductive and Sexual Health in People With Early Onset Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out how cancer treatments (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) affect reproductive and sexual health in people with early onset colorectal cancer. The study researchers will observe and track changes in hormone levels and in sexual and reproductive health in people with early onset colorectal cancer. This information will help researchers know more about how cancer treatments affect reproductive and sexual health, including the ability to have children (fertility).
