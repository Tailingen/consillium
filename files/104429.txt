A Multicentre Real-world Study of Heptapopal Ethanolamine Tablets in Concurrent/Sequential Radioimmunoinduced Thrombocytopenia
The objective of this study was to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of hexapopal ethanolamine tablets in the treatment of synchronous/sequential radioimmunoinduced thrombocytopenia in the real world.

The subjects of this study were patients with solid malignant tumors who had received radioimmunoinduced thrombocytopenia.

This study will retrospectively and prospectively collect real-world data related to investigational drugs, and will observe 500 patients to observe the diagnosis and treatment pattern of radiochemo-induced thrombocytopenia. The study included a screening period (no more than one week) and a treatment period (at least two cycles).Participants meeting protocol inclusion criteria were defined as having platelet values \< 100×109/L during radioimmunotherapy.
