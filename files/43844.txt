G8, VES-13 and CARG Scores in Predicting Chemotherapy Toxicity in Geriatric Cancer Patients
All participants' medical information will be collected for use as a baseline, including tumor-specific variables, nutritional status, functional status, psychological status, cognitive function, social support, and comorbidities. The suitability of G8, VES-13 and CARG chemotherapy risk assessment tools for elderly cancer patients was investigated.
Predicting Chemotherapy Related Toxicity in Elderly Patients
OTHER: Older Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
G8 (Geriatric 8) screening tool measurement, 15-30 minutes|CARG (Cancer and Aging Research Group) chemotherapy toxicity score measurement, 30-60 minutes|VES-13 (Vulnerable Elders Survey-13) measurement, 30-60 minutes
All participants' medical information will be collected for use as a baseline, including tumor-specific variables, nutritional status, functional status, psychological status, cognitive function, social support, and comorbidities. G8, VES-13 and CARG toxicity scores of all participating patients will be determined by two independent investigators before starting chemotherapy. The suitability of these practical chemotherapy risk assessment tools for cancer patients for elderly cancer patients was investigated.
