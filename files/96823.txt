Radiofrequency Splanchnic Denervation Versus Retrocrural Neurolytic Celiac Block for Pancreatic Cancer Pain
The investigators will evaluate the analgesic efficacy of radiofrequency splanchnic nerve denervation versus neurolytic retrocrural celiac denervation for patients with abdominal pain due to cancer pancreas
