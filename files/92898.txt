A Clinical Research of CAR T Cells Targeting CD19 Positive Malignant B-cell Derived Leukemia and Lymphoma
The main purpose of this research is to verify the safety of CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells and to determine the proper dosage of CAR T cells infused.

Adverse events of each patient., Determine the toxicity profile of the CD19 targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 3 years
Survival time of Anti-CD19 CAR T cells in vivo., To evaluate the presence of circulating CAR T cells with flow cytometry and real time PCR in patient blood., 3 years|Efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR T cells assessed by the ability of CAR T cells to kill leukemia/lymphoma cells, 12 weeks|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD19 targeted CAR T cells., To confirm the maximum tolerated dose of CD19 targeted CAR T cells., 4 weeks
Nowadays refractory or relapsed leukemia/lymphoma lacks effective treatment. Innovative therapy is urgently required. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have demonstrated great successes in treating even late stage cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) positive B cell malignancies. To design better CAR T cells, we have developed new CD19 CARs. Preclinical studies have demonstrated effective killing of CD19 target cells. In this study, the CD19 CARs, will be evaluated in CD19 positive leukemia/lymphoma patients. The primary goal is to confirm its adverse effects including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
