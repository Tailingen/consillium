A Clinical Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of HLX10 in Combination With HLX04 Versus Sorafenib as the First-line Treatment in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic HCC
This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of HLX10 + HLX04 vs Sorafenibas as the First-line Treatment in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic HCC

Eligible subjects in this study will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B at 2:1 ratio as follows:

Arm A (treatment group): HLX10 + HLX04 Arm B (control group): sorafenib Randomization is stratified by: region (Asia (excluding Japan) vs. others), HBV infection vs. HCV infection vs. no HBV or HCV infection, portal vein invasion or/and extrahepatic spread (with vs.without), and ECOG (0 vs. 1).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

tumor assessment, Overall survival (OS): defined as a period from randomization to death of the subject for any reason., defined as a period from randomization to death of the subject for any reason (up to approximately 24 months)|tumor assessment, Progression-free survival (PFS) (assessed by the independent radiology review committee \[IRRC\] based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1), Baseline until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 12 months)
