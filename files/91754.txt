Slide Interpretation or Standard Surgical Pathology in Assessing Margin Status in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Surgery
This study is being done to investigate another way of evaluating margin status after pancreatectomy by using cytopathology (slide interpretation) as compared to the traditional method of surgical pathology
Pancreatic Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: cytology specimen collection procedure
Local recurrence at the site of resection, Will be evaluated in a Cox proportion hazards regression model. The prognostic ability of the histological reporting of the specimen margin as well as the cytopathological reporting of the specimen and in situ margins will be evaluated., up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare margin status on final pathology with margin status from cytopathologic evaluation.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo cytopathologic sample collection during pancreatic resection during which slides are gently pressed against the cut edge of the pancreas, the surgical bed, and along the superior mesenteric artery, and finally against the tumor itself.
