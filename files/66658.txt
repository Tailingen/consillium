5 Fraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery With Temozolomide for Glioblastoma Multiforme
This investigation is not only to develop an improved radiation/temozolomide approach, but also develop a regimen with potential to form the basis of better combined therapy with immune based treatments.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Temozolomide
Rate of change of lymphopenia, To measure the incidence of \> grade 3ymphopenia resulting from combined stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy and standard temozolomide in malignant glioma at the the standard follow-up 10 weeks after the initiation of therapy., 10 weeks
Percentage change in Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count (antigen found on helper T cells), To describe the percent of patients with CD4 count \< 200 mm/m3 at the standard week 10 follow-up, 10 weeks|Rate of change of lymphocytes, Describe recovery of lymphocyte counts during routine clinical follow-up., 10 weeks|Rate of survival, To describe clinical/survival outcome based upon routine standard of care., 10 weeks|Rate of change in serious adverse events, To describe treatment related serious adverse effects, 10 weeks
Glioblastoma has a poor prognosis with median survival is 14-16 months for patients enrolling in clinical trials, and across the United States one year survival is reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to be only 35%. Radiation treatment related lymphopenia has been associated with poor tumor outcome in Glioblastoma and a variety of other tumor types. As this lymphopenias is prolonged, it may also reduce efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor lymphocyte mediated immune therapies now approved by the FDA for an increasing number of indications. Modeling and clinical studies suggest that administering radiation over 5 or fewer days (rather than standard 30 days of treatment) may reduce the incidence of lymphopenia.
