NEUWAVE Flexible Probe Study #2
Patients with medically inoperable and operable secondary soft tissue lesion(s) of the lung will have transbronchial microwave ablation performed using cone beam CT for probe guidance and confirmation.

DEVICE: Microwave ablation
Device User Experience Survey, The Device User Experience Survey is an unvalidated, Sponsor-generated questionnaire aimed to increase the Sponsor's understanding of the usability of the NEUWAVE microwave ablation system. The questionnaire asks approximately 30 questions (includes yes/no responses, rating scales, and fill-in-the-blank sections) and is to be completed by the treating physician at the completion of each ablation. A summary of all treating physician responses will be generated at the completion of the study to summarize the overall user experience with the device., Day of ablation (day 0)|Technical Success (lesion completely ablated), Technical Success is determined by the treating physician and is defined as the ablation zone completely overlapping or encompassing the target lesion plus an ablative margin, as assessed by cone beam CT imaging, immediately following the ablation procedure., Day of ablation (day 0)|Technique Efficacy (lesion completely ablated), Technique Efficacy is determined by the treating physician and is defined as the ablation zone completely overlapping or encompassing the target lesion plus an ablative margin, as assessed by cone beam CT imaging, at Visit 3 (i.e. 30 days post-ablation)., 30 days post-ablation
Adverse Events, Any AEs attributable to the ablation procedure, including all device-related, procedure-related, and SAEs, evaluated from the start of the ablation procedure throughout the entirety of the study (i.e. through 1 year post-ablation)., 1 year post-ablation|Primary Efficacy Rate, The Primary Efficacy Rate is the percentage of target lesions successfully eradicated following the first ablation procedure, as assessed using CT imaging by the treating physician on the day of ablation., Day of ablation (day 0)|Secondary Efficacy Rate, The Secondary Efficacy Rate is defined as the percentage of soft tissue lesions that have undergone successful repeat ablations following identification of local soft tissue lesions progression, as assessed using CT imaging by the treating physician throughout the entirety of the study (i.e. 1 year post-ablation)., 1 year post-ablation|Target Lesion Recurrence, Target Lesion Recurrence is defined as the reappearance of the lesion(s) at the treated site, as assessed using CT imaging by the treating physician throughout the entirety of the study (i.e. through 1 year post-ablation)., 1 year post-ablation|Length of Hospital Stay, The Length of Hospital Stay is defined as the length of time of hospitalization from the end of the ablation procedure to the time of discharge (up to 23 hours post-ablation)., Day of ablation (day 0)|Hospital Readmission Rate, The Hospital Readmission Rate is defined as the percentage of patients who were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of the ablation procedure., 30 days post-ablation
EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 is a quality of life questionnaire with 30 questions aimed specifically for cancer patients. Patients will complete this questionnaire at each study visit., 1 year post-ablation|EORTC QLQ-LC13, The EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 is a quality of life questionnaire with 13 questions aimed specifically for lung cancer patients. The questionnaire asks patients to rate their responses on a scale from 1-4 (1 being "not at all" and 4 being "very much"). Patients will complete this questionnaire at each study visit., 1 year post-ablation|Numeric Pain Scale, The Numeric Pain Scale is a questionnaire where the patient reports their pain on a scale from 0-10 (where 0 is 'no pain' and 10 is 'maximum pain). Patients will complete this questionnaire at each study visit through 30 days post-ablation., 30 days post-ablation
Adult patients with medically inoperable and operable secondary soft tissue lesion(s) of the lung less than 2cm will undergo transbronchial microwave ablation performed by an interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon using cone beam CT imaging for probe guidance and confirmation on ablation outcome. All treated patients will be followed for one year following the ablation procedure for efficacy and safety.
