Yttrium Y 90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan together with rituximab works in treating patients with progressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|RADIATION: yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
Overall response rate, Up to 4 years|Duration of response, Up to 4 years
Complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR, and partial response, Up to 4 years|Event-free survival, Up to 4 years|Time to progression, Up to 4 years|Time to next lymphoma treatment, Up to 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab, in terms of overall response rate (complete, unconfirmed complete, and partial) and duration of response, in patients with transformed CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the event-free survival and time to treatment progression in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the immunogenicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive rituximab IV followed within 4 hours by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV (for imaging) over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo 1 (or 2 if needed) imaging scan between days 2-5. In the absence of altered biodistribution, patients receive rituximab IV followed within 4 hours by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 8.

Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
