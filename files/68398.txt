Marrow Infiltrating Lymphocytes - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MILs™ - NSCLC) Alone or in Combination With Nivolumab With or Without Tadalafil in Locally Advanced and Unresectable or Metastatic NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of MILs™ - NSCLC alone and in combination with nivolumab with or without tadalafil in subjects with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC who are refractory or relapsing to a PD-1 containing regimen.

This study will examine the safety and efficacy of Marrow Infiltrating Lymphocytes-Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MILs™ - NSCLC) combined with nivolumab with or without tadalafil in subjects with locally advanced and unresectable and metastatic NSCLC who were refractory to, or have relapsed on, an anti-PD-1 containing regimen. MILs™ - NSCLC are an adoptive cell therapy product derived via the activation and expansion of bone marrow T cells. Subjects will have bone marrow harvested during the Screening Period which will be used to manufacture the MILs™ - NSCLC. The MILs™ - NSCLC will then be administered on Day 0. Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 and will continue every four weeks until treatment discontinuation. Tadalafil will be administered on Day 1 and will continue daily until treatment discontinuation.
