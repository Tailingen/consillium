First-line Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer With Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine
ALPACA is an interventional, multicentre, open-label, randomized active-controlled phase II trial with two arms.

To estimate the treatment effect on overall survival, feasibility, efficacy and safety of alternating treatment cycles of gemcitabine monotherapy followed by nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine relative to standard continuing nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine cycles in first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in patients having received 3 cycles of induction therapy with standard nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine.
