Exploratory Study of Molecular Profile-Associated Evidence Guided Precision Therapy for Salivary Gland Cancer（MAPS）
To explore the feasibility, efficacy and safety of determining the treatment regimen based on genomic profiling in patients with locally advanced and advanced salivary gland cancer.
Salivary Gland Neoplasms
DRUG: Pyrotinib|DRUG: Bicalutamide|DRUG: Leuprorelin
Molecular mutation profile of patients with salivary gland cancer, To explore the complete picture of molecular mutations in locally advanced and advanced salivary gland tumors in China, 18 months|Proportion of patients who receive molecular guided therapy, Proportion of patients who have actionable genomic alterations and receive matched therapy based on genomic profile(s), 18 months
Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients, PFS of patients with locally advanced and advanced salivary gland cancer, 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR in patients with advanced salivary gland cancer, 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS of patients with locally advanced and advanced salivary gland cancer, 2 years|Proportion of patients with actionable genomic alteration, To calculate the proportion of patients with actionable genomic alteration(s), 2 years|Treatment-related adverse events (AEs), The grade of AEs and the number of patients with AEs are assessed by the investigator based on CTCAE v5.0 from the date of enrollment to 90 days after last dose of study treatment, 2 years
This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized single-center study to evaluate the feasibility of using molecular profile-based evidence to guide personalized therapy for patients with incurable salivary gland carcinoma patients. Comprehensive Genomic Profiling is performed on tissue with assessment of tumor mutation burden (TMB) status, and additional PD-L1 immunohistochemistry testing. Study Committee or Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) will recommend matched therapy, if available, following analysis of patient genomic profiles. The final treatment administered will be based on the treating physician's choice with MTB advice, patient preference, comorbidity considerations, and available drug access. Access to medication followed real-world practice.
