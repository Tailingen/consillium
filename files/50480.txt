Eribulin Mesylate and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial is studying the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate and cisplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: eribulin mesylate|DRUG: cisplatin|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
Maximum tolerated dose determined by dose-limiting toxicity graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0, 28 days
Survival, Summarized with Kaplan-Meier plots to describe the outcome of patients treated on this protocol., From first day of treatment to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 8 weeks|Time to failure, Summarized with Kaplan-Meier plots to describe the outcome of patients treated on this protocol., Up to 8 weeks
Primary Objectives:

I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of E7389 and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

II. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

Outline: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV over 5 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 8 weeks.
