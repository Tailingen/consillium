Safety and Clinical Activity Study of Combination Azacitidine and Avelumab in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)
This is a phase I / II study. The purposes of this study are to: 1) find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of the experimental drug avelumab and the drug azacitidine has on people with AML and MRD, and 2) test if the two drugs, avelumab and azacitidine, are effective in getting rid of AML MRD when the drugs are given together in combination.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Minimal Residual Disease
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Avelumab
Number of patients with dose limiting toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 6 pre-allo SCT patients who are evaluable for DLT will be enrolled, with the first 3 patients enrolled in a sequential manner with a 1-week interval between the start of dosing for each patient. If the regimen appears tolerable in the first 3 patients (i.e., â‰¤ 1 of the first 3 patients enrolled experiences a DLT), then the next 3 patients will be enrolled concurrently. If more than 1 out of 6 in the pre-alloSCT group has a DLT, the trial will stop accrual. The combination will be considered safe in pre-allo SCT patients if one or no patient has a DLT out of the six patients. If the combination is safe in pre-alloSCT patients, additional pre-alloSCT patients will begin enrollment for the expanded phase II portion of the study, and accrual of 6 post-alloSCT patients for separate safety evaluation will begin. Toxicity will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 as described by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0., 1 year|sustained MRD negativity (Phase II), This is defined as the time from the first dose of azacitidine to a patient"s confirmed MRD negativity on the second bone marrow., 1 year
