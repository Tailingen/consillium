Endocervical Evaluation With the Curette Versus Cytobrush for the Diagnosis of Dysplasia of the Uterine Cervix
OBJECTIVE: to compare endocervical brushing with endocervical curettage with respect to diagnostic and patient discomfort.

METHOD: women referred to colposcopy because of abnormal Papanicolaou tests will be randomized to endocervical sampling with either a metal curette (endocervical curettage -ECC) or and endocervical brush. All samples will be submitted for histological study.
Cervical Dysplasia
PROCEDURE: Curette v/s endocervical brush
Specimen adequacy, Cytological and histological interpretation of the endocervical brush specimens will then be performed, while for the endocervical currete specimens only histological interpretation will be done. The adequacy of the specimens will be based on the quantity of endocervical cells present (\< or ≥ 20 endocervical cells), the quantity of histological material (\< or ≥ 3 epithelial stripes) and the quality of histological material (absence or presence of lamina propia)., 09/2011 - 05/2012 (1 year)
Patient discomfort, To evaluate the degree of patient discomfort, patients will be requested to complete a questionnaire once the exam has been completed. The main acceptance variables will be degree of helplessness, pain (on visual analog scales), willingness to undergo the test again, and overall satisfaction. Once the exam has been completed, the doctor performing the sampling will answer a questionnaire indicating his/her perception of the exam (patient's pain, technical difficulty performing the exam, doctors acceptability of the exam)., 09/2011 to 05/2012 (8 months)
