A Phase III Trial Comparing Tisagenlecleucel to Standard of Care (SoC) in Adult Participants With r/r Follicular Lymphoma
This trial will compare tisagenlecleucel to standard of care in adult participants with relapsed or refractory (r/r) follicular lymphoma.
Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
BIOLOGICAL: Tisagenlecleucel|DRUG: Lenalidomide and rituximab (R2) in 28-day cycles for up to 12 cycles.|DRUG: Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone or prednisolone (R-CHOP) in 21-day cycles for 6 to 8 cycles|DRUG: Lymphodepleting chemotherapy|OTHER: Corticosteroids and/or Radiation (Bridging therapy)
Progression-free survival (PFS) determined by blinded independent review committee (BIRC), Progression free survival (PFS) based on Lugano response criteria, defined as time from randomization to the first of the following events to occur:

* progressive disease (by BIRC)
* death from any cause, 5 years
Complete response rate (CRR) as assessed by BIRC (Key Secondary), CRR: The proportion of participants with BOR of complete response (CR), 5 years|Overall response rate (ORR) by BIRC, ORR: The proportion of participants with BOR of either CR or partial response (PR), 5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS: Time from randomization to date of death due to any cause, 5 years|Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), TTNT: Time from randomization until start of new anticancer therapy or death due to any cause., 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Time from the date of first documented BIRC response of CR or PR to the date of first documented progression by BIRC or any cause of death, 5 years|Pre-existing (prior to treatment) and treatment-induced anti-mCAR antibodies (humoral immunogenicity), Summarize percentage of patients with pre-existing and treatment-induced anti-mCAR antibodies, and relate the antibody responses with CAR expansion, efficacy, and safety endpoints., 5 years|Anti-mCAR, T cell response, as measured by IFNÎ³ expression (cellular immunogenicity), Summarize cellular immunogenicity by pre-infusion and post-infusion timepoints, and correlate cellular immunogenicity signals with CAR expansion, efficacy, and safety endpoints., 5 years|CAR transgene levels, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), in peripheral blood, bone marrow (and other tissues, if available), Summary of transgene levels by timepoints and by clinical responses, cellular kinetic parameters will be derived using non-compartmental analysis from time course of transgene levels and will be summarized by clinical responses., 5 years|Replication competent lentivirus (RCL) by VSV-g qPCR in participants receiving tisagenlecleucel, This is to assess presence of (Replication competent lentivirus) RCL in participants receiving tisagenlecleucel by VSV-g qPCR, 5 years
The purpose of this phase III study is to verify the clinical benefit of tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of r/r FL by comparing the tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy to standard of care therapy in patients with r/r FL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint.

The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of the tisagenlecleucel treatment strategy over standard of care (SOC) therapy with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) determined by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) based on the Lugano response criteria.

Participants randomized to Arm A (tisagenlecleucel treatment) will receive a single infusion of 0.6 to 6 x 10\^8 CAR-positive viable T-cells.

Participants randomized to Arm B (Standard of Care) will receive R2 or R-CHOP based on investigator choice and this has to be determined prior to randomization.
