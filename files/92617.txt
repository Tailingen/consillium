DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Clinical instrumental examinations
Detection of epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus, Detection of epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus by means of upper GI endoscopy, 1 year
Result of achalasia treatment by investigating dysphagia and gastro-esophageal reflux, Result of achalasia treatment assessed by means of semiquantitative grading scales of dysphagia and gastro-esophageal reflux, 1 year
In order to define incidence and risk factors for epidermoid carcinoma 681 patients affected by esophageal achalasia observed since 1973 were followed up with no time limits according to a prospective follow-up protocol. The local institutional review board approved using the database from the division of thoracic surgery for research purposes. Clinical, radiological and endoscopic data of achalasia patients were collected and analyzed.
