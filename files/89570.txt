Using Text Messages to Improve Oral Chemotherapy for Adolescents and Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The purpose of this section is to learn how text message reminders might help with regularly taking chemotherapy medications for Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
OTHER: High Intensity|OTHER: No Text Messagings|OTHER: Low Intensity Text Messaging
To compare adherence to oral chemotherapy with mercaptopurine and methotrexate, To compare adherence to oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate during the first 84-day cycle of maintenance therapy for AYA patients with ALL on pediatric-based regimens between those who receive the high intensity text message intervention and those who receive standard of care., 84 days
To describe the relationship between oral chemotherapy adherence and AYA patient factors, At the start of cycle 1, Health Competence Beliefs Inventory (HCBI) scores will be collected as a baseline measurement of self-efficacy as measured in a prior AYA adherence study. Higher HCBI scores and lower ADI and SVM scores will be associated with higher adherence given prior associations with self-efficacy and family finances., 1 year
To compare percentage of time during maintenance at goal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count for AYA patients, ANC and platelet measurements are collected throughout maintenance to monitor for therapeutic goals and the potential need for dose changes as part of AYA Oncology pharmacist-led management program, 1 year|To compare clinical outcomes during and after maintenance therapy for AYA patients, Any changes in chemotherapy regimen or evidence of relapsed disease including new minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity within the first year of maintenance will be recorded., 1 year
This study aims to compare adherence to oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate during the first 84-day cycle of maintenance therapy for adolescent and young adult patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia on pediatric-based regimens between those who receive the high intensity text message intervention and those who receive standard-of-care. It is believed that high-intensity text messages will increase patient adherence within cycle 1.
