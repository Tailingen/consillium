Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients Scheduled for Surgery to Remove Ovarian Cancer
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving monoclonal antibodies in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Monoclonal antibody hu3S193
Number of Subjects With Grade 3 Adverse Events, All toxicities were to be graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Scale, version 2.0, March 1998.The study was to be terminated upon the occurrence of an adverse event of Grade 3 or greater severity that is considered definitely related to hu3S193., up to 30 days
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective iss to determine the safety of indium (111In) monoclonal antibody (mAb) hu3S193 (111In-hu3S193) given intraperitoneally or intravenously in patients with ovarian carcinoma.

Secondary objectives include comparing the localization of 111In-hu3S193 in ovarian cancer tissue after intraperitoneal vs intravenous injection and the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of this drug when administered intraperitoneally vs intravenously in these patients as well as the formation of human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms on a first come sequential basis. Arm I: Patients receive indium (In 111) monoclonal antibody hu3S193 (111In-hu3S193) intraperitoneally over 30 minutes. Arm II: Patients received 111In-hu3S193 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients were to undergo surgical debulking 3-7 days following In 111In-hu3S193 administration, and biopsy samples obtained to assess radioactive uptake. Immunohistochemistry was also to be performed. Blood samples were to be obtained to assess serum radioactivity. Whole body imaging was tp be performed 3 hours after infusion of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, on the day of surgery, and at one time point in between. Patients were followed for 30 days.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) were to be accrued for this study.
