Autophagy Bladder Cancer
â€¢ Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. It represents the 7th most commonly diagnosed cancer in male population worldwide and drops to the 11th when both genders are considered . According to the American cancer society's estimates of bladder cancer in 2017, the number of the new cases of bladder cancer is 79,030, and the mortality figures reached 16,870 .

autophagy marker, differences in the level of Atg7(autophagy marker) in Low Grade bladder cancer and High Grade bladder cancer groups in comparison with safety margin and healthy control group., baseline
stress markers, Relation between LC3A and muscle invasiveness in bladder cancer progression, and relation between levels of ATF6, activating transcription factor6 (ER stress marker) -MDA malondialdehyde (oxidative stress marker)-Caspase3 (apoptotic marker) in different study groups and bladder cancer development., baseline
* In Egypt, Bladder Cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among Egyptian males (16%) producing more than 7900 deaths annually . The majority of patients with bladder cancer about (70-80%) present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer .
* Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that degrades cellular organelles and proteins to maintain cellular biosynthesis during stress ; cancer cells induced autophagy to counteract with anticancer therapy by helping them to evade apoptotic pathway .Autophagy is achieved by many autophagy-related genes .
* Previous studies found that human bladder cancer cell lines exhibit high basal level of autophagic activity that may contribute to resistance to current anticancer treatment, so targeting basal autophagy may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies . Autophagy is potently induced by activating transcription factor 6(Endoplasmic Reticulum stress marker) , and Malondialdehyde (oxidative stress marker) .
* Recently several studies demonstrated the role of autophagy in Bladder Cancer progression as evidenced by detection of microtubule associated protein and its relevance with muscle invasion beside its grade dependency . Autophagy was grade dependent process . Autophagy related gene 7 is a key protein involved in autophagosomes biogenesis, Knockdown of Autophagy related gene 7 induced apoptotic cell death in bladder cancer cell lines measured by increased caspase 3 level, Based on these previous studies autophagy plays a role in bladder cancer progression so interruption of its pathway may serve a novel target for future therapies.
