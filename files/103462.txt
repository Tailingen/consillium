Prevention of Neutropenia After Using G-CSF With TAC Chemotherapy
After resection of lymph node positive breast cancer, the injection duration and timing of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) could affect the neutropenia with TAC (Taxotere, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy.
Neutropenia
DRUG: late leukostim|DRUG: early leukostim
frequency of neutropenia, during the 1 cycle (21days) of ajuvant chemotherapy with TAC, record the frequency of neutropenia aftr using G-CSF (Leucostim), Change from Baseline in neutrophil count at 21days
The duration and the injection timing of G-CSF are effective in the prevention of neutropenia, incidence of infection and non hematologic toxicity. With the TAC chemotherapy after resection of breast cancer, the G-CSF early injection versus late injection could change the frequency of neutropenia.
