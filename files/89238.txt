An Innovative Smartphone Application for Adverse Event Management During Breast Cancer Adjuvant Chemotherapy
The aim of this study is to evaluate benefits of the app in breast cancer patients receiving the docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy. The investigators hypothesized that the addition of the app to conventional adverse event management would increase quality of life (QoL) scores and reduce adverse events.

Change from baseline quality of life scores at 4 months, Quality of life scores will be assessed using the simplified Chinese version of the Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3)., 1 day before the first cycle, and 4 months after the first cycle (each cycle is 21 days)
Incidence and severity of 12 common adverse events, The incidence and severity of 12 common adverse events will be measured with the WHO-toxicity scale., 4 months after the first cycle (each cycle is 21 days)
