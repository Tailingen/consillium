Pyrimethamine for the Treatment of Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
In this research study we will start by looking for the highest dose of pyrimethamine that can be given safely to CLL patients without severe or unmanageable side effects. This dose will then be used for a larger Phase II study to assess the efficacy of pyrimethamine for the treatment of CLL/SLL. Pyrimethamine is an antibiotic that is used for the treatment of certain infections. Previous research studies have shown that pyrimethamine may target a protein in tumor cells, called STAT3, which may be important for the growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) cells. Pyrimethamine can kill CLL/SLL cells in the laboratory, and we are therefore undertaking this study to assess whether pyrimethamine will result in clinical benefit or tumor responses in CLL in patients.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: pyrimethamine
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose pyrimethamine, Disease were evaluated weekly in 1st 28 days, and every 2 weeks in 2nd cycle then monthly. Median treatment duration is 1.07 months with range 0.23-9.99 months.|Phase II: Overall Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions., Within 10 days of the completion of the cycle required for response evaluation
Incidence of Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-Related Toxicity, All grade 3 or higher adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on CTCAE as reported on case report forms were counted. Incidence is the number of patients experiencing at least one treatment-related grade 3 or higher AE of any type during the time of observation., Disease were evaluated weekly in 1st 28 days, and every 2 weeks in 2nd cycle then monthly. Median treatment duration is 1.07 months with range 0.23-9.99 months.|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease were evaluated weekly in 1st 28 days, and every 2 weeks in 2nd cycle then monthly, and every 3-6 months during the follow-up.
* Participants will be required to enroll in DFCI Protocol 99-224, the CLL Research Consortium Tissue Bank, and DFCI Protocol 01-206, Tissue and Data Collection for Research Studies in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies, Bone Marrow Disorders, and Normal Donors, or may have blood banked for future use.
* Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time participants will take pyrimethamine orally once per day. Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of study drug.
* The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time points during participation in the study: Physical exam, vital signs, blood tests and bone marrow biopsy. The participant's tumor will be assessed by CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis prior to the start of the study and at the end of the 1st, 3rd and 6th months.
* Participants can continue to receive pyrimethamine as long as they do not have side effects and their disease does not worsen.
