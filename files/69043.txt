Risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events for Naldemedine & Other Medications for Opioid Induced Constipation
The research objective is to characterize the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) among new users of naldemedine versus new users of lubiprostone and new users of naloxegol as comparator opioid induced constipation (OIC) medications.
Opioid-induced Constipation
DRUG: Naldemedine|DRUG: Lubiprostone|DRUG: Naloxegol
Number of Participants with a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event, A composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular (CV) death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke; participants with major adverse cardiovascular events will be identified using claims data and the national death index., 5 years
Number of Participants with Cardiovascular Death, Cardiovascular death is defined by the underlying cause of death and will include death from acute MI, sudden cardiac death, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular procedure, cardiovascular hemorrhage, and other cardiovascular causes. Cardiovascular death will be identified using claims data and the national death index., 5 years|Number of Participants with Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction, Participants with nonfatal myocardial infarction will be identified using claims data., 5 years|Number of Participants with Nonfatal Stroke, Participants with nonfatal stroke will be identified using claims data., 5 years
This is a prevalent new user cohort study conducted using multiple databases linkable to medical records and the National Death Index (NDI) to assess MACE risk among adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain receiving naldemedine or a comparator OIC medication. The uptake of naldemedine and comparator OIC medications will be monitored for each database annually until a sufficient number of patients to support the comparative analyses in the safety assessment phase is accrued. The safety assessment phase will commence at the conclusion of the monitoring phase.
