DRUG: LEO 43204 gel|DRUG: Vehicle gel
Percentage of Participants With Complete Clearance of Actinic Keratosis (AK), The number of clinically visible actinic keratosis lesions (AKs) identified in the treatment area was recorded at Day 1 (baseline), Week 4 and Week 8.

Complete clearance was defined as no clinically visible AKs in the treatment area., At Week 8
Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance of AKs, Partial clearance was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in the number of clinically visible AKs in the treatment area., At Week 8|Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance of AKs, Partial clearance was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in the number of clinically visible AKs in the treatment area., At Week 4|Percent Reduction in AK Count in the Treatment Area Compared to Baseline, The percent reduction at Week 8 from baseline was analysed using a negative binomial regression for the AK count at Week 8 with treatment group and pooled sites as factors and baseline count as offset variable. The table presents adjusted mean percent reduction at Week 8 from baseline., At Week 8
