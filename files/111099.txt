Correlation of Peritoneal Fluid CA-125 Levels With Postoperative Tumor Histology
In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate whether serum and abdominal washing fluid CA-125 levels correlated with postoperative histopathological parameters in patients with endometrial carcinoma.

Abdominal washing fluid CA-125 levels, One year
Endometrial cancer was diagnosed with histopathological examination of the samples obtained by dilatation and curettage. Preoperative serum CA-125 levels were determined in all patients. Serum and abdominal washing fluid CA-125 levels were measured with a double antibody sandwich immunoenzymatic method, using Beckman Coulter DXI (Ireland) analyzer. In addition to routine preoperative investigations, MRI was done in patients who were thought to have an extension outside the uterus.

During surgery, abdominal exploration was performed first, and then an abdominal fluid sample was obtained for cytological examination and measurement of CA-125 level. One hundred milliliters of normal saline was used as the abdominal washing liquid to obtain the sample for CA-125 measurement. Subsequently, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH + BSO) were performed.
