Bendamustine Hydrochloride (HCl) in Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma That Has Progressed During or Following Treatment With a Rituximab Regimen or Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate additional safety data of bendamustine in up to 100 patients with Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (iNHL) relapsing from a rituximab regimen or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Patients will receive up to 6 or 8 cycles of bendamustine treatment using the dosing regimens of TREANDA® (bendamustine) approved in several countries, which have been shown to be reasonably well tolerated. The study protocol includes safety monitoring (i.e., adverse events, concomitant medications, supportive care, clinical safety laboratory tests, and clinical disease status monitoring).

It is an interventional, multicentre, prospective, open-label expanded access study, which in addition allows investigators in Canada, and their patients, access to bendamustine while it is pending Canadian marketing approval.

Although the treatment options available for patients with iNHL or CLL do induce substantial responses, there is no curative treatment. One potential drug candidate for the treatment of CLL and iNHL is bendamustine.

Bendamustine has been widely used in Germany for more than 30 years and is marketed in the United States for treatment of CLL and for treatment of iNHL that has progressed during or within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. In October 2010, the European Medicines Agency formally approved bendamustine in a number of Member States of the European Union for the treatment of patients with iNHL, CLL, and multiple myeloma. The drug's safety profile in these patient populations has been extensively characterized and no unexpected safety concerns are anticipated.
