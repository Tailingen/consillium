Outcomes of HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) Patients Treated With TACE (Transarterial Chemoembolization) and Early, Not Early or Not at All Followed by Sorafenib
This study will collect data of patients who are treated with TACE followed by sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or patients without Sorafenib after TACE. In contrast to a prior observational study on sorafenib (GIDEON study), where pre-treatment with TACE was documented retrospectively, this study will collect more detailed information about the TACE treatment and the status of a patient when treatment with sorafenib is started.
