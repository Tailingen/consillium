Atezolizumab Combined With Chemotherapy in Extensive Stage SCLC
CLINATEZO cohort will evaluate overall survival, real world progression-free survival, best response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced, metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) who received atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy part of the French Early Access Program (ATU). Subsequent treatments (treatment delivered immediately after treatment with atezolizumab and chemotherapy) will be recorded. Those outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.

Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment with atezolizumab and chemotherapy to death from any cause., OS will be measured at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 3 years and 4 years.

Standard-of-care first-line treatment for advanced, metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer is platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) with etoposide. Despite response rates of 60 to 65%, limited progress has been made in more than two decades; outcomes remain poor, with a median overall survival of approximately 10 months. Small cell lung cancer has a high mutation burden, which suggests that these tumors may be immunogenic and could respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that inhibits PD-L1-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1-B7-1 signaling and restores tumor-specific T-cell immunity.

The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced, metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer has been granted access for patients in France part of an Early access program (ATU), in May 2019.
