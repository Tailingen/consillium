Genotype-directed Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Rectal Carcinoma
Determine if genotype-directed neoadjuvant chemoradiation, using information from the thymidylate synthase promoter polymorphism, result in a greater degree of tumor downstaging in high risk patients compared to historical controls.
Rectal Carcinoma
DRUG: 5FU|RADIATION: Radiation|PROCEDURE: Surgery of resectable lesions|DRUG: Irinotecan
Rate of Tumor Downstaging Compared With Historical Controls., Tumor downstaging (DS) is defined as a decrease in the T stage of the primary tumor by at least 1.

Historical studies demonstrate a DS rate of 45%., 1 year after enrollment
Complete Response Rates, Complete tumor response is defined as the absence of any viable tumor in the rectum (ypT0).

Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as the absence of any viable tumor in the rectum or in the perirectal lymph nodes (ypT0N0).

pCR rate of historical controls is 8%-14%., 1 year after enrollment|Define Patient Quality of Life Prior to and Following Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation., The questionnaire is encouraged but not required., Prior to start of study treatment and 3-6 weeks post completion of radiation therapy|Determine Patient Fears and Expectations of Pharmacogenetics., The questionnaire is encouraged but not required., Prior to start of study treatment and 3-6 weeks post completion of radiation therapy
Determine if genotype-directed neoadjuvant chemoradiation, using information from the thymidylate synthase promoter polymorphism, result in a greater degree of tumor downstaging in high risk patients compared to historical controls.
