Safety and Pharmacokinetics of XL647 Administered Orally to Subjects With Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is as follows:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL647 administered orally as a single dose and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors.

The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

* To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of XL647 administered orally as a single dose and as repeat doses in subjects with solid tumors,
* To estimate renal elimination of XL647 administered orally as a single dose in subjects with solid tumors.

The exploratory objective of this study is as follows:

* To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of XL647 administration in plasma and peripheral blood cells.

In addition, subjects may be eligible to enter a Treatment Extension Period. The following information will be obtained from this part of the study:

* Long-term safety and tolerability of XL647 after repeat administration,
* Tumor response after repeat administration of XL647.
