Image-Guided Functional Lung Avoidance Thoracic Radiotherapy for Lung Cancer: A Single-Blind Randomized Trial
Thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is a standard curative treatment for locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and limited stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). TRT has been recognized to cause moderate to severe lung injury in a substantial portion of patients. Conventional standard curative TRT planning techniques minimize the radiation dose to the anatomical lungs, without adaption of regional pulmonary function variations. The principal investigator hypothesized that preferential avoidance of functional lung during curative TRT may decrease the risk of pulmonary toxicity. Functional lung regions are identified using four- dimensional computed tomography for ventilation imaging. This randomized, single-blind trial will comprehensively assess the impact of functional lung avoidance on pulmonary toxicity, quality of life, and clinical outcome in patients receiving curative TRT for locally advanced NSCLC and SCLC.
