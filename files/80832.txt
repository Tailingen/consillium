FT516 in Combination With Monoclonal Antibodies in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose-finding study of FT-516 in combination with monoclonal antibodies in participants with advanced solid tumors. The study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage where participants will be enrolled into indication-specific cohorts.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: FT516|DRUG: Avelumab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: IL-2
Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Within Each Dose Level Cohort, The incidence of DLTs within each dose level cohort will be reported. A DLT is any adverse event (AE) that is at least possibly related to FT516 that occurs after the first FT516 infusion through the end of the DLT assessment period on Cycle 1 Day 29, and meets 1 of the criteria from the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0 or the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) Consensus Grading Guidelines for Cytokine Release Syndrome and Neurological Toxicity Associated with Immune Effector Cells., Up to Day 29 after the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Severity of DLTs Within Each Dose Level Cohort, The severity of DLTs within each cohort will be reported. DLT is any adverse event (AE) that is at least possibly related to FT516 that occurs after the first FT516 infusion through the end of the DLT assessment period on Cycle 1 Day 29, and meets 1 of the criteria from the NCI CTCAE v5.0 or the ASTCT Consensus Grading Guidelines for Cytokine Release Syndrome and Neurological Toxicity Associated with Immune Effector Cells., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Number of Participants with â‰¥1 Adverse Events (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participants temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to 15 years|Investigator-Assessed Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is the time from the first occurrence of a documented, objective response until the time of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) response criteria., Up to 15 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with Stable Disease more than 6 months, Partial Response or Complete Response, per iRECIST response criteria., Up to 15 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of lympho-conditioning to disease progression or to the day of death for any reason, whichever occurs first, per iRECIST response criteria., Up to 15 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first dose of lympho-conditioning to death from any cause., Up to 15 years|Determination of PK of FT516 in peripheral blood, The pharmacokinetics of FT516 in peripheral blood will be reported as the relative percentage of product (FT516) DNA versus patient DNA (% chimerism) measured from blood samples at the specified time points, Study Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 18, 22, 29
