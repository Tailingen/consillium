A Local Retrospective Observational Study to Evaluate the Treatment Patterns of mCRPC Patients in Belgium Treated With Radium-223
The aim of this non interventional study is to describe the proportion of Belgian mCRPC patients which were treated with 1 to 4 and 5 to 6 Radium-223 injections and the patient characteristics which are potentially associated with this proportion.
