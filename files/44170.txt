Assessing the Prognosis of TACE in Combination With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors and Molecular Target Therapies for HCC by Using Clinical and Imaging Biomarkers
The purpose of this study is to id

transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular targeted therapies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) .
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Overall Survival(OS), The OS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to death due to any cause., up to approximately 2 years
Specificity, The specificity of the radiomics artificial intelligence model for identifying optimal candidates among patients who treated TACE in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and molecular target therapy will be calculated., baseline|Sensitivity, The sensitivity of the radiomics artificial intelligence model for identifying optimal candidates among patients who treated TACE in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and molecular target therapy will be calculated., baseline|The area under curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of the radiomics artificial intelligence mode, The area under curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of the radiomics artificial intelligence model for identifying optimal candidates among patients who treated TACE in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and molecular target therapy will be calculated., baseline|Accuracy, Defined by a confusion matrix of sensitivity and specificity to true positives and true negatives., baseline
