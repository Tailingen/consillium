Understanding and Overcoming the Early Adaptive Resistance to EGFR Tyrosine-kinase Inhibitors in Lung Cancer Patients
Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) are effective therapies for advanced lung cancer patients bearing EGFR-activating mutations, but are not curative due to the invariable apparition of resistances. The investigator team have identified a new phenotype related to drug tolerance after EGFR-TKI treatment that shares several characteristics of a known process of Therapy-Induced Senescence (TIS), which could be a major event of drug tolerance in patients. Using cutting-edge technologies, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and circulating tumor cells (CTC), the investigator team will perform an exhaustive characterization of the phenotypic and molecular changes associated with this drug-tolerant state in patients. Their results should lead to new therapeutic approaches to eliminate the reservoir of drug-tolerant cells and to prevent emergence of resistance mutations responsible for the relapse of patients.

OTHER: Blood samples
Rate of EGFR mutated patients for whom phenotypic characterization of DTC-like and osimertinib-tolerant tumor cells is feasible., Rate of EGFR mutated patients for whom the DTC phenotype has been characterized at T0 (Baseline), T1 month, T3 month, Tn month, T antideoxyribonuclease (ADN) Circulant+, T progression, Up to one year or progression
Rate of patients for whom the molecular characterization of DTC-like cells is successfully performed., This rate id defined by the number of patients who are successful compared to the total number of patients. Failure is defined by a patient with circulating tumor cells for which molecular characterization of DTC-like cells could not be performed at all measurement times., Up to one year or progression|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the delay between the date of the patient's inclusion and the date of progression or death. Patients alive and without progression will be censored on the date of last news or on the date of initiation of a new anti-cancer therapy (if applicable)., Up to one year or progression or death
LUNG-RESIST is a translational, monocentric and prospective research study on 40 patients whose objective is to characterize Drug Tolerant Cell (DTC) type cells in patients with a NSCLC carrying an EGFR mutation and to discover and monitor potentials biomarkers involved in this mechanism of resistance to osimertinib. The study will be offered to patients, and for whom the therapeutic decision was decided collegially during multidisciplinary molecular meetings (molecular Tumor Board). Following informed consent, patients will be registered in a single cohort. In this study, treatment with osimertinib is not studied and will be delivered according to current recommendations
