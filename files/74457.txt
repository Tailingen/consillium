A Study of Sirolimus (Albumin-Bound) in Combination With Palbociclib and Fulvestrant for the Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer
This study adopts multicenter/randomized trial design. It plans to enroll patients with HR- positive, HER2- negative advanced breast cancer who are resistant to (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy. Dose-escalation and dose-expansion studies will be carried out to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of sirolimus (albumin-bound) in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in this patient population.
