Frontline Therapy in de Novo Multiple Myeloma Patients Under 65
The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with untreated multiple myeloma. This study will evaluate whether the addition of lenalidomide to bortezomib and dexamethasone will increase the Complete Response (CR)/ very good partial response (VGPR) rate before and after High Dose Therapy (HDT) with ASCT.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide, Bortezomib
Evaluation of the best response after consolidation, Evaluate the best response achieved , according to the IMWG uniform criteria, after consolidation treatment., 6 to 8 months after start of induction for each patient = after consolidation therapy for all patients
Response Evaluation after 3 cycles, Evaluate the complete and very good partial response rates of the combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients after 3 cycles., 6 to 8 months after start of induction for each patient = after consolidation therapy for all patients|Safety and tolerability : number and nature of Adverse Events, Determine the safety and tolerability of the drug combination in this patient populations., 6 to 8 months after start of induction for each patient = after consolidation therapy for all patients|Stem Cells Collection, Evaluate the faisability and quality of the peripheral stem cells collection., 6 to 8 months after start of induction for each patient = after consolidation therapy for all patients|Response After HDT-ASCT and 2 cycles, Evaluate the complete and very good partial response rates 2 months after HDT with ASCT and after 2 cycles of consolidation treatment., 6 to 8 months after start of induction for each patient = after consolidation therapy for all patients|Progression Free Survival, Evaluate the progression free survival, the overall survival, time to progression and duration of response., 6 to 8 months after start of induction for each patient = after consolidation therapy for all patients
Patients will receive 3 induction cycles of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRD) followed by high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. Two months after haematological recovery, patients will receive 2 consolidation cycles of VRD and maintenance therapy for 1 year with lenalidomide
