Using Ex Vivo Tumoroids To Predict Immunotherapy Response In NSCLC
To test whether it is feasible to perform the 3D-EX functional predictive response bioassay in the context of patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors in the standard of care clinical setting.

DRUG: Standard of care immune checkpoint inhbitors
Feasibility of establishing 3D ex-vivo tumoroid model, Twenty-five patients will be enrolled. The bioassay will be considered to be feasible if the 3D Ex-Vivo assay results are obtained on at least 20 patients., 2 years
Correlation of response in ex vivo tumoroids with clinical objective response, To test whether the 3D-EX functional response bioassay can predict tumor response (using RECIST v1.1) in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC, receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, in a standard clinical setting., 2 years
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Immunotherapy such as using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to target the programmed death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/L1) has revolutionized our management of this deadly disease.

However, a large proportion of patients do not derive benefit due to primary, adaptive or acquired resistance. Hence, better identifying this patient population, understanding the resistance mechanism and exploring novel combinations with current SOC immunotherapy are urgently needed to continue to benefit our NSCLC patients.

The investigators hypothesize that patient-derived immune cell containing ex-vivo tumoroids could serve these purposes. In this study, the investigators plan to develop such a 3D ex-vivo system utilizing fresh biopsied tissue from NSCLC patients. The investigators plan to prospectively evaluate the value of these ex-vivo tumoroids in immunotherapy naive advanced/metastatic NSCLC patients who will be receiving anti-PD-1/L1 (with or without anti-CTLA-4) per standard-of-care.
