HS-IT201 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumor. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving lymphodepletion treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by infusion of autologous TIL, then finnaly followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
