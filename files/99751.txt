Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing MBSR to SET in Breast Cancer Patients
This study will compare three standard treatment programs commonly offered to patients with breast cancer. The three programs being compared are 1) Mindfulness Meditation-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), 2)Supportive- Expressive Group Therapy (SET), and 3) A one day stress-management seminar. The purpose of this study is to determine if these three treatments have different effects on psychological well-being, the immune system, and the amount of stress hormones in the bloodstream.
