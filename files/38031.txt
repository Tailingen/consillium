Improvement in total sleep minutes, Change in the total number of sleep minutes over time in the standard of care intervention compared to the change in the total number of sleep minutes over time in the massage therapy intervention. Sleep minutes are measured by actigraphy., 3 weeks
Improvement in sleep quality as demonstrated by circadian activity rhythms (CARs), Amount of dysrgulation in CARs in the standard of care intervention compared to the amount of dysregulation in CARs in the massage therapy intervention. Dysregulation in CARs will be measured by actigraphy (24-h autocorrelation)., 3 weeks
Hospitalized pediatric oncology patients report anxiety, pain, disturbed sleep, and excess fatigue. Massage is safe, does not interfere with medications, and has been shown in limited studies to have efficacy in improving sleep as well as decreasing fatigue, anxiety and other symptoms in cancer patients and children with various ailments.

This project aims to determine if individualized massage therapy for hospitalized pediatric patients receiving intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplant (SCT) is associated with longer duration and improved quality of sleep, more robust circadian rhythms (CARs), improved quality of life (QOL) and reduced fatigue, anxiety, and pain, as compared to a standard of care group.
