Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Gemcitabine in Patients With Specific Unresectable Solid Tumors
Phase I multicenter, open-label, clinical and pharmacokinetic study of PM01183 in combination with gemcitabine in non-heavily pretreated patients with selected advanced solid tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 in combination with gemcitabine, to characterize the safety profile and feasibility of this combination in patients with selected advanced solid tumors, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity in non-heavily pretreated selected solid tumor patients and to evaluate the pharmacogenomics (PGx) in tumor samples of patients exposed, in order to assess potential markers of response and/or resistance.
Specific Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: lurbinectedin (PM01183)|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Recommended Dose (RD), The RD will be the highest dose level explored at which less than one third of evaluable patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1., 19 months
Pharmacokinetics (PK) characterisation, The dose-exposure relationships for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) will be evaluated., 19 months|Preliminary antitumor efficacy, To obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity of this combination in non-heavily pretreated selected solid tumor patients, 29 months|Pharmacogenomics (PGx), to identify molecular markers whose expression may be associated with the clinical outcome of patients. These molecular markers might allow the identification of those patients who will benefit from PM01183 and gemcitabine treatment, thus improving the health care by an individualized medicine., 29 months
