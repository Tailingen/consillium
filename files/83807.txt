To Assess the Effect of Rifampicin on the Pharmacokinetics of Eribulin Mesylate in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) induction by rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin mesylate following intravenous (IV) administration in participants with advanced solid tumors. The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the safety of eribulin mesylate when co-administered with rifampicin and assess the safety and activity of eribulin mesylate as a single agent.

Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as a measure of safety, From date of administration of first dose up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, up to approximately 8 months.
The study consisted of 3 phases: Pre-Treatment, Treatment, and Extension. Pre-Treatment Phase had 2 periods: Screening and Baseline. Treatment Phase consisted of intensive PK assessment with eribulin mesylate given IV alone on Day 1 followed by eribulin mesylate given IV on Day 15 with rifampicin given orally from Days 9 to 20. Extension Phase allowed eribulin mesylate treatment to continue for participants without progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
