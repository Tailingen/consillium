Second Line Chemotherapy FOLFIRINOX in Irresectable Cholangiocarcinoma
Cholangiocarcinoma, is a malignant gastrointestinal tumor of low incidence with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for advanced disease. On the basis of a phase III clinical study, cisplatin plus gemcitabine is considered standard first-line treatment in advanced cholangiocarcinoma patients, but there is no established second line therapy.

Since fluorouracil and leucovorin combined with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) appears to be safe and demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies of advanced pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and a phase I study in cholangiocarcinoma, this combination could be an effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
