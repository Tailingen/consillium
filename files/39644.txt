Eflornithine (DFMO) and Etoposide for Relapsed/Refractory Neuroblastoma
Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) will be used in an open label, multicenter, study in combination with etoposide for subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Eflornithine
Number of participants with event free survival (EFS) during study, To evaluate the efficacy of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in combination with etoposide in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma, based upon:

o Event free survival (EFS) from time of enrollment., 2 years plus 5 years follow up
Length of time that participants experience Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the efficacy of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in combination with etoposide in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma, based upon:

o Overall Survival (OS) from time of enrollment., 7 years|Determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants using INSS Response Evaluation Criteria., To evaluate the efficacy of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in combination with etoposide in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma, based upon:

o Response Rate for patients with active disease (Arm 3) using International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) Response Evaluation Criteria., 2 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To monitor the safety and tolerability profile of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in combination with etoposide in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma., 2 years plus 30 days
Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) will be used in an open label, multicenter, study in combination with etoposide for subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

In this study subjects will receive six 21-day cycles of Etoposide and DFMO followed by an additional 630 days of DFMO alone.

Subjects will be evaluated in 3 arms:

â€¢ Arm 1: Subjects who show no active disease after receiving any additional therapy for neuroblastoma that was refractory to standard induction/consolidation therapy.

Refractory: Subjects with progressive disease on upfront therapy OR did not have at least PR on induction OR required additional second line therapy to achieve remission who are now in first remission.

* Arm 2: Subjects who have previously relapsed and currently show no active disease (in CR2 or greater).
* Arm 3: Subjects who are relapsed or refractory with active disease.
