MK-3475 Immunotherapy in Endometrial Carcinoma
Due to the high expression of PD-L1 in endometrial cancers as well as in ovarian cancers which are molecularly similar to uterine serous cancers, using pembrolizumab should be beneficial in this patient population. Since the investigators are able to get a pre-treatment research- related endometrial biopsy as well as the surgical specimen post two cycles of pembrolizumab, the investigators will be able to evaluate the mechanism of action of this drug on the endometrial cancer tumor environment.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Up to 2 years following completion of therapy (median follow-up of 35 months (full range 11.3-46 months)
