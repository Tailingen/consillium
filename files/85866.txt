Evaluation of Early Identification of Cognitive Side Effects of Immunotherapy
This clinical trial evaluates the use of a tool kit, Stress, Affect, Language and Speech Analysis (SALSA), for early identification of cognitive side effects of immunotherapy compared to the standard of care assessment.
Hematopoietic and Lymphatic System Neoplasm|Malignant Solid Neoplasm
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Proportion of patients completing at least 80 percent of planned SALSA administrations during post CAR-T hospitalization, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the feasibility of SALSA in CAR-T patients. The overall completion rate of will be calculated for each patient, as well as the pattern of completions., 18 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate the use of a toolkit for automated administration and scoring of cognitive tests (Stress, Language and Speech Analysis, or SALSA) in adult cancer patients who are treated with commercial chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) products at University of Minnesota and are at risk of developing immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients complete SALSA assessment and ICE assessments on study. Patients also have their medical records reviewed on study.
