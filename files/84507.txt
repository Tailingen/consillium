NYC Cancer Outreach Network in Neighborhoods for Equity and Community Translation
NYC CONNECT will carry out a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which will assess the relative effectiveness of two evidence-based strategies to increase cancer screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. The RCT will compare the effectiveness of using a combination of 1) culturally and linguistically tailored cancer education materials and 2) community health workers (CHWs) to provide navigation services for cancer screening (the "patient navigation" \[PN\] arm) versus providing culturally and linguistically tailored cancer education only (the "less intensive" \[LI\] arm). The study population will include individuals who are due for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening. All individuals recruited to the study will be provided navigation for unmet social determinants of health (SDH) needs.
