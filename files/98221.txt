FiH Study to Investigate Safety, PK and Efficacy of the NaPi2b ADC TUB-040 in Patients With PROC or r/r Adenocarcinoma NSCLC
The purpose of this multicentric, open label trial (NAPISTAR 1-01) is to evaluate the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of TUB-040 and to find the best dose of TUB-040 in patients with ovarian cancer and Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. TUB-040 is an antibody-drug-conjugate which delivers a topoisomerase I inhibitor to tumor cells which overexpress the target NaPi2b. The study consists of two parts: In dose escalation, ovarian cancer patients and lung cancer patients receive increasing doses of TUB-040 until the maximal tolerated dose is found. In dose optimization, at least two doses are compared with each other to determine which dose is optimal for patients.

TUB-040 is given IV every 3 weeks until the disease progresses or the patient has to stop due to side effects.
