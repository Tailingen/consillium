Patients will followed during two visits for a repeated invasive care. They will be randomized to two groups in a 1:1 ratio.

Crossover plan and arms are described as follow:

Arm A : Visit 1 with Snoezelen session before invasive care and Visit 2 without Snoezelen session before invasive care (standard care)

Arm B : Visit 1 without Snoezelen session before invasive care (standard care) and Visit 2 with Snoezelen session before invasive care
