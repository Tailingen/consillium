Pan-canceR Early DetectIon projeCT
PREDICT is a prospective, multi-center study for the early detection of pan-cancer through cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation based model, in which approximately 14,000 participants will be enrolled. The development and validation of the model will be conducted in participants with early stage cancers or benign diseases, along with non-tumor (healthy) individuals through a two-stage approach. The sensitivity and specificity of the model in cancer early detection will be evaluated, and the accuracy of the identification for tissue of origin will be obtained.
