CHEmotherapy and Cognitive Deterioration in Patients With Operable Breast Cancer: Impact of Cognitive Rehabilitation (CHEMOFOG)
An interventional, non-pharmacological, monocentric study evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in counteracting chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CRCI) in women with operable breast cancer treated with neo-adjuvant therapy and/ or adjuvant therapy.

The effectiveness of a 10-week cognitive rehabilitation program, Test the effectiveness of a 10-week cognitive rehabilitation program in limiting or preventing chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. To test the efficacy of this cognitive rehabilitation program, neurocognitive evaluations will be performed., Neurocognitive evaluations will be performed at T0 (before chemotherapy program start), T1 (after 6 months from chemotherapy started), and T2 (after 12 months from chemotherapy started)
Analysis of cognitive function trends in the control group, Analysis of cognitive function trends though neurocognitive evaluations, Neurocognitive evaluations will be performed at T0 (before chemotherapy program start), T1 (after 6 months from chemotherapy started), and T2 (after 12 months from chemotherapy started)
This interventional, non-pharmacological, monocentric study examines the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in counteracting CRCI in women with operable breast cancer treated with neo-adjuvant therapy and/ or adjuvant therapy.

A total of 128 patients will be randomized 1:1 into two groups:

* Experimental group, which will participate in a cognitive rehabilitation program using Neurotablet® and paper and pencil exercises. To evaluate the efficacy of the cognitive rehabilitation program, neurocognitive evaluations will be performed.
* Control group, which will only carry out neuropsychological assessments.

Neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted before the start of chemotherapy (T0), 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) after the start of chemotherapy. Neuropsychological evaluations will include tests to analyze the main cognitive domains of memory, attention, executive functions and learning.
