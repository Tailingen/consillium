Interleukin-2 in Metastatic Melanoma
To determine whether Interleukin-2 at the dose and schedule will help to increase tumor shrinkage
Melanoma Metastatic
DRUG: Interleukin-2
Response Rate, Radiographic studies to evaluate for response were done after every 2 cycles (6 weeks) until disease progression or death from any cause up to 2 years. Standard RECIST response criteria were utilized. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response Rate (ORR) = 100%(CR + PR/total number of patients receiving Interleukin-2)., Measured until Disease Progression or death from any cause up to 2 years
Median Duration of Response, Duration of response is calculated as the time (months) from the date at which response is first observed (per standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] to the date of first observed disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years. The actual date of tumor assessments was used for this calculation. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Measured until Disease Progression or death from any cause up to 2 years|Median Survival, Measured from date of entry on study until date of death, From time of study entry until death, up to 10 years
In this phase II trial, the previously described IL-2 schedule (daily IL-2 for 5 days (per week) every 3 weeks) will be tested in a larger cohort of patients with melanoma to attempt to determine the response rate, median duration of response, and median survival. The dose intensity of this schedule would allow a patient treated on this regimen to achieve the target threshold (\> 1440 million IU/m2/year).
