Descriptive Analysis of Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Prostate Gland Cancer, Which Spreads to Other Parts of the Body, Who Were Treated First With Novel Anti-hormone Therapy Followed by a Second Line Treatment With Novel Anti-Hormone Therapy or RadIum-223 (Xofigo).
In this study researcher want to learn more about the overall survival in patients suffering from prostate gland cancer which spread outside the prostate to other parts of the body who received either a novel anti-hormone therapy (NAH) or Radium-223 (Xofigo) after a prior NAH therapy (first line treatment). Additionally the researchers are also interested in the occurrence of bone fractures and other skeletal events. Basis for this study will be the US based Flatiron database which provides access to clinical data for cancer patients.
