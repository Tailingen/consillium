Tipifarnib in Treating Patients With Recurrent Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating patients who have recurrent bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: tipifarnib
1-year recurrence-free survival
Recurrence rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Progression rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Survival rate|Time to treatment failure|Molecular changes in the host tissue
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate of patients with stage 0 or I recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with tipifarnib.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
