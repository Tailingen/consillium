Improving Clinical PET/CT Image Quality in Retrospectively Reconstructed Breath-Hold Images
The patient has been referred for an FDG PET/CT scan. FDG is a form of sugar that contains a small amount of radioactivity; it is used to see the size and possible spread of cancer in the body.

Pictures of the body are taken on a machine called a PET/CT scanner. The purpose of this current study is to see if we, the investigators, can take clearer pictures of the tumor than we could with our routine scan method. This would allow us to better see how FDG is picked up by the tumor. PET/CT is presently one of the best tools for detecting cancer and determining its spread in the body. However, due to breathing motion, PET and CT images may become blurred and the location of the tumor on CT and PET images may not match. We have developed a new method that enables us to reduce image blurring and to measure the tumor more accurately on PET images. In this study we want to compare two kinds of images: those from the standard PET/CT scan, and the PET/CT scan pictures taken with our new method.

If successful, we may use this new method for clinical routine in the future.

OTHER: Breath-Hold PET/CT image set
To determine if our breath-hold acquisition technique can be implemented in whole-body PET/CT scans., Because PET events not satisfying the breathing amplitude selection criteria will be dropped off the final image set, it will be necessary to increase the acquisition time for the FOV's covering the thorax area from 3 min/bed to 5 min/bed to compensate for the reduction in statistics. This should result in a total increase of \~6 min for the whole body scan., at the time of scan
To determine if whole body PET/CT improves spatial matching of PET and CT, to compare image quality, blurring, PET-to-CT mis-match, and lesion SUV of the standard PET images with the breath-hold ones., at the time of scan
