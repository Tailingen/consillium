Pharmacokinetics of IFX and TNF Concentrations in Serum, Stool, and Colonic Mucosa in Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis
This is an open-label, prospective, observational study with the primary objective to characterize the pharmacokinetics of infliximab in patients with Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis.
Ulcerative Colitis
DRUG: Infliximab
Inter-compartmental Difference in Infliximab Concentration, Infliximab population pharmacokinetics, 22 weeks
Change in Proteome, Change in Proteomics before and after therapy, 22 weeks|Change in Transcriptome, Change in Transcriptomics before and after therapy, 22 weeks|Change in Robarts Histopathologic Index, Change in Robarts Histopathologic Index before and after therapy The RHI consists of 4 histological items (extent of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, neutrophils in the lamina propria, neutrophils in the epithelium, and erosions and ulceration) scored from 0 to 3 and multiplied by a weighting factor. The total RHI score is calculated by summing the weighted scores of the histological items, with total scores ranging from 0 (no disease activity) to 33 (severe disease activity)., 22 weeks|Change in Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Score, Change in Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Score before and after therapy The Mayo Clinic score (MCS) scores 4 variables (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, a physician's global assessment and endoscopic findings with flexible sigmoidoscopy). The endoscopic component of the MCS assesses disease activity on a 4-point scale (0-3 points), with higher scores representing more severe disease activity. Mucosal healing is often defined as an endoscopy score of 0 or 1.

Normal or inactive disease = 0 Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability) = 1 Moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions) = 2 Severe (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration) = 3, 22 weeks
In Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC), drug exposure may be affected by intestinal protein loss leading to hypoalbuminemia and rapid clearance of infliximab (IFX). Importantly, 2 studies have associated the loss of IFX in stool with poor outcomes. Multiple observational studies have identified that patients with faster IFX clearance have worse clinical outcomes and higher rates of antidrug antibody formation. To better understand optimal dosing of IFX in ASUC, the pharmacokinetics of IFX in association with outcomes must be better defined in this setting.
