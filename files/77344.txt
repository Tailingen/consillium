Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Azacitidine
Phase I Only - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) as Measured by Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), * The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle.
* Hematologic DLT is as a persistent bone marrow aplasia with ≤ 10 % cellularity, which persists for \> 60 days from the start of a chemotherapy cycle.
* Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity that occurs during the first cycle with the specific exceptions of nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, infections or electrolyte abnormalities attributable to any other cause. Grade 3 triglycerides will be considered a DLT only for patients who have Grade 3 in spite of appropriate lipid lowering drug therapy., Completion of the phase I portion of study (approximately 1 year and 4 months)|Phase I Only - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), * The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle.

Patient must be independent of transfusions for a minimum of 1 week before each marrow assessment.
* Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Defined as CR with the exception of neutropenia \<1000/uL or thrombocytopenia \<100,000/ul., Completion of treatment (median follow-up was 8 weeks) (range 4-68 weeks)
Response Rate (CRm + CRc + CRi + PR), * Response rate (CRm + CRc + CRi + PR)
* CRm = morphologic complete remission
* CRc = cytogenetic complete remission
* CRi = morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery
* PR = partial remission, Median number of cycles completed [3 cycles (12 weeks) full range (1 (4 weeks)-17 (68 weeks))]|Morphologic Leukemia-free State, Defined as \< 5% blasts on the BM aspirate with spicules and a count of \>200 nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, and no persistent extramedullary disease., Median number of cycles completed [3 cycles (12 weeks) full range (1 (4 weeks)-17 (68 weeks))]|Morphologic Complete Remission Rate (CRm), Defined as morphologic leukemia-free state, including \<5% blasts in BM aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of \> 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, no persistent extramedullary disease, ANC \> 1000/uL, platelet count \> 100,000/uL. Patient must be independent of transfusions for a minimum of 1 week before each marrow assessment. There is no duration requirement for this designation., Completion of treatment (median follow-up was 8 weeks) (range 4-68 weeks)|Cytogenetic CR (CRc) Rate, Only patients with an identified cytogenetic abnormality may receive this designation. Defines as a morphologic complete remission plus reversion to a normal karyotype (no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells)., Completion of treatment (median follow-up was 8 weeks) (range 4-68 weeks)|CR With Incomplete Blood Counts Rate, Defined as CR with the exception of neutropenia \<1000/uL or thrombocytopenia \<100,000/ul., Completion of treatment (median follow-up was 8 weeks) (range 4-68 weeks)|Partial Remission Rate (PR), Requires that the criteria for complete remission be met with the following exceptions: decrease of \>50% in the percentage of blasts to 5-25% in the BM aspirate. A value of \< 5% blasts in BM with Auer rods is also considered a partial remission., Completion of treatment (median follow-up was 8 weeks) (range 4-68 weeks)|Overall Survival, Defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Until death - median follow-up 4.6 months (full range (0.3-31.4 months))|Event Free Survival, Defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study drug to date of treatment failure, recurrence, or death due to any cause., Until death - median follow-up 4.6 months (full range (0.3-31.4 months))|Time to Progression (TTP), Defined as the interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of progressive disease., Until progressive disease - median follow-up 4.6 months (full range (0.3-31.4 months))|Relapse Free Survival (RFS), This is determined only for patients achieving a complete remission.

Primary:

Phase 1:

To determine the toxicity and feasibility of combining lenalidomide and azacitidine in patients with relapsed/ refractory AML ≥ 18 years or untreated AML ≥60 years.

Phase 2:

To assess the complete remission (CRm plus CRi) rate after lenalidomide + azacitidine therapy in untreated AML ≥60 years.

Secondary:

1. To assess the response rate (RR), morphologic leukemia-free state, morphologic complete remission rate (CRm), cytogenetic CR (CRc) rate, CR with incomplete blood counts 14 rate, and partial remission 15 rate (PR).
2. To assess overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS).
3. To assess time to progression (TTP) in untreated AML ≥60 years.
4. To assess relapse free survival (RFS) and duration of CR for complete responders.
5. To determine the incidence and severity of other toxicities of lenalidomide in combination with azacitidine.
6. Assay the expression levels of cytokines/chemokines in the bone marrow plasma, expression of chemokine receptors/ligands on leukemic blasts important for the AML microenvironment and study the direct cytotoxic effects of lenalidomide, azacitidine and combination of both drugs on cryopreserved AML blast cells.
