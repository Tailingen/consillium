A Study to Determine the Preferred Dose of the Drug, Lisinopril, for Preventing Urinary Toxicity Following Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer
This study will establish the preferred dose of lisinopril in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing radiation treatment. This study will also evaluate the effect of lisinopril on urinary symptoms and the impact of lisinopril on biomarkers and their association with urinary symptoms.
Prostate Cancer|Radiation Toxicity|Urinary Complication
DRUG: Lisinopril Tablets
Mean change in Expanded Prostate Index Composite score, Patient reported outcomes capturing urinary symptoms will be collected using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) patient reported outcome questionnaire prior to radiation on the first day of treatment, weekly during radiation, and approximately 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after radiation. The EPIC bladder domain score will quantify patient reported urinary symptoms. The EPIC bladder domain consists of 12 items each scored on a Likert scale with an overall score transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score indicates worse outcome., baseline to 12 months|change in the percentage of patients with positive blood test in urine, baseline to 12 months|percentage of participants who achieve a dose of 20 mg, 12 months
