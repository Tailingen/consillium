DC Vaccination for Post-remission Therapy in AML
This is a multi-centre, open label, prospective, non-randomized phase I/II trial in 20 patients including a safety-run in phase I part comprising 6 patients.

Trial subjects will receive repeated immunotherapies with autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs), presenting two leukemia-associated antigens.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: WT1/PRAME vaccination
Percentage of patients in whom treatment with the scheduled number of immunotherapies is feasible, 2 years|Percentage of grade I/II, grade III/IV and grade ≥III toxicities in patients having received at least 1 immunotherapy, 2 years
Overall survival, 2 years|Relapse/Progression free survival, 2 years|Time to progression (TTP)., 2 years|Control of minimal residual disease (MRD), 2 years|ECOG performance status, 2 years|Cellular immune responses to applied antigens, 2 years
20 patients with AML who are in remission (ELN criteria by Döhner et al 2017) receive WT1/PRAME autologous DC vaccine by intradermal injection once per week during the first 4 weeks and 1 per month thereafter for 23 consecutive months.

Primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of the DC vaccine in the aforementioned population and the feasibility.

Secondary objectives include evaluation of clinical response and exploratory immune monitoring assessments.
