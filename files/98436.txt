BOLSTER: Building Out Lifelines for Safety, Trust, Empowerment and Renewal
This research study is evaluating a new intervention, BOLSTER, which was designed to provide more support for patients with gynecologic and gastrointestinal cancers and their caregivers after a hospitalization.
Gynecologic Cancer|Gastrointestinal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: BOLSTER|OTHER: Enhanced Discharge Planning (EDP)
Feasibility of the BOLSTER Intervention, ≥50% consent-to-approach ratio, 1 month
Acceptability of the BOLSTER Intervention, ≥70% participants "agree" or "strongly agree" that they would recommend BOLSTER to other patients; and ≥70% participants "agreed or "strongly agreed" that they were satisfied with the BOLSTER intervention. Note that this measure only includes data from the RCT portion of the study, as the Phases 1a and 1b were designed to refine the intervention., 3 months
Hospitalizations can be difficult for patients with cancer, especially when they are transitioning home. Patients and caregivers are often expected to perform complex medical and nursing tasks with little or no preparation. Patients and caregivers report high levels of unmet needs for information about how best to manage symptoms and new medical procedures (such as managing new tubes, lines or drains).

The study team has developed a research project which aims to address these needs. If a patient agrees to participate in the study, she will take part in a program called BOLSTER (Building Out Lifelines for Safety, Trust, Empowerment and Renewal). BOLSTER will provide patients and caregivers with education and skills training, symptom management, and support across care settings.
