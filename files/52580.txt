Safety and Efficacy of Epcoritamab With Gemcitabine, Dexamethasone, and Cisplatin (GDP) Salvage Chemotherapy in Relapsed Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma
Subjects with relapsed large cell lymphoma will receive 3 cycles of combination therapy consisting of GDP and epcoritamab. Each cycle will last 21 days. GDP consists of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, and dexamethasone 40 mg orally on Days 1 through 4. Epcoritamab will be administered subcutaneously (SC) on Days 1, 8, and 15. Patients will receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) between Day 8 through Day 10 of each cycle of combination therapy.

Patients will then undergo radiology imaging for disease assessment. Patients may proceed to SCT(autologous or allogeneic) or CAR T-cell therapy or epcoritamab monotherapy upon completion of Cycle 3 per investigator discretion. The rationale for subjects not proceeding to autoSCT or CAR T-cell therapy will be captured in the eCRFs.

Patients who do not undergo SCT or CAR T-cell therapy may have the option to receive study treatment with epcoritamab monotherapy following completion of Cycle 3. Epcoritamab monotherapy will be offered to selected subjects who become ineligible to undergo SCT or CAR T-cell therapy (such as social situation, change in subject decision). The decision to offer epcoritamab monotherapy will be per investigator's discretion. However, subjects must have demonstrated a response to the combination therapy (partial remission or complete remission) per disease assessment scans prior to offering epcoritamab monotherapy. Epcoritamab monotherapy should begin 2 weeks following Cycle 3 Day 15. Monotherapy will consist of epcoritamab 48 mg administered subcutaneously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle for Cycle 4 to Cycle 9 or until unacceptable toxicity, or disease progression per the Lugano Criteria.

Complete Response (CR), CR rate is defined as proportion of subjects with a CR based on the Lugano Criteria 2022 following 3 cycles of combination treatment., 4 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a CR + PR based on Lugano Criteria 2022, 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from first observed response (CR or PR) to date of progression (PD) based on the Lugano Criteria 2022 or death, whichever occurs first., 4 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation until disease progression based on the Lugano Criteria 2022 or death from any cause., 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from treatment initiation until death from any cause., 4 years|Feasibility of AutoSCT or CAR T-cell, Feasibility of stem cell mobilization or CAR T-cell therapy will be assessed based on the number of subjects that undergo autologous transplant or CAR T-cell therapy., 6 months
