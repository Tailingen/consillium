The Multicentic Trial in Fertility-sparing Treatment and Ovarian Preservation Management for Early Endometrial Cancer
Through multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies comparing different treatment options (fertility-sparing surgery and ovarian preservation surgery and radical surgery)therapeutic efficacy, safety and quality of life of patients, exploration of the best strategies and risks for the treatment of early endometrial cancer, and promotion and application.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: endometrial cancer radical surgery|PROCEDURE: fertility-sparing surgery|PROCEDURE: ovarian preservation surgery
Total survival Time, calculate the time from patients enter the group to death, 6 months
the change of Ovarian volume, measure the ovarian volume dynamically by ultrasonography, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years|the change of endocrine function evaluation, measure the endocrine function(hormone level) dynamically by blood detection, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years|Progression Free Survival, calculate the time from patients enter the group to tumor progression, 6 months
Patients eligible for enrollment are selected and divided into three groups randomly, including fertility group,ovarian preservation group and endometrial cancer radical surgery group. Take interventions including fertility preservation surgery,ovarian preservation surgery and endometrial cancer radical surgery for patients in different groups respectively. Compare therapeutic efficacy, safety and quality of life of patients to evaluate three treatment and explore the best treatment for clinical application.
