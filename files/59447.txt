A Phase 1b/2 Study of T-DXd Combinations in HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
DESTINY-Breast07 will investigate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumour activity of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in combination with other anti-cancer agents in patients with HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer

Objective Response Rate (ORR)- Part 1 and Part 2, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a CR or PR, as determined by the Investigator at local site per RECIST 1.1., Until progression, assessed up to approximately 53 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS)- Part 1 and Part 2, PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization until the date of progression as assessed by the Investigator at local site per RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause., Until progression, assessed up to approximately 53 months|Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2)- Part 2, PFS2 is defined as time from the date of randomisation until the date of progression on next line treatment (the earliest of the progression event subsequent to first subsequent anticancer therapy) or death; second progression will be defined according to local standard clinical practice., Assessed up to approximately 53 months|Duration of Response (DoR)- Part 2, DoR is defined as time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Until progression, assessed up to approximately 53 months|Overall Survival (OS)- Part 2, OS is defined as time from the date of randomisation until the date of death due to any cause., Until death, assessed up to approximately 53 months|Serum Concentration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd), Determination of trastuzumab deruxtecan concentration in serum at different time points after trastuzumab deruxtecan administration, While on study drug up to study completion, approximately 53 months|Serum Concentration of Durvalumab, Determination of durvalumab concentration in serum at different time points after administration, While on study drug up to study completion, approximately 53 months|Serum Concentration of Pertuzumab, Determination of pertuzumab concentration in serum at different time points after administration, While on study drug up to study completion, approximately 53 months|Plasma Concentration of Paclitaxel, Determination of paclitaxel concentration in plasma at different time points after administration, While on study drug up to study completion, approximately 53 months|Plasma Concentration of Tucatinib, Determination of tucatinib concentration in plasma at different time points after administration, While on study drug up to study completion, approximately 53 months|Immunogenicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan, Percentage of patients who develop ADA for trastuzumab deruxtecan, Up to follow-up period, approximately 53 months|Immunogenicity of Durvalumab, Percentage of patients who develop ADA for durvalumab, Up to follow-up period, approximately 53 months|Immunogenicity of Pertuzumab, Percentage of patients who develop ADA for pertuzumab, Up to follow-up period, approximately 53 months
This study is modular in design allowing assessment of safety, tolerability and anti-tumour activity of T-DXd in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Combination-treatment modules will have 2 parts: a dose-finding phase (Part 1), and a dose expansion phase (Part 2); the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in Part 1 will be used for the dose-expansion in Part 2.

The target population of interest in this study is patients with HER2-positive (as per ASCO/CAP 2018 guidelines) advanced/MBC inclusive of patients with active and stable brain metastases. Part 1 of each module will enroll patients with locally assessed HER2-positive advanced/MBC in second-line or later patients. Part 2 of each module will enroll patients with locally assessed HER2-positive breast cancer who have not received prior treatment for advanced/metastatic disease.
