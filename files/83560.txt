Phase II Study of Cabazitaxel in Refractory Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
Cabazitaxel will be administered 20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks, as is the standard administration dose and schedule. This application is a non-labeled indication for cabazitaxel and will inform future drug development in gastroesophageal malignancies, where docetaxel remains an approved first line agent, but is not routinely used due to excessive toxicity and marginal efficacy.

At the conclusion of this study, we hope to demonstrate activity of single agent cabazitaxel in refractory gastric cancer, with preferential activity in one or more gastric cancer subtypes

Number of Participants With Progression at the 3 Month Follow up Visit, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions Results below list the number of participants who progressed at the 3 month follow up visit, 3 months

Prior to initiating protocol therapy, patients will undergo screening evaluations, to be done within 30 days of protocol initiation unless otherwise noted.

Patients who are taxane na√Øve will be assigned to arm A and patients who have had prior taxane therapy will be assigned to Arm B. Each arm will be analyzed separately for the primary study endpoint of 3 month progression free survival rate (PFS), as defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death. Cabazitaxel will be administered 20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks.

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until disease progression; intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment; unacceptable adverse event(s); patient decides to withdraw; general or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

Patients will be followed for 6 months after removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
