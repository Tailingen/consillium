Analysis of Chronic Neuropathic Pain Markers in Patients Treated With Oxaliplatin
The role of oxidative stress in the development of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy has been previously described in mice and in neuronal cell cultures (Massicot 2013); clinical manifestations and pathophysiological mechanisms potentially involved have also been described in humans (Andreas 2007) (Attal 2009).

The investigators team plans to conduct a translational clinicobiological research to explain the nature of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of the development of oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy. To perform this project, the investigators propose to realize a pilot study in patients newly treated with oxaliplatin. This will be conducted in the oncology department of Paris Saint Joseph Hospital from May 2014 until the inclusion of 20 patients.

The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the occurrence of acute and chronic neuropathic pain occurring in patients newly treated with oxaliplatin. The characterization of this pain is based on validated tests (Cruccu 2010).

Moreover, the biochemical changes related to oxidative stress and those related to cellular lipid composition are characterized in these patients.

Thermal thresholds, Four thermal thresholds are assessed by a Thermotest (Somedic AB):

* cold perception threshold
* warm perception threshold
* cold pain threshold
* warm pain threshold, Three to six months
Tactile sensitivity, Tactile sensitivity is assessed with von Frey hairs., Three to six months
Characterization of pain neuropathy, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI questionnaire) is used., Three to six months
