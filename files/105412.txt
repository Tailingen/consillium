PATHOS Study Pain Assessment in Thoracic Oncologic Surgery
A randomized prospective trial to assess whether the use of loco regional anesthesia as adjuvant analgesic therapy is more effective of intravenous analgesia only.
Pain, Postoperative|Lung Neoplasm
DRUG: Ropivacaine for Serratus Plane Block (SPB)
Post operative pain perception, Direct request to the patient to define the pain feeling, according to a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS, 0 to 10)., 24 hours from the end of surgery
Ability to perform post operative rehab exercises, Number of forced inspiratory maneuvers during rehab respiratory exercises, Measured at 24 hrs and 48 hrs after surgery|Systemic rescue analgesia consumption (doses), Number of extra doses of pain killers directly required by the patient (Morphine (0.1 mg/kg), Tramadol 100 mg or Ketorolac 30 mg), measured at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 36 hrs and 48hrs after surgery
A prospective randomized trial comparing intravenous analgesia alone and in association with loco regional anesthesia consisting in a homolateral Serratus Plan Block (SPB). Loco regional blockade of the serratus is further examined by allocating the patients to two different approaches: the block being performed under US guidance by the Anesthesiologist before the beginning of the procedure, or under direct visualization, by the operating surgeon, before entering the pleural cavity.
