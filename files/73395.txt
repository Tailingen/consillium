Study of MRTX1133 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring a KRAS G12D Mutation
A Phase 1/2 study of MRTX1133 in solid tumors harboring a KRAS G12D mutation.
Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Colo-rectal Cancer|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: MRTX1133
Phase 1: Number of Patients who Experience Dose-Limiting Toxicity, 21 Days|Phase 1/1b: Number of patients who experience a treatment-related adverse event, Up to 2 years|Phase 2: Objective response rate (ORR), 2 years|Phase 2: Duration of response (DOR), 2 years|Phase 2: Progression free survival (PFS), 2 years|Phase 2: Overall survival (OS), 2 years
Area under plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), up to 4 days|Time to achieve maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), up to 4 days|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), up to 4 days|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), up to 4 days|Apparent total plasma clearance when dosed orally (CL/F), up to 4 days|Apparent volume of distribution when dosed orally (Vz/F), up to 4 days
This first-in-human clinical trial will begin with an exploration of MRTX1133 dose and regimen. As potentially viable regimens are identified, Phase 1b expansion cohorts may be implemented to ensure collection of sufficient safety and PK information, and early evidence of clinical activity are available to recommend Phase 2 regimens. In Phase 2, separate cohorts of patients by histological diagnosis and/or baseline characteristics will be evaluated for the clinical activity and efficacy of MRTX1133.

This study was terminated prior to phase 2 initiating. Only phase 1 of the study was conducted.
