Study of TG-1701, an Irreversible Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, in Patients With B-Cell Malignancies
This is a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TG-1701, a Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: TG-1701|DRUG: Umbralisib|BIOLOGICAL: Ublituximab
Maximum Tolerated Dose acceptable for participants, To determine the incidence of adverse events, any potential abnormal laboratory results and any dose-limiting toxicities., From first dose up to 30 days post last dose (Up to approximately 4.8 years)
Overall Response Rate, To assess the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with hematologic malignancies, Up to approximately 4.8 years
This Phase I clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety of the investigational drug TG-1701 both as a single-agent and in combination with other investigational drugs, specifically ublituximab and umbralisib. As per protocol v6.0, combination therapy (TG-1701 + Ublituximab + Umbralisib) will be discontinued and the participants from Arm 1 and 2 will be transitioned to the long-term extension period to receive TG-1701 monotherapy.
