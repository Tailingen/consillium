The Immersive Experience of Virtual Reality During Chemotherapy in Patients With Early Breast and Gynecological Cancers: the Patient's Dream Study
"Patient's dream" study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, IRCCS (Rome), from April 2019 to January 2020. Before starting the first course of chemotherapy, patients will be randomly divided to receive the VRE (VRE arm) as "distraction therapy", or to entertain themselves with conventional means such as listening to music, watching a mobile program, reading newspapers, books, magazines or also doing nothing, according to the patient's preferences and for the entire duration of administration of the first CT cycle (control arm). A clinical team composed of three oncologists, three psychologists, one nurse and one expert VR operator will support the patients involved in the study.

The primary aims were the assessment of psychological distress, anxiety and quality of life between the two study arms. Secondary endpoints were the perceived time during the first course of CT and the acute and late toxicity.

The study will conduct in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments and within the protocol approved by the Central Ethics Committee (Trial registration number: RS 1105/18). A written informed consent will obtain from all participants included in the study.
