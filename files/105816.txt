Legume Diet Satiety Pilot Study
This pilot study is designed to test the effects of a high legume (dried bean) diet on hunger and other indicators of health over the course of eight weeks, compared to a more conventional healthy diet.
Obesity|Colorectal Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Legume diet group|BEHAVIORAL: Control diet group|DEVICE: Smartpill|OTHER: legumes
Change in Weight, Evaluate the effects of a high-legume diet compared to a control diet with a similar macronutrient profile on weight change in a randomized controlled feeding study., Baseline to 8 weeks
Gastric Emptying Time, Compare the effects of the high-legume and control diets on gastric emptying time, 8 weeks|Change in Plasma Insulin Level (Biomarker of Appetite Regulation), Compare the effects of the high-legume and control diets on plasma insulin level in a meal response time (30 min) course experiment., Baseline to 8 weeks|Energy Intake, Compare the effects of the high-legume and control diets on self-reported dietary intake measured by telephone 24-hour dietary recalls., Baseline to 8 weeks|Satiety, Use self-reported satiety questionnaire to compare short-term responses to test meals., Time course response at baseline and 8 weeks
The goal of the currently proposed study is to conduct a randomized controlled feeding pilot study within a more diverse population also at high risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to evaluate whether a high-legume diet will result in increased satiety and in turn will facilitate reduced energy intake and weight loss compared to a control diet provided under similar conditions. In addition, explore potential beneficial effects of the high-legume diet on gastric emptying and circulating levels of appetite-regulating hormones and other biomarkers. Dietary behaviors that are even moderately more satiating over time have the potential to enhance weight loss and could lead to a significant public health impact among populations at high risk for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other chronic diseases.

Towards the end of the study, the participants will do an additional test, looking at how long food takes to pass through the digestive system using a SmartPill capsule. The SmartPill is a pill about the size of a large multivitamin that can measure pH, pressure, and temperature changes, which it uses to assess where in the digestive tract it is. The participant swallows the pill, and carries around a receiver that is about the size of a deck of cards for the next 3-5 days. The SmartPill is expelled, and the receiver notifies the participant that they can return the receiver to the study personnel.
