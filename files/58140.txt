Evaluation of Sleep Quality in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment With Hormonal Therapeutic Approaches and in Patients With Full-resected Early Breast Cancer
This study will use polysomnography, alongside other methodologies such as questionnaires, actigraphic measurements and salivary melatonin samples used in previous studies to investigate sleep quality in patients with i) localized, locally advanced or metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer or ii) with full-resected early (stage I-III) epithelial breast cancer. The measurements will be taken before androgen deprivation therapy (ADT - for prostate cancer patients) or endocrine therapy (for breast cancer patients) is initiated, at 6 months and some measures again at 12 months.The groups, defined by cancer type and whether or not treatment includes ADT / endocrine therapy, will be compared to see if there are differences in the prevalence of the lowered sleep quality in the groups.

DEVICE: polysomnography, actigraphy, questionnaires
difference in sleep quality, The two groups considered will be group A1, and group A2. This will demonstrate whether there is a difference in sleep quality between these two groups of patients. The difference between time points will establish correlation between treatment initiation and symptom onset, the between group analysis will test whether the link seems to be radiotherapy alone or whether ADT further decreases sleep quality, 1 year
The main outcomes of this pilot study can be summarised as:

* Using a previously unused methodology to assess whether ADT / endocrine therapy may negatively affect patterns of sleep quality
* Identifying sleep micro/macrostructure changes in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT / endocrine therapy
* Comparing the novel methodology with results obtained previously through standard methods
* Providing statistical underpinnings, such as sample size calculations, for a full interventional trial
* Highlighting the most appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions to be tested in the full interventional trial
