PROCLAIM: Germline Genetic Testing for Prostate Cancer Patients
This registry is for men who have prostate cancer and have had multigene panel hereditary testing. The registry will gather data on genetic testing results and how that information may change physician treatment or follow up recommendations. It will also gather data on the patient's experience with genetic testing, through a post-test survey to be completed 60-90days after results have been received and discussed with their provider.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Invitae multi-cancer gene panel
Diagnostic yield of pathogenic and likely pathogenic genes in the patient population, Identify the diagnostic yield of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in known cancer syndrome genes in patients with prostate cancer, using the Invitae 84 gene multi-cancer panel. These rates will be compared between the two cohorts., to be assessed at baseline only
Evaluate the sensitivity of current NCCN criteria for germline genetic testing for identifying prostate cancer patients that have pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, Compare rates of pathogenic / likely pathogenic variants found in both cohorts after testing using the Invitae 84 gene multi cancer panel., at baseline only|Evaluate the impact of genetic test results on clinical management decisions, Post-Test surveys for patients and the clinician report form will assess whether changes to clinical management were made as a result of the test results., 60-90 days post test results received.
This registry will enroll men with prostate cancer who have done multi-gene testing for their cancer. Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts, one for individuals who meet current NCCN testing guidelines, and one for individuals who do not meet current NCCN guidelines.

The main goal of this Registry is to assess whether nationally developed guidelines used to select patients for hereditary testing are adequate to identify all patients with prostate cancer who may benefit from testing. Patients will completed a post-test survey regarding their testing experience and clinicians will be asked to provide additional medical records review information via the Clinician Report Form.
