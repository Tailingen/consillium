STEREOtactic Radiation and Chemotherapy in Lung Cancer (STEREO)
This trial will test the feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy after stereotactic body radiation therapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
To measure the feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy after stereotactic body radiation therapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 3 years after subject enrollment
Survival rate, specifically disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), measured by follow-up visits and tests, 3 years after subject enrollment|safety of adjuvant chemotherapy after stereotactic body radiation therapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) measured by adverse events, 3 years after subject enrollment|quality of life (QOL) measured by subject questionnaires, 3 years after subject enrollment|Measurement of biological and clinical markers for toxicity, DFS, and OS, 3 years after subject enrollment
This study evaluates the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who received treatment with stereotactic radiation for early stage lung cancer and who are at high risk for microscopic metastatic disease.

Chemotherapy in the form of cisplatin/docetaxel or cisplatin/pemetrexed will be administered approximately six weeks after Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Patients will then undergo follow up clinical evaluation and imaging to evaluate treatment response and for surveillance.

A patient population of 65 patients will be required. Enrollment in this protocol is planned by multi center involvement in the state of Kentucky as part of the Kentucky Trial Network (KTN).
