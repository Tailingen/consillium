Nanoparticles and Hypofractionated Protontherapy for Reirradiation of Pantumor Relapse
This is a prospective multicenter non-randomized phase II study: proton therapy with nanoparticles based on polysiloxane and gadolinium chelates injectable intravenously
Recurrent Cancer|Previous Radiation
RADIATION: Radiation by protontherapy associated to nanoparticles injection
Local efficacy of a treatment combining the administration of nanoparticles with proton therapy, proportion of patients alive and without local progression two years after the start of proton therapy (local progression-free survival rate), 2 years after the treatment
This is a prospective multicenter non-randomized phase II study: proton therapy with nanoparticles based on polysiloxane and gadolinium chelates injectable intravenously in recurrent tumors
