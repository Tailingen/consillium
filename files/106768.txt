Ketohexokinase Isoforms in Endometrial Cancer.
Our preliminary analysis with clinical database suggested that, in patients with type I endometrial cancer, high ketohexokinase-expressing group have lower survival probabilities than low ketohexokinase-expressing group. To understand the importance of ketohexokinase expression and isoform switch during the development of type I endometrial cancer, we propose a series of in vitro experiments and clinical examinations in this project.
