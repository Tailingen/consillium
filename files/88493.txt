Cost-utility of Focal HIFU vs Prostatectomy
Medico-Economic Randomized Trial comparing Focal HIFU Treatment to Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: F-HIFU|PROCEDURE: Radical Prostatectomy
The cost/utility ratio expressed as differential cost per QALY in favor of F-HIFU compared to RP (open, lap or robot) at 24 months., Utility will be measured at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months using the EQ-5D-5L self-administered questionnaire.

Costs will be estimated from the perspective of the French health system. They will be collected by probabilistic matching with data from the SNDS using data from the inclusion hospitalization of each patient included in the the trial., 24 months

Optional salvage treatments possibly being: a second F-HIFU, RP or radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation. All salvage treatments, except the F-HIFU, are already reimbursed by the French Health System and available in the SNDS database., 12, 24 and 48 months|Overall survival, Overall survival at 12, 24 and 48 months measured from the inclusion date to the date of death, all causes of death being included or the date of the last visit or at 48 months, 12, 24 and 48 months|Cancer specific survival, Cancer specific survival at 12, 24 and 48 month measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death due to the progression of PC or the date of the last visit. Causes of death are available in the SNDS database since it is implemented by the CEpiDC, 12, 24 and 48 months|Androgen deprivation-free survival, Androgen deprivation-free survival (equivalent to metastasis-free survival) at 12, 24 and 48 month measured from the inclusion date to the first prescription of androgen deprivation therapy or the date of the last visit, 12, 24 and 48 months|Urinary and sexual functions, Urinary and sexual functions will be evaluated at inclusion then at 6, 12 and, 24 month using auto-questionnaires EPIC-26, Inclusion and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months|Patient's quality of life, Patient's quality of life will be evaluated at inclusion then at 6, 12 and 24 month using the auto-questionnaires EORTC QLQ C30, Inclusion and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months|Urinary and sexual functions, Urinary and sexual functions will be evaluated at inclusion then at 6, 12 and, 24 month using auto-questionnars IPSS, Inclusion and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months|Urinary and sexual functions, Urinary and sexual functions will be evaluated at inclusion then at 6, 12 and, 24 month using auto-questionnaires IIEF-5, Inclusion and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months|Patient's quality of life, Patient's quality of life will be evaluated at inclusion then at 6, 12 and 24 month using the auto-questionnaires QLQ PR25, Inclusion and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months|Patient's quality of life, Patient's quality of life will be evaluated at inclusion then at 6, 12 and 24 month using the auto-questionnaires EQ-5D-5L, Inclusion and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months
Standard treatment option of intermediate risk (ISUP2) prostate cancer (PC) is either radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). An attractive option for selected patients and for the health care system would be to spare the preserved gland to decrease urinary, sexual and digestive side effects of whole-gland treatments keeping with a good cancer control. For these reasons, focal treatments have been developed in localized PC. The principal objective of the EMERHIT study is to estimate, from the health system point of view, the efficiency (cost/utility study) of focal HIFU (F-HIFU) for intermediate risk PC compared to RP (either by open, laparoscopic or robotic surgical approach) at 24 months. It will be a multicentric pragmatic clinical trial, comparative, with no insu, randomized in two parallel groups :

* (1) F-HIFU treatment
* (2) RP Randomization will be equal (ratio 1:1), stratified on the centers and performed maximum at 2 months before the procedure. The comparison to the SNDS data will use the NIR of the patients selected for the study. The use of the SNDS data will allow, on top of the estimation of the care cost, to increase the patient's follow-up (with no supplemental visit) and measure, at 48 months, costs, mortality rate and cancer control measures From version 4.0 of the protocol, randomisation will be adjusted to a 2:1 ratio and stratified by centre.
