A Study of VRD-based Regimen Combined With CART-ASCT-CART2 Treatment in Patients With Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia
This is a single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VRD-based Regimen (Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone) combined with CART-ASCT-CART2 in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed primary plasma cell leukemia.
Plasma Cell Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: anti-BCMA CAR-T
Safety and Tolerability, The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 2 year|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR(including sCR / CR / VGPR / PR, based on IMWG criteria), after induction therapy, 1 month after the first CAR-T cell transfusion, the consolidation therapy ends, 6 months after the second CAR-T cell transfusion|Progression free survival (PFS), Is defined as time from first induction date to first documentation of PD, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 1 year
Complete response rate (CRR), CR or better is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a CR response or Stringent Complete Response (sCR) response according to IMWG criteria, after induction therapy, 1 month after the first CAR-T cell transfusion, the consolidation therapy ends, 6 months after the second CAR-T cell transfusion|Overall survival (OS), Is defined as time from first induction date to time of death due to any cause, 1 year|MRD-negative Rate, MRD negative by flow cytometry, after induction therapy, 1 month after the first CAR-T cell transfusion, the consolidation therapy ends, 6 months after the second CAR-T cell transfusion|Duration of Remission (DOR), Duration from the first evaluation of at least partial remission (PR) to the onset of disease progression or death due to disease progression (whichever occurs first), 2 year
The CART cell duration in vivo, The copies of BCMA-CART DNA in peripheral blood with qPCR method, 1 year
The study is a prospective, single-arm, single-centre, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with VRD-based Regimen (Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone) in combination with CART-ASCT-CART2 in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed primary plasma cell leukemia. Patients receive 3 cycles of induction therapy with VRD-based regimen followed by the first infusion of CAR-T cells. Patients then received 3 cycles of VR-based consolidation therapy, followed by ASCT and the second infusion of CAR-T cells. And R or R maintenance starts on day 100 after ASCT.
