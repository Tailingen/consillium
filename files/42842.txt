Pemigatinib Combined With Durvalumab for Previously Treated Biliary Tract Carcinoma
This study is a single-arm, multicenter Phase II clinical trial designed to preliminarily assess the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of pemigatinib and durvalumab in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced malignant biliary tract cancer.

The study anticipates enrolling 38 participants characterized by the following criteria: 1) A confirmed diagnosis of advanced, metastatic, or unresectable biliary tract cancer by histopathological examination; 2) Presence of FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement confirmed by testing; 3) Prior receipt of first-line treatment for biliary tract cancer.

The primary questions the study aims to address are:

1. Can the combination of pemigatinib and durvalumab improve the prognosis of participants with previously treated biliary tract cancer (BTC)?
2. What is the safety profile of the treatment with pemigatinib and durvalumab?

Participants will receive:

1. Oral administration of 13.5 mg pemigatinib once daily, in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg via intravenous infusion.
2. Follow-up visits will be scheduled every 6 weeks.

Investigators will observe and document the objective tumor response rate of the participants, as well as progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and adverse events.
Biliary Tract Carcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Pemigatinib and Durvalumab
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a PR (\> 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions) based on RECIST v1.1. Clinical response will be determined by an independent radiological review committee., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS=first dose to progression disease \[PD\] or death, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR=CR+PR+satble disease, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS=first dose to death of any cause, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Adverse Event (AE), From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks
