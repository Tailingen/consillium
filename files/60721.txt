SKIP - A Double-blind Placebo-controlled Randomized Multicenter Trial of Skin Toxicity Treatment
Skin toxicity treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS treated with panitumumab monotherapy after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens.

Because of their frequency and severity panitumumab associated skin toxicities affect patients' quality of life and thus threaten patients' compliance to therapy. There is an urgent need for evidence-based treatment recommendations for the prevention and management of panitumumab -associated skin toxicities.

The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of a manageable preemptive treatment with oral doxycycline in combination with a supportive topical regimen containing erythromycin cream (2 %) over duration of 12 weeks on the occurrence and grade of panitumumab induced skin toxicities in a double-blind, controlled randomized setting. Basic skin treatment with or without doxycycline will be discontinued at the end of study treatment after 12 weeks or until a value of 6-10 is observed on the visual analogue scale (VAS), whichever is sooner.
