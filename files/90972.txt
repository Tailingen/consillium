Effect of Concomitant Radiotherapy and Trastuzumab on Cardiotoxicity of Patients Treated for Early Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether concomitant radiotherapy and trastuzumab (patients treated for early breast cancer) is really safe for the heart even years after treatment and if the investigators should use these two treatments concomitantly without additional harm.
Breast Cancer
difference in LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction), we will compare LVEF (LVEF 1) measured before treatment with adjuvant Trastuzumab and concomitant Radiotherapy of breast/thoracic wall with LVEF (LVEF 2) measured at follow up (after adjuvant treatment) outpatient examination. We will then compare the difference in LVEF (LVEF 2-LVEF 1) measured in patients treated for left breast cancer with the difference in LVEF (LVEF 2-LVEF 1) measured in patients treated for right breast cancer, from one to six years from adjuvant radiotherapy for early breast cancer
occurrence of cardiovascular events over time in both groups (RT for left/right breast), occurrence of cardiovascular events over time in both groups (irradiated left / right breast) will be showed by the method of Kaplan-Meier. Groups will be compared with the log rank test., from 6 months to five years after adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab
The investigators know from the studies, that were already published, that for HER2 positive early breast cancer patients in adjuvant treatment concomitant radiotherapy and trastuzumab is safe during the treatment. But there is no study with long term results of cardial function, especially combination of Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NT-proBNP.
