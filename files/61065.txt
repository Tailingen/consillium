Progression-free Survival (PFS) after 6 months according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., PFS is defined as the 6 month from the date of randomization to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 6 Months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) after 6 months according to IRECIST criteria., PFS is defined as the 6 month from the date of randomization to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using iRECIST criteria) or death due to any cause. Per iRECIST criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 6 months
