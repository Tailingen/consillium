To investigate the safety and tolerability of ZN-c3 in combination with PLD, carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or bevacizumab, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0, Through completion, approximately 40 months|To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ZN-c3 in combination with PLD, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine, Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in DLT-evaluable subjects during Cycle 1, Through Cycle 1 (cycle is 28 days for PLD or paclitaxel, and 21 days for carboplatin, gemcitabine, or bevacizumab)
This is a Phase 1b open-label, multicenter study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, preliminary clinical activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of ZN-c3 in combination with other drugs.
