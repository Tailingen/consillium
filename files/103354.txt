Patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction or the stomach who have documented progression after being treated with a 1st line chemotherapy which contained at least a platinum and 5-FU (5-Flourouracil)can be included. All patients will receive a standard second line therapy with paclitaxel and ramucirumab plus the investigational drug avelumab, a checkpoint inhibitor. Clinical and radiographic assessment will be performed regularly. Patients will be treated until disease progression, untolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.
