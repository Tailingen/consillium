Safety and Efficacy of an Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) Therapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Multicenter, single arm, non-randomized, prospective, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion (BEN101) followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumor.

BEN101 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumor. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
