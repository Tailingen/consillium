Celsius TCS Hyperthermia System PMCF Trial
Based on the basic data of all patients foreseen for a local hyperthermia in the participating centers the failure rate (of the Celsius TCS Hyperthermia System) and the complication rate (injury to the patients) will be recorded.
Solid Neoplasms
DEVICE: Hyperthermia
failures of the device as well as failure of persons using the device during treatment, Based on the risk analysis the failures occurring during treatment will be classified and their frequency will be evaluated. This will be done using the investigators' judgment regarding severity of the failures (as minor, moderate, severe)., one month after treatment|any injury, harm or medically relevant discomfort occurring for the patients or the staff, Based on the risk analysis the injuries occurring during treatment will be classified and their frequency will be evaluated. This will be done using the investigators' judgment regarding severity of the failures (as minor, moderate, severe)., one month after treatment
During this PMCF Trial from each participating center the internal data of all Celsius TCS Hyperthermia devices are collected. The participating centers are obligated to report any device-related failure and Adverse Event (injury to the patient). The center reports together with the device-internal data allows to calculate the failure and the complication rates. It will be analyzed regarding the kind of tumor and the concomitant treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The outcome groups (with/without failure or complication) will be analyzed regarding demographic and treatment parameters.
