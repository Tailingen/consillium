A Study of LY3009120 in Participants With Advanced Cancer or Cancer That Has Spread to Other Parts of Their Body
The main purpose of this study is to see how safe the investigational drug known as LY3009120 is and whether it will work to help people with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

DRUG: LY3009120 capsule
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of LY3009120, Maximum tolerated dose for the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LY3009120 that might be safely administered to participants with advanced and/or metastatic cancer. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event (AE) during Cycle 1 (28 days) that was possibly related to the study drug and met 1 of the following criteria: According to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0: ≥Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity except nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation that can be controlled with appropriate care; Grade 3 elevations of ALT and/or AST lasting fewer than 8 days (without evidence of other hepatic injury); Grade 3 rash that resolves or improves to a Grade 2 or less within 7 days; CTCAE Grade 4 hematological toxicity of \>5 days duration; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade 3 febrile neutropenia., Cycle 1 (28 Days)
Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Number of participants with tumor response using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions. SD which is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Baseline through progressive disease (Up to 7.36 months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3009120 Cycle 1 Day 1, PK: Maximum concentration of LY3009120 after a single oral dose Cycle 1 Day 1., Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hours (h) post-dose|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) at Steady State of LY3009120 Cycle 1 Day 15, PK: Maximum concentration of LY3009120 during a twice daily dosing interval at steady state, Cycle 1 Day 15., Cycle 1 Day 15: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3009120 Cycle 1 Day 28, PK: Maximum concentration of LY3009120 during a twice daily dosing interval at steady state, Cycle 1 Day 28., Cycle 1 Day 28: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve From Zero to Infinity (AUC [0-∞]) of LY3009120 Cycle 1 Day 1, PK: area under the concentration versus time curve \[0-∞\] of LY3009120 after a single oral dose Cycle 1 Day1., Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to the End of Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUC[0-τ]) of LY3009120 Cycle 1 Day 15, PK: area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the end of the twice daily dosing interval at steady state \[AUC0-τ\]., Cycle 1 Day 15: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to the End of Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUC[0-τ]) of LY3009120 Cycle 1 Day 28, PK: area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the end of the twice daily dosing interval at steady state AUC\[0-τ\]., Cycle 1 Day 28: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 h post-dose
