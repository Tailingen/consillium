Clinical Study of SL19+22 CAR-T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SL19+22 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19+22 CAR-T cells
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events could occurred within first month post infusion., First month post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: Overall Remission Rate (ORR), Overall Remission Rate (ORR) including partial remission and complete remission rate after infusion of SL19+22, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
Efficacy:duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of CD19 and CD22 CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry, First month post CAR-T cells infusion
SL19+22 injection is a CAR-T product independently developed by Senlang that targets both CD19 and CD22. Based on the traditional CAR T treatment regimen, the CAR structure was designed, and the activation mode of T cells was changed by using cytokine combination amplification and improved transfection technology.

The Main research objectives:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SL19+22 in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

The Secondary research objectives:

To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of SL19+22 in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
