Clinical Efficacy Study of Pucotenlimab Combined With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Advanced Endometrial Cancer
Exploring the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitors on advanced stage III-IV endometrial cancer
Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Pucotenlimab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Pathologic complete response, Proportion of patients with no tumor cells on postoperative pathology and negative lymph node metastasis, At the end of the patient's treatment, up to 1 years.
Surgical complication rate, intraoperative bleeding, vascular injuries, bladder injuries, rectal injuries, and ureteral injuries, as defined by the need for suture repair; occlusive nerve injuries, as defined by complete severance; and vascular injuries, as defined by the need to document the site of injury. Postoperative complications included: ureteral/bladder/rectal/vaginal fistula, internal hemorrhage, pelvic infection, lymphocyst, lymphatic fistula, lower extremity edema, lower extremity venous thrombosis, urinary retention, nerve injury, and bowel obstruction., During and after the surgery, up to 2 years.|Adverse Event, Adverse Effects of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, during the treatment, up to 5 years.|Remission rate (%) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Subjects were assessed for complete and partial remission rates according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, At the end of the patient's treatment, up to 1 years.|Event-free survival (EFS), the time between the enrollment and any documented tumor progression, recurrence, or death from any cause; the analysis of EFS includes the results of tumor evaluations during the study treatment and follow-up periods. If a patient had several indicators of PD or recurrence, the EFS analysis was performed using the indicator that appeared first; PD, recurrence, or death were considered to have reached the study endpoint; patients who were treated with other systemic or antitumor therapies directed at the target lesion of observation were also considered to be in PD; for patients who did not have PD, recurrence, or death at the end of the study, the time when the patient's failure to have a recurrence was last obtained was used as the time to censor the data., Until the end of the 3-year follow-up period, up to 5 years.|Overall survival (OS), the time from the start of enrollment to death from any cause, Until the end of the 3-year follow-up period, up to 5 years.
Conduct domestic multicenter, prospective phase II single arm clinical trials to answer the following questionsï¼š

1. Evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor on the remission rate, surgical complications, and surgical resection rate of advanced stage III-IV endometrial cancer;
2. Evaluate the effect of of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitors on the survival of patients with advanced III-IV endometrial cancer;
3. Exploring the changes in tumor local immune related factors and cells before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor use, as well as the responsiveness of different molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer to neoadjuvant therapy, and screen for biological indicators that predict the effectiveness of PD-1 inhibitors.
