Thymosin-alpha 1 for Adjuvant Treatment After Radical Resection of High-risk Stage II and III Colorectal Cancer
For high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer, even after radical resection and postoperative adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy, 30-40% of patients will still have recurrence and metastasis. Thymosin-alpha 1 is believed to improve immunity and may help promote tumor immunity to reduce the incidence of recurrence and metastasis. This study hopes to verify the effecacy and safety of thymosin-alpha 1 for adjuvant treatment of high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer after radical resection.
Stage II Colorectal Cancer|Stage III Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Thymosin Alpha1
3-year disease-free survival rate, percentage of patients who have no recurrence or metastases or death at 3 years after surgery., 3 years
3-year overall survival rate, percentage of patients who are alive at 3 years after surgery., 3 years|rate of adverse events related to thymosin-alpha 1, percentage of patients with adverse events related to thymosin-alpha 1, including fever, allergies, skin rash, liver and kidney damage, 6 months
Patients with pathological high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer after radical resection were randomly allocated to receive thymosin-alpha 1 twice a week for 6 months (experimental group) or not (control group) in a 1:1 ratio. At the same time, all patients will receive chemo/radiotherapy according to the Chinese Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer. The primary endpoint is 3-year DFS rate.
