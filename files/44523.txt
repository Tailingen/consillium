IFM 2005-01: Velcade/Dexamethasone Versus Vincristine/Adriamycin (Doxorubicin)/Dexamethasone (VAD) for the Treatment of Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised Phase III study, looking at a series of 480 patients up to the age of 65 with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) not previously treated. They will receive VAD or Velcade®/dexamethasone combination as induction treatment plus/minus (±) dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin (DCEP) followed by autograft as first-line therapy, as the investigators try to compare the complete remission (CR) rate (with negative or positive immunofixation) at the end of their induction treatment.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Velcade
To compare the CR rate (with negative or positive immunofixation) obtained with VAD or the Velcade®/dexamethasone combination used as induction treatment in patients up to the age of 65 with newly diagnosed MM, at the end of this induction treatment
After their written informed consent has been obtained and their eligibility verified, patients are randomised between 4 treatment arms: A1 VAD (4 cycles); A2 VAD (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles); B1 Velcade® + dexamethasone (4 cycles); B2 Velcade® + dexamethasone (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles) A1, A2, B1, B2 + autograft. Randomisation will be stratified on the basis of the initial b2 microglobulin level (\> or \< 3 mg/l) and the presence of chromosome 13 abnormalities identified by FISH analysis. VAD: Vincristine/Adriamycin/Dexamethasone; DCEP: Dexamethasone/Cyclophosphamide/ Etoposide/Cisplatin.
