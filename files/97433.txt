Pharmacodynamics Study of MRX34, MicroRNA Liposomal Injection in Melanoma Patients With Biopsy Accessible Lesions
This study is designed to investigate the biomarkers, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the liposomal micro-ribonucleic acid-34 (microRNA-34, miR-34). Melanoma patients with easily accessible lesions will undergo serial biopsies and serial blood samples will be collected.
Melanoma
DRUG: MRX34|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Peak blood concentration and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of MRX34 after IV dosing and drug concentration in tissue biopsies, 3 months
Frequency and severity of adverse events associated with MRX34 treatment, 6 months
Change in tumor measurements over time using RECIST criteria., 6 months|RNA sequencing analysis of PBMCs to evaluate gene expression through TLR signaling, RIG-I Pathway and PD1/PD-L1 Blockade., During 3 months of treatment|Assessment of MRX34 accumulation in tumor tissue measured by qPCR and CISH., During 3 months of treatment
MRX34 Induction Therapy consists of 3 cycles of MRX34 treatment given over an approximately 8 week period. Dexamethasone 10 mg PO (or IV) will be given as premedication. On Days 1-5 of each treatment cycle, MRX34 will be given as a daily infusion followed by 16 days of rest. At screening a tumor biopsy sample will be required from all patients. Additional biopsies will be collected at Cycle 1 Day 3 and the end of Cycles 1 and 3 (Day 18 +/- 1 day)
