Follow-up of Early Breast Cancer by Dynamic Evaluation of CEA and CA 15.3 Followed by 18FDG-PET
The main purpose of follow-up in asymptomatic breast cancer patients during and after adjuvant treatment is to detect breast cancer recurrence and metastatic disease.The aim of this trial is to verify if, in asymptomatic patients, the serial measurement of serum CEA and CA 15.3, with diagnostic imaging procedures (18FDG-PET) performed only in case of a critical increase of serum CEA and CA 15.3 level, can anticipate the diagnosis of breast cancer local and distant recurrence compared to the usual follow-up practice.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Arm B, tumor markers assessment
Time interval between date of randomization and date of diagnosis of disease distant recurrence, Primary objective of the study is to verify if the experimental arm (serial measurement of serum CEA and CA 15.3 with diagnostic imaging procedures - i.e. 18FDG-PET- performed only in case of critical increase of serum markers level) can anticipate the diagnosis of breast cancer loco-regional (except for in-breast recurrence) or distant metastases compared to the control arm (usual follow-up practice)., Participants will be followed from date of randomization until the date of first documented disease distant recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Predefined critical difference of CEA and CA15-3, Secondary objective is to evaluate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of CEA and CA15.3 dynamic changes in the diagnosis of breast cancer loco-regional (except for in-breast recurrence) or distant metastases., Participants will be followed from date of randomization until the date of first documented disease distant recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Exploratory analysis in the different subtypes, Secondary objective is to perform an exploratory analysis on diagnostic anticipation in the different subtypes (ER and HER2 status), Participants will be followed from date of randomization until the date of first documented disease distant recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Imaging diagnostic tests evaluation, Secondary objective is to measure how many imaging diagnostic tests will be avoided in the experimental arm compared to the control arm, Participants will be followed from date of randomization until the date of first documented disease distant recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Patient quality of life evaluation, Secondary objective is to compare the quality of life in the two arms, Participants will be followed from date of randomization until the date of first documented disease distant recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
