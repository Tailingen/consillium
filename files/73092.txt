Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation With Matched Unrelated Donors for Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies, Renal Cell Carcinoma, and Aplastic Anemia
The primary objective of this study is to examine transplant related mortality (TRM) at 100 days \<30%. A TRM of \>50% is considered unacceptable. This study also seeks a TRM at 12 months that is \<50%, engraftment \>90% (defined as donor cells \>80% at 6 months), and 1 year overall survival \>50%.
