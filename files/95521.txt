Pre-operative Biliary SEMS RCT During Neoadjuvant Therapy
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Fully Covered biliary SEMS to Uncovered biliary SEMS in biliary drainage for the pre-operative management of biliary obstructive symptoms caused by pancreatic cancer in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: WallFlexâ„¢ Biliary RX Fully Covered/Uncovered Stent System
Sustained Biliary Drainage, Defined as Absence of Reinterventions for the Management of Biliary Obstructive Symptoms, Sustained biliary drainage, defined as absence of reinterventions for the management of biliary obstructive symptoms, assessed from self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) placement until curative intent surgery (CIS) when applicable, or to one year after SEMS placement otherwise., From SEMS placement until CIS (for patients undergoing CIS; median 110 days to CIS) or from SEMS placement to one year after SEMS placement (for patients not undergoing CIS)
Procedure-related or Stent-related Serious Adverse Events, Serious adverse events related to the stent placement procedure or to the stent, From stent placement procedure up to one year after stent placement procedure|Technical Success, Technical success defined as the ability to deploy the stent in a satisfactory position across the stricture; proximal end of the stent is no more than 1-2cm beyond the proximal end of the stricture., During the Stent Placement Procedure|Ability to Complete Neoadjuvant Therapy as Intended Without Stent-related Interruptions of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Without Biliary Reintervention, The ability to complete neoadjuvant therapy as intended without stent-related interruptions of neoadjuvant therapy and without biliary reintervention, From initial stent placement procedure to curative intent surgery (CIS) (median 110 days to CIS), or from initial stent placement procedure to one year after initial stent placement for participants not undergoing CIS|Number of Participants With Stent Migration, The number of participants with stent migration, At the time of curative intent surgery (CIS) (median 110 days to CIS) or transition to palliation for participants not underoing CIS|Subjective Impression of the Surgeon That the Presence of a Self-expanding Metal Stent May Have Impacted the Surgical Procedure, The subjective impression of the surgeon that the presence of a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) may have impacted the surgical procedure., At the time of curative intent surgery (CIS) (median 110 days to CIS)|For Participants Not Undergoing Curative Intent Surgery, Sustained Biliary Drainage to One Year After Stent Placement, For participants not undergoing curative intent surgery, sustained biliary drainage from stent placement to one year after stent placement., From stent placement to one year after stent placement for participants not undergoing curative intent surgery
