Safety & Efficacy of Durvalumab+Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for High-risk Urothelial Carcinoma of the Upper Urinary Tract
Following radical nephrectomy (RNU) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) most patients face a poor prognosis. Indeed, patients who have undergone RNU for UTUC have 5-year recurrence-free and cancer specific survival probabilities of 69% and 73% respectively.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the pathological complete response rate to combination therapy with neoadjuvant durvalumab and chemotherapy (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) before surgery in patients with high-risk, localized, non-metastatic urothelial carcinomas of the upper tract.

Pathological complete response in Cohort 1, For Cohort 1 (patients on treatment combining Durvalumab and Gemcitabine associated with Cisplatin) the rate of patients with pathological complete response will be calculated and presented with associated 95% confidence interval on the subpopulation of patients with ureteroscopic biopsy at diagnosis.Pathological complete response is defined as no residual signs of viable tumor cells in tissue samples removed during surgery after treatment. To find out if there is a pathologic complete response, a pathologist will perform an evaluation of the tissue samples under a microscope to see if there are still cancer cells left after the treatment., Week 14 - 18|Pathological complete response in Cohort 2, For Cohort 2 (patients on treatment combining Durvalumab and Gemcitabine associated with Carboplatin) the rate of patients with pathological complete response will be calculated and presented with associated 95% confidence interval on the subpopulation of patients with ureteroscopic biopsy at diagnosis.Pathological complete response is defined as no residual signs of viable tumor cells in tissue samples removed during surgery after treatment.

Following radical nephrectomy (RNU) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) most patients face a poor prognosis. Indeed, patients who have undergone RNU for UTUC have 5-year recurrence-free and cancer specific survival probabilities of 69% and 73% respectively. Additional systemic therapy therefore seems justified for prolonged cancer control. However, there have been very few studies on neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies in UTUC. Recently, the UK's multicentric POUT trial reported the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in UTUC patients. Level 1 evidence has been provided for neoadjuvant therapy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder via meta-analysis in 2005 but there are also several arguments for systemic therapy in this context especially as most patients lose the function of one kidney and cannot receive nephrotoxic cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Urothelial carcinoma of the upper tract have a different genetic background from carcinomas of the lower tract. The investigators hypothesized that there would be a greater occurrence of lower pathological stages among study group patients who receive neoadjuvant combined Durvalumab/Gemcitabine/Cisplatin or Carboplatin prior to RNU compared to the current literature (Gregg et al. 2018, Almassi et al. 2018). The primary objective is to assess the pathological complete response rate (ypT0) in each cohort and independently of a combination therapy with neoadjuvant durvalumab and chemotherapy (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) before surgery in patients with high-risk, localized, non-metastatic urothelial carcinomas of the upper tract.Secondary objectives include: assessing partial response rate to treatment, assessing the safety and tolerability of the treatment and evaluating the overall survival, bladder recurrence and dissemination at two years of follow-up.
