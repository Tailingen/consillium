A Phase II Clinical Trial of Artificial Intelligence-assisted One-stop Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer After Breast-conserving Surgery
Background: Breast cancer became the most prevalent cancer globally in 2020, and post-surgery radiotherapy is crucial for most patients. Traditional radiotherapy is complex and time-consuming, affecting patient experience. To streamline this, an AI-assisted All-in-one (AIO) radiotherapy approach has been developed, integrating steps like target delineation and planning to reduce wait times and enhance accuracy. Preliminary results are promising, with significant time savings and high pass rates in initial assessments. Further exploration is needed to confirm the accuracy, effectiveness, and safety of AIO radiotherapy.

Primary objective: To conduct a prospective phase II clinical trial to determine the feasibility (including efficacy and safety) of AIO radiotherapy, and to provide a basis for establishing standard operating procedures.

Secondary objectives: To assess the impact of AIO radiotherapy on overall survival, local regional recurrence, and distant metastasis rates. To investigate the incidence and contributing factors of cardiac damage after AIO radiotherapy.
