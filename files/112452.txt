FHD-609 in Subjects With Advanced Synovial Sarcoma or Advanced SMARCB1-Loss Tumors
This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of FHD-609 given intravenously in subjects with advanced synovial sarcoma or advanced SMARCB1-loss tumors.

This study is an ascending multiple dose clinical trial with expansion arms. It is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FHD-609 when administered intravenously to subjects with advanced synovial sarcoma or advanced SMARCB1-loss tumors. The Dose Escalation Phase will allow for the determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FHD-609. This study will also evaluate the PK/PD profiles of multiple dose administration of FHD-609.

The Dose Expansion Phase will allow a more robust evaluation of the safety profile of FHD-609, including toxicities that may occur less frequently, and an assessment of anti-tumor activity. The data from this study in subjects with advanced synovial sarcoma, including safety, tolerability, PK/PD findings, and anti-tumor activity, will form the basis for subsequent clinical development of FHD-609.
