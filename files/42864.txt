Predicting Location and Extent of Prostate Cancer Using Micro-Ultrasound Imaging
The goal of this study is to use a clinical micro-ultrasound to systematically image the prostate before biopsy or surgery. The images from the ultrasound system will be saved and compared to other imaging modalities and pathology in order to develop better tools.

DEVICE: ExactVu
Micro-Ultrasound Detection of High Grade Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score ≥7) vs. Surgical Pathology, Evaluate the ability of micro-ultrasound to identify high grade prostate cancer foci (Gleason score ≥7) in comparison to final surgical pathology result (prostatectomy or biopsy), From date of micro ultrasound exam until the date of Prostate biopsy data are obtained (average of 7 days)
Prostate Cancer Border Identification Post-Prostatectomy, Evaluate the ability of micro-ultrasound to identify the borders of prostate cancer foci in comparison to final surgical pathology result in men after prostatectomy., 3 years|Micro-Ultrasound Detection of Low Grade Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 6), Evaluate the ability of micro-ultrasound to detect low grade prostate cancer foci (Gleason score 6), 1 year and 10 months|Prostate Cancer Detection: Micro-Ultrasound vs. mpMRI Comparison, Comparison of prostate cancer detection between micro-ultrasound and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)., 1 year and 10 months|Measuring Correlation Between Prostatectomy Pathology and Imaging Correlation, Perform a detailed pathologic and imaging correlation between findings on micro-ultrasound, MRI and final surgical histopathology in men who undergo prostatectomy, 3 years
