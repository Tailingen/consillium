A Study of PDR001 in Combination With CJM112, EGF816, Ilaris® (Canakinumab) or Mekinist® (Trametinib)
The purpose of this study was to combine the PDR001 checkpoint inhibitor with each of four agents with immunomodulatory activity to identify the doses and schedule for combination therapy and to preliminarily assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacological and clinical activity of these combinations.

This was a Phase Ib, multi-center, open-label study, to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of PDR001 in combination with canakinumab, CJM112, trametinib and EGF816 and single agent (s.a.) canakinumab in subjects with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC). The study comprised a dose escalation part for combination treatments only, followed by a dose expansion part.
