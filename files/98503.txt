GM-CLAG in Relapsed/Refractory FLT3-mutated AML
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II study dose of gilteritinib when combined with mitoxantrone, cladribine, cytarabine and filgrastim (GM-CLAG) in participants with FLT3- mutated relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Gilteritinib 40 MG Oral Tablet|DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Filgrastim|DRUG: Mitoxantrone
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of gilteritinib when combined with mitoxantrone, cladribine, cytarabine and filgrastim (GM-CLAG), DLT is defined as:

* Any treatment-related death
* Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting \> 42 days from start of cycle in the absence of active AML

  * Any Grade 4 or greater ANC lasting past cycle day 42
  * Any Grade 4 or greater platelets lasting past cycle day 42
* Grade ≥ 4 organ toxicity (i.e., adverse reactions involving neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, renal, hepatic, or cutaneous systems.)
* Confirmed Hy's law cases, 42 days|Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of gilteritinib when combined with mitoxantrone, cladribine, cytarabine and filgrastim (GM-CLAG), The MTD will be defined as the highest dose of Gilteritinib estimated to have less than 20% hematologic or non-hematologic DLT rates. Enrollment of next patient will be allowed only after prior cohort has completed Cycle 1 and recovered or failure of response has been documented by Day 42., 42 days
Complete remission (CR) rate after completing induction chemotherapy with the GM-CLAG combination., All the following criteria should be met:

1. bone marrow blasts \<5%
2. absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer roda
3. absence of extramedullary disease
4. ANC ≥ 1.0 × 109 /L (1000/µL)
5. platelet count ≥ 100 × 109 /L (100,000/µL)., 42 days|Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) after completing induction chemotherapy with the GM-CLAG combination., All CR criteria should be met except for residual neutropenia ANC ≤ 1.0 × 109 /L (1000/µL) or thrombocytopenia ≤ 100 × 109 /L (100,000 /µL)., 42 days|Complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) after completing induction chemotherapy with the GM-CLAG combination., All CR criteria should be met except for residual neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with at least partial recovery as evidenced by: ANC ≥ 0.5 × 109 /L (500/µL) and platelet count ≥ 50 × 109 /L (100,000/µL)., 42 days|Composite complete remission (CRc) after completing induction chemotherapy with the GM-CLAG combination., This is a composite rate of subjects who achieve a CR and those who achieve CRi., 42 days|Minimal residual disease status (MRD) after completing induction chemotherapy with the GM-CLAG combination., All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; MRD status will be determined by FLT3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of bone marrow aspirates obtained at the end of each cycle of induction., Two Induction Cycles (each up to 42 days)|Best response to Induction Therapy, Best response is defined as the best measured response (CR, CRp, CRi, or PR) post-treatment.

Two best responses, up to the time of 2 cycles of treatment period will be defined., Two Induction Cycles (each up to 42 days)|Percentage of patients proceeding to transplantation, To evaluate percentage of patients proceeding to transplantation at anytime during study period, Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Defined for all patients of the trial; measured from the date of registration to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive., Up to 2 years|Leukemia-free survival (LFS), Defined only for patients achieving CR, or CRi; measured from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse or death from any cause., Up to 2 years
The treatment of FLT3- mutated relapsed or refractory (R/R) is challenging. Gilteritinib, as a single agent, is the first FLT3 inhibitor to be FDA approved in the R/R setting. This phase I clinical trial will evaluate DLT/MTD and the recommended phase II study dose of gilteritinib when combined with mitoxantrone, cladribine, cytarabine and filgrastim (CLAG-M) in patients with FLT3- mutated R/R AML. This study will also evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib when combined with CLAG-M at specific time points. Although this combination has not been established to have superior clinical benefit in comparison to single-agent gilteritinib, the objective of this trial is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit in addition to safety and tolerability.
