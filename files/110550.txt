Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
RATIONALE: A vaccine made from a person's myelodysplasia cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.
Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
BIOLOGICAL: ras peptide cancer vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether a specific T-cell response can be induced in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome treated with mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific N-, K-, or H-ras peptide mutation in their bone marrow) and intradermal sargramostim (GM-CSF). II. Determine whether HLA type or the ability to respond immunologically to common recall antigens correlates with the induction of anti-ras immune responses in these patients treated with this regimen. III. Assess toxicity of mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally on days 1-10. Patients receive mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific N-, K-, or H-ras mutation in their bone marrow) intradermally on day 7. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks after the last vaccination.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-70 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-15 months.
