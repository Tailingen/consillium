Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on the Rate of Pathologic Complete Response in Vitamin D Deficient Patients
A two arm pilot study investigating the rate of pathologic complete response in patients with vitamin D deficiency and triple negative breast cancer undergoing standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy + vitamin D supplementation, including an observational arm to describe response in patients who are not deficient. Investigators hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable triple negative breast cancer patients with vitamin D deficiency, will increase the rate of pathologic complete response chain reaction to that of vitamin D sufficient patients based on historical controls.

Number of Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) in Vitamin D Supplementation Group, Investigators will determine whether the proportion responding (pCR) is less than or equal to 30% or greater than or equal to 60% using a one-stage phase II design. All participants in the intervention group who are evaluable will be included in the analysis. Pathologic complete response, which is also characterized as residual cancer burden 0, is defined as a final surgical pathologic diagnosis of ypT0 ypN0 or ypTis ypN0., Up to 26 months
Number of Participants with Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) Index - Vitamin D Supplementation Group, Five variables are included in the calculation formula. These include: 1) Primary tumor bed area, defined as the largest two dimensions (mms) of the residual tumor bed in the breast (largest tumor bed if multicentric disease), 2) Overall cancer cellularity (as percentage of area), 3) Percentage of cancer that is in situ disease, 4) Number of positive lymph nodes and 5) Diameter of largest metastasis. The calculated residual cancer burden index will be categorized as one of four residual cancer burden classes RCB-0 (pathologic complete response), minimal residual disease (RCB-I), moderate residual disease (RCB-II), or extensive residual disease (RCB-III)., Up to 26 months|Number of Participants with Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) Index - Observational Arm, Five variables are included in the calculation formula.

Primary Objective: To determine if pathologic complete response in vitamin D deficient patients receiving vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative breast cancer is greater than or equal to 60% or less than or equal to pathologic complete response in historical controls (30%) using a one-stage phase II design.

Secondary Objective(s):

* To estimate the proportion of patients with residual cancer burden (RCB) classes I, II, and III in vitamin D deficient patients receiving vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative breast cancer.
* To estimate pathologic complete response reaction in the observational arm of vitamin D sufficient patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative breast cancer.
* To determine the feasibility of delivery of vitamin D supplementation with standard of care chemotherapy.
* To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of vitamin D supplementation with standard of care chemotherapy.
* To estimate the change in vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression from pre- and post-neoadjuvant treatment breast tumor tissue samples of vitamin D deficient patients.
* To estimate the change in VDR expression from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment breast tumor tissue samples in a sample of 5 vitamin D sufficient patients.
* To estimate the changes in the fecal microbiome and mammary gland microbiome of vitamin D deficient patients from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment, and to explore the concordance in the changes between the mammary and fecal microbiome.
* To estimate the changes in the fecal microbiome and mammary gland microbiome in a sample of 5 vitamin D sufficient patients from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment.

Patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 days after the last study intervention is administered for adverse events monitoring.

Patients will be followed for 30 days after removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
