Overall response rate, 5 years
Association between safety and toxicity of patients with unresectable or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer, To evaluate the association between safety/toxicity outcome, we will apply the multivariate logistic regression with type I error of 0.05 and FDR-adjusted p-values. This multivariate logistic regression will include all variables that differ significantly in univariate logistic regression analysis., 5 years|Overall survival (OS), 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), 5 years
