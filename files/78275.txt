Study Design:

This is an open label (all participants know the identity of the study drug), multicenter (more than one study site), study consisting of 2 parts:

Group A (NRG1+ NSCLC): Approximately 50 NRG1+NSCLC patients will be enrolled and will receive zenocutuzumab in combination with afatinib 40 mg orally once daily.

Group B (mCRPC): Up to 40 mCRPC patients will be enrolled and will receive zenocutuzumab in combination with the AR targeting agent enzalutamide or abiraterone on which they experienced disease progression immediately before study entry.

For the administration of zenocutuzumab in combination in Groups A and B, the Treatment Period will include 2 phases, an initial safety run-in phase, and an expansion phase with an interim efficacy analysis.

The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening, Treatment, Safety Follow-up, and Long-term Follow up.
