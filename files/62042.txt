KN046 Plus Regorafenib or Apatinib in MSI-H Digestive System Cancers Resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade
The study is an interventional phase II clinical trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KN046, a PD-L1 and CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, in combination with regorafenib or apatinib for microsatellite instability-high digestive system cancers resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. KN046 plus regorafenib will be given for patients with colorectal cancers, and KN046 plus apatinib will be given for patients with gastric cancers (including esophageal-gastric junction cancers) and other kinds of digestive system cancers.
Digestive System Cancers
DRUG: KN046|DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: Apatinib
Progression free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of radiographic progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months post-dose
Overall response rate, Objective response rate (defined as CR+PR) will be reported based on investigator's evaluation., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months post-dose|Disease control rate, Disease control rate (defined as CR+PR+SD) will be reported based on investigator's evaluation., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months post-dose|Duration of response, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the date of the first response to the first objective documentation of radiographic progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months post-dose|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months post-dose|treatment-related adverse event, A treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) is defined as any adverse event not present prior to the initiation of drug treatment or any adverse event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency following exposure to the drug treatment. TRAEs were graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI)-CTCAE version 5.0., Informed consent to 30 days after last dose of treatment.
