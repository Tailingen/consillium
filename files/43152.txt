Liquid Biopsy-based Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer: a Proof-of-concept Study ( PROFOUND-OC )
This study is a multi-center, observational study aiming at developing a machine learning-based early detection model using prospectively collected liquid biopsy samples from newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.

Peripheral blood samples from ovarian cancer (OC) patients will be prospectively collected to identify cancer-specific circulating signals by analyzing cell free DNA. Based on the comprehensive molecular profiling, a machine learning-driven noninvasive test will be trained and validated through a two-stage approach in clinically annotated individuals. Approximately 168 stage I-II OC patients will be enrolled in this study. Age-matched female controls included in model development were recruited in another study, which are volunteers without a cancer diagnosis after routine medical screening.
