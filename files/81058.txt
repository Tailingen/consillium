A Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Initial Efficacy of IBI110 in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of IBI110 in subjects with advanced malignancies.
Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: IBI110|DRUG: IBI110|DRUG: IBI110+ Sintilimab|DRUG: IBI110+ Sintilimab
Number of subjects with AEs and SAEs, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI110 alone or in combination with Sintilimab \[Adverse events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) \], up to 2 years after enrollment|Percentage of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI110 alone or in combination with Sintilimab., From Baseline to the end of Cycle 1
Pharmacokinetics: AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration., up to 2 years after enrollment|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax, Maximum concentration (Cmax) of the drug after administration, up to 2 years after enrollment|Immunogenicity: Percentage of ADA positive subjects, Immunogenicity: Number of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) positive subjects will be counted and percentage of ADA positive subjects will be calculated to evaluate immunogenicity of IBI110., up to 2 years after enrollment|Preliminary anti-tumor activity of IBI110 (Objective Response Rate), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of Complete Response (CR) plus partial response (PR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors and Lugano2014 criteria for lymphoma., up to 2 years after enrollment
This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of IBI110 in subjects with advanced malignancies.
