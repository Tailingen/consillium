Prospective Trial of Vaccine Responses in Childhood Cancer Survivors
This study will look at your body's response to the new immunizations. We want to see how well they will protect you. Immunization is the same as vaccination. Our goal is to protect you as much as we can. We do not want you to have the measles, mumps, or whooping cough. We are doing the study because there is no standard way to re-immunize people after cancer treatments.
