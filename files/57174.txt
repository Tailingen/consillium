Study of Anti-CD33 Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Expressing T Cells (CD33CART) in Children and Young Adults With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This phase 1/2 trial aims to determine the safety and feasibility of antiCD33 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expressing T cells (CD33CART) in children and adolescents/young adults (AYAs) with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The trial will be done in two phases: Phase 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of CD33CART cells using a 3+3 trial design, with dose-escalation for autologous products separated from dose-escalation for an allogeneic arm. Phase 2 is an expansion phase designed to evaluate the rate of response to CD33CART.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD33CART autologous|BIOLOGICAL: CD33CART allogeneic
Maximum tolerated dose - Autologous Arm, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lentivirally-transduced autologous CD33-redirected CAR-T cells (CD33CART) in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory AML, Day 28 post CD33CART infusion|Maximum tolerated dose - Allogeneic Arm, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lentivirally-transduced allogeneic CD33-redirected CAR-T cells (ALLO-CD33CART) in children and young adults with post-HSCT relapsed/refractory AML, Day 28 post CD33CART infusion|Morphologic remission, To determine the percentage of recipients treated with CD33CART who achieve morphologic remission (\<5% blasts in marrow) at Day 28 post-CD33CART cell infusion, Day 28 post CD33CART infusion
Feasibility of CD33CART manufacture, To determine the feasibility of manufacturing CD33CART for recipients with AML, 2 weeks post start of CD33CART manufacture|Feasibility of CD33CART infusion, To determine the feasibility of infusing CD33CART in recipients with AML, 6 weeks post apheresis|Molecular Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), sinusoidal occlusion syndrome (SOS), or other CD33CART related toxicities, To determine the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), sinusoidal occlusion syndrome (SOS), or other CD33CART related toxicities, 8 weeks post CD33CART infusion|Overall survival, event-free survival and treatment-related mortality, To estimate the overall survival, event-free survival, and treatment-related mortality at Day 28 post-CD33CART, 28 days post CD33CART infusion|Morphologic remission, To determine the percentage of recipients treated with CD33CART who achieve morphologic remission (\<5% blasts in marrow) at Day 28 post-CD33CART cell infusion (for those in Phase I), 28 days post CD33CART infusion|Molecular remission, To determine the percentage of recipients treated with CD33CART who achieve molecular remission (for those with an identified molecular marker) at Day 28 post-CD33CART cell infusion, 28 days post CD33CART infusion|MRD negativity, To determine minimal residual disease \[MRD\] negativity by flow cytometry (\<0.1%) at Day 28 post-CD33CART cell infusion, 28 days post CD33CART infusion|GVHD, To determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated on the allogeneic arm (ALLO-CD33CART)., 30 days post CD33CART infusion|Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, To determine the percentage of recipients able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following treatment with CD33CART, 6 weeks post CD33CART infusion|SOS and other post-transplant toxicities, For treatment population that subsequently proceeds to HSCT: To determine the percentage of recipients able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following treatment with CD33CART, 6 weeks post HCT|Post-HCT time to engraftment, For treatment population that subsequently proceeds to HSCT: To evaluate the post-HCT time to engraftment, transplant related mortality, incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD and cGVHD)., 6 weeks post HCT
This study consists of two phases. The objectives of Phase 1 and Phase 2 are:

Phase 1:

Autologous Arm: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lentivirally transduced autologous CD33-redirected CAR-T cells (CD33CART) in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory AML

Allogeneic Arm: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lentivirally transduced allogeneic CD33-redirected CAR-T cells (ALLO-CD33CART) in children and young adults with post-HSCT relapsed/refractory AML

Phase 2:

To determine the percentage of recipients treated with CD33CART who achieve morphologic remission (\<5% blasts in marrow) at Day 28 post-CD33CART cell infusion
