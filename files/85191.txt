MTH1, A Phase I, Study on Tumors Inhibition, First in Human, First in Class
Primary Objective

• To determine the safety and tolerability of Karonudib (TH1579) in escalating doses for the treatment of patients with advanced solid malignant tumours.

Secondary Objective

* To define DLT and MTD.
* To determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule.
* To determine the pharmacokinetics of Karonudib.
* To determine preliminary signs of clinical efficacy of Karonudib.
* To determine overall survival.
Cancer
DRUG: Karonudib
Safety and tolerability of Karonudib (TH1579) will be evaluated., Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). DLTs will be assessed during first cycle of therapy, week 1-4 based on Haematological toxicity and Non-haematological toxicity.

MTD: The highest dose of Karonudib that does not cause unacceptable side effects is defined as the MTD., 28 days, first treatment cycle for the patient.
