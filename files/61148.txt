Efficacy of Risk-Stratified Treatment in Newly Diagnosed Infant Leukemia
This clinical trial is an open-label, multicenter, prospective phase 2 clinical trial targeting pediatric leukemia patients of infant age. The goal is to improve survival rates by varying the presence or absence of chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation based on genetic characteristics at the time of diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) values measured by various methods after treatment.

In addition, by clearly defining the patient group that requires hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, it is expected that the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in infantile leukemia, for which there have been various guidelines for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, can be confirmed. Additionally, due to the characteristics of infants, this study aim to identify long-term sequelae or prognosis related to treatment by prospectively collecting side effect data related to treatment during and after treatment.

Infant leukemia patients are classified into low/intermediate/high risk groups and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is performed after chemotherapy or chemotherapy as shown in the schema below.

* Low risk group : Induction chemotherapy-Low Risk Consolidation chemotherapy 1\~4 - Maintenance chemotherapy
* Intermediate risk group : Induction chemotherapy-High Risk Consolidation chemotherapy 1\~4 - Maintenance chemotherapy
* High risk group : Induction chemotherapy-High Risk Consolidation chemotherapy 1\~4 - hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
