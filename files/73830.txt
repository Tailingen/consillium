Precision-T: A Study of Orca-T in Recipients Undergoing Allogeneic Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Orca-T, an allogeneic stem cell and T-cell immunotherapy biologic manufactured for each patient (transplant recipient) from the mobilized peripheral blood of a specific, unique donor. It is composed of purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), purified regulatory T cells (Tregs), and conventional T cells (Tcons) in participants undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant transplantation for hematologic malignancies.
