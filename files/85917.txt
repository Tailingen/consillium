ARQ761 + PARP Inhibitor in Refractory Solid Tumors
Open Label, dose escalation in a 3+3 study design to establish the RP2D of the combination of ARQ761 and a PARP inhibitor, Olaparib
Lymphoma
DRUG: ARQ761, Olaparib
The maximum tolerated dose of ARQ761 in combination with Olaparib., If a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in 1 out of 3 patients at a given dose level, up to 3 additional patients will be enrolled and treated at that dose level., Day 1-28
Dose limiting toxicities, DLT will be defined by the occurrence of any of the following toxicities possibly or probably related to treatment, during cycle 1 only:

Grade 3 or 4 hemolysis or hemolytic anemia, except: Transfusion for hemolysis or hemolytic anemia will be considered a DLT only if Hgb \< 8.0 g/dL (Grade 3 anemia) (b) Any drug related grade 3 or grade 4 non-hematological toxicity, except alopecia, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of optimal anti-diarrheal and/or anti-nausea medications (c)Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days. (d) Platelets \<50,000/µl for longer than 7 days or any platelet count \<25,000/µl. (e) Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia that does not recover to Grade 1 within 7 days, 4 weeks
Open Label, dose escalation in a 3+3 study design to establish the RP2D of the combination of ARQ761 and a PARP inhibitor, Olaparib. This is an exploratory Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of the combination of ARQ761 and Olaparib.
