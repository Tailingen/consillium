Efficacy and Safety of Zanubrutinib in Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
This was a single-arm, open-label, multi-center Phase 2 study in participants with histologically documented CLL/SLL who have relapsed after or refractory to ≥ 1 prior treatment regimen(s). The study is composed of an initial screening phase, a single-arm treatment phase, and a follow-up phase.
Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Relapsed or Refractory Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Zanubrutinib
Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best response of CR or, CRi, Nodular Partial Response, PR, and PR with Lymphocytosis as assessed by IRC per the modified IWCLL Guidelines in participants with CLL and the Revised Criteria for Response for Malignant Lymphoma in participants with SLL., Up to 1 year and 4 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS): Percentage of Participants Progression/Death Event Free, PFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to first documentation of progression by International workshop on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (IWCLL) criteria/revised criteria for response for malignant lymphoma or death, whichever is earlier., 6, 12, 24, and 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR): Event Free Rate - Percentage of Participants Who Remained Event Free, DOR is defined as the time from the date that response criteria are first met to the date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from treatment initiation to first signs of response, Up to 3.5 years|Overall Response Rate as Determined by the Investigator, Overall response was defined as achieving a best overall response of CR, CRi, nodular partial response (nPR), PR, or partial response with lymphocytosis (PR-L)., up to 3.5 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. All AEs were monitored per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version \[v\] 4.03 2010). A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event that has an onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first., Up to 3.5 years
