Safety and Efficacy of Mitomycin C-based HIPEC After srHCC and PM of HCC
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is featured by the spontaneously rupture when suffering severe cirrhosis and intratumoral overpressure. It is a fatal complication with an acute mortality. Importantly, it is served as an independent risk factor for peritoneal metastasis (PM) of HCC with poor prognosis. The systematic agents effective to extrahepatic lesions confers modest efficacy towards PM. HIPEC, as a novel strategy, has been proved by overwhelming studies that it is effective to peritoneal malignant tumors. However, there is absence of prospective study of HIPEC efficacy towards HCC.
