A Phase I/IIa Clinical Trial to Assess Feasibility, Safety and Antitumor Activity of Autologous SLAMF7 CAR-T Cells in Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare hematologic malignancy of aberrant plasma cells.

There is a high and currently unmet medical need for novel, innovative treatment concepts to improve the therapeutic outcome and prognosis of patients suffering from MM.

There is definitive evidence that MM is susceptible to immune-based therapies from pre-clinical investigations and early clinical trials.

CARAMBA-1 is a first-in-human clinical trial of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells in patients with advanced MM that have exhausted conventional therapies.

The CARAMBA-1 clinical trial is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter clinical trial which combines a phase I dose-escalation part with a phase IIa dose-expansion part to assess feasibility, safety and anti-myeloma activity of SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.

The CARAMBA project and the CARAMBA-1 clinical trial are supported by the European Union in the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.

SLAMF7 CAR-T cells are manufactured using virus-free gene-transfer using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system.

The CAR-T cell product is formulated to contain equal proportions of CD8 cytotoxic and CD4 helper SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.
