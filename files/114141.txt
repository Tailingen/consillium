Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) - Phase 1, The highest dose at which less than (\<) 33 percent (%) of participants experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) was to be designated as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as well as the RP2D. DLT was defined as any of the following events: Grade 3/4 (severe or life-threatening/ disabling adverse event \[AE\]) nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (despite the use of adequate/maximal medical intervention and/or prophylaxis); Grade greater than or equal to (\>=) 3 (severe or life-threatening/disabling AE or death related to AE) non-hematological toxicity; delayed (which delayed scheduled treatment for \>14 days) recovery from toxicity related to treatment with PF-00299804; Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \<500 cells per cubic millimeter \[cells/mm\^3\] for 5 or more consecutive days or febrile neutropenia \[fever \>=38.5 degrees Celsius with ANC \<1000 cells/mm\^3\]); and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (\<25,000 cells/mm\^3) or bleeding which required platelet transfusion., Baseline up to Day 21|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at Month 4 (PFS4m) - Phase 2, PFS4m was defined as percent chance of being event free (event defined as progressive disease \[PD\] or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first) at 4 months. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), as at least 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LD recorded since the treatment started and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Month 4
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at Month 6 (PFS6m) - Phase 2, PFS6m was defined as percent chance of being event free (event defined as PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first) at 6 months. Progression was defined using RECIST, as at least 20% increase in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LD recorded since the treatment started and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Month 6|Overall Survival (OS) at Month 6 (OS6m) - Phase 2, OS6m was defined as percent chance of being alive at Month 6., Month 6|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Phase 1, Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LDs) of target lesion, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Baseline until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy or death, assessed every 2 (odd-numbered) cycles up to 12 months after end of treatment (EOT) (EOT: up to Day 506)|Soluble Protein Biomarkers Level, Blood specimens were analyzed at a sponsor-designated laboratory for analysis of shed proteins/receptors related to Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) signaling (epidermal growth factor receptor \[EGFR\], HER2). These measurements were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Scores were averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score for Global Qol/Fn scales=better level of QoL/functioning or higher score for symptom scales/items=greater degree of symptoms. Overall scale change is categorized as Improved (if average scales change from baseline: for Global QoL/Fn scales \>=10; for symptom scale/item \<=-10), Worsened (if average scales change from baseline: for Global QoL/Fn scales \<=-10; for symptom scale/item \>=10), and Stable (if average scales change from baseline \>-10 but \<10 for Global QoL/Fn scales and symptom scale/item) and participants in each category are reported., Baseline up to end of treatment (up to Day 889)|Number of Participants With Change in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) - Phase 2, EORTC QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, chest pain, arm pain, other pain, and medicine for pain). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Overall scale change is categorized as Improved (if average scales change from baseline \<=-10), Worsened (if average scales change from baseline \>=10), and Stable (if average scales change from baseline \>-10 but \<10) and participants in each category are reported., Baseline up to end of treatment (up to Day 889)|Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score - Phase 2, DLQI: 10-item questionnaire to measure how much the participant's skin problem has impacted their life over the previous week. All questions were answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all/not relevant) to 3 (very much/prevented work or studying). The DLQI was calculated by summing the score of each question and ranged from 0 to 30, where higher scores indicate more quality of life impairment., C1D1 (baseline), D1 of each subsequent cycle up to C44|Best Overall Response (BOR) - Phase 2, Number of participants with BOR according to RECIST: CR= disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR= at least 30% decrease in sum of LDs of target lesion, taking as reference baseline sum LD, associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions. Stable/no response= neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Objective progression= at least a 20% increase in sum of LDs of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LD recorded since treatment started and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Baseline until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy or death, assessed every 2 (odd-numbered) cycles up to 12 months after EOT (EOT: up to Day 1723)|Duration of Response (DR), Time in weeks from first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause minus the date of the first CR or PR \[which ever occurred first\] that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response., Baseline until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy or death, assessed every 2 (odd-numbered) cycles up to 12 months after EOT (EOT: up to Day 506 for Phase 1 and up to Day 1723 for Phase 2)
