ResQ201A: Clinical Trial Of N-803 Plus TISLELIZUMAB And DOCETAXEL Versus DOCETAXEL Monotherapy In Participants With Advanced Or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of N-803 plus tislelizumab and docetaxel (experimental arm) versus docetaxel monotherapy (control arm). Enrolled participants will be randomized 2:1 to treatment in the experimental arm or the control arm. Participant randomization will be stratified by geographical region (North America vs Europe vs ASIA vs Other), NSCLC histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), and actionable genomic alteration (AGA); (epidermal growth factor receptor \[EGFR\]/anaplastic lymphoma kinase \[ALK\] vs OTHER AGA vs No AGA).
NSCLC Stage IV
DRUG: N-803|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel
Compare Overall Survival between the experimental and control arms, Approximately 12 months
