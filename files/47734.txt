Construction of a Prediction Model for Metachronous Colorectal Adenoma
The study aimed to explore the independent risk factors for the metachronous colorectal adenoma after endoscopic resection, and construct the prediction model of metachronous colorectal adenoma, in order to provide theoretical basis for postoperative follow-up time of patients, and allocate limited medical resources.
Metachronous Colorectal Adenoma
Demographic characteristics of patients with metachronous colorectal adenomas checklist, Age (years), sex (man/woman), family history of colorectal cancer (in first-degree relatives, including parents and siblings), history of smoking (never, past, current), history of alcohol consumption (never, past, current), regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 3 year
Cumulative recurrence rate of metachronous colorectal adenomas, Cumulative recurrence rate, 3 year
A large cohort of eligible patients were included in the analysis, and classified into derivation and validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of participants were utilized to develop a prediction model for metachronous colorectal adenoma. In the derivation cohort, the LASSO regression method was applied to filter variables and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify important predictors.A prediction model was established based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated with respect to its discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness.
