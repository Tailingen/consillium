HAIC Combined Sintilimab for Liver Metastasis From Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Patients with liver metastasis from esophagus squamous (ESC) are usually offered systemic therapy. However, for those with predominant liver disease or failure of system therapy, local liver management becomes an option. This prospective single center study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using percutaneous catheter placement techniques for liver metastases from esophagus squamous (ESC).
