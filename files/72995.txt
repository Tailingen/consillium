Serum Pepsinogen After H. Pylori Eradication
Helicobacter pylori has been recognized as a major pathogen in gastric carcinogenesis. Current guidelines recommend the H. pylori "test-and-treat" strategy for the purpose of primary and secondary gastric cancer prevention. Considering the "point of no return" theory, however, H. pylori eradication cannot reduce the risk of gastric cancer in subjects with gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. The intragastric hypoacidic environment is associated with the risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer development. Recently, the secretory ability of the stomach can be measured using the serum pepsinogen (PG) assay.
Helicobacter Pylori Eradication
Serum pepsinogen change after H. pylori eradication, Serum pepsinogen recovery, after 8 weeks
This study aimed to evaluate the change of serum PGs after H. pylori eradication success and identify the optimal timing of eradication.
