Safety and Efficacy of CD123-targeted CAR-NK for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm
This study is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalating + dose-expansion clinical study, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeting CD123 CAR-NK cell preparations in Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or blastocytic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). The pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR-NK cell preparations for the treatment of patients with Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or blastocytic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm were obtained and the recommended dose.

BIOLOGICAL: CD123 targeted CAR-NK cells
To evaluate the safety of CAR-NK cell preparations in the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm[Safety and Tolerability], The incidence of adverse events after CD123 CAR-NK cell infusion was assessed by the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), 1 month|To evaluate the efficacy of CAR-NK cell preparations in the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm[Effectiveness], Objective response rate at 4W±7D and 3M±7D after CAR-NK infusion (Objective response rate includes CR, CRi), 1month,3months
AUCS of CD123 CAR-NK cells [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 90 days, 3 months|CMAX of CD123 CAR-NK cells [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of CEA CAR-T cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|TMAX of CD123 CAR-NK cells[Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|Pharmacodynamics of CD123 CAR-NK cells[Cell dynamics], The degree of clearance of malignant cells in peripheral blood was detected by blood smear at each time point，and the concentration level of serum cytoplasmic factors such as CRP and IL-6 were detected by ELISA at each time point, 3 months
Duration of Response (DOR) of CD123 CAR-NK treatment in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/CRi to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CD123 CAR-NK treatment in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CD123 CAR-NK cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression, 2 years|Overall survival(OS)of CD123 CAR-NK treatment in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CD123 CAR-NK cell infusion to death from any cause, 2 years
According to the different disease type, it is divided into two subgroups: AML and BPDCN. Each subgroup includes a dose exploration stage (Part A) and a dose expansion stage (Part B). 3 patients were explored, starting from the low-dose group, and in the dose expansion phase, the safety and efficacy were further verified according to the safe recommended dose obtained in the dose exploration phase.
