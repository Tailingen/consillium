Osimertinib for NSCLC With EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutation
This is a single-arm, non-randomized multicentre phase 2 study in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation, whose disease has progressed on standard chemotherapy.

EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutant NSCLCs are generally resistant to 1st-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as well as 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs (overall response rates of 0-8.7%). Osimertinib is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for sensitizing EGFR and EGFR T790M resistance mutations with a significant selectivity margin against wild-type EGFR. Osimertinib is potent with a wide therapeutic window in Ba/F3 cells with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Therefore, this study will be performed to investigate the efficacy of osimertinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation
