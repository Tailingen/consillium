Clinical Trial of Chemotherapy, Oregovomab and Nivolumab in Patients With Epithelial Cancer of Ovarian, Tubal or Peritoneal Origin
This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I/II, single-center study with dose finding and dose expansion parts.

This study hypothesizes that the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy, Oregovomab and Nivolumab will improve intracellular CA 125 antigen processing and elicit a stronger systemic CA 125-specific T cell response and that it will be in a manner that is synergistic, safe and clinical efficacious in patients with relapsed platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).
