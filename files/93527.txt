Safety, PK/PD, and Clinical Activity of KT-413 in Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-cell NHL
This Phase 1a/1b study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (PK/ PD) of KT-413 in patients with R/R NHL. The Phase 1a stage of the study will explore escalating doses of single-agent KT-413. The Phase 1b stage will be split into 2 expansion cohorts to further characterize the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (PK/ PD) of KT-413 in MYD88 mutant and MYD88 wild-type R/R DLBCL.
