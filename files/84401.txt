Mezigdomide and Elranatamab for Relapsed And/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The goal of this clinical trial is to find out how well a combination of two medicines (mezigdomide and elranatamab) works in treating patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma.
Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
DRUG: Elranatamab|DRUG: Mezigdomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of subjects who achieve best response of partial response (PR) or better according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, From C1D1 to confirmed PD, lost to follow-up, or death (whichever occurs first), assessed up to 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from randomization to first documentation of progressive disease (PD) according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (Kumar, 2016) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From randomization to first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause, assessed up to 24 months.|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to time of death due to any cause, assessed up to 24 months.|Complete Response Rate (CR) or better, Percentage of subjects who achieve best response of complete response (CR) or better according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (Kumar, 2016)., From C1D1 to confirmed PD, lost to follow-up, or death (whichever occurs first), assessed up to 24 months|Very Good Partial Response Rate (VGPR) or better, Percentage of subjects who achieve best response of very good partial response (VGPR) or better according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (Kumar, 2016)., From C1D1 to confirmed PD, lost to follow-up, or death (whichever occurs first), assessed up to 24 months|Time to Response (TTR), Time from randomization to the first documentation of response (PR or better), assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of Response (DOR), Time from the first documentation of response (PR or better) to the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months.|Recommended mezigdomide dose, Recommended mezigdomide dose for Part 2, based on the totality of safety, and efficacy, through study part 1 completion, up to 6 weeks.|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), Time from randomization to the start of the next antimyeloma treatment, assessed up to 24 months.|Safety, Type, frequency, seriousness and severity of adverse events (AEs), and relationship of AEs to study treatment This includes frequency of grade 3/4 cytopenias and infection., From C1D1 to End of trial, assessed up to 24 months.|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity rate, Proportion of subjects who achieve complete response (CR) or better and are MRD negative, From C1D1 to confirmed PD, lost to follow-up, or death (whichever occurs first), assessed up to 24 months
Biomarkers, Correlation of baseline RNA/protein expression, gene expression, cytogenetics, copy number abnormalities and/or mutations in tumor cells to treatment response.

Correlation of changes in RNA/protein expression, gene expression or genomic abnormalities in tumor cells to disease progression, From C1D1 to End of trial, assessed up to 24 months.
This is a phase I/II (2 parts), open-label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elranatamab in combination with mezigdomide.

Part 1 (safety cohort): Since the combination of elranatamab with mezigdomide has not previously been evaluated, Part 1 (safety cohort) of the study will be conducted in up to approximately 12 participants to select the optimal RP2D and to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.

Part 2 (expansion cohort): In Part 2 (expansion cohort), approximately 63 participants will be enrolled. The primary objective of Part 2 is to determine the overall response rate per IMWG criteria at 24 months after enrollment. Participants will receive elranatamab, mezigdomide and dexamethasone.
