CT-guided Radioactive Iodine-125 Seed Implantation for Recurrent Desmoid Tumors
This study aimed to explore the long-term outcomes of CT-guided radioactive iodine-125 (I-125) seed implantation (RISI) for recurrent desmoid tumor.

A multicenter retrospective study reviewed 38 recurrent desmoid tumor patients receiving RISI from July 2013 to July 2021.The clinical outcomes including overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), local control time (LCT), overall survival (OS), adverse events (AEs), and symptom relief rate were statistically assessed.

Local control time (LCT), LCT was defined as the time from seed implantation to local progression, 8 years|objective response rate (ORR), ORR was calculated from patients achieving CR and PR, 6 months|disease control rate (DCR), DCR was likewise calculated from the patients of CR, PR and SD., 6 months
overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from RISI to death from any cause, 8 years|adverse events (AEs), The AEs were evaluated as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines., 8 years|symptom relief rate, symptom relief rate was calculated from the patients achieving relief after treatment., 8 years
Desmoid tumor was characterized by a high potential of recurrence even following initial definitive treatment. There were considerable controversies regarding the management of recurrent desmoid tumor. This study aimed to explore the long-term outcomes of CT-guided radioactive iodine-125 (I-125) seed implantation (RISI) for recurrent desmoid tumor.

38 patients, diagnosed with recurrent desmoid tumor, undergoing RISI in 3 different centers including Peking University Third Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of the Army Medical University, and Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital from July 2013 to July 2021 were reviewed consecutively.

The clinical outcomes including overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), local control time (LCT), overall survival (OS), adverse events (AEs), and symptom relief rate were statistically assessed.
