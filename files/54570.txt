This is a single-center, non-randomized clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR066 in treatment of r/r B cell lymphoma who received CD19 CAR-T therapy.
B Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD20-directed CAR-T cells with CliniMACS ProdigyÂ® system
Incidence of adverse events, The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 12 weeks after C-CAR066 infusion
Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects who achieved complete response and partial response, Up to 24 months after C-CAR066 infusion|Complete response rate (CRR), The percentage of subjects who achieved complete response, Up to 24 months after C-CAR066 infusion|Duration of response (DOR), The time from the date of first response (PR or CR) to the date of disease progression or death after C-CAR066 infusion, Up to 24 months after C-CAR066 infusion|Progression free survival (PFS), The time from C-CAR066 infusion to the date of progression as assessed by Lugano 2014 criteria or death, Up to 24 months after C-CAR066 infusion|Overall survival (OS), Time from C-CAR066 infusion to death from any cause, Up to 24 months after C-CAR066 infusion
This study plans to enroll 10 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of C-CAR066. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of C-CAR066 injection.

The study will include the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre- Treatment (Cell Product Preparation, Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), C-CAR066 infusion and Follow-up Visit.
