Treatment for Advanced B-Cell Lymphoma
To safely reduce the burden of therapy in children, adolescents and young adults with mature B-NHL by reducing the number of intrathecal (IT) injections by the introduction of IT Liposomal Cytarabine (L-ARA-C, \[Depocyt®\]) and reducing the dose of anthracycline (doxorubicin) in good risk patients with the addition of rituximab to the FAB chemotherapy backbone (Immunochemotherapy).
