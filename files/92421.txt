A Study of LOXO-783 in Patients With Breast Cancer/Other Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of LOXO-783. LOXO-783 may be used to treat breast cancer and other solid tumors that have a change in a particular gene (known as the PIK3CA gene). Participation could last up to 36 months (3 years) and possibly longer if the disease does not get worse.
