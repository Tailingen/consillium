Effect of Low-frequency Electroacupuncture (EA) on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) can decrease serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione (A) and testosterone (T)of young women with polycystic ovary syndrome in the Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) stimulation test ，also，we hypothesize that EA is more efficiency in improving ovulation rate and menstrual cycle than sham acupuncture.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
OTHER: acupuncture protocol 1|OTHER: Acupuncture protocol 2
HCG stimulation test, Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) stimulation test: Both at baseline and in one week after the treatment, the patients will receive an intramuscular injection of 5000 IU HCG, and 24 h and 48 h later, serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione (A) and testosterone (T) of the patients will be detected., 16 weeks
Laboratory examination, Serum levels of sex hormone steroids including blood follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen, progesterone, prolactin and total testosterone will be evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin releasing test will be performed at baseline and 16 weeks. Serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, adrenal cortical hormone and beta endorphin will be examined at baseline and 16 weeks later., 16 weeks|trans-abdomen ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries, The uterine dimensions, endometrial thickness and echo type, other uterine abnormalities, presence and size of leiomyoma, uterine artery blood flow parameters (pulsation index, resistance index, Shrinkage value / Diastolic value) will be obtained through trans-abdomen ultrasound at baseline and 16 weeks. The ovarian size in three dimensions, the size of the largest ovarian follicle/cyst and size of every follicle with a mean diameter greater than 10 mm, and total antral follicle (small follicles with mean diameter \< 10 mm) count of each ovary; ovarian artery blood flow parameters will be observed through trans-abdomen ultrasound at baseline and 16 weeks later., 16 weeks|Physical examination, Physical examination including vital signs, height, weight, hip and waist measurements, BMI and assessment of hirsutism by Ferriman-Gallwey score and acne standard acne lesion counts will be performed at baseline and 16 weeks., 16 weeks|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Adverse events happened during 16-week treatment period and 12-week follow-up will be recorded and classified. Unless otherwise formal requirements, each report about the detail and summary of adverse event to data safety supervision and the commission will be reported by double blind way., 16 weeks|menstrual frequency, The menstruation characteristics including menstrual cycle, duration and amount of the past 4 months and during the treatment period will be recorded. Menstrual frequency was calculated by dividing the number of menstrual bleeding by 4., 16 weeks|serum levels of the neurotransmitter, serum levels of AD, NE,5-HT and GABA between two groups both at baseline and after the treatment., 16 weeks
First, patients will be recruited according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

Second, baseline measurements (including menstrual frequency,human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) stimulation test,physical examination,trans-abdomen ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries, serum levels of sex hormone steroids) will be taken.

Third, each patient will receive 32 sessions of acupuncture in 16 weeks, twice a week.

Last, the above baseline measurements will be taken again as soon as the treatment is finished and menstrual frequency will be recorded during the 12 weeks of follow-up after the treatment.
