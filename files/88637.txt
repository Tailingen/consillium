Improving Quality of Life After Prostate Brachytherapy: a Comparison of HDR and LDR Brachytherapy
Optimal non surgical treatment of prostate cancer requires dose escalation which is frequently provided by adding a brachytherapy "boost" to a short course of external beam radiotherapy. The hypothesis in this randomized study is that a High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost leads to equivalent or better Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival when compared to a Low Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy boost and that it is associated with a more favorable toxicity profile and improved quality of life.

RADIATION: HDR|RADIATION: LDR
Compare Quality of Life between two arms as measured by EPIC questionnaire, Quality of life will be measured through validated instruments including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the International Index of Erectile Function ((IEF), and the urinary, bowel and sexual domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). IPSS has 7 questions related to voiding symptoms, each scored 0-5, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms. IIEF has 5 questions, each scored 0-5 with a higher score indicating better function. EPIC has several questions for each domain with an overall higher score associated with better QoL in that domain., 6 months
Quality of Life long term, Quality of Life will be assessed to 5 years using the validated instruments International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index Erectile Function and EPIC, 5 years
Efficacy: cancer free status, regular PSA monitoring every 6 months to 3 years and then annually to determine PSA recurrence free survival, 10 years
Men with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer who are technically suitable for prostate brachytherapy based on prostate size and voiding function and who are interested in this modality of treatment will be approached for randomization between either high dose rate (single 15 Gray) or low dose rate permanent seed implant (110 Gray) brachytherapy. Baseline International Prostate Symptom score, Quality of Life Assessment and International Index of Erectile Function will be recorded and then every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months to 3 years. Androgen deprivation treatment is allowed for 6 or 12 months.
