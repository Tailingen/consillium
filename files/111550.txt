A Study to Evaluate Efficacy in Subjects With Esophageal Cancer Treated With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab or Nivolumab Combined With Fluorouracil Plus Cisplatin Versus Fluorouracil Plus Cisplatin
The main purpose of this study is to compare how long subjects with esophageal cancer live overall or live without disease progression after receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab combined with fluorouracil plus cisplatin versus fluorouracil plus cisplatin
Various Advanced Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Fluorouracil
Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Tumor Cell PD-L1, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive., From the date of randomization to up to the date of death (up to approximately 20 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by BICR in Participants With Tumor Cell PD-L1, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented progressive disease (PD) per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) or death due to any cause. Participants who die without a reported prior PD per BICR (and die without start of subsequent therapy) will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. Participants who did not have documented PD per BICR per RECIST1.1 criteria and who did not die, will be censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment on or prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Participants who did not have any on-study tumor assessments and did not die (or died after initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy) will be censored at the randomization date. Participants who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported PD per BICR will be censored at the last tumor assessment on or prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy., From the date of randomization to up to the date of the first documented disease progression or death (up to approximately 9 months)
Overall Survival (OS) in All Randomized Participants, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive., From the date of randomization to up to the date of death (up to approximately 16 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) in All Randomized Participants as Assessed by BICR, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented progressive disease (PD) per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) or death due to any cause. Participants who die without a reported prior PD per BICR (and die without start of subsequent therapy) will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. Participants who did not have documented PD per BICR per RECIST1.1 criteria and who did not die, will be censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment on or prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Participants who did not have any on-study tumor assessments and did not die (or died after initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy) will be censored at the randomization date. Participants who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported PD per BICR will be censored at the last tumor assessment on or prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy., From the date of randomization to up to the date of the first documented disease progression or death (up to approximately 7 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation as determined by BICR, recorded between the date of randomization and the date of objectively documented progression (per RECIST 1.1) or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy (including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), whichever occurs first. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and the reduction of any pathological lymph nodes to \<10 mm., From the date of randomization to up to the date of objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first (up to 40 months)
