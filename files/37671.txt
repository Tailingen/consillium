morbi-mortality, Early Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition in patients undergoing colon cancer resection in an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol to improve the results of morbi-mortality and hospitalization versus standard intravenous fluid therapy, 30 days
The main objective is to determine if perioperative nutritional support with PeriOlimel N4-E, that reaches nutritional requirements of ERAS protocol for colorectal cancer surgery patients, can improve nutritional status so it decreases postoperative complications, hospital length of stay and costs, compared to conventional fluid therapy administration since patients receive oral nutrition at day 3-5.
