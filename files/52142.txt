A Study of GC012F (AZD0120), a CAR T Therapy Targeting CD19 and BCMA in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This trial is a phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter study of GC012F (AZD0120), a CD19/BCMA dual CART-cell therapy, in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma.
Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: GC012F (AZD0120)
Phase 1b Adverse Events (AEs), The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), 2 years|Phase 1b Dose-limiting toxicities, The DLT evaluation period is defined as the first 28 days of Cycle 1, 28 days|Phase 2 Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 2 years
Phase 1b Pharmacokinetic - AUC, Area under the curve of the GC012F (AZD0120) level, 2 years|Phase 1b Pharmacokinetic - Cmax, Maximum GC012F (AZD0120) level, 2 years|Phase 1b Pharmacokinetic - half-life, The elimination half-life of GC012F (AZD0120) level, 2 years|Phase 1b Pharmacokinetic - Tmax, Time to reach Maximum GC012F (AZD0120) level, 2 years|Phase 2: Adverse Events (AEs), Further characterization of the safety of GC012F (AZD0120) by measuring the incidence and severity of AEs, 2 years|Phase 1b and 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR (sCR/CR/VGPR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve sCR/CR/VGPR rate according to the IMWG criteria., 2 years|Phase 1b and 2: MRD negative rate, MRD negative rate as defined by the IMWG response criteria, 2 years|Phase 1b and 2: Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) will be calculated among responders from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Phase 1b and 2: PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of the initial infusion of GC012F to the date of first documented disease progression, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Phase 1b and 2: OS, Overall survival (OS) is measured from the date of the initial infusion of GC012F to the date of the subject's death., 2 years
For Phase Ib It aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, pharmacodynamic effect, immunogenicity in subjects with relapsed/ refractory Multiple Myeloma, and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of GC012F (AZD0120).

For Phase 2, it aims to evaluate the efficacy, to further characterize the safety of GC012F (AZD0120), pharmacodynamic effect, and immunogenicity, changes from baseline for subject-reported health-related quality of life, overall health status in subjects with relapsed/ refractory Multiple Myeloma.
