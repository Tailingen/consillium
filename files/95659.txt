Dosimetry Study of Betalutin for Treatment of Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (LYMRIT-37-02)
This study is a phase I, open label, randomized study to assess pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of lutetium (177Lu) lilotomab satetraxetan (Betalutin®) radioimmunotherapy in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The study will also investigate the safety, toxicity and efficacy of Betalutin and pre-dosing.
