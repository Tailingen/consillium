Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are often prescribed for malnourished patients to help improve nutritional status. Commonly in cancer patients taste and smell alterations and side effects of treatment can affect the palatability and compliance to ONS. A variety of flavours and styles are available of ONS however research of the palatability of these in cancer patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate specific flavours created based on the taste changes occuring during treatment.

* Cooling/fresh sensation: to have a fresh mouthfeel and lighter base perception
* Neutral: to avoid that patients experience additional flavour and let them the opportunity to mix it with other food
