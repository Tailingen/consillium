A Phase I/II Study of Nivolumab, Ipilimumab and Plinabulin in Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open-label Phase I/II study, with a dose escalation part (Phase I) and a single-arm part (Phase II), in patients with recurrent SCLC who progressed after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and who are candidates for second line therapy. No PK evaluation is planned in this study as nivolumab and ipilimumab are unlikely to alter plinabulin's PK, since the route of excretion is different.

Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Establish MTD of plinabulin in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab for patients with recurrent SCLC. MTD reflects the highest dose of plinabulin that did not cause a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in \> 33% of participants. DLTs were defined in accordance to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4., Up to 42 days of first Plinabulin dose|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease(PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Up to maximum of 9 months
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Assess adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4, Up to a maximum of 43 months|Number of Participants With Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs), Assess Immune-related adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.

irAE's are defined as any treatment-related AE that is inflammatory in nature, consistent with the mechanism of action of immunotherapy and generally medically manageable with topical and/or systemic immunosuppressants., Up to a maximum of 43 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST1.1): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. Objective Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to maximum of 9 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) = CR+PR+SD per RECIST v1.1., Up to maximum of 9 months|Progression Free Survival at 6 Months, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. PFS is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause. PFS at 6 months is defined as the percentage of patient who was progression free at 6 months from the initiation of treatment., 6 Months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death or date of last contact., Up to a maximum of 45 months
This is an open-label Phase I/II study, with a dose escalation part (Phase I) and a single arm part (Phase II), in patients with recurrent SCLC.

In the Phase I part, patients will receive plinabulin at escalating doses in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Doses of study drug will be administered as intravenous (IV) infusions in 21 day cycles. Patients will receive all study drugs on Day 1 of each cycle. After 4 treatment cycles, ipilimumab is stopped and patients continue treatment with nivolumab and plinabulin every 2 weeks (maintenance period) or until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment discontinuation occurs.

At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort, starting at 20 mg/m2 of plinabulin. The dose of plinabulin will be escalated in sequential patient cohorts after the safety data from the first cycle is reviewed. Thereafter the dose of plinabulin will be escalated to 30 mg/m2, provided that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed per the specified criteria, until the RP2D is determined.

In the Phase II part, up to 26 patients will be treated with the triple combination of plinabulin (at RP2D) + nivolumab + ipilimumab. Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment discontinuation occurs.
