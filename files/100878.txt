Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Intra-peritoneal Infusion of Catumaxomab and Treatment of Investigator Choice in Patients With Advanced Gastric Carcinoma With Peritoneal Metastasis
A total of 297 subjects are estimated to enroll in the study, with 15 eligible subjects enrolled in the 1st stage at most and 282 evaluable subjects in the 2nd stage. All subjects are adult patients with age over 18-year-old; they must be diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis at the time of enrollment; and failed at least prior two standard systemic anti-cancer therapies for recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer, before enrollment.

In the first stage, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary safety of catumaxomab will be explored in Asian patients with gastric cancer ; in Cohort A, the enrolled subjects will receive the first infusion at 10μg on day 1, which will be increased to 20 μg, 50 μg and 150 μg on days 4, 8 and 11, respectively. 42 days are defined as a cycle. From the second cycle, catumaxomab will be changed to 20 μg, 50 μg, 150 μg on days 1, 4, 8 respectively. In Cohort B, 28 days are defined as a cycle. It is estimated to enroll 6 subjects in each cohort first.

In the second stage, approximate 282 subjects who meet the enrollment criteria are randomized into either catumaxomab infusion group (catumaxomab group) or treatment of investigator choice group (IC group), at a ratio of 2:1.

Subjects at the first and second stages will continue the treatment until one of the following conditions occurs:1)Significant progression of tumor lesions, including but not limited to peritoneal metastases lesions and/or ascites; 2)Intolerable toxicity; 3)The investigator believes that patients need to withdraw from the study and receive other treatment;4)death;5)Withdrawal of informed consent.
