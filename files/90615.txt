Spleen Irradiation With Nanoliposomal Irinotecan Plus 5-FU and Leucovorin in Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Splenomegaly is common in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The spleen is an important source of immune suppressive cells and phagocytic cells and may mediate the accumulation of liposomal drugs and immunosuppression. In this study, spleen irradiation (SI) will be added to standard chemotherapy.

DRUG: nanoliposomal irinotecan|RADIATION: spleen irradiation
12W-PFS, 12-week PFS rate (%), 12 week
Splenomegaly is common in PDAC. Therefore, we design a phase II study to enroll metastatic PDAC patients who have failed prior gemcitabine-based therapy and have splenomegaly. With add-on SI to standard nal-IRI/FL therapy, we hypothesize that 1) splenic phagocytes and spleen volume will be reduced with attenuated entrapment of nal-IRI within spleen, 2) splenic source of immunosuppressive immune cells will be reduced with potential reconstitution of antitumor TME.
