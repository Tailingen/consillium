The purpose of this phase III study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of liso-cel for the treatment of r/r FL by comparing it to standard of care therapy in patients with r/r FL, with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint.

The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of the Liso-cel treatment strategy over standard of care (SOC) therapy with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) determined by independent review committee (IRC) based on the Lugano response criteria.

Participants randomized to Arm A (Standard of Care) will receive RCHOP, BR, or R2 based on investigator choice and this has to be determined prior to randomization.

Participants randomized to Arm B (Liso-cel treatment) will receive a single infusion CAR-positive viable T-cells.
