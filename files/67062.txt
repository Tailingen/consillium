Non-Operative Management and Early Response Assessment in Rectal Cancer
The investigators' data from a phase I study of short course radiation therapy followed by chemotherapy showed 74% complete clinical response (cCR). Given the promising response rate, the investigators are evaluating short course radiation therapy (SCRT) followed by chemotherapy in a multi-institution phase II trial to validate the cCR rate of this treatment paradigm. SCRT has not been prospectively evaluated in non-operative management for patients with non-metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.
Adenocarcinoma of the Lower Rectum
RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen|OTHER: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal cancer (FACT-C) questionnaire|PROCEDURE: Rectal biopsy samples|PROCEDURE: Blood for ctDNA
Clinical complete response rate, -Criteria for clinical complete response:

* No residual gross tumor at procto/sigmoidoscopy;, or only erythematous scar or ulcer
* No palpable tumor on DRE
* No radiographic evidence of tumor on MRI
* No suspicious mesorectal lymph nodes on MRI
* Negative biopsy from scar, ulcer, or former tumor site (if necessary according to surgeon's judgment), Completion of treatment (estimated to be 22 weeks)
Progression-free survival (PFS), * Criteria for progressive disease:

  * Increase in the size of primary tumor by RECIST criteria (increase of at least 20% from nadir in the sum of the target lesion, with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm)
  * New metastatic disease
* PFS is defined as the time from date of treatment to death or progression, which occurs first. The alive patients without progression are censored as the last date follow-up., 2 years|Incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity during treatment, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., Completion of treatment (estimated to be 22 weeks)|Incidence of post chemoradiotherapy grade 3 or higher toxicity, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., 1 year|Quality of anorectal function as measured by the FACT-C questionnaire, * Questionnaire with 5 sections (physical well-being, social/family well being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns)
* Answers to the questions range from 0=not at all to 4=very much. The higher the total score the lower quality of life, 1 year (between 10-14 months post treatment start date)|Organ preservation rate, 1 year|Organ preservation rate, 2 years
