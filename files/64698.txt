A Phase II Study of E7389 in Patients With Breast Cancer, Previously Treated With Anthracycline, Taxane and Capecitabine
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of E7389 in Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with anthracycline, taxane, and capecitabine as prior therapy, and who are refractory to the last prior therapy for their disease.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: E7389
Objective Response Rate, Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), consisting of complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR). Defined as the best response from the start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence. Lesions measured by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Objective response rate: complete response (CR-disappearance of all lesions)+ partial response (PR-30% decrease in lesion diameter), Progressive Disease (PD-20% increase in lesion diameter), stable disease (SD-neither shrinkage nor increase of lesions)., Every two cycles
Duration of Response, Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all lesions. Partial response (PR) is defined as 30% decrease in lesion diameter., From first documented complete or partial response until disease progression or death
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of E7389 in Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with anthracycline, taxane, and capecitabine as prior therapy, and who are refractory to the last prior therapy for their disease.
