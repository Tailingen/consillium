Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane(TAP) Block in Intensive Care Unit
The Transversus Abdominis Block (TAP) block is known to be an effective means of reducing patient pain after abdominal surgery. In the meantime, the general TAP block has been studied in patients who were in the recovery room and the ward after surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of pain reduction and opioid saving effects in patients with TAP block in ICU settings.

This study is a prospective study in a single institute of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and is assigned to the test group and the control group by random assignment. In both groups, PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) was used as a post-operative pain control modality. In the Intervention group, a 0.25% Bupivacaine was used for transverse nerve block , and normal saline was used for placebo(control) group

The TAP block will be performed within 1 hour after entering the intensive care unit (ICU) in double blinded state
