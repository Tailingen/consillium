Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. And combination of pd-1 blocking antibody plus regorafenib showed increased ORR in advanced colorectal cancer. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with Sintilimab plus regorafenib in previously treated colorectal cancer liver metastasis.
