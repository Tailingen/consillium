Long-term Study to Evaluate and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Favorable Intermediate Risk Localized Prostate Cancer
This is a long-term prospective registry study to determine whether Prolaris testing in patients with favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer influences physician management decisions toward conservative treatment in patients with Prolaris low-risk scores without negatively impacting patient oncologic outcomes, thereby sparing low-risk patients from unnecessary treatments and associated side-effects.

This is a long-term prospective registry to evaluate the impact of Prolaris testing on therapeutic decisions in patients with newly diagnosed favorable intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer and to summarize clinical oncologic outcomes. The design of the study is non-interventional, and therefore the protocol will not require a specific treatment plan for study participants. However, in the absence of a universally accepted timeframe for repeat biopsies within existing active surveillance recommendations, study sites will be encouraged to monitor patients for disease progression as per the standard of care (e.g., current National Comprehensive Cancer Network \[NCCN\] guidelines) with the expectation of a repeat biopsy within 18 months of the initial biopsy.

Patients who undergo Prolaris testing will be included in the registry as well as patients who do not undergo Prolaris testing. Data collection for the first primary objective extends over a 3-year period. During this time, data is collected on the treatment initiated, any follow-up prostate biopsy performed in patients initially treated with active surveillance, definitive treatments performed (with pathology data if surgical therapy is performed), and the reasons definitive treatment was pursued, as well as data related to disease progression such as biochemical recurrence, development of prostate cancer metastases, or disease specific death.

Data collection for the second primary objective extends out to 8 years. During this time data is collected on any follow-up prostate biopsy in patients still treated with active surveillance, definitive treatments performed (with pathology data if surgical therapy is performed), and the reasons definitive treatment was pursued, as well as data related to disease progression such as biochemical recurrence, development of prostate cancer metastases, or disease specific death.
