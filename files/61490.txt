Study of ASTX727 Plus Talazoparib in Patients With Triple Negative or Hormone Resistant/HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a Phase I study to test the safety of a combination of ASTX727 with talazoparib in patients with triple negative breast cancer or hormone resistant/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Hormone Receptor Positive Tumor
DRUG: Talazoparib|DRUG: ASTX727
Safety of ASTX727 plus talazoparib using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0, through study completion i.e up to 1 year|Rate of dose limiting toxicity, rate of dose limiting toxicity will be assessed during cycle 1 (28 days) in patients enrolled during the dose escalation phase, 28 days
Overall response rate, through study completion (i.e. up to 1 year)|Clinical benefit response for triple negative disease subjects, clinical benefit response defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease, 18 weeks|Clinical benefit response for hormone receptor positive/ HER2 negative subjects, clinical benefit response defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease, 24 weeks|Progression free survival in all enrolled subjects, through study completion (i.e. up to 1 year)
The phase I portion will use a traditional 3 + 3 design and standard definitions of DLT based on toxicity experienced during the first cycle of therapy. Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone resistant/HER2 negative (HRBC) metastatic disease will be enrolled and analyzed together during the dose escalation cohorts. Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined, we will enroll a small expansion cohort to further characterize safety and provide preliminary efficacy estimates.The expansion cohort will be limited to 14 patients; 7 with TNBC and 7 with HRBC. The dose level selected for expansion will be based on the totality of the data available including toxicity during the DLT evaluation period, toxicity during subsequent cycles, and correlative results.
