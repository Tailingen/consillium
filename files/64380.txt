Phase I/Ib Study of Paclitaxel in Combination With VS-6063 in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
This is a Phase I/Ib, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of paclitaxel in combination with defactinib (VS-6063), a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Phase I (Dose Escalation) and Phase Ib (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to assess assess the safety (including the recommended phase 2 dose), the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer activity of defactinib (VS-6063) when administered in combination with paclitaxel. Pharmacodynamic effects will also be examined in tumor biopsies.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: defactinib|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Number of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03 (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects)during the study (safety and tolerability)., Adverse events and their frequency, duration and severity, as determined based on CTCAE 4.03, From start of treatment to end of treatment, an expected average of 12 weeks|Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on a combination of maximum tolerated dosed (MTD), review of adverse event data and review of AUC, Tmax and t1/2 obtained from PK data during the dose escalation phase of the study., The RP2D will be determined based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of defactinib (VS-6063) in combination with paclitaxel as determined by number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) related to defactinib in combination with paclitaxel, From start of treatment to end of cycle 1 (4 week cycles)
Proportion of patients treated with paclitaxel and defactinib (VS-6063) with progression-free survival using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, Response rate and progression-free survival, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, Every 2 cycles up to end of treatment, an expected average of 12 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of defactinib (VS-6063) when co-administered with paclitaxel, AUC (Area Under Curve) 0-t., Plasma concentration of defactinib (VS-6063), Time points at Day 1 and Day 15 in Cycle 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of defactinib (VS-6063) when co-administered with paclitaxel, maximum concentrations (Cmax), Plasma concentration of defactinib (VS-6063), Time points at Day 1 and Day 15 in Cycle 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of defactinib (VS-6063) when co-administered with paclitaxel, Time to maximum concentrations (Tmax), Plasma concentration of defactinib (VS-6063), Time points at Day 1 and Day 15 in Cycle 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of defactinib (VS-6063) when co-administered with paclitaxel, , estimates of concentration 1/2 life (T1/2), Plasma concentration of defactinib (VS-6063), Time points at Day 1 and Day 15 in Cycle 1
Evaluate biomarkers of defactinib (VS-6063) activity, Pre and post dose biomarkers (including but not limited to FAK and phospho-FAK, as well as specific markers for cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis and cancer stem cells) in archival tumor tissue and new biopsy samples, Day 1 and Day 10 of treatment|Examine if the tumor expression status correlates with response to defactinib (VS-6063) therapy, Tumor expression status (pFAK and other biomarkers) compared with response to defactinib, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, From start of treatment to end of treatment, an expected average of 12 weeks
