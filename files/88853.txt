Clinical Trial to Assess The Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Tisagenlecleucel And Ibrutinib in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This is an open label, multi-center, single-arm, phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ibrutinib and Tisagenlecleucel in twenty patients with relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) or who had sub-optimal response to standard therapy in the presence of TP53 mutation.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma Recurrent
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: ibrutinib and Tisagenlecleucel
Estimate complete response (CR) rate at month 4 following the infusion of Tisagenlecleucel using the Lugano criteria, Using the Lugano criteria, 4 months after Tisagenlecleucel infusion using the Lugano criteria
Evaluate safety of combination therapy with Tisagenlecleucel and ibrutinib through monitoring of the incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0), SAEs, dose interruptions and dose reductions of ibrutinib, Through monitoring of the incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0), Serious Adverse Events, dose interruptions and dose reductions of ibrutinib, From date of registration until the date of first progression or until the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to the date of the patient's last annual assessment, on average for five years|Estimate objective response (OR) rate at day 28, month 4, 6, 9 and 12 following the infusion of Tisagenlecleucel using Lugano criteria, Using Lugano criteria, day 28, month 4, 6, 9 and 12 following the infusion of Tisagenlecleucel|To estimate objective response (OR) rate at day 28, month 4, 6, 9 and 12 following the infusion of Tisagenlecleucel by TP53 status, Assessment of TP53 status, day 28, month 4, 6, 9 and 12 following the infusion of Tisagenlecleucel by TP53 status|To estimate Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative response rates by aggregate measure of peripheral blood/or bone marrow flow cytometry, PCR and ctDNA, Measured through aggregate measure of peripheral blood/or bone marrow flow cytometry, PCR and ctDNA, At day 28, months 4, 6, 9 and 12 following the infusion of Tisagenlecleucel|To estimate progression-free survival, According to Lugano criteria, From date of registration until the date of first progression or until the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to the date of the patient's last annual assessment, on average for five years|To estimate duration of response, Using Lugano criteria, From date of registration until the date of first progression or until the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to the date of the patient's last annual assessment, on average for five years|To estimate overall survival, By monitoring for patient death due to any cause, From date of registration until the date of first progression or until the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to the date of the patient's last annual assessment, on average for five years
