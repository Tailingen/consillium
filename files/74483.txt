Pharmacokinetic Study of Thalidomide in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
Objective of this study is to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of thalidomide when given orally as monotherapy to subjects with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Thalidomide Celgeneâ„¢
Pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma thalidomide: Tmax Cmax AUC t1/2 CL/F V/F, PK blood sampling for a single day (on Day 5), predose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose
This is an open-label, PK study in multiple myeloma subjects who are currently receiving thalidomide-containing therapy or are newly diagnosed. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, a PK phase with a 5-day period of thalidomide treatment (200 mg/day), and an end-of-study evaluation on Day 6. Subjects will have frequent blood samples drawn for PK assessments on Days 5 and 6 in an inpatient setting.
