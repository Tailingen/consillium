Angiosarcomas are very rare tumors (incidence \< 1/100.000/year) of vascular or lymphatic origin characterized by a clinical heterogeneity in terms of presentation and behavior.In several prospective and retrospective studies, weekly paclitaxel showed promising activity in patients with advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma. Given the important role of PD-L1 in the suppression of T-cell responses, and the mode of action of avelumab which blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors, avelumab is being developed as a potential therapy for subjects with various tumors. In prior study cutaneous angiosarcoma patients with a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells with tumor site PD-L1 expression were more likely to have favorable survival.

Therefore, antitumor activity of Avelumab as inhibitor of PD-1/PDL-1 interaction with Paclitaxel, standard chemotherapy, might have more therapeutic improvement.
