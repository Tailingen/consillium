A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization of TG-0054 Alone or in Combination With G-CSF in Patients With Multiple Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Hodgkin Disease
This Phase II study is to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization of TG-0054 alone or in combination with G-CSF in Patients with Multiple Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Hodgkin Disease.
Multiple Myeloma|Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma|Hodgkin's Disease
DRUG: TG-0054
Number of Patients Achieving the CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) Mobilization Target of ≧2.5×1000000 Cells/kg, Patients were all with multiple myeloma (MM), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin disease (HD).

Number of patients who mobilized the targeted total number of CD34+ cells within a maximum of 4 leukapheresis sessions in study arm 1 and arm 3. Patients in arm 1 followed administration of TG-0054 (3.14 mg/kg) alone and leukapheresis start from study day 1. Patients in arm 3 followed administration of TG-0054 (3.14 mg/kg) combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and leukapheresis start from study day 8., 1 week
the Average Number of Leukapheresis Sessions, To determine the average number of leukapheresis sessions required to collect 2.5 x10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg., 1 week|Circulating CD34+ Cell Count in Peripheral Blood, Calculate the median total CD34+ cell counts across all leukapheresis sessions following TG 0054 administration alone and in combination with G-CSF mobilization in order to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of TG-0054 by determining circulating CD34+ cell counts in peripheral blood., pre-dose(-2 to 0 h),2, 4 and 6 hr after dosing.
