Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary Syndrome
RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill lymphoma cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who have mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate in patients with mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously for 4 consecutive days a week for 6 consecutive weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response or stable disease continue treatment for 2 courses past best response. Patients who demonstrate a persistent partial response continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
