Exploratory Study Evaluating Fluorodeoxyglucose - Position Emission Tomography as a Predictive Marker for Therapy With RAD001 in Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn if PET scanning can predict the degree of tumor shrinkage with the study drug RAD001 in subjects who have advanced renal cancer.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: RAD001
Relative Tumor Size Change Following 8 Weeks of Therapy., The primary objective is to determine whether high SUV uptake on FDG-PET is associated with greater tumor shrinkage. Tumor size is defined as the sum of unidimensional tumor measurements from standard CT imaging calculated according to RECIST criteria. Tumor size is measured at baseline and after eight weeks of therapy. Tumor shrinkage is the relative change (%) in tumor size from baseline., 8 weeks
Percent Change in FDG-PETUptake Following 2 Weeks of Therapy, The secondary objective was to explore whether an early change in FDG-PET uptake is associated with tumor shrinkage. Change in FDG-PET uptake was calculated using the baseline and 2-week FDG-PET scans., 2 weeks
The purpose of this study is to learn if PET scanning can predict the degree of tumor shrinkage with the study drug RAD001 in subjects who have advanced renal cancer.
