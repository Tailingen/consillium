Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Investigator's Choice Standard Therapy for Participants With Advanced Esophageal/ Esophagogastric Junction Carcinoma That Progressed After First-Line Therapy (MK-3475-181/KEYNOTE-181)
In this study, participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or Siewert type I adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) that had progressed after first-line standard therapy were randomized to receive either pembrolizumab (MK-3475) OR the Investigator's choice of standard chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan.

The primary study hypothesis was that treatment with pembrolizumab would prolong overall survival (OS) as compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy.

Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Esophagus, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Median OS in participants with SCC of the esophagus is presented., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 15-Oct-2018 (up to approximately 34 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Combined Positive Score ≥10 (PD-L1 CPS ≥10), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Median OS in participants with a PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is presented., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 15-Oct-2018 (up to approximately 34 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in All Participants, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Median OS in all participants is presented., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 15-Oct-2018 (up to approximately 34 months)
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in All Participants, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. Median PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 in all participants is presented., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 15-Oct-2018 (up to approximately 34 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in All Participants, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed using RECIST 1.1. The percentage of all participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented., Through Final Analysis data cutoff date of 15-Oct-2018 (up to approximately 34 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in Participants With Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Esophagus, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE.
