Quality of Life in Patients After Pharyngolaryngectomy
Laryngeal cancer is an indication for a laryngectomy (separation of the airways and digestive tract). Laryngectomy causes a permanent disruption of self-perception. Communication, social interactions, diet andaesthetic appearance are altered. Its modifications disrupt the quality of life of patients and must be taken into account as soon as possible in patient cares.

Questions are summarized in five multiitem domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning) and nine single item domains (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, financial impact; diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life).

Each domain is scored between 0 and 100. For functional domains, a high score value represents a high level of quality of life. For symptom domains, a high score represents an important level of symptoms (a low level of quality of life)., Day 0
