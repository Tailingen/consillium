Change From Baseline in Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment in Appetite Score at Week 4 in Part A, The Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment-Appetite was a self-reported questionnaire that measured the severity of anorexia. The measure consisted of 1 question that asked study participants to rate their appetite over the past 7 days from 0-"no appetite" to 10-"very good appetite", where higher score indicated better appetite.

In this Outcome Measure (OM), changes from baseline in the Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment-Appetite score at Week 4 were summarized descriptively by treatment group., Baseline, Week 4
Change From Baseline in Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment in Appetite Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 in Part A, The Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment-Appetite was a self-reported questionnaire that measured the severity of anorexia. The measure consisted of 1 question that asked study participants to rate their appetite over the past 7 days from 0-"no appetite" to 10-"very good appetite", where higher score indicated better appetite.

In this OM, changes from baseline in the Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment-Appetite score were summarized descriptively by treatment group and timepoint., Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6|Change From Baseline in Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment in Fatigue Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Part A, The Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment-Fatigue was a self-reported questionnaire that measured the severity of fatigue. The measure consisted of 1 question that asked study participants to rate their fatigue over the past 7 days from 0-"no fatigue" to 10-"worst possible fatigue", where higher score indicated worse fatigue.

In this OM, changes from baseline in the Cancer-Related Cachexia Symptom Assessment-Fatigue score were summarized descriptively by treatment group and timepoint., Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6|Number of Participants With All-Causality Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in Part A, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to discharge from study that are absent before treatment or that worsen relative to pretreatment state. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or results in congenital anomaly/birth defect., Day 1 through Week 6 (for a period of 6 weeks)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities in Part A, Laboratory parameters included: hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocytes, erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume, erythrocytes mean corpuscular hemoglobin, erythrocytes mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelets, leukocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes), chemistry (bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urate, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, bicarbonate and glucose) and urine (pH, urine glucose, ketones, urine protein, urine hemoglobin, urobilinogen, urine bilirubin, nitrite, leukocyte esterase, urine erythrocytes \[/high power field (HPF)\], urine leukocytes \[/HPF\] and hyaline casts \[/low power field (LPF)\])., Days 1, 22 and 43
A 6 week double blind study to compare the effects of the investigational new drug (PF-06946860) and a placebo on appetite and to find out how participants with advanced cancer and anorexia feel after receiving repeated doses injected under the skin (subcutaneously).

During the initial 6-week treatment period (Part A), a total of 2 doses of study drug or placebo will be administered 3 weeks apart. Each dose contains two injections. Part B is an optional 18-week open-label treatment period where up to 7 doses of study drug may be administered. Part B does not include placebo.

Assessments include:

* Measure the impact of the study drug on appetite, fatigue, and pain questionnaires
* Body weight measurements
* Blood samples to evaluate safety and additional endpoints including the amount of the study drug in the blood and the effects of the study drug on levels of a specific cytokine.
