Comparing the Diagnostic Efficiencies of CEUS and EOB-MRI in Patients With High Risk of HCC
HCC is a serious threat to the health of people. Accurate diagnosis of early HCC by imaging allows patients to obtain proper treatment. However, for lesions with diameters ≤2 cm, the tumor blood supply is not fully established, and there may be no typical manifestation on the image. In addition, atypical enhanced patterns caused by liver cirrhosis may also hinder imaging diagnosis of HCC. Therefore, early diagnosis of HCC in the context of cirrhosis remains a major clinical problem.

Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and MRI Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CEMRI) are common diagnostic imaging methods. Till now, there is still lack of a detailed investigation comparing the diagnostic efficacies of CEUS and EOB-MRI for micro HCC in the context of cirrhosis. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the imaging patterns in CEUS and EOB-MRI for liver lesions with diameters ≤ 2 cm among patients with high risk of HCC, and to compare the diagnostic efficacies of EOB-MRI and CEUS for early-stage HCCs.
