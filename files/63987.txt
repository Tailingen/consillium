A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Monotherapy With BCD-264 and Darzalex in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The aim of this study is to confirm the comparability of the efficacy and safety profiles of BCD-264 and Darzalex as monotherapy for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in subjects previously treated with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, and who had disease progression on prior therapy.
