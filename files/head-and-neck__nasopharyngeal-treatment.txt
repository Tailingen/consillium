About This PDQ Summary
Incidence
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma arises in the lining of the nasal cavity and pharynx, and it accounts for about one-third of all cancers of the upper airways in children.[
1
,
2
]
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is exceedingly rare in children younger than 10 years.[
3
] The age-adjusted incidence rates (2016–2020) for both sexes and all races of children younger than 20 years in the United States are shown in

The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is characterized by racial and geographic variations, with an endemic distribution among well-defined ethnic groups. These groups include inhabitants of some areas in North Africa, the Mediterranean basin, and, particularly, Southeast Asia. In the United States, the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is markedly higher in Black children than in other racial or ethnic groups (see
Table 2
).[

Risk Factors
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is strongly associated with EBV infection. In addition to the serological evidence of infection in more than 98% of patients, EBV DNA is present as a monoclonal episome in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and tumor cells can have EBV antigens on their cell surface.[
1
] The circulating levels of EBV DNA and serological documentation of EBV infection may help with the diagnosis.[
1
]
HLA subtypes.
Specific HLA subtypes, such as the HLA A2 Bsin2 haplotype, are associated with a higher risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.[

[PUBMED Abstract]
Clinical Presentation
Given the rich lymphatic drainage of the nasopharynx, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is often the first sign of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Other signs and symptoms include the following:[
1
,
2
]
Nosebleeds.
Nasal congestion and obstruction.
Headache.
Otalgia.
Otitis media.
The tumor spreads locally to adjacent areas of the oropharynx and may invade the skull base, resulting in cranial nerve palsy or difficulty with movements of the jaw (trismus). Distant metastatic sites may include the bones, lungs,
and liver.

Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation
Diagnostic tests determine the extent of the primary tumor and the presence of metastases.  Visualization of the nasopharynx, by an otolaryngologist using nasal endoscopy and magnetic resonance
imaging of the head and neck, can determine the extent of the
primary tumor.
A diagnosis can be made from a biopsy of the
primary tumor or enlarged lymph nodes of the neck.  Nasopharyngeal carcinomas must be distinguished from all other cancers that can present with
enlarged lymph nodes and from other types of cancer in the head and neck area. 
Thus, diseases such as thyroid cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (including Burkitt lymphoma), and Hodgkin lymphoma must be considered, as
well as benign conditions such as nasal angiofibroma, which usually presents with
epistaxis in adolescent males, infectious lymphadenitis, and Rosai-Dorfman disease.
Evaluation of the chest and abdomen by computed tomography (CT) and bone scan is performed to determine whether there is metastatic
disease. Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)–CT may also be helpful in the evaluation of potential metastatic lesions.[

[PUBMED Abstract]
Histology
The World
Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the following three histological subtypes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma:
Type I: Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.
Type II: Nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Type II is further defined by the presence or absence of lymphoid infiltration as type IIa or IIb, respectively.
Type III: Undifferentiated carcinoma. Type III is further defined by the presence or absence of lymphoid infiltration as type IIIa or IIIb, respectively.
Children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are more likely to have WHO type II or type III disease.[

Genomics of Childhood Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Four tertiary academic medical centers in China studied 30 patients (25 male and 5 female) with pathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were younger than 20 years.[
1
] Nasopharyngeal primary tumors with paired blood samples were collected and sequenced using whole-exome sequencing. Several genes such as
SHOC1
(formerly known as
C9orf84
) (20%),
ZFHX4
(16.7%),
ZC3H6
(16.7%), and
RBM38
(16.7%) were frequently altered in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Copy number analysis revealed highly recurring gain/amplification of the HLA class II genes at 6p21.32 (63.3%) and losses of
TOLLIP
at 11p15.5 (20%).
In another analysis, homozygous deletion of the
CDKN2A
locus on 9p21.3 was confirmed in 7 of 15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma specimens (46.7%) and in 3 of 5 cell lines/patient-derived xenografts  (60%).
CCND1
amplification was found in 3 of 20 nasopharyngeal tumors (15%).[
2
] Whole-genome sequencing of nasopharyngeal carcinoma revealed that
TP53
was the most significantly altered gene (n = 10), followed by
TRAF3
,
NFKBIA
,
AEBP1
, and
NLRC5
. All of these genes have been reported to regulate nuclear factor kappa B.[
3
] In addition, significant somatic aberrations detected in HLA-A and
NLRC5
suggest the impairment of antigen presentation, while
PTEN
variants may activate the PI3K pathway. This study found four coding genes that were significantly altered, namely
PLIN4
,
MUC21
,
SLC35G5
, and
ERVW-1
.

Prognosis
The overall survival  of children and adolescents with nasopharyngeal carcinoma has improved over the last four decades through the use of state-of-the-art multimodal treatment.[
1
-
8
] The 5-year relative survival rate was 91% for children younger than 20 years who were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the United States between 2013 and 2019.[
9
] After controlling for stage, children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma have significantly better outcomes than adults.[
1
,
7
] However, the intensive use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy results in significant acute and long-term morbidities, including subsequent neoplasms.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Newly Diagnosed Childhood Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors within the PARTNER project (Paediatric Rare Tumours Network–European Registry) have published comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children and adolescents.[

Treatment options for newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma include the following:
Combined-modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy

Combined-Modality Therapy With Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy
High-dose radiation therapy alone has a role in managing nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However,  studies (in both children and adults)  show that combined-modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation is the most effective way to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma.[
2
]
Multiple studies have investigated the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The use of concomitant chemoradiation therapy has been consistently associated with a significant survival benefit, including improved locoregional disease control and reduction in distant metastases.[
2
] The addition of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy to concomitant chemoradiation has further improved outcomes. The Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Nasopharyngeal  Carcinoma (MAC-NPC) collaborative group presented an analysis of 26 trials that included 7,080 patients. The results showed that the addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy reduced the risk of death, and that the hazard ratio (HR) for risk of death was lowest for adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiation therapy, compared with concurrent chemoradiation therapy alone.[
3
]
In adult patients, recent studies investigated the use of neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin. A phase III study compared concurrent chemoradiation therapy with or without induction therapy using gemcitabine plus cisplatin for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The study found a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients who received induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, compared with those who did not receive induction chemotherapy (5-year OS rates, 87.9% vs. 78.8%; HR, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.78;
P
= .001).[
4
,
5
]
In children, most studies have used neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by concomitant chemoradiation with single-agent cisplatin.[

][
Level of evidence B4
]; [
9
] Using this approach, 5-year OS rate estimates are consistently above 80%.[
7
-
9
] The following two modifications of this approach have been investigated:
The German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) NPC-2003 study included a 6-month maintenance therapy phase with interferon-beta. The study reported a 30-month OS rate estimate of 97.1%.[
7
]
A randomized prospective trial compared cisplatin and 5-FU with and without docetaxel.[
8
][
Level of evidence A1
]  The addition of docetaxel was not associated with improved outcomes.
For adults with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gemcitabine plus cisplatin has been shown to be more effective than 5-FU plus cisplatin, both in front-line and recurrent settings.[
10
,
11
]
While nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a very chemosensitive neoplasm, high radiation doses to the nasopharynx and neck (approximately 65–70 Gy) are required for optimal locoregional control.[
12
-
14
] However, in children, studies using neoadjuvant chemotherapy have shown that it is possible to reduce the radiation dose to 55 Gy or 60 Gy for good-responding patients.[
6
,
7
,
15
] The GPOH reviewed 45 patients enrolled in the NPC-2003 study and an additional 21 patients who were subsequently treated  per the  NPC-2003 trial.[
16
]  The 66 patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma had  an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 93.6% and an OS rate of 96.7% after a median follow-up of 73 months. Seven patients who had complete responses after induction therapy received a reduced radiation dose of 54 Gy. None of these patients experienced a relapse. In young patients with advanced locoregional nasopharyngeal carcinoma, excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved using multimodal treatment, including interferon-beta. Radiation doses may be reduced in patients with complete remission after induction chemotherapy. Reduced radiation doses may limit late effects related to radiation exposure.
The Children's Oncology Group performed a prospective trial to evaluate the impact of induction chemotherapy  and concurrent chemoradiation therapy.[
9
]  Patients were scheduled to receive three cycles of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU, followed by chemoradiation therapy with three cycles of cisplatin. Patients with complete or partial responses to induction chemotherapy received 61.2 Gy of radiation to the nasopharynx and neck, and patients with stable disease received 71.2 Gy of radiation.  After a feasibility analysis, the study was amended to reduce cisplatin to two cycles during chemoradiation therapy. Results of the study include the following:
The 5-year EFS rate estimate was 84.3%, and the OS rate estimate was 89.2%.
The 5-year EFS rates were 100% for patients with stage IIb disease, 82.8% for patients with stage III disease, and 82.7% for patients with stage IV disease.
The 5-year cumulative incidence estimates of  local, distant, and combined relapses were 3.7%, 8.7%, and 1.8%, respectively.
Patients who were treated with three chemoradiation therapy cycles of cisplatin were observed to have higher 5-year postinduction EFS rates than patients who were treated with two cycles, although the difference was not statistically significant (90.7% vs. 81.2%;
P
= .14).
The combination of cisplatin-based chemotherapy and high doses of radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and neck are associated with a high probability of hearing loss, hypothyroidism and panhypopituitarism, trismus, xerostomia, dental problems, and chronic sinusitis or otitis.[

Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
In a group of 549 pediatric patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed between 2005 and 2021, recursive partitioning (i.e., successive grouping) was performed based on stage and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load. This resulted in three groups of patients: low-risk patients, intermediate-risk patients, and high-risk patients.[
21
]
Intermediate-risk patients (stage IVa nasopharyngeal carcinoma and <4,000 copies/mL of EBV) had significant responses with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Their progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastases‒free survival rates were significantly improved, compared with those who received only concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
In contrast, there were no significant differences between these two treatment regimens in low-risk and high-risk patients.
Surgery
Surgery has a limited role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The disease is usually considered unresectable because of extensive local spread.
Immunotherapy With Checkpoint Inhibitors
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody toripalimab-tpzi in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine for first-line treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent, locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The approval was based on the results of a phase III placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients received toripalimab-tpzi or placebo in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by monotherapy with toripalimab-tpzi or placebo. Patients randomly assigned to receive toripalimab-tpzi had superior PFS  and OS rates. The 1-year and 2-year PFS rates were 59.0% versus 32.9% and 44.8% versus 25.4% in the toripalimab-tpzi and placebo groups, respectively. Corresponding OS rates at 2 years were 78.0% versus 65.1%, respectively. At 3 years, the OS rates were 64.5% versus 49.2%, respectively.[

ARAR2221 (NCT06064097)
(A Study Using Nivolumab, in Combination with Chemotherapy Drugs to Treat Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma)
:
This study will evaluate the safety of combining induction chemotherapy with an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab) in children, adolescents, and young adults with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It will also estimate the 2-year EFS rate of patients treated with induction chemoimmunotherapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin, followed by consolidation chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy (cisplatin, nivolumab, and response-adjusted, dose de-escalated radiation therapy), and nivolumab maintenance therapy.
The treatment plan in the ARAR2221 trial was modeled after therapy that was effective in phase III trials for adults with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Relapsed or Refractory Childhood Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The outcome  is poor for patients with relapsed or refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and most patients present with distant metastases.
Treatment options for relapsed or refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma include the following:
Chemotherapy
.
Immunotherapy
.
Chemotherapy
Long-term remissions can be achieved with conventional chemotherapy. In a retrospective review of 14 pediatric patients with relapsed nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with varying chemotherapy regimens, the 3-year event-free survival rate was 34%, and the overall survival rate was 44%.[
1
]
Immunotherapy
Given the unique pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, immunotherapy has been explored for patients with refractory disease, as follows:
The use of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte therapy is a promising approach, with minimal toxicity and evidence of significant antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma.[
2
] In a phase I/II study of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte therapy in patients with refractory disease, response rates were observed in 33.3% of patients. Long-term remissions were obtained in 62% of patients treated in their second or subsequent remission.[
3
]
Anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)  monoclonal antibodies have been studied in adults with refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In a meta-analysis that included nine studies and 842 patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received PD-1 inhibitors, the objective response rate was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21%–26%), the 1-year progression-free survival rate was 25% (95% CI, 18%–32%), and the 1-year overall survival rate was 53% (95% CI, 37%–68%).[
