Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence in Patients With HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of each study vaccine and to evaluate the effect on the time to disease recurrence (assessed by disease free survival).

Participants will be assigned to receive one of two study vaccines (DC1 study vaccine vs. WOKVAC). The study vaccine will be administered in two phases: a study vaccination phase and a booster phase.
Breast Cancer Female|Breast Cancer, Male|Breast Cancer Stage I|Breast Cancer Stage II|Breast Cancer Stage III|Residual Disease|HER2-positive Breast Cancer|HER2 Positive Breast Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: DC1 Vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: WOKVAC Vaccine
Immunogenicity, The primary immunogenicity outcome for both arms of this trial will be the summation of spots (ELISPOT) for 6 distinct peptides and reported as total SFC/10\^6 cells. A value \>150 defines an immune response., Up to 3 years
Disease-free Survival (DFS), Clinical activity is characterized by disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from start of treatment to documented recurrence (any breast event), death due to any cause or last patient contact that documents recurrence-free status (i.e., a clinic or scan date)., Up to 3 years
The total duration of the study will be 6 years (4 years of patient enrollment and 2 additional years of clinical follow-up). Assessment for disease recurrence and survival will be conducted every 6 months (with a phone call/secure email, medical records or follow up visit) from the end of treatment for a total of 2 years, until the completion of the trial or until documented disease recurrence.
