CLIMB: CNS Lymphoma Imaging and Molecular Biomarkers Study
A prospective imaging and translational tissue study in CNS lymphoma to enable further disease characterisation and the development of potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers.
CNS Lymphoma
Plasma ctDNA detection, To assess if plasma ctDNA detection measured from end of treatment (using the tumour informed approach) can be used an early detection tool for progressive disease., 5 Years|Contrast clearance analysis, To assess the results of contrast clearance analysis, 5 Years
Plasma ctDNA detection from end of treatment, To assess if plasma ctDNA detection measured from end of treatment (using the tumour agnostic approach) can be used as an early detection tool for progressive disease, 5 Years|Plasma ctDNA detection rate at baseline, To assess plasma ctDNA detection rate at baseline using the (i) tumour agnostic and (ii) tumour informed approach, 5 Years|Plasma ctDNA detection at end of treatment, To assess whether plasma ctDNA detection at end of treatment can be used an early detection tool for progressive disease and survival using the (i) tumour agnostic and (ii) tumour informed approach, 5 Years|Plasma ctDNA detection rate at disease progression, To assess plasma ctDNA detection rate at disease progression using the (i) tumour agnostic and (ii) tumour informed approach, 5 Years|Radiological data provided by CCA, To evaluate whether additional radiological data provided by CCA is useful for prognostication and is associated with disease progression and survival, 5 Years
As a single centre exploratory study, this trial will recruit patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma and will look at the molecular aspects of the disease in the tissue collection and imaging response assessments using CCA with respect to progression free survival.
