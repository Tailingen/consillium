Collection of Tumor Tissue, Blood and Spinal Fluid From Patients With Brain or Spine Tumors
The purpose of the study is to collect samples of brain or spine tumors. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center would then store them for use by researchers who study brain or spine cancer and try to find better ways of treating it. We will also collect blood and spinal fluid from patients with brain or spine tumors. The blood and spinal fluids are also used for research studies of cancer and its treatment.
Primary or Metastatic Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumor
To establish a repository of CNS tumors or metastases to the CNS and related tissues for current or future studies., conclusion of the study
The main objective of the protocol is the establishment of a repository of central nervous system (CNS) tumors or metastases to the CNS and related tissues as an invaluable resource for current or future research studies of the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of human central nervous system tumors. The database will be established through the intra-operative acquisition of brain or spine tumors as well as the collection of blood and spinal fluids from consenting CNS tumor patients.
