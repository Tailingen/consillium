Unnecessary Mastectomy Due to False Size Prediction by Preoperative Imaging Studies in Breast Cancer
* The surgical method for breast cancer is determined according to the size and location of the remaining lesions after prior chemotherapy.
* There are many patients who were able to undergo partial resection when confirming the final results of patients who underwent total resection after prior chemotherapy.
* Therefore, we would like to investigate whether it is effective to make decisions based on the results of pre-operative tests after prior chemotherapy.

Final pathology report, Comparison of the difference in size of lesions confirmed by preoperative imaging and final pathology results, 2 weeks after surgery
In a study published by Jennifer F. et al., sensitivity to lesions remaining after prior chemotherapy of breast magnetic resonance imaging was measured as 83%, specificity 47%, PPV 47%, NPV 83%, and accuracy 74%. have.

Most of the preoperative examinations after prior chemotherapy have the most confidence in the results of breast magnetic resonance imaging, but there will be other factors to predict this result as there will be differences in the actual postoperative pathology results. .

After prior chemotherapy, total resection was performed, and cases where partial resection is possible in the postoperative pathologic results are prospectively identified and compared and analyzed.
