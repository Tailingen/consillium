Study on the Biomarker of First-line Immunotherapy Combined With Chemotherapy in Advanced Esophageal Cancer
This study intends to explore the predictive biomarkers by Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiple immunohistochemistry (mIHC) for the treatment of SHR-1210 in combination with paclitaxel and platinum in advanced esophageal cancer.
Advanced Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Combination therapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is determined using RECIST v1.1, defined as best overall response (CR or PR) across all assessment time points during the period from enrolment to termination of trial treatment., up to approximately 1 year
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), It is defined as the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment., up to approximately 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the enrollment to death from any cause, up to approximately 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients who have achieved complete responseï¼Œ partial response and Stable disease assessed by investigators according to Recist v 1.1., up to approximately 1 year|Adverse events (AEs), All adverse event/Serious adverse event that occurred during the study period according to CTCAE v 4.03, up to approximately 1 year
