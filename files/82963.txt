Defining a Vascular Phenotype of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma With CT Perfusion Using Quantitative Radiomics
With CT-perfusion(CTP) it is possible to visualize the enhancement pattern of the tumor. The perfusion CT, interleaved with a routine contrast enhanced CT (CECT) will be performed at diagnosis in all patients (goal: n=125 patients) and at the first follow-up at 3 months in patients treated with systemic therapy (goal: n=50 patients). Also, the histopathology will be collected for resected tumors to perform histopathology analysis. CTP parameters will be correlated to immunohistological findings and clinical outcome.

The main goal of the study is to create an AI-assisted method to classify patients with a vascular phenotype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The investigators expect that this phenotype can be used to predict overall survival and chemotherapy response.
