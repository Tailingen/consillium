A Study of Clofarabine in Combination With Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in Children With Acute Leukemias.
Clofarabine (injection) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have had at least 2 prior treatment regimens. This use is based on the induction of complete responses. Randomized trials demonstrating increased survival or other clinical benefit have not been conducted.

The purpose of the phase 1 portion of this study was to determine if clofarabine added to a combination of etoposide and cyclophosphamide is safe in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The purpose of the phase 2 portion of the study was to measure the effectiveness of the combination therapy in children with ALL.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Relapsed Leukemia
DRUG: clofarabine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in Phase 1, The MTD was to be the highest dose level of clofarabine in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide that caused \<= 1 of 6 participants to experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) with the next higher dose level having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants experiencing a DLT. The MTD would be used as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). If the MTD could not be determined, then the target dose of clofarabine 40 mg/m\^2, etoposide 100 mg/m\^2 and cyclophosphamide 440 mg/m\^2 as taken by Cohort 5 was to become the RP2D.

The rating scale used is 0 = not the MTD, 1 = the MTD., Up to Day 42 (Phase 1 portion of study)|Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity in Phase 1, The number of participants in each cohort that had dose limiting toxicity is summarized. Toxicities were reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) who determined if additional participants should be added to the cohort and the criteria for escalating to the next cohort., Up to Day 42 (Phase 1 portion of study)|Percentage of Participants Achieving A Response Over the First Two Treatment Cycles in Phase 2, Response categories 1) complete remission (CR): without circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, bone marrow (BM) with \<5% blasts, and platelet (plt)/ANC recovery: ≥75/ ≥0.75 \[x 10\^9/L\] 2) CR in absence of plt recovery (CRp): plt ≥20 to \<75 x 10\^9/L 3) partial remission (PR): no circulating blasts, appearance of normal hematopoietic progenitors, and either a BM with ≥5% and ≤25% blasts with recovery of plts/ANC or a BM with \<5% blasts not meeting CR/CRp definition 4) Overall remission (OR): CR+CRp 5) Any response: CR+CRp+PR., Approximately 28-56 days (Phase 2 portion of study)
Summary of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) in Phase 1, Number of participants with AEs that occurred during treatment and follow-up period (45 days after last cycle). Drug-related AEs and SAEs were followed until resolved or mutually agreed by the investigator and Genzyme to discontinue reporting. AEs were classified by the investigator according to severity (graded using National Cancer Institute \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] version 3.0) and relationship to study drug. The severity scale is:\> Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5=Death related to AE, Up to 9.5 months (Phase 1 portion of study)|Percentage of Participants Achieving A Response Over the First Two Treatment Cycles in Phase 1, Response categories 1) complete remission (CR): without circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, bone marrow (BM) with \<5% blasts, and platelet (plt)/ANC recovery: ALL ≥75/ ≥0.75 \[x 10\^9/L\]; AML ≥100/ ≥1.0 \[x 10\^9/L\] 2) CR in absence of plt recovery (CRp): ALL plt ≥20 to \<75 x 10\^9/L; AML plt ≥20 to \<100 x 10\^9/L 3) partial remission (PR): no circulating blasts, appearance of normal hematopoietic progenitors, and either a BM with ≥5% and ≤25% blasts with recovery of plts/ANC or a BM with \<5% blasts not meeting CR/CRp definition 4) Overall remission (OR): CR+CRp 5) Any response: CR+CRp+PR., Approximately 2 months (Phase 1 portion of study)|Time to Remission for Participants Who Had a Response in Phase 1, The weeks between start of intervention and remission as assessed by the investigator in Phase 1. Participants who had a complete remission (CR) or complete remission with the absence of total platelet recovery (CRp) are included., up to 8 weeks (Phase 1 portion of study)|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Duration of Remission (DOR) for Participants Who Achieved Overall Remission (OR) in Phase 1, Duration of response is the time from the first objective measurement of complete response (CR) or complete response with the absence of total platelet recovery (CRp) to the date of first objective documentation of disease relapse or death due to any cause, plus one day. For summary purposes, results are presented as weeks., Up to 2 years (Phase 1 portion of study)|Kaplan Meier Estimates of Event-free Survival (EFS) for Participants in Phase 1, Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from date of first administration of study interventions until the earliest of the following: date of death or date of first response assessment confirming relapse or date of final response assessment which fails to confirm response, plus one day. For summary purposes, results are presented as weeks., Up to 2 years (Phase 1 portion of study)|Number of Participants With 4-month Event Free Survival in Phase 1, Number of participants with event-free survival at four months post first dose of therapy.
