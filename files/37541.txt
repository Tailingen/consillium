Platform Study of Immunotherapy Combinations in Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
The goal of this clinical trial is to to learn about different combinations of immunotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer whose cancer has spread to their liver and are planning to have surgery to remove tumor metastases from their liver. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* whether these combinations of immunotherapy change the tumor microenvironment in the liver
* whether these combinations of immunotherapy are safe and effective when used in colorectal cancer with liver metastases

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following:

* Botensilimab and balstilimab
* Botensilimab, balstilimab, and AGEN1423
* Botensilimab, balstilimab, and radiation

Participants will be asked to come in to receive drug infusions (and radiation, if applicable) before and after their surgical resection. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years.

Mean CD8:Treg ratio, as determined by flow cytometry of tumor tissue, at time of surgical resection in each treatment arm, Preliminary immunological response to treatment will be assessed by comparison of the CD8:Treg ratios in tumor tissue obtained during standard of care surgical resection between treatment arms. CD8:Treg ratio will be assessed by flow cytometry, At surgical resection
Number of Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 per treatment arm, Potentially treatment-related AEs include any AEs that are assessed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to one of the study interventions. AEs will be reported by CTCAE v5.0 term., 90 days following the last dose of study drug|Pathological Response Rate Per Arm, Resected tumors from the liver will be examined in their entirety, and regression of resected tumors was assessed by estimating the percentage of residual viable tumor of the macroscopically identifiable tumor bed, as identified on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining. In addition, regression will be classified using the Mandard tumor regression grading system. Major pathologic response (MPR) will be defined as ≤10% of residual viable tumor cells (or ≥ 90% response). PR will be defined as at least 50% tumor regression. Pathological response rate will be reported as the number of patients with MPR or PR., At surgical resection|Radiographic Response Rate Per Arm, Radiographic response will be evaluated based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Radiographic response rate will be reported as the number of patients with CR or PR., 90 days following the last dose of study drug|Number of Participants Per Arm with ctDNA Clearance, Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be assessed at 90 days following the last dose of study drug, 90 days following the last dose of study drug
This is a single-center, 3-arm, randomized, open-label, phase II, screening study to assess the initial immunological changes in the tumor microenvironment in response to treatment with combination immunotherapy (Botensilimab/ Balstilimab), with or without radiation and/or additional TGFβ-CD73 trap, in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases.

Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive one of 3 investigational treatment: botensilimab + balstilimab (Arm 1); botensilimab + balstilimab + AGEN1423 (Arm 2); or botensilimab + balstilimab + radiation (Arm 3). The study arms are not directly or formally compared with each other. It is established that the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have been predictive of patient survival following resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases. Immunotherapy combinations with an increase in the ratio of CD8+ T cells: Tregs will be considered for further investigation.

All participants will have a total of four treatment visits to receive immunotherapy infusions. Two visits will occur prior to surgery, each approximately 3 weeks apart. Surgery will be scheduled between day 28-42. After surgery, you will return for two more treatment visits. After the last dose of immunotherapy, participants will come to the clinic approximately 3 weeks and 3 months later for follow-up visits. Participants will be followed remotely for up to two years.
