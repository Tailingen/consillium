Determination of prostate lesion aggressiveness using Gleason scores, Uptake of (\[Ga-68\]PSMA) will be compared with the Gleason score, which is a grading system used to determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.

- Iterations and subsets are part of the Iterative Reconstruction used for PET image reconstruction. Ordered subsets methods group projection data into an ordered sequence of subsets (or blocks). An iteration of ordered subsets EM is defined as a single pass through all the subsets, in each subset using the current estimate to initialize application of EM with that data subset., During scan, up to 35 minutes
Individuals with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and without prior prostate biopsy are offered abbreviated bi-parametric prostate MRI. As Standard of Care (SOC), MRIs will be examined and scored for likelihood for malignancy using the PI-RADS version 2.1 criteria. Those with PI-RADS 3, 4 or 5 lesions or those with PI-RADS 1 or 2 lesions with clinical suspicion for prostate cancer based on serum PSA level, family history or clinical examination (positive digital rectal examination) will be included on study. Only those receiving care at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center will be included into the study.

This study is to evaluate (\[Ga-68\]PSMA) for characterization of prostate abnormalities. For imaging, an FDA approved imaging technology, digital Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) will be used. The study team would like to know if digital PET/CT using \[Ga-68\]PSMA provides accurate information whether or not a participant has prostate cancer and if there is potential spread of the disease within the body. \[Ga-68\]PSMA is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by binding to Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSA), which is overexpressed in prostate cancer. \[Ga-68\]PSMA is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, FDA approval has been obtained for this study protocol by an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.
