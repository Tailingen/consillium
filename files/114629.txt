Improving Pharmacological Transition of Palliative Care Patients From Inpatient to Outpatient Care
The transition of palliative care patients from inpatient to outpatient care is aimed to be improved through structured pharmaceutical discharge management by a trained pharmacist. This data will be compared with retrospective cases.

As part of a prospective observational study with a retrospective comparison group, a pharmacist should, on request, check the discharge medication planned by the primary care physicians before discharge and discuss it with the various colleagues providing (follow-up) care. In addition, the availability in the outpatient "medicine cabinet" and the possibility of prescribing by the responsible GPs (by telephone) should be checked in advance. In addition, longitudinal focus groups with relevant stakeholders are to be conducted to collect quantitative data as well as qualitative data on the views of those providing and receiving treatment.

There will be cooperation with the Specialized Outpatient Palliative Care Service Muenster to ensure sufficient case numbers and a low rate of missing values through partial use of the standard care data from the "Information System Palliative Care" (ISPC) program they use.
