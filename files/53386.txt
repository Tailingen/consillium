Maveropepimut-S (MVP-S) and Low-Dose CPA in Patients With Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer
Phase 2, single arm, study to assess the efficacy and safety of maveropepimut-S (MVP-S) and low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) in subjects with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

A Simon two-stage statistical design to assess MVP-S in combination with low dose CPA in platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer patients who have received no greater than 4 previous lines of anti-cancer therapy.

MVP-S, previously called DPX-Survivac, was recently evaluated in a small Phase 2 single arm study of ovarian cancer patients known as DeCidE1 (NCT02785250).
