INNO-206 in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether INNO-206 is effective in the treatment of small cell lung cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: INNO-206
To determine the objective overall response rate (OR; complete [CR] and partial [PR] responses).
To determine the rates of stable disease and progressive disease.|To determine time to progression.|To determine progression-free survival.|To determine overall survival.|To evaluate the treatment-related toxicities in this patient population.|To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of INNO-206 in a minimum of 12 patients.
This is a phase II, open-label, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study of INNO 206 in adult patients with recurrent extensive small cell lung cancer sensitive to first-line platinum-based therapy. The primary objective of the study is to determine the objective overall response rate. Secondary objectives include evaluating the treatment-related toxicities in this patient population and determining the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INNO-206 in a minimum of 12 patients.
