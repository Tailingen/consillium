Efficacy and Safety of Cinacalcet in Pediatric Patients With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on Dialysis
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of cinacalcet for reducing the plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level by ≥ 30%.
Chronic Kidney Disease, Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
DRUG: Cinacalcet HCl|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Standard of Care
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a ≥ 30% Reduction From Baseline In Mean Plasma iPTH During Weeks 11 to 15, Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were measured at weeks 11 and 15; the mean value from these 2 measurements was calculated.

This endpoint was the primary endpoint in the US only., Baseline and weeks 11 to 15|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a ≥ 30% Reduction From Baseline in Mean Plasma Intact Parathyroid Hormone During the Efficacy Assessment Period, Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were measured at weeks 17, 18, 19 and 20; the mean value from these measurements was calculated.

This endpoint was specified as the the primary endpoint in all countries except the United States (US). In the US this endpoint was specified as a secondary efficacy endpoint., Baseline and the efficacy assessment period (EAP), weeks 17 to 20
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Mean iPTH ≤ 300 pg/mL (31.8 Pmol/L) During Weeks 17 to 20, Efficacy assessment period, weeks 17 to 20|Percent Change in iPTH From Baseline to the Mean Value During Weeks 17 to 20, Baseline and weeks 17 to 20|Change in Corrected Serum Calcium From Baseline to the Mean Value During Weeks 17 to 20, Baseline and weeks 17 to 20|Change in Serum Phosphorus From Baseline to the Mean Value During Weeks 17 to 20, Baseline and weeks 17 to 20
This was a 24-week, randomized, multicenter, open-label, controlled study. Participants were randomized into one of two treatment arms; oral administration of cinacalcet daily in addition to standard of care treatment, or standard of care alone. Randomization was stratified by age group (6 to \< 12 and 12 to \< 18 years of age). All participants received standard of care which could include therapy with Vitamin D sterols, calcium supplementation, and phosphate binders.

Participants in both treatment groups who completed the 20-week treatment period and those who ended the study due to study closure were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension study (20140159; NCT02341417) for further safety follow-up.
