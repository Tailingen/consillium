Blinded Cross-Over Bioequivalence (BE) Trial of Luitpold Azacitidine vs Vidaza
The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of subcutaneous Vidaza® and subcutaneous Luitpold Azacitidine pharmacokinetics and to assess the comparative safety of subcutaneous Vidaza® versus subcutaneous Luitpold Azacitidine.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Myelofibrosis|Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Luitpold Azacitidine|DRUG: Vidaza®
Area Under the Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to the Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC 0-t), The AUC is a measure of systemic drug exposure, which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample; AUC 0-t is defined as AUC from time 0 to the last data point, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 hours after dosing on days 1 and 2.|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC 0-∞), The AUC is a measure of systemic drug exposure, which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample. AUC 0-∞ is defined as area under the concentration vs. time curve from zero to infinity., 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 hours after dosing on days 1 and 2|Observed Maximal Concentration (Cmax), Cmax refers to the highest measured drug concentration which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample., 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 hours after dosing on days 1 and 2
To assess the bioequivalence of Vidaza® and Luitpold Azacitidine pharmacokinetics, in terms of Maximal Concentration (Cmax), Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to the Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC 0-t), and Area Under the Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC 0-∞), following SC administration.

To assess the comparative safety of Vidaza® versus Luitpold Azacitidine during the 2 day study period.
