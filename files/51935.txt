Expanded Access to Elotuzumab (Empliciti) for Multiple Myeloma
At BMS, we work with physicians/investigators to make investigational products available to patients with life-threatening diseases that have exhausted other treatment options and where there is a reasonable expectation of benefit over risk.

When contacted by a treating physician, BMS will consider requests for providing early patient access to Elotuzumab in patients with multiple myeloma who are residents of Belgium, Thailand, Turkey, Argentina, and Colombia.
