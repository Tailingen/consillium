Survival Analysis: TACE vs. Combination Therapy in HCC
This retrospective observational study aimed to assess potential improvements associated with systemic therapies in patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for initially unresectable HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Transarterial chemoembolization|OTHER: Systemic treatment
Progression Free Survival (PFS) per mRECIST, The duration from treatment initiation to PD in patients who cannot undergo surgery, or to the date of postoperative relapse in patients who receive surgery, or death for any reason, whichever occurs first (according to mRECIST)., 12-48 months
12 months PFS rate, The percentage of patients who have not progressed or relapsed or death at the 12 month time point since the first time of treatment., 12 months|Overall survival (OS), The duration from treatment initiation to death from any cause., 24-48 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per mRECIST, The proportion of complete response or partial response as optimal response among all treated patients according to mRECIST., 12-48 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per mRECIST, The proportion of complete response, partial response or stable disease as optimal response among all treated patients according to mRECIST., 12-48 months|Adverse events (AEs), The incidence, relationship with study drugs, and severity level of all adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment related adverse events (TRAEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) and the changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and laboratory test results before, during, and after the treatment., 12-48 months
Standard treatments provide limited benefits for patients with intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, recommendations on multimodal treatment regimens for patients with locally advanced HCC have attracted much attention. Therefore, this retrospective research was designed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of TACE alone or in combination with immune and targeted therapy in the primary treatment for patients with intermediate to advanced stage HCC.
