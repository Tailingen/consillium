QUILT-3.011 Phase 2 Yeast-Brachyury Vaccine Chordoma
This is a phase 2 clinical trial to determine whether the yeast-brachyury vaccine GI-6301 improves the effectiveness of radiation for patients with localized chordoma. Chordoma patients with inoperable or residual tumor who do not have metastases and are planning to be treated with definitive (\>70Gy) radiation were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive radiation plus the vaccine or radiation plus a blinded placebo. The study compared the outcomes of patients treated with radiation with and without the vaccine to determine whether the vaccine can increase the chances of shrinking the tumor and/or preventing further tumor growth.

Overall Response Rate, Difference in overall response rate among patients with Chordoma who are treated with radiation plus placebo vs. radiation plus vaccine.

Overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 in the irradiated tumor site after up to 24 months among patients with Chordoma who are treated with radiation plus vaccine vs. radiation plus placebo

Complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions and no new lesions) or partial response (PR; \>=30% decrease in the sum of the greatest diameter)., Up to 24 months
Chordoma is a rare disease, affecting about 3,000 people in the United States. There have been indications of clinical benefit in patients with chordoma enrolled on the phase I trial of GI-6301.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a difference in overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 after up to 24 months among patients with Chordoma who are treated with radiation plus placebo vs. radiation plus vaccine.
