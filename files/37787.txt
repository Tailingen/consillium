Selinexor and Lenalidomide for Consolidation and Maintenance Treatment in Multiple Myeloma Post-transplant
This phase II clinical trial studies the addition of selinexor to lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma following transplant. Selinexor is an oral medication approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma following failure of other regimens, and lenalidomide is an oral medication approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma following transplant. This study is testing if the combination of selinexor and lenalidomide is more effective than lenalidomide alone in this setting.

Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, Defined by rate of MRD negativity using clonoSEQ MRD® assay at a sensitivity of 10\^-5. MRD negativity is defined as 0 residual clonal cells in a bone marrow biopsy sample., At the end of consolidation treatment (at the end of 4 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, Defined by rate of MRD negativity using clonoSEQ MRD® assay at a sensitivity of 10\^-5. MRD negativity is defined as 0 residual clonal cells in a bone marrow biopsy sample., 12 months from study treatment initiation
Rate of partial response or better, Defined as the rate of patients achieving a partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR), or stringent complete response (sCR), as defined by standard IMWG response criteria., 12 months from study treatment initiation|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as time from AHCT to progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first, and those event-free survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout, 12 months from study treatment initiation
