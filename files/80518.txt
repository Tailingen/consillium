DRUG: Dabigatran Etexilate|DRUG: Tepotinib
Area Under Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Last Sampling Time (Tlast) at Which the Concentration is at or Above the Lower Limit of Quantification (AUC0-t) of Total Dabigatran, AUC0-t was calculated according to the mixed log linear trapezoidal rule., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Total Dabigatran, AUC0-inf was calculated as AUC0-t plus (+) AUCextra. AUCextra represents the extrapolated part of AUC0-inf calculated by Clastpred/Lambda z, where Clastpred is the predicted plasma concentration at the last sampling time point, calculated from the log-linear regression line for Lambda z determination at which the measured plasma concentration is at or above Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Total Dabigatran, Cmax was obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8
Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Total Dabigatran, Tmax is time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Elimination Half Life (t1/2) of Total Dabigatran, Elimination Half Life (t1/2) was defined as the time required for the concentration or amount of drug in the body to be reduced by one-half., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Apparent Clearance (CL/f) of Total Dabigatran, Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Apparent Volume of Distribution During Terminal Phase (Vz/f) of Total Dabigatran, Volume of distribution was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Vz/f after oral dose was influenced by the fraction absorbed., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Percentage of Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Tlast Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-inf) Obtained by Extrapolation (AUCextra%) of Total Dabigatran, The AUC from time tlast extrapolated to infinity given as percentage of AUC0-inf. AUCextra% = (AUCextra /AUC0-inf)\*100., Pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours Post-dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs, Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom/disease temporally associated with use of medicinal product, whether/not considered related to medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAE is defined as AEs starting/worsening after first intake of the study drug. TEAEs included both serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs., Screening up to Day 4 in Period 1; Day 1 up to Day 15 in Period 2|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Laboratory Values, Number of participants with clinically significant change in laboratory values were reported. Clinical significance was decided by the investigator. Laboratory investigation included hematology, biochemistry, virology, drugs of abuse, hormones, urinalysis, and coagulation., Screening up to Day 4 in Period 1; Day 1 up to Day 15 in Period 2|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings, Number of participants with clinically significant change in 12-lead ECG were reported. Clinical significance was decided by the investigator. The 12-lead ECGs were recorded after the participant have rested for at least 5 minutes in supine position., Screening up to Day 4 in Period 1; Day 1 up to Day 15 in Period 2|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Signs, Number of participants with clinically significant change in vital signs were reported. Clinical significance was decided by the investigator. Vital signs included body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate., Screening up to Day 4 in Period 1; Day 1 up to Day 15 in Period 2
