A Phase 2 Trial of Glofitamab for Minimal Residual Disease in Patients With Large B-cell Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if glofitamab can help to prevent recurrence of LBCL in patients who have achieved CR after standard first-line therapy but have tested positive for MRD. The safety of glofitamab will also be studied.
B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Glofitamab
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

To determine the rate of undetectable MRD following treatment with glofitamab in patients with LBCL who were MRD positive at the end of standard first line treatment

Secondary Objective:

To determine progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and evaluate safety of glofitamab as treatment for patients with LBCL who are MRD positive at end of standard first line treatment

Exploratory Objective:

To determine the biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance to glofitamab in LBCL

To determine the kinetics of T-cell activation and exhaustion in patients treated with gofitamab to eliminate MRD
