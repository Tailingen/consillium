Study of Tumor Treating Fields With Hypofractionated Chemoradiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of TTFields + SRS+ Temozolomide (TMZ) for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM).
Glioblastoma|Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
DEVICE: Optune|DRUG: Gadolinium|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLTs), Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related adverse events that are severe or medically significant, and needing topical \& systemic therapy; needing surgery intervention; needing hospitalization; needing treatment interruption; or life threatening. Late DLTs will be assessed as the number of DLTs that occur in the period from 31 days after the start of treatment through 5 months after the start of treatment. The outcome will be reported as a number without dispersion., 5 months
Acute dose limiting toxicity, Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as possibly, probably, or definitely related adverse events that are severe or medically significant, and needing topical \& systemic therapy; needing surgery intervention; needing hospitalization; needing treatment interruption; or life threatening. Acute DLTs will be assessed as the number of DLTs that occur in the period from the start of treatment through 30 days after the start of treatment. The outcome will be reported as a number without dispersion., 1 month|Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months, Progression-free survival is defined as the number of evaluable participants who, at 6 months from the date of surgical resection or biopsy (PFS6), are alive without disease progression, death, or other defined event (study withdrawal or loss to follow up). Disease progression is defined as â‰¥ 25% increase in product of perpendicular diameters of the lesion; any increase in MRI T2/FLAIR lesion area from previous MRI scan; MRI detection of a new lesion; decline in clinical status not attributable to causes other than the tumor. The outcome will be reported as the number without dispersion., 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be assessed as the number of evaluable participants who remain alive from the date of surgical resection or biopsy. The outcome will be reported as the number without dispersion., 30 months
Primary Objective:

Determine the safety of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) started concurrently with 5 fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. secondary objective: Efficacy for the combination of TTFields started concurrently with 5
