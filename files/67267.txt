Study to Assess the Safety of Escalating Doses of AT9283, in Patients With Leukemias
The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of AT9283 that can be given to patients who have ALL, AML, CML, high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Researchers want to perform pharmacokinetic (PK) testing on blood to find out how quickly the study drug leaves the body and how the body breaks down the drug. The safety and effectiveness of this drug will also be studied.
