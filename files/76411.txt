CIRSE Registry for SIR-Spheres Therapy
The administration of SIR-Spheres microspheres (yttrium-90 resin microspheres) is a form of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for the treatment of patients with primary and secondary liver tumours. The primary objective is to observe the real-life clinical application of radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres and the impact of the treatment in clinical practice. Secondary objectives are to observe safety and effectiveness of SIR-Spheres treatment in terms of adverse events, Overall Survival (OS), Progression-free survival (PFS), technical considerations, liver PFS and Quality of Life (QoL) + subgroup analyses

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also called radioembolisation (RE), with SIR-Spheres microspheres is an endovascular procedure, included within the interventional oncologic technologies to treat primary and secondary liver tumours. Using a microcatheter, a precise dose of resin microspheres is released in the hepatic artery, where they are carried into the arterioles and selectively lodge in the tumour microvasculature. The microspheres are loaded with the radioactive yttrium-90, a high-energy beta-emitting isotope with a half-life of 64.1 hours. Following administration, 94% of the radiation is delivered in 11 days. Previous reports on the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 resin microspheres for the treatment of primary and secondary liver tumours are very promising. In order to further improve the understanding of this therapy in its true clinical setting, the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) initiated the CIRSE Registry for SIR-Spheres Therapy (CIRT), a phase 4 observational study that aims to collect robust data on the real-life clinical practice of radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres microspheres. Further, using the quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 with its hepatocellular carcinoma module (developed and verified by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)), CIRT aims to collect data on the quality of life of patients treated with SIR-Spheres microspheres.
