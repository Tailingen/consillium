ALL2008 Protocol for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - 6MP Consolidation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to increase the fraction of patients, who become MRD-negative during consolidation for the non-HR ALL group through individualized intensification of the 6MP-dosage days 30-85.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: 6MPindividualized|DRUG: 6MPfixed
Fraction of patients that become MRD-negative at treatment days 85 and/or 92 (end-of-consolidation) and event-free survival. MRD is measured either by Flow-cytometry (for PreB-ALL patients) or PCR for clonal generearrangements(for T-ALL patients), 6 years
Toxicity of treatment, degree of myelo-, hepato- and renal toxicity; and development of asparaginase antibodies., 6 years
20% of children with ALL still fails to be cured. The ALL-2008 protocol is a treatment and research protocol that aims to improve the overall outcome of Nordic children and adolescents with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and previous NOPHO protocols.

The specific and primary objectives of the randomised study is:

To increase the fraction of patients, who become MRD-negative during consolidation for the non-HR ALL group through individualised intensification of the 6MP-dosage days 30-85. We will additionally measure EFS and toxicity as secondary end points of effect.
