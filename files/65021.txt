Pre-operative PET-MR of High Risk Prostate Cancer Patients for Assessment of Cancer Aggressiveness and Lymph Node Status
Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in Norwegian men. For optimal treatment, accurate staging of the disease at the time point of diagnosis is important. The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic potential of a combined PET/MR examination for risk assessment and detection of lymph node metastases. The overall aim of the project is to improve the investigators ability to provide individually tailored treatment to prostate cancer patients.

The study will include 32 men with high-risk prostate cancer, who are eligible for radical prostatectomy. Informed consent is a requirement for inclusion in the study.
