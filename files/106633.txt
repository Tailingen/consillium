Performance characteristics of Axumin PET scan in patients undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, Investigate the accuracy of anti-18F-FACBC PET/CT correlating with histopathologic outcomes, Two years
Investigators aim to perform a prospective study of anti-18F-FACBC PET/CT in patients with NSGCT prior to RPLND, either in the primary setting or in the post-chemotherapy setting. We will correlate histopathologic outcomes from the RPLND specimen and clinical outcomes of recurrence during follow-up to identify the accuracy of anti-18F-FACBC PET/CT in these settings.
