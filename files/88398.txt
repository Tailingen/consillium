This is a modular Phase I/II, open-label, dose escalation and expansion, multicentre Study. The study consists of individual modules, each evaluating the safety and tolerability of AZD0466 as monotherapy or with a specific combination treatment. The initial components are the core protocol, which contains information applicable to all modules, and Module 1.

Module 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of AZD0466 monotherapy and will include 2 parts. Part A dose escalation and Part B dose expansion cohorts. Part A will enrol patients with advanced B-NHL and once the RP2D has been determined, Part B may open to further explore the preliminary anticancer efficacy of AZD0466 monotherapy in patients with selected lymphoid malignancies.

Part A: Phase 1 dose setting to assess the safety and tolerability and determine dose(s) and schedule(s) to be evaluated in Part B.

Part B: Phase 1b/2a dose expansion to assess the efficacy of AZD0466 in 3 select patient populations: relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (Cohort B1), R/R follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (Cohort B2), and R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Cohort B3).
