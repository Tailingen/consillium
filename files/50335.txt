Perifosine and Torisel (Temsirolimus) for Recurrent/Progressive Malignant Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug called temsirolimus in combination with a drug called perifosine in treating brain tumors that have continued to grow after previous treatment. Temsirolimus is an intravenous drug approved by the FDA for treatment of other cancers (kidney cancer, certain types of lymphoma) but not for brain tumors. Perifosine is a pill that has not been approved by the FDA which blocks a messenger that tells cancer cells to grow. Research suggests that combined treatment with both drugs is better than either alone, and that it is reasonably safe.

Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the radiographic response rate plus 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate., Up to 6 months from the start of treatment
Median Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival will be calculated by using the interval between the date in which the first study drug administration took place (Arm A), and first day of study drug administration following surgery (Arm B), until the date of subject expiration., Up to 48 months from start of treatment
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common subtype in adults, representing more than 50% of gliomas. Standard initial treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy to the tumor bed and chemotherapy with an oral DNA alkylator, temozolomide. However, recurrence is nearly universal despite standard therapy. There is no standard treatment at recurrence. Median survival is about 15 months from diagnosis and 6 months from recurrence. Once patients develop tumor progression, conventional chemotherapy is generally ineffective.
