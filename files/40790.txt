UARK 2014-14: Phase II Prospective Evaluation of Bone Remodeling During Ixazomib Treatment
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Ixazomib on inducing osteoblast activation as measured by bone markers and imaging in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Ixazomib
Change in Serum Osteocalcin From Baseline to End of Study in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma., To evaluate the effect of Ixazomib on inducing osteoblast activation as measured by change in serum osteocalcin from baseline to end of study in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma., Baseline, Treatment (28-day cycles for 6 cycles)
This is a phase II study designed to examine the bone anabolic effect of the next generation proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, in relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. Treatment consists of Ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28 day cycle, for a maximum of 6 cycles. Determination of relapsed/refractory disease as an entry criterion may be based on patient data obtained during or following the patient's most recent prior antineoplastic therapy. Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Patients will be seen at regular intervals while they are participating in the study.
