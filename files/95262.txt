Pivotal Study to Validate a Novel System to Non-Invasively Detect Severe Neutropenia
Pivotal study to validate the diagnostic performance of PointCheck, the first non invasive device to preliminary detect neutropenia in cancer patients receiving intermediate/high risk antineoplastic therapy.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PointCheck
PointCheck Accuracy, The main primary endpoints for this study will be the sensitivity and specificity of PointCheckTM to detect grade IV neutropenia ac cording to the CTCAE V5 definition of severe neutropenia in a standard blood analysis., Two weeks
PointCheck Precision, Repeatability and reproducibility will be assessed using the % positive/negative results of the test's classification compared to the gold standard after multiple measurements in different contexts., Two-weeks|PointCheck Usability, Mean System Usability Score, Two-weeks|PointCheck Errors, Device related errors (number/type), Two-weeks|PointCheck Safety, total number (and %) of AEs and SAEs related to the device use., Two-weeks
