A Phase 2 Study of 9-ING-41Combined With Chemotherapy in Adolescents and Adults With Advanced Sarcomas
9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel will lead to sustained disease control and/or increase the rates of objective response in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

This is an open label, two-stratum, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of 9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine/docetaxel in patients ≥10 years of age with advanced sarcoma.

Stratum A: Patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma previously treated with 0-3 prior lines of systemic therapy will receive 9-ING-41 twice weekly with gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel on day 8 of a 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Stratum B: Patients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcoma previously treated with at least one line of systemic therapy will receive 9-ING-41 twice weekly with gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel on day 8 of a 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Disease response assessment will be performed every 2 cycles (6 weeks) for the first 8 cycles (24 weeks), then every 12 weeks thereafter.

Disease Control Rate, To determine the Disease Control Rate (DCR = Complete Response \[CR\] + Partial Response \[PR\] + Stable Disease \[SD\] at 6 months) of 9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel in advanced sarcoma., Approximately 24 weeks
Progression Free Survival, To determine the activity of 9-ING-41 with chemotherapy by assessing progression free survival (PFS)., From start of protocol therapy, approximately 5 years
