Study of Gemcitabine+Platinum Salt+Bevacizumab Combination for Metastatic Collecting Duct Carcinoma (GETUG-AFU 24)
Open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, phase II, single arm non comparative trial evaluating toxicity and efficacy of gemcitabine plus platinum salt in combination with bevacizumab in first-line setting in metastatic collecting duct carcinoma.
Collecting Duct Carcinoma (Kidney)
DRUG: Bevacizumab
Composite endpoint : Objective response rate / Progression-free survival, The primary endpoint is composed of:

* the objective response rate (CR or PR) according to RECIST criteria (V1.1) on the basis of measurable lesions defined at baseline,
* the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months , PFS is defined as the absence of disease progression or death, 6 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from the date of the first dose of treatment to the date of progression or death (whichever comes first), or last date with no progression, 2 years max|The Overall Survival (OS), The Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated from the date of the first dose of treatment to the date of death (whatever the cause) or the date of last follow-up, 2 years max|The toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI-CTC scale version 4.0, 2 years max
