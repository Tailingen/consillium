Phase 1, Open-label Trial to Determine Safety of OPB-51602 in Subjects With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether OPB-51602 is safe and tolerable when given daily by mouth to subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: OPB-51602
To determine the safety and tolerability of OPB-51602, AEs, vital signs, body weight, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, and performance status will be assessed., Weekly for first cycle, then every 2 weeks (on average up to 8 weeks).
To determine the pharmacokinetics of OPB-51602 and to determine the MTD of OPB-51602, The following PK parameters (Cmax, tmax, AUC₀-t, AUCtau, CLss/F and t½,z) will be determined using a non-compartmental approach for OPB-51602 and selected metabolites after single (Cycle 1, Day 1) and multiple daily doses (Cycle 2, Day 1)., 28 days|Pharmacodynamic profile:, Study drug effects on STAT-3 phosphorylation will be assessed in PBMCs of study subjects in the dose escalation and expansion stages., 28 days|Antitumor effects:, Treatment response and/or disease progression in subjects with measurable disease will be evaluated after every 2 cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST₉)., Every 2 cycles (on average 8 weeks).
This study is based on data that support a role for the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of proteins in oncogenesis. One of the mechanisms of action of OPB-51602 includes inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. Therefore OPB-51602 is expected to be active as an anti-cancer drug. This first-in-human study will characterize the safety profile of OPB-51602, evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OPB-51602, identify a recommended phase II dose, and obtain preliminary efficacy data, in subjects with advanced cancers for whom there is no standard treatment available.
