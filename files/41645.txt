Monitoring of Bone Free Flaps With Microdialysis
Microdialysis is admitted to be reliable by numerous surgeons to monitor flaps. Nevertheless, a few authors reported follow up with microdialysis in bone flaps, and they all described the position of the catheter in the surrounding soft tissue muscle. This surrounding soft tissue is not always the reflect of bone vascularisation.

The aim is to study the feasibility of a follow up of microanastomosed bone flaps with microdialysis. To reach this goal, investigators perform a clinical prospective research project untitled MTM project

DEVICE: CMA 70 catheter directly positioned in bone tissue
Feasibility study of monitoring bone free flaps with microdialysis (catheter directly positioned in bone tissue), Success of microdialysis is defined as the collection and measurement of metabolites levels as: lactate, pyruvate,glycerol and glucose., Day 5 after catheter insertion
Evaluation of "flush-out" period, Time required to acquire interpretable data after opening microdialysis circuit, Day 5 after catheter insertion|Compliance of the prescription, Compliance rate of simples collected and analysed, Day 5 after catheter insertion
Delay of ischemia detection with metabolic parameters, compared to clinical symptoms, Time between the occurrence of the first metabolic changes and the first clinical signs of tissue damage, from implantation time day 5
In addition to our classical clinical monitoring, bone microanastomosed flaps for reconstructive facial surgery will be monitored with CMA 70 catheter directly positioned in bone tissue.

The monitoring is recorded during 5 days. Glucose, lactate , pyruvate , glycerol rates will be analysed :

* every hour at day 1,
* every two hours at day 2,
* every three hours at day 3,4 and 5.

Data are managed with Labpilot software.
