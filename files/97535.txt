Endometrial Cancer Patientes MMR Deficient Comparing Chemotherapy vs Dostarlimab in First Line
Phase 3, randomized, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab versus carboplatin-paclitaxel in patients with MMR deficient relapse or advanced endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Dostarlimab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until objective tumor progression based on RECIST 1.1, by BICR (Blinded Independent Central Review), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients alive and free of progression will be censored at the last disease assessment date., from the date of randomization until objective tumor progression based on RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first assessed up to 5 years.
Overall Survival (OS) (key secondary endpoint), Measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Patients alive at the cut-off date will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive., from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2), Defined by the time from initial randomization to the second objective disease progression (ie, after the first subsequent therapy) as assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause, whoever occurs first. Patients alive and free of second progression (including patients without any progression), will be censored at the last disease assessment date., from the date of randomization until second objective tumor progression based on RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first assessed up to 5 years|Quality Of Life evaluation based on Quality of Life Questionnaire EQ5D5L (The 5-level EQ-5D version), The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems, through study completion, an average of 5 years|To assess the effects of Dostarlimab on Health related quality of Life (QoL) based on EORTC QLQ C30 (Quality of Life questionnaire-core 30), Health related quality of life of the patient. For all scales a high score is equivalent to worse or more problems. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum possible value of the raw score. All items are scored from1 to 4, giving a range=3. For each scale, calculate the raw score by the addition of item responses divided by the number of items. Then a linear transformation is used to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. Score= (raw score-1)/rangex100, Defined as the Global Health Status score from the EORTC QLQ C30 at 18 weeks, assessed up to 5 years|To assess the quantity of peripheral neuropathy event induced by chemotherapy based on EORTC QLQ-CIPN 20 (Quality of Life questionnaire-Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy 20), Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy assessed by QLQ-CIPN20 at 18 weeks for each problems or symptoms there are a scales with a high score which is equivalent to worse or more. All items are scored from1 to 4, giving a range=3. 1 = Not at all and 4 = Very much. For each scale, calculate the raw score by the addition of item responses divided by the number of items., Defined as the Global Health Status score from the EORTC QLQ-CIP20 at 18 weeks, assessed up to 5 years|To assess the effects of treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measure by determining time to deterioration in Quality of life, based EORTC QLQ-EN24 (Quality of Life Questionnaire - Endometrial Cancer Module), To assess disease and treatment specific aspects of the quality of life of patients with endometrial cancer. A high score for the functional scales represents a high level of functioning, while a high score for the symptom scales represents a high level of symptoms or problems. Symptoms related to sexual/vaginal problems (EMSXV including item 51-53) are optional., Defined as the Global Health Status score from the EORTC QLQ-EN24 at 18 weeks, assessed up to 5 years|To assess the status of health for patients with endometrial cancer based on EUROQOL EQ-5D (Descriptive system), Deterioration and impact on patients' life of endometrial cancer assessed by the questionnaire EUROQOL EQ-5D, Defined as the Global Health Status score from the EUROQOL EQ-5D at 18 weeks, assessed up to 5 years|Best Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete or partial response as per RECIST 1.1, from the date of randomization until best objective response based on RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved confirmed CR or PR or have demonstrated SD for at least 24 weeks; per RECIST 1.1., from the date of randomization until response or stable disease per RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 5 years|Duration of Response Rate (DoR), Measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression., from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression ,assessed up to 5 years|Safety and number of adverse events, Measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression., From date of randomization until end of study, assessed up to 6 years|Tolerability to the treatment, Assessed by CTCAE v5.0 (by investigators) Assessed by NCI PRO-CTCAE (by patients), From date of randomization until end of study, assessed up to 6 years|Time to first and second Subsequent Treatment, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of respectively the first and second subsequent anticancer therapy or death., from the date of randomization to date of event, assessed up to an average of 5 years|To determine the immunogenicity of dostarlimab, Incidence of ADA against dostarlimab, from randomisation to 12 weeks after end of treatment, assessed at study end
Phase III, randomized, open label, multi-centre study.

Randomization on a 1:1 ratio, stratification performed according to:

* Prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes or no)
* Prior pelvic radiotherapy (yes or no)
* Disease status: newly diagnosed advanced / metastatic disease versus relapse
