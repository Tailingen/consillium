Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of HZ-A-018 in Patients With B Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and RP2D (Recommended Phase II Dose) of orally administered HZ-A-018 in patients with B cell lymphoma who have at least failed or relapsed after first-line treatment.
Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: HZ-A-018
Dose limiting toxicity assessment for each patient, The "3+3" design will be applied in the dose-escalation part., At the end of the first 28 day cycle|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The "3+3" design will be applied in the dose-escalation part., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Adverse events (AEs), Adverse events at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v5.0 used as a guide for the grading of severity., Up to 2 years
