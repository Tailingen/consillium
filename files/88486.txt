Maximum QTcF was categorized as less than (\<) 450 milliseconds (msec), 450 msec to 480 msec, 480 msec to 500 msec, and more than (\>) 500 msec., Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 1 (for Arm B Expansion), Cycle 1 Day 2 (for Arms A, B and C), Cycle 2 Day 1 (for Arms A, B and C), Day 1 for each cycle (Cycles 3-36, for Arms B Expansion and C) and end of treatment (up to 2 years, for Arms B Expansion and C).|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Arm A, Percentage of participants with objective response based on the assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions., Baseline up to 18 months.|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Arm B, Percentage of participants with objective response based on the assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions., Baseline up to 18 months.|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Arm C, Percentage of participants with objective response based on the assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions., Baseline up to 18 months.|Clinical Benefit Response Rate - Arm B Expansion, Percent of participants with confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks on study according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD)., Baseline up to 18 months.|Duration of Response - Arm B Expansion, Duration of response was calculated from first date of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to the date of progression or death due to any cause. In the event of no progression or death, the last tumor assessment date without progression was used in this calculation., Baseline up to 18 months.|Progression Free Survival - Arm B Expansion, Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to date of first documentation of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS was calculated as first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1 . Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease \[PD\]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was "Death")., Baseline up to 18 months.|Mean Observed Score Values for European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) - Arm B Expansion, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30): included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms., Baseline, Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 2, Day 1 of Cycles 3 to 16.|Mean Change From Baseline for European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) - Arm B Expansion, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30): included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties).

This study will evaluate PF-05212384 (gedatolisib) PI3K/mTOR inhibitor)) in combination with either docetaxel, cisplatin or dacomitinib in select advanced solid tumors. The study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these combinations in patients with advanced cancer in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose in each combination. The cisplatin combination expansion portion will evaluate the anti tumor activity of PF 05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with TNBC in 2 separate Arms (Arm 1 and Arm 2).
