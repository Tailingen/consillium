S0119: Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the survival of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan.
* Determine the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the overall toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
