Study of IMX-110 in Combination With Tislelizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Phase 1/2a Phase 1 is an open-label, multicenter dose escalation/dose expansion study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of IMX-110 in combination with Tislelizumab. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be evaluated in further dose expansion Phase 2a study submitted as an amendment to this Phase 1 protocol during the conduct of the Phase 1 study.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: IMX-110 combined with Tislelizumab
Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Incidence, severity and causality of AE and serious adverse events (SAE) / Physical examination changes from baseline / Vital sign changes from baseline (heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature) / Hematology and chemistry parameter changes from baseline / 12-lead ECG and 2-D Echocardiogram changes from baseline, 28 days|Maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and RP2D of IMX-110 in combination with Tislelizumab, MTD is defined as the highest dose at which ≤ 33% of the patients treated during the 3+3 design experience a DLT and/or at least two ≥ grade 2 non-hematologic toxicities during the first treatment cycle, and will be used to identify the RP2D to be taken forward to Phase 2a., 28 days
Plasma concentrations of IMX-110, Plasma concentration of IMX-110 will be measured when administered in treatment Cycle 1. Samples will be collected on Day 1 (pre-dose, and immediately after, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 3 hours, 5 hours post-dose), on Day 2 (pre-dose), and Day 5 (pre-dose and immediately after, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 3 hours, 5 hours post-dose), and optionally on Day 7 (pre-dose, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 3 hours, 5 hours post-dose)., 7 days|Response Rate, Objective Response Rate as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 and iRECIST, 8 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the start of treatment to the time of progression or death, whichever occurs first while on the study., 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from Cycle 1 Day1 to death due to any cause., 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR as determined by RECIST criteria version 1.1 and iRECIST, 5 years
