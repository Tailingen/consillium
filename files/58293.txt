A Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity Between SB27 and Keytruda in Subjects With Metastatic Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to confirm that SB27 works in the same way as Keytruda in metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The main question it aims to answer is:

• How effective the study drug is Participants will receive either investigational product (SB27 or Keytruda) and chemotherapy every 3 weeks.

Researchers will compare SB27 and Keytruda to see if SB27 works in the same way as Keytruda.
