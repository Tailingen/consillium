Behavioral Support Before Anesthesia
Studies shows that reduced nervousness before anaesthesia may improve a course past anaesthesia. Therefore it is interesting to investigate how we can best help patients shortly before anaesthesia. A RCT with three intervention arms (with different personal support) and a control arm (with usual personal support) is therefore performed.

Hypothesis: Nervousness is reduced by the new interventions compared to the usual help provided.
Nervousness|Life Experiences
BEHAVIORAL: Only support from an anaesthetic nurse on the surgery ward|BEHAVIORAL: Support: a theatre nurse + an anaesthetic nurse|BEHAVIORAL: Support: a nurse from the ward + an anaesthetic nurse|BEHAVIORAL: Optional relative supports
Change from baseline in nervousness at the operating table, VAS score shown by patients and written down by the anesthetic nurse correcte to one decimal place., Baseline and when the patient is on the operating table, on average 1Â½ days
Satisfaction with help from healthcare professionals, A validated questionnaire is filed out by patients. The questionnaire have six items measuring satisfaction with help from healthcare professionals provided at the hospital., A questionnaire at discharge, an expected average of three days|Healthcare professional time spent, Healthcare professional time spent on interventions: Healthcare professional time used with patient and relative half an hour before anaesthesia byond what is required by law, The last half an hour before anaesthesia
All patients receive behavioral support the last half hour before anaesthesia, but at different times and provided by persons with different connection to the patients.

The last two patients in all arms will be interviewed about their experiences with the help offered.

Statistic will provide results in the quantitative part of the study and analysis and interpretation following ideas of the French philosopher Poul Ricoeur will provide results in the qualitative part of the study.
