Split-course Hypofractionated Radiotherapy With Concurrent Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of split-course thoracic radiotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy with or without consolidation immunotherapy for patients with local advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of split-course thoracic radiotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy with or without consolidation immunotherapy for local advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.

Patients were treated with hypo-RT (30Gy in 6 fractions) followed by hypo-boost (30Gy in 6 fractions) combined with concurrent weekly chemotherapy (docetaxel 25 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2). Consolidation immunotherapy were recommended for those without disease progression or persistent grade2+ toxicities following radiotherapy. The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first day of radiotherapy to the date at which disease progresses. Progression-free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v. 5.0.
