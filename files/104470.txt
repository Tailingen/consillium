Interest of Intrathecal Chemotherapy With Liposomal Cytarabine (DepoCyte®) in Meningeal Metastasis of Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of Depocyte® IT combined with the systemic standard treatment in terms of clinical and/or radiological neuromeningeal progression free survival (SSPN)
Breast Cancer|Leptomeningeal Metastases
DRUG: Liposomal Cytarabine
Leptomeningeal disease-related neurological progression-free survival (LM-PFS), time between randomization and date of first leptomeningeal progression (defined according to clinical-neurological or imaging criteria) or date of death (death from any cause) whatever occurs first. Patients alive without neurological progression at the time of the last follow-up will be censored at the date of the last visit., At baseline, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, after 2 months from baseline once a month until progression (up to 6 months) and at the end of the study (up to 6 months)
Response of leptomeningeal metastases, Evaluated by clinical improvement, cytological improvement and MRI improvement. At 2 and 6 months, and best leptomeningeal disease response to treatment in response to treatment, At baseline, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, after 2 months from baseline once a month until progression (up to 6 months) and at the end of the study (up to 6 months)|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS defined by the time between randomization and date of first progression: leptomeningeal, parenchymal, systemic (extra-CNS) or date of death (from any cause) if it occurs first. Patients alive and without progression at the time of the last follow-up will be censured at the date of the last visit. The different components of PFS will also be estimated considering the competing risk approach., At baseline, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, after 2 months from baseline once a month until progression (up to 6 months) and at the end of the study (up to 6 months)|Overall survival, Time between the date of randomization in the study and the death of the patient (from any cause)., Until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months.|Tolerance to DepoCyte® according to NCI CTCAE V4.0, Safety and tolerability profile of DepoCyte® according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events will be considered as severe if the grade is more than 2. All AE will be taken into account except events unequivocally related to the underlying disease or its progression. SAE will be also reported., Up to 30 days after the last administration of the study treatment|Q-TWiST, Q-TWiSTanalysis defined by 3 health status: time with toxicity before progression (TOX), time after progression (PROG) considering progression at any site, and time without toxicity and without progression (TWiST)., Calculated at the end of study
Quality of life (questionnaire QLQ C30, BN20 and C15), Quality of life data will be described and compared between the 2 groups of treatment by estimating the impact of DepoCyte® in terms of time to definitive deterioration of quality of life will be also compared. A deterioration of quality of life is defined as by a decrease of 10 points of the quality of life score or an increase of 10 points for quality of life symptoms., At baseline, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, after 2 months from baseline once a month until progression (up to 6 months) and at the end of the study (up to 6 months)|Autonomy in daily life (questionnaire Instrumental Activities in Daily Living), IADL scale which evaluates the repercussions of the patients difficulties in the different activities of daily life., At baseline, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, after 2 months from baseline once a month until progression (up to 6 months) and at the end of the study (up to 6 months)|Emotional state of the patient assessed by the psychological distress score, Emotional Distress Profile (EDP) scale and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale., At baseline|Identification and quantification of tumor cells in the CSF by the Veridex technique for the diagnosis and the follow-up of breast cancer leptomeningeal metastases, 60 samples analysed at the diagnostic and monitoring of tumor meningitis moments, by VERIDEX technique: the presence of tumours cells is affirmed if there is no more than 1 cell in 7.5 mL., At baseline, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, after 2 months from baseline once a month until progression (up to 6 months) and at the end of the study (up to 6 months)|Leptomeningeal response according to RANO criteria combining clinical, CSF cytological and imaging response, Leptomeningeal response according to RANO criteria combining clinical, CSF cytological and imaging response, Done at the end of study
After the signature of the consent form and validation of the eligibility inclusion criteria, patients will be randomized. Treatment will start within a maximum of 10 days after randomization.

Arm A: Systemic standard treatment without DepoCyte® Arm B: Systemic standard treatment with DepoCyte® DepoCyte® will be slowly administered by injection (1 to 5 minutes) of 50 mg (5 mL) into the CSF via a lumbar puncture or a ventricular device

* every 14 +/- 2 days for a total of 5 cycles (induction treatment)
* then every 28 +/-4 days until progression (maintenance treatment) Standard systemic treatment by chemotherapy, targeted therapy or hormonal therapy is at the discretion of the investigator taking into account the breast cancer sub-type and previous treatments. The systemic treatment will be determined before randomization. It can be modified at any time according to the treating oncologist. Focal radiotherapy to symptomatic sites is allowed. The usual follow-up of patients treated by IT DepoCyte® of every 14 days for the first two months and then monthly is not modified in patients of Arm B. Evaluation in Arm A will be matched to Arm B, and are thus more frequent than routinely done because such patients are usually seen every 3 weeks. The follow-up for systemic disease is left at the discretion of the treating oncologist.

Translational research Only Oscar Lambret Center will participate in this exploratory analysis. For patients who accept to participate, a 10 mL CSF sample will be collected at enrollment and once per month, just before treatment.

* Arm A: at monthly visit
* Arm B: at a IT injection, once per month, just before DepoCyte® injection Samples will be sent to the analysis center as soon as possible and will be destroyed at the end of all study-related procedures.
