Evaluation of a New Open Source Virtual Bronchoscope Navigation System
To evaluate the feasibility of the Fraxinus Virtual Bronchoscope Navigation (VBN) System in the bronchoscopic access to target lesions. The study emphasizes the system´s efficacy in diagnostics of peripheral pulmonary lesions and the ease of use for the operator.
Bronchial Neoplasms
DEVICE: Fraxinus VBN system
Evidence if the Fraxinus VBN System has a role in the assessment of peripheral pulmonary lesions, The proportion of cases in which the use of the system is considered beneficial, 48 hours
Diagnostic yield, Diagnostic success defined as cytology or biopsy with pathology, 1 week|Duration of procedure, Time spent with preparations and bronchoscopy, 48 hours|Adverse events, Procedure related adverse events or unexpected incidents registrated, 48 hours|Operators-reported satisfaction, Enquiry on main operator´s experience after end of bronchoscopy, 48 hours
Multi-center study. The study explores Fraxinus which is an open source, software only, simple guiding system for bronchoscopy. The system provides 3D maps with centerline-to-target information extracted from preoperative computed tomography. The ability of the system to guide a user to a peripheral target lesion will be evaluated. During bronchoscopy any established method for diagnostic sampling is allowed. User Evaluation will be essential to decide if the Fraxinus VBN System is beneficial in a clinical setting.
