Efficacy, Safety and Underlying Mechanisms of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Acupuncture for Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis
In recent years, a number of randomized controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). Indeed, the latest American clinical guidelines recommended acupuncture treatment for AR patients who are interested in non-pharmacological treatment.

In conventional acupuncture treatment for AR, needles are inserted at specific acupoints in the body; with several studies demonstrating acupuncture of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) to improve nasal symptoms and quality of life in nasal inflammatory diseases.

The investigators hypothesize that, compared with sham acupuncture and rescue medication (RM), active SPG acupuncture combined with RM would lead to greater improvements in symptoms score and reduction in overall need for antihistamines. To test this hypothesis the investigators design a randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of SPG acupuncture in pollen-induced seasonal AR patients and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms.
Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis
PROCEDURE: SPA acupuncture|PROCEDURE: sham acupuncture
Change from baseline symptom scores at visit 4, Patients recorded nasal and ocular symptom severity during the trial. Four nasal symptoms (itching, sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction) and two ocular symptoms (ocular itch and watery eyes) were individually graded on a ten-point scale (0, no symptoms; 1-3, mild symptoms; 4-7, moderate symptoms; 8-10, severe symptoms). Our primary outcome is TNSS change from baseline at the end of four-acupuncture treatment at Visit 4 (15 minutes after the fourth acupuncture ). The investigator will compare the symptom scores between the active acupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group., Symptom scores will be assessed at baseline (V0), visit 4( V4). V4 is within 15 minutes after the fourth acupuncture.
Rescue medication score, when the symptoms were very severe and could not tolerated, the patients could use loratadine as rescue medication. The need for rescue medication was assessed as rescue medication score (RMS), analyzed as the weekly sum of daily use of Loratadine (10mg/d, equivalent to 1 point) or nasal corticosteroid spray (2 points), RMS will be assessed at baseline (V0), and each visit. V1 to V4 is within two weeks. V5 is one week after the fourth acupuncture, and V6 is two weeks after the fourth acupuncture. There is no acupuncture during both V5 and V6|SNOT-22, SNOT-22 is assessed to evaluate the quality of life of the SAR patients., SNOT-22 will be assessed at baseline (V0), and each visit. V1 to V4 is within two weeks. V5 is one week after the fourth acupuncture, and V6 is two weeks later. There is no acupuncture during both V5 and V6.|nasal patency, Eccovision acoustic rhinometry (Hood Labs, Pembroke, USA) was used to measure the total nasal cavity volume (NCV) and minimum cross-sectional area (MCA). The ATMO 300 Rhinomanometer (ATMOS MedizinTechnikGmbH\&Co., Feldkirch, Germany) was used to measure the nasal airway resistance (NAR) by anterior active rhinomanometry., NCV, NAR and MCA will be assessed at baseline (V0), and each visit. V1 to V4 is within two weeks. V5 is one week after the fourth acupuncture, and V6 is two weeks after the fourth acupuncture.|neuropeptides in nasal secretions, The levels of neuropeptides; including substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) , neuropeptide Y (NPY)) will be analysed using ELISA., Nasal secretions can be obtained at each visit. V1 to V4 is within two weeks. V5 is one week later and V6 is two weeks later. There is no acupuncture during both V5 and V6.|inflammatory cytokines in nasal secretions, The levels of inflammatory cytokines; including interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-5, IL-8, IL-17A, and eotaxin in the supernatants will be analyzed using the Luminex System., Nasal secretions can be obtained at each visit. V1 to V4 is within two weeks. V5 is one week later and V6 is two weeks later. There is no acupuncture during both V5 and V6.|adverse events, Any adverse event following acupuncture was assessed by physicians and patients. Patients were instructed to record any unexpected signs, symptoms, and feelings during the entire trial period. the pain score will be recorded during V1-V4., adverse events will be recorded at V1 to V4. V1, V2, V3, and V4 is within two weeks. V5 is one week after fourth treatment and V6 is two weeks later. There is no acupuncture during both V5 and V6.
