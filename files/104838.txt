Study of Apatinib in RET Fusion Positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RET fusions are present in 1% to 2% of unselected population of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of RET tyrosine kinase show promising therapeutic effects in a non-small cell lung cancer patients. Apatinib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitors including RET fusions. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Apatinib in patients with RET fusion positive advanced NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib single agent arm
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate ORR every 6-8 weeks after initiation of apatinib, change from baseline in tumor size every 6-8 weeks after the initiation of apatinib, up to 24 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is evaluated in 24 months since the treatment began, 24 months|overall survival (OS), evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began, 24 months|Safety and Tolerability as measured by adverse events, Number of Participants with treatment related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 24 months|quality of life (QOL, measured by questionnaire), Change from baseline in Pain on the 11 point short pain scale (SPS-11), 24 months
To observe objective response rate (ORR) of apatinib in RET fusion positive pre-treated advanced NSCLC.

To observe Progression free survival （PFS）. To assess the overall survival (OS). To assess safety and tolerability. To evaluate quality of life. To explore the relationship between biomarkers and the toxicity/efficacy of apatinib.
