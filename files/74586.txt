A Phase III Study of Ivonescimab + Chemo With/Without AK117 vs Chemo in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of Ivonescimab plus chemotherapy with or without AK117 versus placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study seeks to determine whether the addition of Ivonescimab and/or AK117 improves clinical outcomes compared to standard chemotherapy alone. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Ivonescimab with/without AK117 or placebo, both in combination with chemotherapy.
