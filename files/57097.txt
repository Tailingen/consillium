Mid-transverse Process Combined With Erector Spinae Block Versus Paravertebral Plane Block
This study aims to compare efficacy of Mid-transverse process to pleura block combined with erector spinae block versus paravertebral plane block in cancer patients undergoing thoracotomy surgeries.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Mid-transverse process to pleura block combined with erector spinae block|PROCEDURE: paravertebral block
visual analogue score changes during rest and cough for the three groups., the score of visual analogue score, with minimum score of 0 and maximum of 10, with higher scores meaning more severe pain, for 24 hours postoperative
Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) application has also been used in recent years due to the lower incidence of side effects. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB)has been used as a part of multimodal analgesia in recent years. In ESPB is aimed to treat the postoperative pain of the thoracoabdominal region by injecting a local anesthetic into the interfacial area under the erector spinae muscle . ESPB creates an effect that covers the posterior and lateral thorax by affecting the dorsal rami and branches of the spinal nerves . Midtransverse process to pleura (MTP) block is less invasive as the position of the needle in this block is midway between the transverse process' posterior border and the pleura. Due to fenestrations present in the superior costotransverse ligament (SCTL), the drug reaches the paravertebral space
