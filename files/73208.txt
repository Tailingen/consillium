Perioperative FOLFIRI VS Adjuvant FOLFIRI in Resectable Advanced CRC Failed to Oxaliplatin
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most leading causes of cancer death in China. Although multiple treatment modalities including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been developed, the prognosis of advanced CRC still remains poor. While around 30% of resectable advanced CRC could be cured. This study is designed to compare perioperative FOLFIRI versus adjuvant FOLFIRI in resectable advanced CRC who exposed to oxaliplatin in open-label, phase III mode.
