MNPR-101-DFO*-89Zr Expanded Access Program (EAP) for Patients With Solid Tumor Cancer
The purpose of this Expanded Access Program (EAP) is to allow use of the investigational imaging agent, MNPR-101-DFO\*-89Zr, with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, to non-invasively detect the presence of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) binding in solid tumors. uPAR binding is higher in tumors compared to normal tissue in some cancers.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MNPR-101-DFO*-89Zr
Imaging agent MNPR-101-DFO\*-89Zr will be dosed to adult patients diagnosed with solid tumor cancer followed 3 to 5 days later by PET/CT imaging. The result will determine if there is sufficient uPAR binding, as assessed by the Investigator, to support administration of the companion intervention MNPR-101-PCTA-177Lu in a separate expanded access program (EAP IST-00Cb). The safety of MNPR-101-DFO\*-89Zr will be evaluated as will the amount of radioactivity present in blood samples.
