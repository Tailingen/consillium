Patients in each group will receive electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture during the first week of the chemotherapy cycle. They will receive self-acupressure or sham acupressure during the second and third weeks of the chemotherapy cycle. Participants will be asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L and FACT-B scales. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed.
