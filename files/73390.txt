Study of ONO-4538 in Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (TASUKI-52)
The purpose of study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ONO-4538 in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (ONO-4538 group) to placebo in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (placebo group) in chemotherapy-naïve subjects with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer unsuitable for radical radiation in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ONO-4538|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC), PFS (as assessed by the IRRC) will be calculated using the following formula : PFS (days) = "date when overall response is assessed as progressive disease (PD) or date of death (for any reason), whichever comes first" - "date of randomization" + 1. Please refer to the protocol, in this study, tumor response will be evaluated by CT, etc. according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately 32 months
Overall Survival (OS), Approximately 32 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR [as Assessed by the IRRC]), ORR represents the proportion of subjects whose best overall response was assessed as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Please refer to the protocol, in this study, tumor response will be evaluated by CT, etc. according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately 32 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR [as Assessed by the IRRC]), DCR represents the proportion of subjects whose best overall response was assessed as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). Please refer to the protocol, in this study, tumor response will be evaluated by CT, etc. according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately 32 months|Duration of Response (DOR [as Assessed by the IRRC]), The lower and upper limits of 95% CI for the median are censored value in the both groups., Approximately 32 months|Best Overall Response (BOR [as Assessed by the IRRC]), Approximately 32 months
