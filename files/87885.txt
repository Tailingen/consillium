GM1 Prophylaxis for Nab-paclitaxel-associated Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) in Patients With Breast Cancer
This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GM1 in preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer patients treated with Albumin-paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen.

This study was randomly divided into two groups at a ratio of 1:1, with 176 subjects in each group. All patients received GM1/ placebo treatment + chemotherapy.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of GM1 in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by albumin-paclitaxel chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the end of GM1 treatment in cycle 4 (C4D21), and the proportion of patients whose FACT/GOG-Ntx score changed by more than 12 points from baseline.
