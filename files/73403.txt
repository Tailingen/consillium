the Dissection of Lymph Node Posterior to Right Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve for Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
This study was completed in two stages. In the first stage, 2000 participants were enrolled according to the criteria. Following the principle of informed consent and voluntary consent of patients, the standard operation was "right or bilateral thyroidectomy + isthmus resection + right area VI lymph node dissection + left area VI lymph node dissection + lateral neck lymph node dissection". The age of participants, the size of right thyroid tumors, the invasion of the capsule and the number of lateral neck lymph node metastasis were counted to validate and improve the predictive model of lymph node posterior to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve in papillary thyroid cancer (Y=-0.029×age+0.771×tumor size+0.660×capsular invasion+1.331×right lateral lymph node metastasis-1.687, Y ≥0.16 means right recurrent laryngeal nerve posterior lymph node metastasis).

In the second stage, 2000 participants assessed by the model without posterior right recurrent laryngeal nerve metastasis were randomly divided into experimental group and control group according to the principle of informed consent and voluntary. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve posterior lymph nodes were not dissected in experimental group, while the right recurrent laryngeal nerve posterior lymph nodes were routinely dissected in control group. Through long-term follow-up and comparison of RFS and OS between the two groups, the investigators can scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of the "prediction model of lymph node posterior to right recurrent laryngeal nerve metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma", and seek evidence for accurate treatment of lymph node posterior to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve in thyroid papillary carcinoma.
Lymph Node Metastases
PROCEDURE: lymph node dissection
Recurrence of thyroid cancer, Participants will be followed from the operation to 20 year (maximum)
