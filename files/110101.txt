Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers
Background:

The human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause a number of cancers, including cervical and throat cancers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cancer. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.

Objective:

The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause HPV-related cancers to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.

Eligibility:

- Adults age 18-66 with HPV-related cancer who have a tumor that can be safely removed.

Design:

Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.

Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.

Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}

Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.

Number of Participants With an Objective Clinical Response, Patients must have a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) at least 4 months after cell infusion to count towards clinical response. Clinical response is assessed by the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum LD., 4 months after cell infusion
Number of Patients With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, Here is the number of serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned. A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence., 51 months and 18 days
Background:

* Metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated malignancies (cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal) are incurable and poorly palliated by standard therapies.
* Administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) generated from resected metastatic melanoma can induce objective long-term tumor responses.
* Young TIL can be generated from HPV-associated tumors.

Objectives:

* To determine if autologous Young TIL infused in conjunction with high dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen can mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent HPV-associated cancer.
* To study immunologic correlates associated with Young TIL therapy for HPV-associated cancers.
* To determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen.

Eligibility:

- Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent HIPV-16+ or HPV-18+ human papillomavirus-associated cancer.

Design:

* Patients will undergo biopsy or resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines.
* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day intravenous (IV)) on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine (25 mg/m(2)/day IV) on days -5 through -1.
* On day 0 patients will receive between 1 times 10 (9) to 2 times 10(11) young TIL and then begin high dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses).
* Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after TIL infusion.
* Initially, 18 evaluable patients will be enrolled in two cohorts; patients with cervical cancer and those with non- cervical cancer. For each cohort, if 0 to 2 of the 18 patients experience a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled. If 3 or more of the first 18 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 35 evaluable patients have been enrolled in each cohort. Up to 73 patients may be enrolled over approximately 3-4 years.
