AZD1775 for Advanced Solid Tumors
BACKGROUND:

* Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase involved in the phosphorylation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1/CDC2)-bound cyclin B, resulting in G2 cell cycle arrest in response to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage to allow time for DNA repair. Recent preclinical data additionally implicates Wee1 in maintenance of genomic integrity during S phase.
* Adavosertib (AZD1775) is a selective inhibitor of Wee1 kinase. Recent preclinical model data additionally show single agent anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts.
* Preliminary data show AZD1775 is tolerable at lower doses in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. We propose to demonstrate single-agent activity for AZD1775.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

* To establish the safety and tolerability of single-agent AZD1775 in patients with refractory solid tumors
* To determine the pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 in patients with refractory solid tumors

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the effect of AZD1775 on markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells
* To evaluate the antitumor activity of AZD1775 in patients with refractory solid tumors

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

-To identify tumor genomic alterations and gene expression patterns potentially associated with AZD1775 antitumor activity

ELIGIBILITY:

* Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which all standard therapy known to prolong survival have failed, or for which standard therapies do not exist.
* No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks or (5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) prior to entering the study.
* Adequate organ function

STUDY DESIGN:

* This study will follow a traditional 3+3 design.
* In Arm A starting at dose level 1, AZD1775 will be administered orally, twice a day (BID), for 5 doses (Day (D) 1-3) during each cycle. Starting at dose level 2 and onwards, AZD1775 will be administered orally, BID, for 5 doses for the first 2 weeks of each cycle (D1-3 and 8- 10). Each cycle is 21 days (+/- 1 day for scheduling).
* Once maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established, 6 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to further evaluate that dose for pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints.
* A further expansion arm of 6 additional patients with documented tumors harboring breast cancer type 1 or 2 (BRCA)-1 or -2 mutations will also be enrolled at the MTD to further explore the safety of the agent and obtain preliminary evidence of activity in this patient population.
* Based on preliminary evidence of drug activity in an alternative once-daily dosing schedule, patients without a documented BRCA mutation will be accrued to a once-daily dosing schedule Arm B, with mandatory paired tumor biopsies at the maximum tolerated single daily dose, to further evaluate PD endpoints. AZD1775 will be administered orally once daily for 5 days (D1-5 and 8-12) during weeks 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle (+/- 1 day for scheduling).
* During the escalation phase, tumor biopsies will be optional and will be evaluated for pharmacodynamic (PD) studies for evidence of Wee1 inhibition DNA damage and repair, and apoptosis (gamma H2A histone family member X (yH2AX), phosphorylated Nbs1 (pNbs1), Rad51, Rabbit polyclonal phospho-cyclin-dependent kinases (pTyr15-Cdk) and caspase 3). During the expansion phase, once MTD is reached, mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in up to 20 additional patients enrolled at the MTD to further evaluate PD endpoints.

DRUG: MK-1775 (AZD1775)
To Establish the Safety and Tolerability of Single-agent AZD1775 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors, Here is the number of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approx.19 mo/8 d for A1, 3 mo/28 d for A2, 10 mo/28 d for A3, 2 mo/14 d for A4, 20 mo/24 d for A5, 10 mo/23 d for A6, 4 mo/23 d for A7, 14 mo/11 d for A8, 15 mo/24 d for A9, and 77 mo/6 d for A10.|Establish the Safety and Tolerability of Single-agent AZD1775 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors, Adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Grade 1 is mild. Grade 2 is moderate. Grade 3 is severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening. Grade 4 is life-threatening., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approx.19 mo/8 d for A1, 3 mo/28 d for A2, 10 mo/28 d for A3, 2 mo/14 d for A4, 20 mo/24 d for A5, 10 mo/23 d for A6, 4 mo/23 d for A7, 14 mo/11 d for A8, 15 mo/24 d for A9, and 77 mo/6 d for A10.|To Determine the Pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors., Mean plasma concentration (± standard deviation) of AZD1775 at baseline and after AZD1775 administration., Pre-Treatment (Baseline) and Cycle 1 Days 1 and 3 (Arms 3 and 7) or Days 1 and 5 (Arms 1-2, 5-6, and 8)
To Evaluate the Antitumor Activity of AZD1775 in Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors, Objective Response is defined as a Complete Response + Partial Response and was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., 21 days
Number of Participants With a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as an adverse event that is related (possibly, probably, or definitely) to administration of MK-1775 (Adavosertib (AZD1775). Examples are Grade ≥ 3 non-hematological toxicity, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding, Grade 3 fatigue of greater than 1 week duration, and failure to tolerate 100% of the dosing in the first cycle will be considered a DLT, etc., First cycle (21 days) of treatment
