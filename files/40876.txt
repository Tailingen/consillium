The Safety, Feasibility and Oncological Outcomes of Laparoscopic Completion Total Gastrectomy for Remnant Gastric Cancer
This study aims to investigate the safety, feasibility, and long-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic completion total gastrectomy for remnant gastric cancer.
Remnant Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic completion total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy
Morbidity, The early postoperative complication are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery., 30 days
3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months|3-year overall survival rate, 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type, 36 months|Mortality, The early mortality are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery., 30days|Rates of combined organ resection, Combined organ resection performing by severe injury or abdominal adhesions, 1 day|Intraoperative morbidity rates, With the number of patients undergoing surgery as the denominator, the number of patients with any of the following intraoperative complications is calculated as numerator., 1 day|Number of retrieved lymph nodes, Number of retrieved lymph nodes, 1 day|Operation time, From skin incision to skin closure, 1 day|Postoperative recovery course, Including time to first flatus, time to initiation of solid food intake, time to removal of intra-abdominal drains, hospital stay, 10 days|Intraoperative blood loss, 1 day|Inflammatory and immune response and nutrional status, the values of hemoglobin, prealbumin, albumin, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count from peripheral blood before the operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded., 7 days|Textbook Outcome, Textbook outcome (TO) was defined based on review of existing TO metrics in the literature including outcomes such as complete-potentially curative status, no intraoperative complications, no eventful postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher), 15 lymph nodes(LNs) examined, hospital stay \< 21days, no reintervention (surgical, endoscopic or radiological) within 30 days after surgery, no readmission to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 30 days after surgery, no postoperative mortality within 30 days after surgery, and no hospital readmission within 30 days after discharge. When all nine desired health outcomes were realized, TO was achieved., 30 days|Technical performance, Technical performance were assessed by the Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS) and the Generic Error Rating Tool., 1 day|The Surgery Task Load Index (SURG-TLX), Surgeons were required to complete one modified SURG-TLX questionnaire for each procedure., 1 day
In 2005, since Yamada reported the first case of laparoscopic completion total gastrectomy (LCTG) for RGC, laparoscopic technology was widely used in the treatment of RGC. However, due to the low incidence and rapid aggravation of RGC, adhesion, anatomic changes, and more complex lymphatic pathways caused by the previous operation, the popularity of LCTG is limited. Therefore, higher level evidence is warranted to further confirm the safety, feasibility, and oncological outcomes of LCTG in patients with RGC. This prospective single-arm study is designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and long-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic completion total gastrectomy for remnant gastric cancer.
