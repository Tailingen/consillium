Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of AL2846 Capsule Combined With TQB2450 Injection Compared to Docetaxel Injection in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Have Failed With Immunotherapy.
To investigate the efficacy of AL2846 capsules in combination with TQB2450 injection or Docetaxel injection in patients with advanced NSCLC who have previously failed immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody), regardless of new anti-tumor treatment and early termination of treatment.
