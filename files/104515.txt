Clinical Application of PD-1 Inhibitor in Colorectal Cancer for Improving Survival
This trial is a single-center retrospective study. Eligible patients receiving PD-1 inhibitor treatment will enrolled.

In patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), curative surgery combined with chemotherapy ( FOLFOX or CAPOX regimens) has become the standard treatment. However, 20 to 30% of these patients will develop distant metastasis, which ultimately results in death. Oxaliplatin- and fluoropyrimidine-based doublet chemotherapy does not adequately meet the clinical need for tumor shrinkage and downstaging. There is an urgent need to explore drugs with different mechanisms of action in combination with chemotherapy to improve efficacy. Relatively few trials of preoperative therapy have been reported, In recent years, the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized cancer treatment. Given the limitations of current treatment strategies in achieving optimal clinical outcomes, this retrospective study aims to research the disease-free survival rates and overall survival (OS) in CRC patients using PD-1 inhibitors.
