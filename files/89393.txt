Early Administration of ATG Followed by Cyclophosphamide, Busulfan and Fludarabine Before a Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Patients With Hematological Cancer
RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin before the transplant and tacrolimus and methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving antithymocyte globulin together with cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and fludarabine works in treating patients with hematological cancer or kidney cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

OBJECTIVES:

* To assess the percentage of patients with hematological malignancies or renal cell carcinoma who achieve \> 90% donor T-cell chimerism at 30 days after treatment with reduced-intensity conditioning comprising low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin, low-dose cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and fludarabine phosphate followed by allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation from a matched related donor.
* To assess the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and extensive chronic GVHD in these patients.
* To assess whether this regimen is associated with reduced transplant-related toxicity and increased tolerability in these patients.
* To assess the overall safety of this conditioning regimen as measured by 6-month transplant-related mortality in these patients.
* To determine the efficacy of this regimen in inducing durable remissions in these patients.

OUTLINE:

* Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC): Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours on day -16 and over 6-8 hours on day -15, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3, busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -4 and -3, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day -2.
* Transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation on day 0.
* Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive oral tacrolimus every 12 hours on days -1 to 90, followed by a taper until day 150. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, and 6.

Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies of anti-thymocyte globulin and PCR analysis for chimerism.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
