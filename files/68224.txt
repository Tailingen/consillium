Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Liver Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The objective of the study is to investigate the long-term outcomes of minimally invasive liver surgery (robotic vs laparoscopic) for hepatocellular carcinoma patients of stage BCLC 0-A. Data from two tertiary centers for liver surgery will be retrospectively reviewed. Patients will be divided in two cohorts (robot; laparoscopy). The primary endpoint will be recurrence-free and overall survival; secondary endpoints were incidence, pattern, and treatment of recurrences.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Minimally invasive liver resection
Recurrence-free survival, Recurrence was dated at the first HCC detection on follow-up imaging., From the date of liver resection until the first documented HCC progression on follow-up imaging, assessed up to 116 months. The Minimum follow-up accepted was of 3 months postoperatively.|Overall survival, From the date of liver resection until the date of death for any cause or the last follow-up available whichever came first, assessed up to 116 months. The Minimum follow-up accepted was of 3 months postoperatively.
