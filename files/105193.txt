A Study of HB0025 Injection in Patients With Advanced Renal Cancer
It is a phase II open label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of HB0025 in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
Renal Cancer
DRUG: HB0025
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the number of patients were confirmed complete response(CR) and/or partial response(PR) according to RECIST 1.1 divided by the patients with at least one tumour evaluation., up to 24 mouths
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR defined as the number of patients were confirmed CR and/or PR and/or stable disease(SD) according to RECIST 1.1 divided by the patients with at least one tumour evaluation, up to 24 mouths|Progression-free Survival（PFS）, progression-free survival (PFS) means the time between the start of treatment and the onset of tumor progression or death from various causes., up to 24 mouths|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as time from the first record of CR or PR to the first record of tumor progression or death of subjects, up to 24 mouths|AUC, Area Under concentration-time Curve (AUC), up to 24 mouths|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), up to 24 mouths|Tmax, half-life time of maximum concentration, up to 24 mouths|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Using the ELISA method to detect the anti-drug antibody production in peripheral blood after HB0025 administration., up to 24 mouths|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug., up to 24 mouths|Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Parameters Reported as TEAEs, Participants with abnormal laboratory parameters reported as TEAEs are reported. Laboratory analysis included hematology, clinical chemistry, thyroid function tests, and urinalysis., up to 24 mouths|Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs and Physical Examination Reported as TEAEs, Participants with abnormal vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate) and physical examination reported as TEAEs are reported., up to 24 mouths|Number of Participants With Notable QTc Interval, Notable QTc intervals included single beat changes from baseline (Day 1) values (\> 30, \> 60, and \> 90 milliseconds). Participants who had notable QTc interval are reported., up to 24 mouths
The phase II study will enroll subjects with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who have progressing tumor after standard therapy and have no better treatment option.This study will set up 2 dose groups.HB0025 injection is administered once every 2 weeks.
