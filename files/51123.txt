Gemcitabine/Irinotecan/ZD1839 vs Paclitaxel/Carboplatin/Etoposide/ZD1839 in Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site
In this randomized trial, we will investigate the activity and toxicity of two active regimens, gemcitabine/irinotecan and paclitaxel/carboplatin/Etoposide (both followed by ZD1839) in the first-line treatment of patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site.
Neoplasms, Unknown Primary
DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Overall Survival (OS), the Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Death, Length of time, in months, that patients were alive from their first date of protocol treatment until death., 24 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), the Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Worsening of Their Disease, Length of time, in months, that patients were alive from their first date of protocol treatment until worsening of their disease, 12 months
Upon determination of eligibility, all patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

* Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Etoposide
* Irinotecan + Gemcitabine

Patients will be stratified by tumor location (liver/bone versus all others) and number of metastatic sites (one versus two or more). Patients with an objective response or stable disease after completion of chemotherapy will receive ZD1839 until disease progression. Patients who do not respond to chemotherapy may crossover to the other chemotherapy regimen and will receive ZD1839 if they have an objective response or stable disease. The study is not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
