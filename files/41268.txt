Prestoma-Trial for Parastomal Hernia Prevention
Prestoma Trial is designed to compare the safety and efficiency of three different meshes and techniques to prevent parastomal hernia after laparoscopic or robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma.
Rectal Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: Parietene Macro|DEVICE: Parietex Parastomal|DEVICE: Dynamesh IPST
Incidence of parastomal hernia, The primary outcome is incidence of parastomal hernia at 12 months follow up, detected clinically or on CT scan., 1 year
Surgical infections, Surgical infections due to primary surgery, defined by CDC (Centers for Disease Control) definition for surgical site infection., 30 days|Complications, The incidence of complications defined by Clavien-Dindo Classification, 30 days|Stoma related complications, Any complications related to stoma, 5 years|Reoperation rate, Reoperation needed for any reason related to previous surgery, 5 years|Operative time, Total time needed in operation theatre and time needed for mesh application, 30 days|Length of stay, Length of stay at the hospital., 30 days|Quality of Life measured by RAND 36, Quality of life measured by The RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 which assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perceptions with a scale 0-100, higher the score, better the quality of life., 5 years
Parastomal hernia after permanent colostomy formation is a common problem. The European Hernia Society recommends the use of prophylactic mesh when the stoma is constructed. So far, there're no trials comparing the methods to prevent the parastomal hernia.

Prestoma Trial is designed to compare the most researched retromuscular mesh (Parietene Macro by Medtronic) with two different types of intraperitoneal meshes (Parietex Parastomal by Medtronic and Dynamesh IPST) in parastomal hernia prevention after laparoscopic or robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma.
