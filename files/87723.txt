The Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Combined Anterior and Posterior Approach
The goal of this observational study was to compare the perioperative outcomes, postoperative urinary control rates and positive surgical margin (PSM) rates of the robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy combined anterior and posterior approach (AP-RARP) with the Retzius-sparing approach (RS-RARP) and anterior approach (anterior-RARP) in the treatment of prostate cancer. The main question it aims to answer was:

• The early therapeutic efficacy of the robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy combined anterior and posterior approach

Participants has been underwent:

* AP-RARP
* RS-RARP
* anterior-RARP Researchers compared the three groups to see if AP-RARP combines the advantages of anterior and posterior RARP and is a feasible surgical option for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Prostatectomy|Prostate Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: the robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
urinary continence, was defined as using 0-1 pad a day, 0-6 month after surgery|positive surgical margin, observed whether the tissue cutting in surgery has tumor cell in surgical margin by pathologist, 2 weeks after surgery
operating time, The start time of the operation refers to the time of incision of the skin at the surgical site. The end time of surgery refers to the time when the skin is sutured., the day of the surgery|intraoperative blood loss, Intraoperative bleeding was defined as the sum of blood content in blood gauze, blood content in negative pressure suction bottle and blood clot volume., the day of the surgery
