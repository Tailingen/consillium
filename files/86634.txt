Non-Invasive Plasma Treatment for Cervical Infections: Targeting High- and Low-Risk HPV Variants
This is a prospective, single-center, observational proof-of-principle clinical trial at the Department of Women's Health of the University Hospital TÃ¼bingen.
HPV Infection|Cervical Cancer
OTHER: Cold physical Plasma|OTHER: Control group
HPV eradication rate, In the following intervention study, participants will be tested for HPV infection before and after NIPP treatment., 3-6 months
Correlation of HPV Genotyping, HPV genotyping is crucial for identifying specific viral strains. Correlation studies will be performed via obtained datasets and the application of statistical methods to identify associations among different HPV genotypes. The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the virus, guide health interventions, and improve clinical management strategies related to HPV infections., During the study (12-24 months)|HPV-Quality-of-Life (HPV-QoL), The HPV-Quality-of-Life (HPV-QoL) questionnaire is developed to determine the impact of HPV infection and related interventions on women health-related quality-of-life., During the study (12-24 months)|Tissue Tolerance and Compatibility of NIPP Treatment, Cold plasma generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, electric fields, and other biologically active components that can interact with biological tissues. Assessing tissue tolerance and compatibility will be crucial for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of cold plasma treatment., During the study (12-24 months)|Detection of Intracellular Molecular Plasma Mechanisms, The detection of intracellular molecular plasma mechanisms refers to the identification and study of processes and mechanisms that take place within cells through the interaction with so-called plasma, especially cold plasma. The detection of intracellular molecular plasma mechanisms refers to the identification and study of processes that take place within cells through the interaction with plasma, especially cold plasma. Interaction of cold plasma with cellular mechanisms will be studied via routine molecular biological methodology., During the study (12-24 months)
The aim of this study is to investigate the HPV (Human papillomavirus)-eradicating efficacy of NIPP (non-invasive physical plasma) in patients with confirmed HPV infection but without cervical dysplasia. Another objective is to examine cellular/molecular/immunological effects of NIPP on the cervix through molecular biological methods following in-vivo treatment. Tissue samples will be obtained at defined intervals via minibiopsy, and analyses will be conducted using molecular biological, histological, and microscopic methods, potentially in collaboration with other research institutes.
