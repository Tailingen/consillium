Sequential Regimen of Bendamustin-Debulking Followed by Obinutuzumab, Acalabrutinib and Venetoclax in Patients with Relapsed/refractory CLL
CLL2-BAAG is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen of debulking with bendamustine followed by induction and maintenance with GA101 (obinutuzumab), acalabrutinib (ACP-196) and venetoclax (ABT-199) in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia
DRUG: Bendamustine|BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab|BIOLOGICAL: Acalabrutinib|BIOLOGICAL: Venetoclax
Negativity rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood (PB) measured by 4-color flow cytometry, MRD negativity is defined as less than one (1) CLL-cell among 10,000 leukocytes analyzed \[0.01%\], i.e. \< 10-4. The MRD negativity rate is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved MRD negativity based on the full analysis set (FAS)., At final restaging (RE): 12 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle
Overall response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients having achieved a complete response (CR), a CR with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi), or a partial response(PR) as best response., At final restaging (RE): 12 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle|CR / CRi rate, Proportion of patients having achieved a CR or CRi as best response, At final restaging (RE): 12 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle|MRD in PB measured by 4-color flow cytometry at different times: At screening, after debulking, 4-weekly during induction, at initial response assessment (after 6 induction cycles), at RE, every 12 weeks during maintenance and follow up., MRD negativity is defined as less than one (1) CLL-cell among 10,000 leukocytes analyzed \[0.01%\], i.e. \< 10-4. MRD values will be categorized into negative (\<10-4) and positive (â‰¥10-4), From date of screening until the end of follow-up, up to 40 month.|Safety: Adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of particular interest (AEPI), Type, frequency, and severity of AEs, SAEs and AESIs and their relationship to study treatment., up to 40 months after first dose of study drug
In the CLL2-BAAG trial will be included a total of 46 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL in need of treatment.This trial will evaluate a debulking with two cycles bendamustine (only for patients with a higher tumor load), followed by an induction and a maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab, acalabrutinib and venetoclax in patients with re-lapsed/refractory CLL. The duration of maintenance treatment is depending on MRD levels. This trial combines one old (chemotherapy) and three novel, synergistic (antibody, BTK-inhibitor and Bcl-2 antagonist) principles of action in order to achieve deep and long lasting remissions with a short duration of treatment. Additionally, this trial has an extensive accompanying scientific program aiming at a better understanding of the kinetics of response and clonal evolution of CLL.
