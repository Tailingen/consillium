Pharmacology-driven Dosing of Fluoropyrimidines in Cancer Patients
The fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and capecitabine (Cp) are among the most commonly used anticancer drugs. Still, there is much controversy about the correct dosing, and the fact that a minority of patients experience severe, sometimes even lethal toxicity following treatment. One important factor predisposing patients to severe toxicity is deficiency in the 5FU-catabolic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Our group identified 4 DPD risk alleles in over 300 Swiss cancer patients, that resulted in a 8-times increased risk of experiencing severe toxicity from 5FU or Cp. In patients receiving 5FU as a continuous infusion, there are accumulating data that keeping the AUC of 5FU between 20-30 mg\*h/L is beneficial in terms of treatment toxicity and activity. In this study, patients carrying at least 1/4 DPD risk alleles will receive a 50% dose reduction of either 5FU or Cp, with the potential of later dose increases in the abscence of severe toxicity. Additionally, patients receiving i.v. 5FU will undergo therapeutic drug monitoring at the end of the 2-day continuous infusion, with subsequent dose adaptations to target a 5FU AUC of 20-30 mg\*h/L. The primary study objective is to reduce the incidence of severe treatment-related toxicity from 13% (in historical controls) to 5% in study patients.

Predefined fluoropyrimidine-related (index) toxicity, Index toxicity is defined as follows:

* All adverse events CTC grades ≥3, including myelosuppression but excluding nausea and vomiting (that is often due to concurrent platinum drug treatment)
* Fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity CTC grade ≥2, including mucositis, dehydration, hand-foot syndrome
* Diarrhea CTC grade ≥2 lasting for \>/=5 days or an increase of 2 CTC grades in case of preexisting diarrhea. Diarrhea should not be evaluated in patients with a colostomy, After 6 weeks of fluoropyrimidine-based treatment
Area-under-the plasma-concentration time curve of 5-fluorouracil, AUC of 5FU as derived from 5FU steady-state plasma concentrations, taken 2 hours before the planned end of the continuous drug infusion. 5FU target AUC is defined as within the range of 20-30 mg•h/L, at 8 weeks|Endogenous dihydrouracil/uracil ratio in plasma, Endogenous UH2 to U ratio as analysed at the time of PK sampling of 5FU or Cp, and repeated for each treatment cycle., at start of each treatment cycle|Objective treatment response (best response) according to RECIST v.1.1, Objective treatment response according to the RECIST criteria v1.1 is assessed in all patients, end of first-line treatment|Progression-free survival, Defined as the time interval between start of study treatment and disease progression or death, whatever comes first., time of disease progression or death
