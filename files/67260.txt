PDR001 in Combination With Bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 as First Line Therapy in Patients With Metastatic MSS Colorectal Cancer
This was a phase Ib study of PDR001 in combination with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 as first line therapy in patients with metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. The study was to have assessed primarily, the safety and tolerability and then the efficacy of PDR001 in combination with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6. Particular attention would have been paid to the level of activity of study drug combinations in CMS4 patients (retrospective analysis).

The study was terminated early due to company decision.
