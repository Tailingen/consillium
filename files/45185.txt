This is an open-label, multiple-centre, single dose clinical trial to assess the PK of a single oromucosal dose of Sativex in subjects with advanced cancer who are currently on background Step III opioid therapy.

A minimum of 25 subjects ≥18 years with advanced cancer will be needed for the assessment of the primary objective of the trial. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be performed within -10 to -2 days prior to dosing. For the Screening Visit, subjects will attend on an outpatient basis.

Subjects will be checked into the clinical research facility on Day -1 and will be confined to the clinical research facility for the Inpatient/Treatment Period (Day -1 to Day 3) (Visit 2). Subjects will be administered a single oromucosal dose of Sativex on Day 1 (time \[t\]=0). Fourteen PK blood samples will be taken from Day 1 to Day 3 during Visit 2: one predose sample and 13 postdose samples at the following time points after dosing: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose.

Subjects will be discharged from the clinical research facility after the 48-hour PK blood sample has been taken and final safety assessments are completed. Subjects who discontinue from the trial prior to the completion of the PK blood draws will undergo the safety evaluations scheduled for Day 3.

The Safety Follow-up Call (Visit 3) will be made 7 (+2) days after dosing on Day 1. Subjects with any new adverse events (AEs) or clinical laboratory abnormalities will be asked to return for safety follow-up.

The expected duration for trial participation (including Screening Visit, Inpatient/Treatment Period, and Safety Follow-up Call) for each individual subject is a maximum of 19 days.
