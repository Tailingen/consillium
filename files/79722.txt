Bortezomib and Filgrastim to Promote Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma
This clinical trial studies peripheral blood hemapoietic stem cell mobilization with the combination of bortezomib and G-CSF (filgrastim) in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.

DRUG: bortezomib|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|PROCEDURE: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
>= 2 Fold Increase in Circulating PBSC's, Participants with \>= 2 fold increase in circulating PBSC's in blood and in apheresis collections in up to 4-days collection, Up to 6 months
Time to Neutrophil Engraftment, Estimated Median Time to Neutrophil Engraftment, ANC 500, Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate if addition of Bortezomib to the mobilization protocol will result with an increase in the levels of circulating peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) by at least 2-fold in blood and in the apheresis collections in up to 4-days collection protocol.

II. To assess whether time to neutrophil engraftment is 12 days or less, the historical value.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test for co-mobilization of lymphoma or myeloma cells by bortezomib and G-CSF using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients and by flow cytometry (cluster of differentiation \[CD\]38+/CD138+ cell) for multiple myeloma (MM) patients.

II. To determine the effect of Bortezomib on the extent of mobilization of dendritic cells subsets, plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)1 and pDC2 and DC1/DC2 ratio by flow cytometry.
