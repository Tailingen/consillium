4-aminopyridine Treatment for Nerve Injury
To evaluate the role of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on the course of recovery after peripheral nerve traction and/or crush injury. This study aims to test the hypothesis that 4-aminopyridine speeds the often slow and unpredictable recovery after peripheral nerve traction and/or crush injuries.

To evaluate the role of 4-AP on the recovery of nerve function we will be giving patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RP) either 4-AP or placebo in the perioperative period. This population of patients was selected as nerve crush injury during RP is thought to contribute to erectile dysfunction and urinary continence post operatively.
