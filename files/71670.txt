Gene Mutation in Samples From Young Patients With Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Syndrome at Risk for Developing Cancer
RATIONALE: The identification of gene mutations in young patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma syndrome may allow doctors to better understand the genetic processes involved in the development of some types of cancer, and may also help doctors identify patients who are at risk for cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study studies gene mutations in samples from young patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma syndrome at risk for developing cancer.

Relationship between DICER1 mutations and tumor pathogenesis in cystic nephromas and cystic partially differentiated nephroblastomas outside of families with PPB nephroblastomas
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if DICER1 mutations contribute to tumor pathogenesis in cystic nephromas and cystic partially differentiated nephroblastomas outside of families with pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) syndrome.

OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for DICER1 mutation by qPCR and directly sequenced using BigDye Terminator chemistry. Results are then compared against the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database.
