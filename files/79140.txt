Trial of Intravenous Fenretinide Emulsion for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas
This study addresses the hypothesis that intermittent treatment with fenretinide intravenous emulsion will induce objective responses in patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) who have failed at least one prior systemic therapy and will result in acceptable toxicities.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Fenretinide
Objective response rate, Objective tumor responses will be measured and recorded during the two weeks following the completion of the drug infusion of every even-numbered treatment cycle until the patient is removed from the study.
Safety and tolerability profile will be assessed by adverse events which will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03., monitored from start of initial therapy until 30 days after the patient is removed from study therapy.
This is an open-label, multicenter, single arm efficacy and safety study in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, who have failed at least one prior system therapy.

Approximately 140 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with fenretinide (4-HPR) intravenous emulsion administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days, once every 3 weeks until there is disease progression or unmanageable treatment-related toxicities.

The primary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Responses will be categorized using criteria established by the International Harmonization Project on Lymphoma. Safety will be evaluated during the study and for 30 days after the last administration of study drug. Adverse events and laboratory studies will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03.
