A Study of Simmitinib Plus Irinotecan in Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of simmitinib plus irinotecan liposome in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and to evaluate the PK of the drug and the correlation between biomarkers and clinical efficacy of simmitinib plus irinotecan liposome.

The experiment was divided into two stages. The first stage is dose escalation stage. Rapid titration and "3+3" dose escalation design were used to observe DLT of simmitinib plus irinotecan liposome, and MTD was determined. The second stage is a randomized controlled study. After RP2D was determined in the first stage, participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, including simmitinib plus irinotecan liposome, irinotecan liposome, and irinotecan.
