A Study of Aneustat (OMN54) in Patients With Advanced Cancer and Lymphomas
This is a phase I, open-label, multiple dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Aneustat™ (OMN54), a novel therapy, administered orally in patients with advanced cancer and lymphomas.
Neoplasms
DRUG: Aneustat (OMN54)
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of two dosing regimens (once daily and twice daily), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose, based on data from 6 patients (or 5 patients if one patient has withdrawn due to non-Aneustat (OMN54) related reasons), below the non-tolerated dose (DL T).|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of two dosing regimens (once daily and twice daily), Assessment per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.|Plasma blood concentrations of chemical markers, These measurements are intended to characterize the pharmacokinetics of Aneustat (OMN54)
Tumor Response, Tumor response as per RECIST criteria version 1.1, and tumor markers in plasma, as applicable|Measurement of pathway biomarkers in plasma, Plasma concentrations of cancer-related proteins to help characterize Aneustat (OMN54) activity
Patients who complete a 28-day cycle, may be eligible to continue receiving Aneustat™ (OMN54) in 4-week increments for up to 6 cycles (inclusive of cycle 1) if further treatment is judged to be of possible benefit; if patient has not experienced unacceptable toxicity; and no study withdrawal criteria has been met.
