A Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Sonrotoclax Plus Zanubrutinib Compared With Placebo Plus Zanubrutinib in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The goal of this study is to compare how well sonrotoclax plus zanubrutinib works versus zanubrutinib plus placebo in treating adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This study will also look at the safety of sonrotoclax plus zanubrutinib versus zanubrutinib plus placebo.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma|B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Sonrotoclax|DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 49 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause., Approximately 92 months|PFS as assessed by investigator (INV), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 66 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by BIRC and by INV, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), per Lugano 2014 criteria., Approximately 66 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as assessed by BIRC and by INV, DOR is defined as the time from the first qualifying response to the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 66 months|Complete Response Rate (CRR) as assessed by BIRC and by INV, CRR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of CR., Approximately 66 months|Time to first response as assessed by BIRC and by INV, Time to first response is defined as time from the date of randomization to first response., Approximately 66 months|Time to initiation of new anticancer therapy, Time to initiation of new anticancer therapy is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of new anticancer therapy., Approximately 66 months|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma High Grade Module 29 (EORTC-QLQ-NHL-HG29), Patient-reported symptom burden as measured by the EORTC-QLQ-NHL-HG29 questionnaire. The EORTC-QLQ-NHL-HG29 is the NHL-aggressive module of QLQ-C30; and it consists of 5 scales: Symptom burden due to disease and/or treatment (7 items), Neuropathy (2 items), Physical condition/Fatigue (5 items), Emotional impacts (4 items), and Worries/Fears health and functioning (11 items). Items are rated using a 4-point response scale ("not at all," "a little," "quite a bit," and "very much"). A higher score for all the multi-item scales and items represents a higher level of symptomatology or problems., Approximately 66 months|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), Patient-reported physical condition/fatigue as measured by global health status (GHS) and physical function as measured by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-30 contains 30 questions that incorporate 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The participant answers questions about their health during the past week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where 1 =Not at all (best) to 4 =Very Much (worst) and 2 questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1 =Very poor (worst) to 7 =Excellent (best)., Approximately 66 months|Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Number of participants with TEAEs, including laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiogram results, and physical examination findings, graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 30 days after the last dose; up to approximately 66 months
