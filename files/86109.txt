Digital Patient Education Platform in Head and Neck Cancer
Head and neck cancer is a disease that has a particular propensity for treatment-related morbidity. It is hypothesized that patients who are more involved in their care in hospital and who are actively provided with more treatment-related education may report increased satisfaction and have improved overall outcomes. The investigators aim to determine whether delivery of patient-centred education in a multimedia format via a digital platform has an impact on overall satisfaction and perceived quality of medical care.
