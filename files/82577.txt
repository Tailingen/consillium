Trial of FOLF(HA)Iri With Cetuximab in mCRC
As an approach to improve efficacy and provide clinical benefit to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment regimens, Alchemia Oncology has developed a novel means for delivering anti-cancer agents to tumours. The drug delivery platform is based on the use of hyaluronic acid (HA), a novel excipient, in which, formulation with HA results in optimisation of cytotoxic drug uptake and retention within solid tumours. In the specific example of HA-Irinotecan, this new formulation of irinotecan has demonstrated enhanced efficacy in both nonclinical and early clinical studies.

The current study is an investigation into the use of HA-Irinotecan in a Phase II single arm trial of FOLF(HA)iri plus cetuximab in irinotecan-na誰ve second line patients with KRAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer. The study objectives are to confirm the safety and efficacy of FOLF(HA)iri plus cetuximab as second-line therapy in irinotecan-na誰ve metastatic colorectal cancer patients.

It is expected that the study recruit approximately 40-50 patients in 1 year with subsequent treatment and follow up; thus the trial will run for approximately 2-3 years.
