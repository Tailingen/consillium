A Study of ILB2109 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ia study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ILB2109, a A2a receptor antagonist, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ILB2109
The Incidence of DLTs, The incidence rate of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), At the end of Cycle 0 and 1 (Cycle 0 is 3 days, Cycle 1 is 21 days)|MTD, Determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for subsequent studies, 30 Months|RD, Determining the Recommended Dose (RD) for subsequent studies, 30 Months
Safety Outcomes, Determining the incidence rate, type and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Event (TESAE), and lab abnormalities (hematology and major organ function lab tests) based on NCI-CTCAE 5.0;, From Informed Consent to 28 days after the last dose, expected follow-up period 6 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), n tumor treatment, the proportion of patients whose tumor volume has shrunk to a predetermined value and can be maintained for a certain period of time. It includes the proportion of patients with complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) to the total number of evaluable cases., Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from randomization of patients to the onset of disease progression., Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), The time from randomization to death for any reason, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|1-Year OS, The probability of a survival time of 1 year after treatment for this disease, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|Time To Response (TTR), Time from the start of treatment to the first objective tumor response, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|Duration Of Response (DOR), The time from response to progression/death, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|Clinical Benefit Response (CBR), The total percentage of patients who achieved a complete response, partial response, or had stable disease for 6 months or more., Tumor assessment every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) until disease progression, expected follow-up period 6 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Characterize the single-dose and multiple-dose plasma concentration of ILB2109, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified time points in Cycles 0, 1 and 2 (Cycle 0 is 3 days, Cycles 1&2 each is 21 days)|Area Under the plasma drug concentration-time Curve (AUC), Characterize the single-dose and multiple-dose plasma concentration of ILB2109, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified time points in Cycles 0, 1 and 2 (Cycle 0 is 3 days, Cycles 1&2 each is 21 days)
Plasma Concentration of Downstream Signaling Protein, Characterize the relationship between the plasma concentration of ILB2109 and the level of a downstream signaling protein to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ILB2109., Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified time points in Cycles 0 and 1 (Cycle 0 is 3 days, Cycle 1 is 21 days)
This is a two-part study consists of dose escalation and dose expansion. The dose escalation part adopts a 3+3 protocol design and consists of 5 cohorts. Based on the data obtained from the escalation study, selected cohorts will be expanded to further investigate the safety and efficacy of the study drug. The escalation part consists of a single-dose cycle (Cycle 0) followed by multiple-dose cycles (Cycle 1 and above). Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy outcomes at pre-specified time points.
