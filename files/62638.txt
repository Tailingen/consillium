A First-in-human (FIH) Combination Treatment Study With a Single Dose Level of BMC128
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BMC128 in combination with nivolumab (a known immunotherapy) in order to investigate if administration of select elements of the intestinal microbiome may serve as a novel and effective means of improving the efficacy of anti-cancer immunotherapies.

DRUG: BMC128|DRUG: Nivolumab
Number and severity of drug-related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Safety and tolerability assessments will be based on frequency, severity, and duration of treatment-related AEs, including clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs, ECOG, and safety laboratory tests. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be graded using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0 or higher)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
The clinical effects of combined BMC128 and nivolumab treatment, Objective response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of patients who achieved partial response (PR) and complete response (CR), per iRECIST.

Clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of patients who achieved PR, CR or stable disease (SD) for 6 months or more, per iRECIST.

Duration of response (DoR) defined as time from response to progression or death, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
This phase 1, first-in-human, proof-of-concept, open-label, combination treatment study is designed to profile the safety and tolerability of BMC128 in combination with Nivolumab, its effect on the intestinal microbiome and the anti-tumor immune and inflammatory responses and its preliminary anti-tumor activity. A 14-day induction phase, in which patients will be treated with a single dose level of BMC128, will be initiated, followed by four 28-day treatment cycles of BMC128 in combination with Nivolumab. Thereafter, patients will be treated with Nivolumab as a monotherapy for up to 22 additional cycles, until disease progression (PD) or intolerable toxicity
