A Study of Repotrectinib in Combination With Other Anticancer Therapies for the Treatment of Subjects With KRAS-Mutant Solid Tumors
A Phase 1b/2 Study of Repotrectinib in Combination with Other Anticancer Therapies for the Treatment of Subjects with KRAS-Mutant Advanced Solid Tumors (TRIDENT-2)
KRAS Mutation-Related Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: TPX-0005|DRUG: Trametinib
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities, Number of participants with first cycle DLTs to determine Mean Tolderable Dose (MTD) and/or RP2D.

A DLT is defined as an adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications that meets the criteria defined in each subprotocol.

The MTD is defined as the highest dose level of repotrectinib given in combination with other anticancer therapy observed to cause a DLT in fewer than 33% of the treated subjects in the first treatment cycle (i.e., Cycle 1)., From initial dose to end of first cycle of treatment, approximately 28 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Assessed the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1., The ORR will be defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). A confirmed response is a response that persists on a repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. Participants with a confirmed objective response (CR or PR) will be referred to as responders.

Radiographic confirmation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) or disease progression will be based on RECIST v1.1. The ORR will be reported as the percentage of responders by RECIST v1.1 along with the corresponding two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson exact CI.

Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR) = \>=30% decrease in the sum diameters of target lesions., From screening to end of treatment approximately 10 months|Cmax of Repotrectinib, Cmax is defined as maximum plasma concentration of the drug., At Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 22|Tmax of Repotrecitinib, Tmax is defined is the time to maximum plasma concentration, At Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 22|AUC 0-24 of Repotrecitinib, Area under the plasma concentration time-curve. AUC from time 0 to 24 hours after dose., At Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 22|Cmax of Trametinib, Cmax is defined as maximum plasma concentration of the drug., At Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 22|Tmax of Trametinib, Tmax is defined is the time to maximum plasma concentration, At Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 22|AUC 0-24 of Trametinib, Area under the plasma concentration time-curve. AUC from time 0 to 24 hours after dose., At Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 22
Phase 1 Dose Escalation: To evaluate tolerability of repotrectinib at increasing dose levels in combination with other anticancer therapies for the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS-mutant solid tumors

Phase 2 Efficacy Evaluation: Investigate the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of repotrectinib in combination with other anticancer therapies for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS-mutant solid tumors.
