Phase I/II Study of U3-1402 in Subjects With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3) Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, three-part, multiple-dose study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of U3-1402 in patients with HER3-positive metastatic breast cancer. HER3 is a unique member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor, which defines a certain type of cancer.

The number of patients and treatment cycles are not fixed in this study. Subjects who continue to derive clinical benefit from the study treatment in the absence of withdrawal of consent, progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or death may continue the study treatment until the end of the trial.

Number of Participants Reporting Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), AEs will be collected systematically from signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through 28 days after last dose, Baseline up to 28 days post last dose, up to approximately 9 months|Number of Participants With Best Overall Tumor Response Using Blinded Independent Central Review Based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, CR was defined as a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target and non-target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target and non-target lesions. Objective response rate is the number of patients with confirmed complete response and confirmed partial response., From screening until disease progresses, up to approximately 9 months
