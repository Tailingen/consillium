Fosbretabulin or Placebo in Combination With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of fosbretabulin given with chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) compared to placebo given with chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) in subjects with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). The primary objective of the study is to determine overall survival. A maximum of 300 subjects will be recruited from approximately 75 multinational sites of which approximately 35 will be located in the United States.
Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Fosbretabulin + paclitaxel + carboplatin|DRUG: Placebo + paclitaxel + carboplatin
Overall survival, Maximun length of study for each subject is 2 years from date of randomization
Number of adverse events of the combination of fosbretabulin + paclitaxel + carboplatin, Maximun length of study for each subject is 2 years from date of randomization|Number of participants with 1-year survival, Maximun length of study for each subject is 2 years from date of randomization
Determine the proportion of subjects with measurable disease who have objective tumor response, by treatment, Maximun length of study for each subject is 2 years from date of randomization
The Treatment Plan followed for all subjects will consist of:

* A Screening Visit within 14 days before study drug (fosbretabulin or placebo) administration
* A Treatment Phase of 21-day combination treatment (study drug plus chemotherapy) cycles (up to 6 cycles)
* An End of Treatment Phase assessment
* An End of Study Visit occurring 30 days after the last day of study drug administration, as able

After the last clinic visit, all subjects will be followed for survival by monthly phone calls, email, or in-person.
