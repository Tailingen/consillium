A Feasibility Study to Determine Whether the Botanical Garden Become a Region of Forest Therapy for Cancer Survivors
The forest healing system is an important topic of alternative therapy in recent years. To investigates forest therapy's effectiveness in alleviating negative emotions among post-cancer patients. It compares therapy outcomes at Taipei Botanical Garden and Fushan Botanical Garden. Utilizing a pretest-posttest experimental design, a two-hour guided forest healing activity serves as the intervention method. Data collection involves instrumental tests and saliva samples.

Introduction:

Cancer's global impact persists, ranking among the top three causes of death in Taiwan. Despite improved survival rates after cancer surgery, negative emotions among patients remain a challenge. Post-cancer depression adversely affects treatment outcomes and overall quality of life. Forest therapy, a natural healing approach, has gained attention for its potential to reduce stress, mitigate negative emotions, and enhance well-being.

Objectives:

This study investigates forest therapy's effectiveness in alleviating negative emotions among post-cancer patients. It compares therapy outcomes at Taipei Botanical Garden and Fushan Botanical Garden. Additionally, the study explores the lasting emotional benefits of forest therapy.

Methods:

Utilizing a pretest-posttest experimental design, this study is conducted at the Botanical Garden in Fushan, Taipei. Participants are cancer patients who are six months post-treatment. A two-hour guided forest healing activity serves as the intervention method. Data collection involves instrumental tests and saliva samples. A comparable location adjacent to Taipei Botanical Garden, excluding urban areas, is selected for comparison activities. Portable heart rhythm monitors track data, and saliva samples are analyzed for salivary α-amylase enzyme kinetics and cortisol concentrations. The study employs questionnaires including the Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition-Adult short (POMS2-A short), Beck Depression Inventory-Second edition (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the abbreviated Taiwan version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF).
