Study of Tcelna (Imilecleucel-T) in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Tcelna (imilecleucel-T, autologous T-Cell Immunotherapy) is effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).
Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System|Multiple Sclerosis|Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis|Disease Progression|Brain Atrophy
BIOLOGICAL: Tcelna|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Brain Atrophy, The percentage of brain volume change (atrophy) as measured on 24 month MRIs calculated by the central MRI facility., 2 Years
Disease Progression, The percentage of subjects with sustained progression with definitions of sustained effect at 3 months and 6 months., 2 Years
Subjects whose myelin reactive T-cell can be identified by EPA will are randomized and provide blood to manufacture Tcelna. Approximately 5 weeks after receipt of the subject's whole blood procurement, the subjects will receive either Tcelna or placebo and will complete baseline assessments and will receive study treatments at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 (Visits 3-7), totaling 5 doses in year one.

Approximately one month prior to the Week 52 visit a second blood procurement will be performed and the subject will receive the second series of treatments as received in the first year study schedule. Subjects will be evaluated for changes in disability and cognitive function every 3 months, and radiographic changes annually.
