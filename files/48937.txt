Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma
The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety of Pembrolizumab and Temozolomide in treating recurrent glioblastoma and to characterize the effect of this treatment on the participants tumor and immune system..
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab and Temozolomide
Treatment toxicity, Quantification of the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab and Temozolomide with gross total resection of recurrent glioblastoma., Change in frequency of adverse events prior to gross total resection or recurrent glioblastoma
Overall Survival, Progression and response to treatment will be determined using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria., Every 8 weeks for 24 months|Neurologic function and quality of life, Using the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-oncology (NANO) scale on each visit. In addition, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be monitored., Every 8 weeks for 24 months|Treatment Toxicity, Quantification of the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab and Temozolomide after gross total resection of recurrent glioblastoma., Change in frequency of adverse events after gross total resection or recurrent glioblastoma
Participants will undergo screening tests to determine if they are eligible to participate. This will involve a complete history and physical examination, vital signs, blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), and serum chemistry (CMP).

Participants will receive one cycle of Temozolomide and Pembrolizumab prior to removing recurrent tumor, followed by three weekly cycles of treatment until progression.
