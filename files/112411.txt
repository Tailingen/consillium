Olaparib Treatment in BRCA Mutated Ovarian Cancer Patients After Complete or Partial Response to Platinum Chemotherapy
A Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study to assess the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy in relapsed high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients (including patients with primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube cancer) or high grade endometrioid cancer with BRCA mutations (documented mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that is predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function)) who have responded following platinum based chemotherapy.

Assessments then per local practice every 12 wks until second progression. Assessed until 19Sep2016 DCO (16Jan2017 DCO for China Cohort); up to a max of 36 mths|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by the the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O), To compare the effects of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as assessed by the trial outcome index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O) in BRCA mutated relapsed ovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partial response following platinum based chemotherapy. The TOI ranges from 0-100 and a higher score indicates a higher HRQoL., Questionnaires completed by patient at baseline, Day 29 and then every 12 weeks for 12 months. Assessed until 19 Sep 2016 DCO.|Efficacy of Olaparib by Time to First Subsequent Therapy or Death (TFST), To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomization to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST)., Time elapsed from randomization to first subsequent therapy or death. Assessed every 12 weeks following treatment discontinuation. Assessed until 03 Feb 2020 DCO; up to a maximum of 75 months.|Efficacy of Olaparib by Time to Second Subsequent Therapy or Death (TSST), To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomization to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST)., Time elapsed from randomization to second subsequent therapy or death. Assessed every 12 weeks following treatment discontinuation. Assessed until 03 Feb 2020 DCO; up to a maximum of 75 months.|Efficacy of Olaparib by Time From Randomization to Study Treatment Discontinuation or Death (TDT), To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomization to study treatment discontinuation or death (TDT)., Time elapsed from randomization to study treatment discontinuation or death. Assessed until 03 Feb 2020 DCO; up to a maximum of 75 months.|Efficacy in Patients With a Deleterious or Suspected Deleterious Variant in Either of the BRCA Genes by Assessment of PFS., To assess efficacy of olaparib in patients identified as having a deleterious or suspected deleterious variant in either of the BRCA genes using variants identified with current and future BRCA mutation assays (gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis)., Radiologic scans performed at baseline then every ~12 weeks for the first 72 weeks, then every ~24 weeks thereafter, assessed until disease progression. Assessed until 19 Sep 2016 DCO.|To Determine the Exposure to Olaparib by Pharmacokinetic Analysis, To determine the exposure to olaparib in patients receiving olaparib maintenance monotherapy, Pharmacokinetics sampling to be performed in a subset of patients.

Comparison of olaparib against a placebo in patients with ovarian cancer whose cancer has already improved by taking platinum based chemotherapy. The patients must also have a fault in their DNA which codes for the BRCA protein. The BRCA protein helps mend broken DNA in the cells of the body; if this protein doesn't work properly it can increase the chance of getting cancer. The aim of this study is to see whether patients taking olaparib tablets last longer until their cancer gets worse, compared to those taking the placebo tablet. The study is also looking to see if there is an overall improvement to how long the patients survive whilst taking olaparib tablets compared to the placebo tablets; and the quality of their life whilst living with ovarian cancer.
