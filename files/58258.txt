Observational Basket Trial to Collect Tissue to Train and Validate a Live Tumor Diagnostic Platform
The primary objective of this study is to determine the ex-vivo prognostic accuracy of the Cybrid live tumor diagnostic platform across a basket of solid tumors, using in-vivo RECIST 1.1 as the reference method.

Sensitivity and Specificity of Cybrid Score for Predicting In-Vivo Clinical Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, The ex-vivo prognostic accuracy of the Cybrid live tumor diagnostic platform will be determined using in-vivo RECIST 1.1 as the reference method., 3 years
Determine the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of Cybrid Score and Compare to the AUCs of Current FDA Approved Predictive Biomarkers PD-L1 and Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB), The AUC of Cybrid Score will be established with a clinically meaningful confidence interval and compared to the AUCs of established FDA approved biomarkers for predicting clinical response to ICIs., 3 years
Cancer is a leading cause of death and despite many new drugs, a major diagnostic challenge remains knowing which drug will work best for a patient. A new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, current diagnostic methods (e.g. PDL1, MSI and TMB) do not accurately predict which patients will respond.

Elephas is developing a diagnostic platform using small 3D Live Tumor Fragments (LTFs) from participants for accurate prediction of drug response with a focus on CPIs such as Pembrolizumab (Keytruda). These LTFs contain both tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells, which are critical in determining response to CPIs and other immunotherapies.

In this observational clinical basket trial, participants will be recruited and their actual clinical response (using RECIST 1.1) to CPIs across five solid tumors (lung, head/neck, bladder, kidney, and skin) will be compared to the platform's predictive Artificial Intelligence (AI) score that is based on RNA, clinical data, and 3D microscopy images. The sensitivity and specificity of the platform's score will be determined and compared to current diagnostic methods for CPIs like PDL1, MSI, and TMB.
