Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
DRUG: MEK162|DRUG: Imatinib Mesylate (GleevecÂ®; STI571; NSC #716051)|OTHER: Blood draws|PROCEDURE: biopsy
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (phase 1b portion), The first three patients will be enrolled at Dose Level 1. If dose level 1 is not found to be tolerable, then the next cohort will be enrolled at dose level -1. If dose level -1 is not found to be tolerable, then the study may be terminated based on discussions with the sponsor and the combination may be deemed intolerable. If 0/3 patients or 1/6 patients experience a DLT on dose level 2, this will be the RP2D., 1 year|Best Response Rate (phase II portion), Response Rate (CR+PR, RECIST 1.1). Response rate (RECIST 1.1) will be determined as the proportion of evaluable patients who have complete response or partial response defined by the RECIST 1.1., 2 years
Response Rate (RR) (phase 1b portion), defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria and by CHOI criteria RR will be estimated as the proportion of patients who have complete response or partial response for each criterion., 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate among all patients enrolled. Patients who have not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study will be censored at the time of the last follow-up., 1 year|RR by CHOI criteria (phase II portion), It will be determined as the proportion of patients who have complete response or partial response defined by the CHOI criteria with a two-sided 95% CI provided., 1 year|RR by EORTC criteria, It will be determined as the proportion of patients who have complete response or partial response defined by the EORTC criteria with a two-sided 95% CI provided., 1 year
