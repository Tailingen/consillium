Validation of Digital Morphometry for Cancer Risk in Benign Prostate Biopsies
The goal of this study is to apply cutting-edge imaging approaches, incorporating machine-learning for pattern recognition and multispectral analysis, to the development and validation of intermediate endpoint biomarkers in benign tissue that characterize the response to 5α-reductase inhibitor chemoprevention as well as the risk of prostate cancer among men with negative biopsies.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Dutasteride|DRUG: Placebo
Effects of dutasteride (vs. placebo) using multi-feature scores derived from digital image analysis on both nuclear and architectural features in benign prostate tissue., Year 4
Multivariable treatment-response score between subjects who develop PCa while on dutasteride and those who do not., Year 4|Magnitude of association between nuclear phenotype in benign biopsies, and subsequent risk of PCa in untreated men at elevated risk., Year 4
