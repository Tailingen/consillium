Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Therapy In Combination With Sorafenib
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy with Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib compared to TACE alone in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not candidates for surgical resection or percutaneous ablation therapy.

DRUG: TACE with sorafenib|PROCEDURE: TACE alone
Progression Free Survival, Patients will be evaluated for these endpoints every 8 weeks, every 8 week|Overall Survival, The overall survival is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause, and will be evaluated every 8 weeks in the protocol treatment, and every one year in the follow-up period,respectively., every 8 week
Time To Progression, Time to progression is defined as time from randomization to radiological progression and will be evaluated every 8 week., every 8 weeks|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as best response, 4week after TACE|Tumor markers, Change of tumor markers, every 4 weeks|Safety, Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability(According to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0), every 4 weeks|Time To Untreatable Progression(TTUP), Time to untreatable progression is defined as time from randomization to untreatable progression and will be evaluated every 8 week., every 8 week till untreatable progression, assessed up to 100 months|Time to Child-Pugh C, Time to Child-Pugh C is defined as time from randomization to Child-Pugh C and will be evaluated every 8 week., every 8 week till liver deterioration to Child-Pugh C, assessed up to 100 months|Time to intrahepatic tumor progression, Time to intrahepatic tumor progression is defined as time from randomization to intrahepatic tumor progression and will be evaluated every 8 week., every 8 week till intrahepatic tumor progression, assessed up to 100 months|Time to vascular invasion, Time to vascular invasion is defined as time from randomization to vascular invasion and will be evaluated every 8 week., every 8 week till vascular invasion, assessed up to 100 months|Time to Extrahepatic spread, Time to extrahepatic spread is defined as time from randomization to extrahepatic spread and will be evaluated every 8 week., every 8 week till extrahepatic spread, assessed up to 100 months
TACE with sorafenib Group

Sorafenib will be administrated at a dose of 400mg o.d. before the first TACE. After 2days drug rest, TACE will be conducted. Sorafenib will be resumed at a dose of 400mg o.d. from 3 days after TACE(the resumption day can be postponed until 21 days after TACE). When tolerability is confirmed at 1 week after resumption, the dose of sorafenib will be increased to 400mg b.i.d. When tumor increases, TACE will be repeated.

Control group

TACE will be conducted at scheduled day. When tumor increases, TACE will be repeated.

The treatment regimen will be continued until untreatable progression which is defined as follows:

* Child-Pugh grade C
* Tumor growth (125 percent from baseline status)
* Vascular invasion(Vp3,Vp4)
* Extra hepatic spread which size is more than 10mm
