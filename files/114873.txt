Acalabrutinib, Umbralisib, and Ublituximab (AU2) In Relapsed and Untreated CLL
This study is testing the effectiveness of the study drug combination of acalabrutinib, umbralisib, and ublituximab in participants with Chronic Lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are/is:

* Acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE®, ACP-196)
* Umbralisib (TGR-1202)
* Ublituximab (TG-1101)

DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Umbralisib|DRUG: Ublituximab
Complete Remission (CR) Rate After 24 Cycles, The CR Rate is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete remission (CR) based on 2018 IW-CLL criteria., According to this endpoint is after 24 cycles. Overall median number of cycles is 24 with range 1-25.
Partial Remission (PR) Rate After 24 Cycles, The PR Rate is defined as the proportion of participants achieving partial remission (PR) based on 2018 IW-CLL criteria., According to this endpoint is after 24 cycles. Overall median number of cycles is 24 with range 1-25.|Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration between randomization and documented disease progression (PD) or death, or is censored at time of last dsease assessment., Disease will be evaluated through imaging at cycle 1 day 1, 8, and 15, cycle 2-6 and cycle 8-25 day 1, and cycle 7 day 1, 2 and 8. Observation on treatment up to approximately 25 cycles. In long-term follow-up, survival follow-up up to 5 years.
In this research study, Investigators are exploring the combination of acalabrutinib, umbralisib, and ublituximab and hoping to determine if the combination is effective at controlling cancer growth in participants with CLL.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

Participants will receive the study drugs for a maximum of 24 cycles (2 years) and will be followed for a maximum of 5 years after discontinuing the study drugs.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are/is:

* Acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE®, ACP-196)
* Umbralisib (TGR-1202)
* Ublituximab (TG-1101)

It is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved umbralisib or ublituximab as a treatment for any disease.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved acalabrutinib for CLL, but not in this combination.

  * Acalabrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It blocks a type of protein called Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) that helps CLL cells live and grow. By blocking BTK, acalabrutinib may kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.
  * Umbralisib is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K. PI3K is a protein that helps CLL cells grow.
  * Ublituximab is a type of investigational drug called a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein made in the laboratory that can locate and bind to substances in the body, including tumor cells. By binding to the tumor cells, the antibody might prevent the tumor cell from growing and spreading.

As of March 2023, TG therapeutics has decided to no longer provide umbralisib, ublituximab and funding for this study. Study participants still on treatment will still have access to acalabrutinib.
