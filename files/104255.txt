A Study of Regorafenib in Refractory Advanced Gastro-Oesophageal Cancer
A randomised phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 2:1 (regorafenib : placebo)
Gastro-Oesophageal Cancer
DRUG: Regorafenib|OTHER: Placebo
Overall Survival, The interval from the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause, or the date last known alive., From time of patient randomisation until date last known alive (up to 12 months following end of treatment).
Progression Free Survival, The interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., From time of patient randomisation until first evidence of disease progression or death (up to 12 months following randomisation).|Objective Tumour Response Rate, The OTRR will be calculated by summing the number of participants in a given arm that are assessed as having a complete or partial response (as per RECIST criteria), and dividing this by the total number of participants in the corresponding arm of the analysis set., From time of patient randomisation until evidence of complete or partial response (up to 12 months following randomisation).|Evaluation of health states experienced by participants, Questionnaire used to assess quality of life, From time of commencement of treatment until first evidence of disease progression (up to 12 months following commencement of treatment).|Rates of Adverse Events, A descriptive analysis of the adverse events (AE) data will be prepared for participants in the safety population. The number and percentage of participants who experience AEs will be tabulated according to CTCAE term/category, grade, and seriousness., From time dose of study treatment until 30 days after last dose of study treatment
Identification of tumour markers to that predict treatment outcomes for AGOC, Biomarker assessment, CTC DNA assessment to predict whether treatment for AGOC is efficacious, Up to 24 months following close of recruitment.|Evaluation of regorafenib Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax] between Asia and Rest of World cohorts., Evaluation of regorafenib Maximum Plasma Concentration \[Cmax\] in patients from either Asia or ROW to assess whether genetic factors aide/hinder metabolic rate of consumption of regorafenib, Up to 24 months following close of recruitment.
Purpose:

The purpose of this Phase III study is to determine if regorafenib improves overall survival in patients with Advanced Gastro-Oesophageal Carcinoma.

Who is it for:

You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with advanced (metastatic or locally recurrent) Gastro-Oesophageal Carcinoma which has not responded to a minimum of 2 lines of prior anti-cancer therapy.

Trial Details:

Participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups: regorafenib or placebo in 2:1 ratio respectively and will not be aware of their group allocation. Regorafenib or matching placebo will be self-administered by participants orally once daily on days 1-21 of each 28 days cycle. Treatment will continue until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Participants will be followed up every 2-4 weeks in order to evaluate their progress on the study.
