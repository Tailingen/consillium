Immunotherapy With Y90-RadioEmbolization for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This clinical trial will be conducted as a single-center, open-label, Phase I/2 trial to evaluate the feasibility and safety of Yttrium-90 radioembolization (Y90-RE) in combination with a fixed dose of of immunotherapy (durvalumab - 750 mg) in subjects with liver-predominant, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), which is mismatch repair proficient/microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS).

DRUG: Durvalumab|RADIATION: Yttrium-90 RadioEmbolization
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Yttrium-90 radioembolization combined with immunotherapy durvalumab to treat liver-predominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), MTD will be defined as the highest dose level for which at most 1 out of 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) using CTCAE version 5.0., Initiation of treatment up to 8 weeks and 2 doses ("priming") of immunotherapy prior to Y90-RE.
Incidence of adverse events (AE) per CTCAE version 5.0, The number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by dose-level, and by tumor molecular subtype) will be tabulated and summarized., Initiation of screening up to 2 years|Determine overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients that have achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST v1.1 as well as mRECIST and iRECIST., Up to 2 months post treatment|Determine the disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients that have achieved a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) by RECIST v1.1 as well as mRECIST and iRECIST., Up to 2 months post treatment|Determine liver-specific progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients that have achieved liver-specific progression free survival (Liver-PFS), Up to 2 months post treatment|Determine overall progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients that have achieved overall progression free survival (PFS), Up to 2 years|Determine overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause., Up to 2 years|Determine duration of response, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started., Up to 2 years
Circulating tumor DNA - ctDNA - liquid biopsy correlates, To determine changes in the expression profile and in levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood pre- and post- treatment, Up to 2 months post treatment|Immune correlates - tissue, To assess the changes in immune infiltration (TISSUE: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes - TILs (CD-3, CD-8), PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, pre- and post-Y90-RE and immunotherapy), Up to 2 months post treatment|Immune correlates - blood, To analyze serial changes in immune cells (BLOOD) pre- and post-Y90-RE and immunotherapy, Up to 2 months post treatment|Tumor tissue - correlates, To evaluate mutation burden by whole-exome sequencing pre- and post-treatment (TISSUE), Up to 2 months post treatment|Tumor tissue - correlates, To evaluate concomitant expression profile changes through RNA-Seq pre- and post-treatment (TISSUE), Up to 2 months post treatment|Abscopal effects, To report on any abscopal effects seen in terms of responses outside the Y90-RE field, Up to 2 months post treatment
The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out more about the side effects of immunotherapy with a form of radiation treatment for the cancer in the liver called Yttrium-90 RadioEmbolization (Y90-RE). An immunotherapy drug, durvalumab, will be given intravenously every 2 weeks. Investigators are studying what doses of durvalumab are safe for people in combination with this form of radiation treatment. Patients in this study will receive durvalumab, which is experimental and not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for metastatic colorectal cancer. Microscopic radioactive particles (TheraSphereÂ®) will be used for radioembolization to deliver the Y90 drug to the liver.

The number of doses of the immunotherapy drug (range: 2 to 5) will depend on the cohort patients are assigned to. There is no placebo. Everyone on the study is treated with immunotherapy alongside Y90-RadioEmbolization.
