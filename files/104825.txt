Study of Opevesostat (MK-5684) Versus Alternative NHA in mCRPC (MK-5684-003)
This is a phase 3, randomized, open-label study of opevesostat compared to alternative abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with respect to overall survival (OS) and to radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in participants with mCRPC previously treated with next-generation hormonal agent (NHA) and taxane-based chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that opevesostat is superior with respect to OS and rPFS per PCWG Modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR in androgen receptor ligand binding domain (AR LBD) mutation-negative and -positive participants.
Prostate Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Opevesostat|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Hydrocortisone|DRUG: Fludrocortisone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Overall Survival (OS) in Androgen Receptor Ligand Binding Domain (AR LBD) Mutation-Positive Participants, OS is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS in AR LBD mutation-positive participants will be reported for each study arm., Up to ~54 months|OS in AR LBD Mutation-Negative Participants, OS is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS in AR LBD mutation-negative participants will be reported for each study arm., Up to ~54 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS) Per Prostate Cancer Working Group-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review in AR LBD Mutation-Positive Participant, rPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. rPFS in AR LBD mutation-positive participants will be reported for each study arm., Up to ~36 months|rPFS Per Prostate Cancer Working Group-modified RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review in AR LBD Mutation-Negative Participants, rPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. rPFS in AR LBD mutation-negative participants will be reported for each study arm., Up to ~36 months
Time to Initiation of the First Subsequent Anti-Cancer Therapy or Death (TFST), TFST is defined as the time from randomization to initiation of the first subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first., Up to ~54 months|Objective Response (OR), OR is determined by PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~54 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is determined by PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~54 months|Time to Pain Progression (TTPP), TTPP is assessed by Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Item 3 ("Worst Pain in 24 Hours") and opiate analgesic use (Analgesic Quantification Algorithm \[AQA\] Score)., Up to ~54 months|Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, The time from randomization to PSA progression. The PSA progression date is defined as the date of either: 1) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir, confirmed by a second value ≥3 weeks later if there is PSA decline from baseline 2) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks if there is no PSA decline from baseline., Up to ~54 months|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal-related Event (SSRE), The time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following symptomatic skeletal-related events: 1) Use of EBRT to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms; 2) new symptomatic pathologic bone fracture (vertebral or nonvertebral); 3) spinal cord compression; or 4) tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention., Up to ~54 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to ~54 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to ~54 months
