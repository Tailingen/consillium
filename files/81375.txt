Differences in knowledge scores between the intervention and control arms will be analyzed., Baseline, 3 months, 9 months|Self-efficacy, Self-efficacy will be measured using a nine-item barrier self-efficacy scale and a four-item task self-efficacy scale to assess participants' confidence in overcoming barriers to physical activity and ability to do physical activity. The two self-efficacy scales have Cronbach's alpha of 0.96 and 0.89 among cancer patients, respectively. The total self-efficacy score ranges from The total self-efficacy score ranges from 13 to 65. A higher score indicates a higher level of confidence in overcoming barriers and doing physical activity. Differences in total self-efficacy scores between the intervention and control arms will be analyzed., Baseline, 3 months, 9 months|Physical activity engagement, Physical activity engagement is measured by a 6-point Likert scale that measures the habit strength for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The total habit score ranges from 17 to 102. A higher score indicates a greater engagement in physical activity. Differences in habit scores between the intervention and control arms will be analyzed., Baseline, 3 months, 9 months|Physical activity enjoyment, Enjoyment is measured by a short version of the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (4-item). The enjoyment score ranges from 4 to 20. A higher score indicates a higher level of enjoyment participants perceive from doing physical activity. Differences in enjoyment scores between the intervention and control arms will be analyzed., Baseline, 3 months, 9 months|Pain score, Pain will be measured using a 4-item 5-point Likert pain interference scale from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures.

The purpose of this research is to improve the quality of life for underserved cancer survivors by increasing physical activity. A physical activity intervention will be tested for feasibility with African American cancer survivors. The project will serve as a foundation for intervening with other underserved cancer survivors.

Feasibility will be measured as intervention Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance, following the RE-AIM framework. Survey and biomarker data will be collected at baseline, 3 and 9 months later. These time points will facilitate exploration of changes pre- and post-intervention, and to determine if effects are maintained 6 months after completing the intervention. Our primary hypothesis is that the intervention will be feasible to deliver.
