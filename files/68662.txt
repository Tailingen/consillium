Stereotactic Boost and Long-Term Androgen Deprivation for Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
We hypothesize that Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Boost (SBRT) as a boost to the prostate following whole pelvic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can be delivered effectively and safely in a population of men with unfavorable intermediate and high risk localized prostate cancer.

Our primary objective is to assess the feasibility and safety of a treatment strategy incorporating whole pelvic IMRT followed by an SBRT boost to the prostate with neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant androgen deprivation for a total of 28 months for men with unfavorable intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgical Boost|DRUG: Casodex|DRUG: Leuprolide
Tumor Assessment, Tumors will be assessed using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System, 7th Edition. This system consists of the following subscales: the extent of the primary tumor (T category), whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N category), the absence or presence of distant metastasis (M category), the PSA level at the time of diagnosis, and the Gleason score, based on the prostate biopsy (or surgery)., 24 months
Zubrod Performance Scale, This is a scale used to evaluate the patient's performance status is an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life., Weekly during radiation treatment; every three months during hormone therapy; every six months for 3 yrs after hormone therapy
The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of a treatment strategy incorporating whole pelvic IMRT followed by an SBRT boost to the prostate with neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant androgen deprivation for a total of 28 months for men with unfavorable intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer.

The secondary objective is to assess biochemical control at 24 months following the experimental treatment strategy by the "Phoenix definition". Patients not meeting these prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria (Phoenix Definition) for failure who undergo salvage therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy, or Cryosurgery) should also be declared as failures at the time a positive biopsy is obtained or salvage therapy is administered, whichever comes first.

Another secondary objective is to assess toxicity of the experimental treatment approach as scored by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events The third secondary objective is to assess prostate organ motion during hypofractionated radiotherapy. To assess motion of the prostate during the protracted delivery of hypofractionated radiotherapy as assessed by implanted electromagnetic transponder beacons.
