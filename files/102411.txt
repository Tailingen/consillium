Phase I Chemoprevention Trial With Green Tea Polyphenon E & Erlotinib in Patients With Premalignant Lesions of the Head & Neck
The purpose of this study is to test the preventive effects of a combination of drugs: polyphenon E (PPE) derived from green tea extracts, and erlotinib. Because this combination of drugs has not been tested in humans before for the prevention of cancer, it is not clear which dose of each agent will be optimal in combination.

We will test the safety of the combination of PPE and erlotinib and see what effects (good and/or bad) it has on the patient's premalignant lesion, and find the highest dose of each agent that can be given in combination without causing severe side effects.
Cancer of Head and Neck|Neoplasms, Head and Neck
DRUG: Erlotinib|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Green Tea Polyphenon E
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib when administered with a constant dose of green tea polyphenon E (PPE)., Define MTD as the dose level of erlotinib when administered with a constant dose of 200 mg (EGCG) TID of Green Tea Polyphenon E (PPE) to a patient results in a probability equal to Î¸ = 0.33 that a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be manifest within 1 cycle defined as 28 days., Cytobrush/biopsy at three months
To assess the safety of the combination of PPE and erlotinib in patients receiving 3 different doses of erlotinib (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) in combination with PPE (200 mg EGCG TID) for 6 months., Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months
