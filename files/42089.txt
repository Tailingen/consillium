FIH Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, PK, PD & Preliminary Efficacy of AT03-65 With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase I, First-in-Human Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Preliminary Efficacy of AT03-65 in Adults with Advanced Solid Tumors
Solid Tumor
DRUG: AT03-65
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AT03-65, The MTD is defined as the highest dose with an observed incidence of DLT in no more than one out of six patients treated at a particular dose level., Up to 21 days|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT refers to AEs that occurred during DLT observation period in dose escalation study, excluding toxicities clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes., Up to 21 days
Determine levels of AT03-65 and its constituents over time in plasma, Assess PK concentration of AT03-65 in peripheral blood, Maximum 2 years|Evaluate changes in circulating tumor DNA in plasma, Assess PD markers related to AT03-65 in peripheral blood, Maximum 2 years|Determine the presence of antibodies to AT03-65 at different times in plasma, Assess immunogenicity concentration in peripheral blood, Maximum 2 years|Assessment of Overall Response Rate (ORR) in subjects with advanced / metastatic solid tumors, Percentage of subjects whose best response is observed to be CR or PR throughout the study as assessed by local radiological assessment made by investigator according to RECIST V1.1, Maximum 2 years|Determine the expression level of CLDN6 in tumor samples, Assess the presence and expression level of CLDN6 in tumor samples, Maximum 2 years|Progress-Free Survival (PFS) of treatment in subjects with advanced / metastatic solid tumors, PFS as assessed by Local Investigators according to RECIST V1.1, Maximum 2 years|Assessment of Disease Control Rate (DCR)in subjects with advanced / metastatic solid tumors, Percentage of subjects with best overall response of CR, PR and SD as assessed per RECIST v1.1, Maximum 2 years|Assessment of Duration of Response (DOR) of treatment in patients with solid tumor, DOR as assessed by Local Investigators according to the RECIST V1.1, Maximum 2 years|Assessment of Overall Survival (OS) of treatment in subjects with advanced / metastatic solid tumors, OS as assessed as duration from first dose of IMP to death, Maximum 2 years|Assessment of Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)in subjects with advanced / metastatic solid tumors, Percentage of subjects whose best response is observed to be CR, PR or SD, Maximum 2 years
This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of AT03-65 in adults with advanced solid tumors. AT03-65 is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated escalation method for the lower 3 dose level groups and the 3 + 3 escalation method is used in the subsequent dose level groups.

The study design is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during 21-day cycle. One or more doses or regimens lower than or at the MTD may be selected for further evaluations under Dose Expansion to further evaluate the IMP and identify the RP2D.
