68-Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI and 68-Ga RM2 PET/MRI for Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Response to HIFU Therapy
This study is being conducted to determine whether the combination of imaging agents 68-Ga RM2 and 68-Ga PMSA11 is better at assessing response to high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or high dose rate (HDR) local therapy than standard imaging or biopsy in patients with known prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 68-Ga RM2|DRUG: 68-Ga PSMA11|DEVICE: Investigational software and coils in PET/MR Scan|PROCEDURE: PET/MRI
Number of Participants for Which an Assessment of PET Based Therapeutic Response to HIFU is Successfully Obtained, Positron emission tomography (PET) based of Assessment of Local Therapeutic Response. Therapeutic response to HIFU will be assessed by 68-Ga PSMA 11 and 68-Ga RM2 PET scans., Up to approximately 2 hours to complete each scan
Primary Objective: To determine feasibility of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for evaluation of HIFU or HDR local therapy in patients with known prostate cancer.
