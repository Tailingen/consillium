The Development of Quantitative Ultrasound Imaging Software Platform
The goal of this observational study is to compare the image differences between conventional ultrasound and artificial intelligence-based ultrasound software in conscious adults.

The main question it aims to answer is to evaluate the effectiveness by determining that the new image analysis method is considered valid if it helps to identify more than 30% of histological characteristics.

Participants will undergo the examination using the two methods mentioned earlier after signing the consent form.
