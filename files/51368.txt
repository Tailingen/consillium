A Study of YL201 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, first-in-human study of YL201 conducted in China and the United States. The study will include 2 parts: a dose escalation part (Part 1) followed by a dose expansion part (Part 2).

Part 1 will estimate the MTD/RED(s) in dose escalation cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available.

Part 2 will include patients with selected advanced solid tumor types enrolled at the MTD/RED(s), to better define the safety profile and evaluate the efficacy of YL201.
