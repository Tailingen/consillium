Demonstrate Efficacy and Safety of Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to demonstrate equivalence
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: CT-P6|DRUG: Herceptin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate, Best Overall Response (BOR) was derived from the overall response across all time points until after Cycle 8 using Independent Tumor Review Committee (ITRC) data in the FAS. Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the number of patients with a BOR of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of patients in the corresponding population, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1., 6 months (up to 24 weeks)
Time to Progression, Time from randomization to determined progressive disease, as assessed by RECIST version 1.1., Through study completion, approximately 40 months|Time to Response, Time from randomization to observed tumor response (Complete Response or Partial Response), as assessed by RECIST 1.1, Through study completion, approximately 40 months|Progression Free Survival, Time from randomization to radiological progression or death from any cause, as assessed by RECIST 1.1, Through study completion, approximately 40 months|Overall Survival, The number of days between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause., Through study completion, approximately 40 months|Safety Endpoints; Cardiotoxicity, Mean change from baseline to endpoint assessment in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (%), Through study completion, approximately 40 months|Safety Endpoints; Immunogenicity, Assessed by the proportion of patients with development of antibodies to study drug (positive anti-drug antibody \[ADA\] results after the first study drug infusion), During treatment, median of 13 cycles (every cycle is 3 weeks)|Pharmacokinetic Endpoints; Ctroughss, Trough concentration at steady state, predose and at 1.5 hours (end of infusion) of each cycle
Patients will receive CT-P6 or Herceptin every 3 weeks.
