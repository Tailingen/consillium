Impact of Cross-training on Induction Treatment Response in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Adults
Despite advances in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the prognosis in adults is still poor, largely due to the resistance of treatment at diagnosis or early relapse. Among the strategies associated with the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is rehabilitation and physical medicine in order to improve the quality of life, body composition, fitness, strength and improve the attachment and acceptance of their treatment

Previous evidence had shown that among the beneficial effects of an exercise intervention in cancer is the reduction of adverse events associated with treatment, such as nausea and fatigue. Also, the overexpression of Interleukin-15 in cancer is related to a poor prognosis, biologically the implementation of a cross-training exercise routine can function as a regulatory pathway for its expression due to its consumption at muscular level. Finally, the time to consider a relapse with a very poor prognosis is during first three months of treatment, so implementation of an exercise strategy during this period could reduce the proportion of early relapses mediated by Interleukin-15 expression
