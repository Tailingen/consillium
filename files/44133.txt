Ultrasound and Near Infrared Imaging for Predicting and Monitoring Neoadjuvant Treatment
To determine the accuracy of NIR/US assessment of tumor vasculature and oxygen changes in predicting and monitoring early neoadjuvant treatment response compared to pathological response.

DEVICE: Optical Tomography Using Near Infrared Diffused Light Assisted with Ultrasound
Pathologic Response Based on Miller-Payne Grading System, In the Miller-Payne system, the pathologic response is divided into 5 grades based on comparison of tumor cellularity between pre-neoadjuvant core biopsy and definitive surgical specimen as:

* grade 1: no change or some alteration to individual malignant cells but no reduction in overall cellularity (pNR)
* grade 2: a minor loss of tumor cells but overall cellularity still high; up to 30% (pPR)
* grade 3: between an estimated 30% and 90% reduction in tumor cells (pPR)
* grade 4: a marked disappearance of tumor cells such that only small clusters or widely dispersed individual cells remain (almost pCR); more than 90% loss of tumor cells
* grade 5: no malignant cells identifiable in sections from the site of the tumor; only vascular fibroelastonic stroma remains often containing macrophages (pCR) (however, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be present), Up to 6 months
