Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of MB0151 in Adult Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Expressing Somatostatin Receptors
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of MB0151 in adult subjects (at least 18 years old) with advanced solid tumors. This study includes two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. In this study, the protocol of accelerated titration combined with i3+3 is used for dose escalation,administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be sequentially assigned to the planned dose cohorts according to this protocol to receive MB0151 treatment and will be monitored for the occurrence of DLT. The RP2D and/or OBD will be determined by considering the PK profile, safety and efficacy data in the dose-escalation stage (including backfill cohorts).
