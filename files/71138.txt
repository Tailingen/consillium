Sentinel Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological cancer. Current treatment of EC typically includes removal of the uterus and to determine the extent of the disease (removal of fallopian tubes, ovaries \& if required a lymph node dissection (surgical staging)). While lymph node dissection may be valuable to guide the need for adjuvant treatment (chemo or radiotherapy) after surgery, it has been a topic of controversy for the last 30 years. In some patients it causes morbidity, specifically lymphoedema. This recently has been replaced with sentinel node biopsy (SNB). It requires an injection of a dye into the cervix with specific equipment \& surgical dissection of the lymph node in which the dye first becomes visible. Despite this promising proposition \& similar to a lymph node dissection, the value to patients, cost effectiveness \& potential harms (e.g. lymphedema) of SNB compared to no-node dissection in EC has never been established. Aim: determine the value of SNB for patients, the healthcare system and exclude detriment to patients using a randomised approach 1:1. Stage 1 - 444 patients. Stage 2 additional 316 patients.

Primary Outcome Stage 1:

Proportion of participants returning to usual daily activities at 12 months from surgery using the EQ-5D which will determine when women in both groups can return to their usual activities.

Primary Outcome Stage 2:

Treatment non-inferiority as evaluated by disease-free survival status at 4.5 years post-surgery, as measured by the time interval between the date of randomisation and date of first recurrence. Confirmation of recurrent disease will be ascertained through clinical assessment, radiological work-up and/or histological results.

Cost Effectiveness using QALYs using EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) Questionnaire, An assessment will be performed on the cost-effectiveness of TH + SNB relative to TH alone, calculated as the incremental cost per unit of improvement in functional outcome, measured in terms of the primary outcome. This will assess how much more money the proposed intervention will cost the health system and society, and whether this represents a sound investment in terms of the improvement in quality of life. We will also measure the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with the intervention and use this to undertake a cost-utility analysis.

These will also be adjudicated by an independent committee to ensure accuracy of documented recurrence, 4.5 years from surgery|Impact of body composition (sarcopenia) on surgical complications, recovery and overall survival, Body mass measures are practical \& sensitive for predicting health risks \& outcomes. Sarcopenia is defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass \& strength. It's been found to be associated with procedure-related morbidity, survival in cancer patients and increased use of healthcare. The concurrent appearance of low muscle mass with high adiposity (sarcopenic obesity) is common in people with chronic diseases. The trial will determine the role sarcopenia has on participants pre-operatively (via CT images \& Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS - if available at site) \& postoperatively using the BIS in regard to survival in gynaecological malignancies, if it is a predictive factor for treatment adverse events \& participants tolerability of treatment \& compare diagnostic methods to determine medical fitness for surgery. BIS sends non-detectable electrical currents, at a range of frequencies through the body allowing precise measurement \& analysis of impedance to currents by extracellular fluid, 4.5 years from surgery|Impact of frailty on surgical complications, recovery and overall survival, It has been reported consistently that frailty has a significant impact on the occurrence of adverse postoperative outcomes. Therefore, measuring frailty is important to estimate risks, determine the best treatment options, and to aid diagnosis and care planning. Frailty will be measured prior to surgery suing the validated tool - Frailty Phenotype. This may determine the impact frailty has on survival, quality of life, lymphedema, peri-, intra- and postoperative outcomes, 4.5 years from surgery|Follow-Up Strategies, Current institutional \& clinical guidelines suggest patients need to be seen at regular follow up visits. The risk of developing a recurrence is higher within the initial period after surgery \& the majority of recurrences develop within those first 3 years. Participants will ideally be seen 3 monthly for the first 3 years \& 6 monthly until 4.5 years. The objective of follow up is that local recurrences from endometrial cancer are potentially curable. It helps to diagnose local recurrences as early as possible so that they are amenable for curative or effective palliative management. We will compare these clinical findings to a symptom checklist that will be completed by participants every 3 months from surgery until 4.5 years. This records patient reported symptoms that may indicate a recurrence. Comparing these findings should determine effective follow up strategies for this group of patients., 4.5 years from surgery
Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that SNB will not cause detriment to patients (lymphoedema, morbidity, loss of quality of life) and not increase costs compared to patients without a retroperitoneal node dissection. The secondary hypothesis is that disease-free survival in patients without retroperitoneal node dissection is not inferior to those receiving SNB.

Aims: To determine the value of SNB for patients, the healthcare system and to exclude detriment to patients.

Objectives:

Primary Stage 1:

To determine the recovery of participants (defined as incidence of adverse events, lower limb lymphoedema and health-related QOL) and to the healthcare system (cost) of Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) for the surgical treatment of endometrial cancer.

Primary Stage 2:

Compare disease-free survival at 4.5 years for participants randomised to receive hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with SNB compared to participants randomised to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without retroperitoneal node dissection.
