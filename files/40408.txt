Comparative Study of Antiperistaltic vs Isoperistaltic Billroth II + Braun Anastomosis for Postoperative Reflux
Postoperative gastroesophageal reflux is one of the most common complications of distal gastrectomy. With more attention paid on it by surgeons, several new operation methods have been practised. Among all these, distal gastrctomy with Billroth II + Braun anastomosis was reported to be an useful method to decrease postoperative reflux rate. Meanwhile, the direction of anastomotic peristalsis has also been reported to affect the anastomosis and thus make difference in reflux rate. We design this study to investigate the potential effect and the superiority of antiperistaltic vs isoperistaltic Billroth II + Braun reconstruction in distal gastrectomy.
