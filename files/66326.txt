A Study to Isolate and Test Circulating Tumor Cells Using the ClearCellÂ® FX EP+ System
The purpose of this study is to isolate and measure circulating tumor cells in the blood stream to advance detection of cancer and treatment monitoring. In this study, the investigators will utilize the novel technology for circulating tumor cell detection in order to evaluate their presence in patients with lung cancer.

Number and types of mutations in the primary tumor., Within 1 year|Number and type of mutations detectable in the matched circulating tumor cell samples., Within 1 year
Concordance of mutations detected by either method., Within 1 year
The plan is to collect both blood and tumor samples from the patient's lung cancer in order to validate this technology in detecting circulating tumor cells. The investigators will also obtain a postoperative blood sample to see if there is a decrease in the overall circulating tumor cell measurement once the tumor has been surgically removed.
