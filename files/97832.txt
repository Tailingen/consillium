A Phase IB Study Of The BTKi CC-292 Combined With Lenalidomide In Adults Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma
This is an open label, 3 + 3 dose escalation study, to determine the MTD, safety, efficacy and PK profiles for subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies when using CC-292 and lenalidomide combination therapy. Subjects will be followed for disease progression and collection of second primary malignancy (SPM) events. This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory expansion phase in 3 cohorts of 12 patients each.
Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: CC-292 + lenalidomide
Determination of the recommended dose of CC-292 and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma, The optimal CC-292 and lenalidomide combination will be determined based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and/or the analysis of adverse events, serious adverse events and toxicities observed during the study, 28 days
preliminary efficacy signals of the CC-292 + Lenalidomide combination, Overall response rate and overall response rate, complete and partial response rates, progression free survival, response duration, time to next treatment and overall survival, 6 months|Observed maximum plasma concentration, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose|time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose|Terminal phase rate constant (λz), 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose|plasma decay half-life (t1/2), 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose|Area under the curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration [AUC(0-t)], Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (predose) to time of the last quantifiable concentration (0-t), 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose|Area under the curve from time zero to extrapolated infinity [AUC(0-∞)], Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (predose)to extrapolated infinity(0-∞), 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose|BTk receptor occupancy, BTK receptor occupancy will be determined in the peripheral blood cells and tumor tissue, 0 (predose) and 21 days post dose
