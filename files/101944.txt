NAC to Prevent Cisplatin-induced Hearing Loss
Cisplatin is a key chemotherapy agent for the treatment of multiple childhood cancers but causes permanent hearing loss. This study investigates the drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to determine the dose necessary to protect hearing and also how well tolerated NAC is when combined with chemotherapy.
Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive|Liver Neoplasms|Osteosarcoma|Other Childhood Cancers Using Cisplatin-based Regimens
DRUG: N-Acetylcysteine
Target Serum Level NAC, Following the first dose of cisplatin, NAC will be administered as described below. A NAC level will then be measured immediately following this first dose of NAC to determine if the blood (serum) level reaches the threshold necessary for hearing protection., On average up to 4 weeks from diagnosis
Adverse events during infusion of NAC, Subjects will be monitored during and after each NAC infusion to determine how well they tolerate the drug. Infusion rate related and spontaneously resolving "anaphylactoid" reactions are the most common reported toxicity and will be closely monitored. Most subjects will receive 3 cycles of cisplatin and NAC, typically within the first 15 weeks of starting chemotherapy. Subjects who continue to receive cisplatin and NAC for additional cycles will continue to be monitored., Up to approximately 40 weeks from start of chemotherapy (regimen dependent)|NAC Level, A NAC serum level will be measured surrounding the first dose of NAC at 4 times:

1. pre-cisplatin (baseline)
2. following cisplatin/before NAC
3. immediately following NAC (primary aim)
4. delayed four hours following NAC

For those in the non-intervention arm, NAC serum levels will be measured at corresponding times as determined by the start of the cisplatin infusion., -6,0, 0.5, and 4 hours from start of first NAC dose (intervention)|Hearing assessment, Routinely performed hearing assessments will be analyzed at the end of therapy as compared to a historical cohort, non-treated, and to patient's baseline (if available) to evaluate for any trend toward a protective effect from NAC., Up to approximately 40 weeks from start of chemotherapy|Renal Toxicity, Information regarding renal toxicity due to cisplatin will be collected at end of therapy and compared to historical rates and non-treated patients to evaluate a potential protective effect by NAC, Up to approximately 40 weeks from start of chemotherapy|Response of tumor to treatment, Early indicators of tumor response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy (e.g. percent necrosis in resected tumors, early remission rates, etc) will be informally evaluated in comparison to historical data for any evidence NAC decreases efficacy of the chemotherapy, On average up to 15 weeks from start of chemotherapy (regimen dependent)|Effect of Genotype on Hearing Loss and Hearing Protection, Saliva/cheek swabs will be collected one-time for genotype analysis to examine the influence of glutathione polymorphisms on cisplatin-induced hearing loss and NAC hearing protection, On average up to 15 weeks from start of chemotherapy|Glutathione serum level, Glutathione serum levels will be measured at times corresponding to NAC levels surrounding the first dose of NAC at 4 times:

1. pre-cisplatin (baseline)
2. following cisplatin/before NAC
3. immediately following NAC (primary aim)
4. delayed four hours following NAC

For those in the non-intervention arm, serum levels will again be measured at corresponding times as determined by the start of the cisplatin infusion., -6,0, 0.5, and 4 hours from start of first NAC dose (intervention)
The study is a dose-finding study of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to protect hearing in children receiving cisplatin for the treatment of their cancer. NAC also has potential to protect the kidneys from cisplatin toxicity.

The study uses a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme to determine the dose of NAC necessary to achieve serum levels consistent with hearing protection in pre-clinical animal models. Three dose levels are predefined. Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined, an expansion cohort will then be enrolled to further evaluate tolerability as well as intra-patient and inter-patient variability in achieved serum levels. An option to enroll in a separate arm for study assessments only is available for those who do not wish to receive NAC. Hearing loss in the cohort will be assessed in the entire cohort in comparison to historical and non-treated children to evaluate for trends toward efficacy.
