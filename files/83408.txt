Robot-assisted Procedure Versus Open Simultaneous Resection of Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted simultaneous resection in selected patients with sigmoid colon cancer or rectal cancer liver metastases, and compared with the traditional open procedure.
Colorectal Liver Metastasis
PROCEDURE: RSRCLM|PROCEDURE: Open
Surgical Complication, According to Clavein-Dindo complication system to calculate the complication events during 30 day after surgery, 30 days after surgury
Operative mortality, death occurred 30 days after operation, 30 days post operatively|Disease-free survival(DFS), DFS was defined as from the date of randomization to the date of tumor, 3 years disease-free survival|overall survival (OS), overall survival was defined as from the date of randomization to the date of Death ;, OS rate at 3 and 5 years after operation|locoregional recurrence rate, local recurrence rate at 3 and 5 years after operation, 3 and 5 years
self reported bladder function, This section is assessed using a self-rating scale "International prostate symptom score" (IPSS), at postoperative 3, 6 and 1 2 months|self reported sexual function for male patients, This section is assessed using a self-rating scale "International Index of Erectile Function" (IIEF-5)., at postoperative 3, 6 and 1 2 month|self reported sexual function for female patients, This section is assessed using a self-rating scale "Female Sexual Function Index" (FSFI)., at postoperative 3, 6 and 1 2 months|liver function, Serum aminotransferase will be tested in the laboratory, at Day 1，3，5 after surgery
The Da Vinci Surgical System may help to overcome some of the difficulties of laparoscopy for complicated abdominal surgery. The aim of this study was to present an innovative technique that is robot-assisted, simultaneous radical resection of both colorectal cancer and liver metastasis (RSRCLM).
