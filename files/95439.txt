Fluoroscopic Anterior Approach Versus Ultrasound Guided Superior Hypogastric Plexus Neurolysis in Cancer Pelvic Pain
Cancer related pelvic pain can be debilitating and difficult to treat. Superior hypogastric plexus neurolysis (SHPN) is considered to be an option for adequately relieving pain, with fewer side effects and improving the quality of life

The superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) is one of the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia, located in the lower border of the L5 vertebra and upper part of the sacrum in the retroperitoneal space. It is considered as a continuity of the celiac plexus and the lumbar sympathetic ganglia. It is related to the bifurcation of the aorta and the ureters. The SHP has a sympathetic connection (both efferent and afferent fibers) with splanchnic nerves and aortic plexus. It innervates the viscera of the pelvis, including the urinary bladder, ureters, sigmoid colon down to the anal canal, and upper vagina SHP blockade can be performed either by ultrasound (US), fluoroscopic, computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and it is conducted through anterior (transabdominal) or posterior (lateral, paramedian, oblique, transdiscal, or transvaginal) approaches These different imaging modalities and approaches have been described for SHPN to make it easier, safer and more accurate and satisfied to the patients
