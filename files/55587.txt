Study of NUV-422 in Combination With Enzalutamide in Patients With mCRPC
NUV-422-04 is an open-label Phase 1b/2 dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NUV-422 in combination with enzalutamide. The study population is comprised of adults with mCRPC. Patients will self-administer NUV-422 and 160 mg enzalutamide orally in 28-day cycles.

Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Safety and tolerability of NUV-422 in combination with enzalutamide to determine the recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2cD), Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and laboratory abnormalities, During the DLT period (28 days)|Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-response rate (PSA-RR), PSA per standard criteria, Every 4 weeks throughout study treatment, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR per standard criteria, Every 8 weeks throughout study treatment, an average of 6 months
