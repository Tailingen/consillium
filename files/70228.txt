Non-invasive Identification of Colorectal Cancer and Adenomas in Early Stages
The NICE study is a prospective, multi-site study to train and validate a blood-based, glycoproteomic test for the early detection of advanced adenoma and colorectal cancer by collecting blood samples and associated relevant clinical information from average-risk participants who undergo routine screening colonoscopy as well as participants undergoing colonoscopy for surveillance or diagnostic indications
Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Non-Interventional
Sensitivity of the InterVenn test, To determine the sensitivity of the InterVenn test, up to 90 days from baseline|Specificity of the InterVenn test, To determine the specificity of the InterVenn test, up to 90 days from baseline
InterVenn is using its glycoprotein profiling technology platform that couples high-resolution liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) with an artificial intelligence (AI), neural network (NN)-based high-throughput data processing software to identify patterns uniquely associated with colon adenoma and colon adenocarcinoma in order to detect (pre)cancerous events early. The purpose of this prospective multi-center observational study is to train and validate a blood-based, glycoproteomic test for the early detection of advanced adenoma and colorectal cancer by collecting blood samples and associated relevant clinical information from average-risk participants who undergo routine screening colonoscopy as well as participants undergoing colonoscopy for surveillance or diagnostic indications.
