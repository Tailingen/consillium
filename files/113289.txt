CTC Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Proportion of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the postoperative phase after curative tumor removal of pancreatic cancer will be determined and correlated to the accordance of anesthesia (desflurane versus propofol)
Adenocarcinoma|Circulating Tumor Cells|Pancreatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Desflurane
Peak of CTC in the postoperative phase after curative tumor removal, CTC will be counted and peak of CTC will be determined., Day 0 to Day 7
Kinetics of CTC after surgery up to day 7, CTC will be counted and kinetics of CTC will be determined., 1 year|Month to Tumor recurrence, Tumor recurrence will be monitored., 1 year|Number of surviving patients, One year after surgery the number of patients still being alive will be determined., 1 year
This prospective, randomized study will be conducted over a 36-month period to investigate whether commonly used anesthetics (volatile versus intravenous) have an effect on the changes or occurrence of CTC in patients suffering from primary pancreatic cancer undergoing curative surgery. The specific research question is if there are changes of the CTC count in the postoperative phase in the desflurane group (intervention) compared to the propofol one (control). A secondary question is if these changes can be correlated to tumor outcome.
