A Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of EndoTAG®-1 in Combination With Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Compared With Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine as First-line Therapy in Patients With Visceral Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, and controlled trial to test the superiority of EndoTAG®-1 in combination with paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine.

An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established to decide on the recommended dose (RD) of EndoTAG®-1, paclitaxel and gemcitabine to be used throughout the trial and to monitor the patients' safety and treatment efficacy data
