Evaluating Cognitive Changes on Patients in Chemotherapy (ECCPC)
This randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the impact of a structured low-intensity exercise program on cognitive function in adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The study enrolls 100 participants who are randomly assigned to either a standard care group or an exercise intervention group. Cognitive function is measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline, 6, 9, and 12 months. Participants in the intervention group are instructed to double their baseline daily step count, tracked via pedometer, while those in the control group maintain their usual activity. All patients are given the pedometer for one week prior to the start of chemo to monitor their step count and determine their baseline. The study also collects self-reported data on cognitive difficulties and psychological well-being. The primary objective is to determine whether regular physical activity mitigates chemotherapy-related cognitive decline ("chemo brain") and whether MoCA scores correlate with patients' subjective experiences. This low-cost, home-based approach may offer an accessible strategy for preserving cognitive function during cancer treatment.
Chemotherapy-related Cognitive Impairment
BEHAVIORAL: Low-Intensity Walking Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Control Group Intervention
Change in Cognitive Function as Measured by MoCA Score, This outcome evaluates whether cognitive decline associated with chemotherapy ("chemo brain") can be measured using the MoCA, a brief and validated tool suitable for clinical settings. The goal is to determine if MoCA can effectively detect changes in cognitive performance over the course of chemotherapy without the need for extensive neuropsychological testing., Baseline, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months
Correlation Between MoCA Scores and Self-Reported Cognitive Difficulties, This outcome examines how well participants' MoCA scores align with their own self-reported cognitive difficulties. Self-reported data will be collected using a structured questionnaire to capture subjective experiences of memory, attention, and mental clarity. The analysis will assess whether objective cognitive test results reflect participants' perceived impairments., Baseline, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months
Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a well-documented side effect of cancer treatment, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and effective interventions are lacking. Emerging evidence suggests that physical activity may mitigate cognitive decline through improvements in neuroplasticity, cerebral blood flow, and reduction of inflammation-driven neurotoxicity. This study builds on that foundation by integrating both objective and subjective measures of cognitive function to better capture the patient experience. A mixed-effects ANCOVA model will be used to assess treatment effects over time, with additional analyses exploring the relationship between adherence to the exercise regimen and cognitive outcomes. By leveraging a low-cost, accessible intervention and including diverse demographic and psychosocial factors, this trial aims to inform future strategies for managing CRCI and improving long-term quality of life for cancer patients.
