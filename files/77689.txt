A Study of RC48-ADC Combined With JS001 For Perioperative Treatment of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous RC48-ADC combined with JS001 in perioperative treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Muscle Invasive Bladder Carcinoma
DRUG: RC48-ADC|DRUG: JS001
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, pCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having pCR. pCR is defined as absence of viable tumor (pT0pT0N0) in examined tissue from RC and PLND., Up to approximately 16 Weeks (Time of surgery)
Rate of Pathologic Response, No residual tumor (ypT0N0) and partial response (ypTis-1N0) in surgical specimen., Up to approximately 16 Weeks (Time of surgery)|1-year Disease Free Survival Rate, The percentage of participants disease free on 1 year after surgery., From approximately 16 Weeks up to approximately 12 Months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to approximately 12 Weeks.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 60 Months.
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous RC48-ADC combined with JS001 in perioperative treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
