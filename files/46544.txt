A Clinical Study of IBI130 for Subjects With Unresectable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of IBI130. It includes a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion section to identify MTD/RP2D of IBI130, plan to enroll 20\~182 subjects,and a phase 2 to explore efficacy, safety and tolerability of IBI130 at RP2D in specified types of solid tumor.Approximately 150 evaluable subjects will be enrolled for phase 2.
