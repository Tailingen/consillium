Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease with abnormal proliferation of clonal plasma cell, which is often accompanied by multiple osteolytic damage, hypercalcemia, anemia, and kidney damage. QLS4131 is a novel tri-specific humanized antibody. The study consists 3 periods: screening phase, treatment phase and a post-treatment follow-up phase. The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of QLS4131 administered to participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Total duration of study is up to 2 years.
