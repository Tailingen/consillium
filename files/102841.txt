An Observational Registry to Evaluate the Incidence of and Risk Factors for Vascular Occlusive Events Associated With ICLUSIGÂ®
This is an observational registry to further characterize the safety profile of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CP-CML), accelerated phase (AP-CML), blast phase (BP-CML), or Ph+ALL treated with Iclusig (ponatinib) in routine clinical practice in the US. The registry is focused on analysis of vascular occlusive events.
Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic-Phase, Accelerated-Phase, Blast-Phase, Ph+ALL
The incidence of Vascular Occlusive Events (VOEs) including, but not limited to: myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular ischemic disease, peripheral artery occlusive disease and venous thromboembolism, All VOEs will be entered into the EDC (Electronic Data Capture system), 54 months|Number of participants with the risk factors for development of VOEs, Subject medical history and family medical history will be entered into the EDC, 54 months|Composite outcome measure of VOEs, The category/type of outcome (e.g. Death, Disability/Permanent Damage, Hospitalization, Other), the time of duration, and status (continuing, resolved, fatal) will be entered into the EDC., 54 months
The registry is being conducted in an effort to better understand rates, risk factors, and outcomes associated with vascular occlusive events in patients treated with Iclusig (ponatinib) in real world settings. This registry study will collect information about patient demographics, leukemia diagnosis, previous anti-cancer treatments, history of cardiovascular disease, risk factors for vascular complications, and concurrent medications (including antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents).
