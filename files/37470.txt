Primary HPV Self-Collection in Indonesia
The purpose of this study is to implement human papillomavirus (HPV) self-collection in Indonesia.
Cervical Cancers|CIN - Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: HPV Self-Collection
Success Rate of HPV Self-Collection, number of subjects with valid HPV test results from self-collection / number of eligible subjects, from enrollment to receipt of results, up to 8 weeks
HPV Self-Collection Participation Rate, number of subjects with samples received at the laboratory / number of invited subjects, from enrollment to receipt of results, up to 8 weeks|HPV Self-Collection Invitation Coverage, number of subjects with valid HPV test results from self-collection / total eligible population in the catchment area, from enrollment to receipt of results, up to 8 weeks|Examination Coverage of HPV Self-Collection, number of subjects with samples received at the laboratory / total eligible population in the catchment area, from enrollment to receipt of results, up to 8 weeks|HPV Self-Collection Acceptance Rate, number of subjects who perform self-collection / number of subjects given HPV self-collection kits and instructions, from enrollment to specimen collection, up to 2 weeks|Preference for HPV Self-Collection, number of subjects who choose self-collection / number of subjects who answered survey questions, from enrollment to specimen collection, up to 2 weeks|Patient Follow-up Rate, number of subjects who receive VIA follow-up within 6 months / number of subjects with positive HPV tests, from receipt of results to follow-up exam, up to 6 months
HPV Test Validity, number of valid HPV test results / number of HPV tests, from specimen collection to receipt of results, up to 6 weeks|Time from HPV Self-Collection to Receipt of Sample in Lab, number of days from HPV self-collection until sample is received in the laboratory, from specimen collection to receipt of sample in laboratory, up to 2 weeks|Time from Receipt of Sample in Lab to Result Reporting, number of days from receipt of HPV sample in laboratory to availability of results, receipt of sample in laboratory to receipt of results, up to 4 weeks|Time from Result Reporting to Patient Follow-up, number of days from result reporting to patient presenting for follow-up examination, from receipt of results to follow-up exam, up to 6 months|Average Cycle Threshold Values by Genotype, average cycle threshold value for each genotype in all subjects with a reportable cycle threshold value for that genotype, from specimen collection to receipt of results, up to 6 weeks
After participants give informed consent, they will receive a short educational session about cervical cancer and HPV, after which they will be offered the opportunity to undergo primary HR-HPV testing via self-collection. Participants will be contacted within 4 weeks with their results. Those who test positive for high-risk HPV will receive a follow-up appointment, at which time visual assessment with acetic acid and/or colposcopy will be performed. Those with detectable lesions and/or HPV 16/18+ will undergo treatment with thermal ablation. If they are ineligible for thermal ablation, they will undergo cervical biopsy, endocervical curettage, and/or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) as indicated. Anyone with suspicion for cancer will undergo biopsies and referral to a gynecologic oncologist.
