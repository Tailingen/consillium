Pharmacokinetically-guided on the Individualization of Pembrolizumab Administration in the Treatment of Lung Cancer
Pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy has become the standard therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a fixed dose of 200mg every 3 weeks. The investigators performed this study to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided pembrolizumab administration in advanced NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: pembrolizumab
PFS, median progression-free survival, 18 months
In this prospective, open-label, single-arm exploratory study, the investigators enrolled advanced NSCLC patients without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutation in Sun yat-sen university cancer center. Eligible patients received pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks with or without chemotherapy for four cycles, then for patients without progressive disease, pembrolizumab was administrated in new dose-intervals according to steady state plasma-concentration (Css) of pembrolizumab until disease progression. Primary endpoint was the progression-free survival. Patients with Css of pembrolizumab also underthe investigatorsnt genetic polymorphism analysis of variable number of tandem repeats region (VNTR) in neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).
