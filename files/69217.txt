Erlotinib and Sequential Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a Phase-II Study to evaluate the accuracy of Fluorodeoxyglucose-/Fluorothymidine-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-/FLT-PET) analyses for early prediction of non-progression in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Erlotinib.
