A Study of Belzutifan (MK-6482) Plus Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Placebo Plus Pembrolizumab in Participants With Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Post Nephrectomy (MK-6482-022)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of oral belzutifan (MK-6482) plus intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab (MK-3475) compared to placebo plus pembrolizumab, in the adjuvant treatment of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) post nephrectomy.

The primary study hypothesis is that belzutifan plus pembrolizumab is superior to placebo plus pembrolizumab with respect to disease-free survival (DFS).
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Belzutifan|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Disease-Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es) as assessed by investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The DFS for all participants will be presented., Up to approximately 54 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 89 months|Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who experienced an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 66 weeks|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who discontinued the study due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 54 weeks|Disease Recurrence-Specific Survival 1 (DRSS1), DRSS1 is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence of RCC as assessed by the investigator. For DRSS1, only local recurrence is counted as an event., Up to approximately 54 months|Disease Recurrence-Specific Survival 2 (DRSS2), DRSS2 is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence with visceral lesion or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es) with visceral lesion, whichever occurs first, as assessed by investigator., Up to approximately 54 months|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Items 29 and 30 Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of participants with cancer. Participant responses to the questions "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 combined scores will be presented., Baseline (Day 1) and up to approximately 36 months|Change From Baseline in Physical Functioning Using the EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1- 5 Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Higher scores indicate a worse level of function. Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5 will be presented., Baseline (Day 1) and up to approximately 36 months|Change From Baseline in Role Functioning Using the EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 6 and 7 Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant responses to questions about their role functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Higher score indicate a worse level of function. Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 6-7 will be presented., Baseline (Day 1) and up to approximately 36 months|Change From Baseline in Disease Symptoms Using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-Disease-related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) Items 1-9 Score, The FKSI-DRS index consists of a 9-item questionnaire that assesses the extent of participant symptoms from kidney cancer. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all to 4=Very much) and summed to generate an index symptom score. These scores can range from 0 to 36, with a higher score indicating more favorable kidney cancer symptom status. Change from baseline in the score of FKSI-DRS Items 1-9 will be presented., Baseline (Day 1) and up to approximately 36 months
