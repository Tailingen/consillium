Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive procedures. The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic distal gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of robotic and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy in the treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma （cT1-4a, N-/+, M0）.
