Novel Imaging Techniques for the Characterization of Musculoskeletal Tumors II
This study aims at evaluating the value of various artificial intelligence based techniques to improve the characterization and image post-processing for patients with musculoskeletal tumors.
Soft Tissue Neoplasm|Bone Neoplasm
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MR imaging
Lesion benignancy or malignancy, Histologic determination of lesion aggressiveness (benign versus malignant) on core biopsy material, Performed up to 6 months after CT and Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging
Sarcoma FNCLCC (fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer) grade, Histologic grade of the sarcomas included in the study population with surgical resection material, Performed up to 1 year after CT and MR imaging
Comparison of values relating to the texture parameters of tumors evaluated by MRI and ultra-high resolution CT between benign and malignant lesions using histological analysis as the standard of reference.

Comparison of the diagnostic performance of texture parameters derived from different MRI sequences and ultra-high resolution CT for musculoskeletal tumor characterization.

Evaluate the impact of ultra-high resolution with respect to standard resolution on CT images Comparison of the diagnostic performance of the texture parameters for the tumor on the diagnostic performance of texture analysis derived parameters for the characterization of musculoskeletal tumors.

Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of automatic artificial intelligence (AI) based tumor segmentation tools.

Evaluate the use of trabecular analysis on ultra-high resolution CT images for the evaluation of tumor-bone interfaces.
