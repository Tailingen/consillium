This clinical trial is part of a broader research study (registered trial intervention ISRCTN21786830) which aimed to evaluate a palliative care nurse-led family-oriented intervention Family-Strengths Oriented Therapeutic Conversation (FAM-SOTC) to support family caregivers of a close relative with advanced/final stage cancer, in the context of the family when receiving specialized palliative home-care. The purpose of the current trial is to investigate the effects of the FAM-SOTC intervention when additionally delivering the third session of the intervention in this trial; an adapted version; FAM-SOTC Post-Loss and repeated post-intervention measures at 3, 5 and six months post-loss completed by bereaved family caregivers who have prior participated in the FAM-SOTC trial intervention pre-loss are compared to measures at 3, 5 and six months post-loss among bereaved family caregivers in a control group who received usual care pre- and post-loss from the palliative home-care unit. The FAM-SOTC intervention and the FAM-SOTC Post Loss intervention is delivered simultaneously in two separate clinical trials, where two sessions were delivered pre-loss (FAM-SOTC) and one session delivered post-loss (FAM-SOTC-PL).
