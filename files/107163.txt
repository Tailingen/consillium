Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Radical Surgery for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
This \[Study Type: Clinical Trial\] aims to \[Primary Objective: evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of robotic gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer\] in \[Participant Population: patients with locally advanced gastric cancer, aged \>18 years and \<75 years\]. The primary questions it seeks to answer are:

Is the 3-year disease-free survival rate of robotic gastrectomy non-inferior to that of laparoscopic gastrectomy? Is the perioperative safety of robotic gastrectomy superior to that of laparoscopic gastrectomy? Researchers will compare \[Intervention Groups: Robotic Gastrectomy vs. Laparoscopic Gastrectomy\] to determine whether \[robotic surgery offers advantages in long-term efficacy and perioperative safety\].

Participants will:

Sign an informed consent form and be randomly assigned to either the robotic surgery group or the laparoscopic surgery group.

Undergo the assigned surgical procedure and receive regular follow-up visits (at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 21 months, 2 years, 2.5 years, and 3 years postoperatively).

Complete physical examinations, blood tests (including complete blood count, biochemical markers, and tumor markers), and imaging studies (such as abdominal CT, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and chest X-ray) during the follow-up period.
