Mayo Clinic Upper Digestive Disease Survey
The Mayo Clinic Conduit Report Card Questionnaires have been created in order to have a consistent evaluation tools for patients undergoing esophageal reconstruction or treatment or patients that are experiencing an upper digestive disease in order to standardize and validate outcome measures. Data will be used to establish the validation of the questionnaires/survey. Data will also lead to the establishment of "normal" or expected scores for patients undergoing each type of esophagectomy procedure and for upper digestive diseases. Data will contribute to creating treatment algorithms for symptom management for upper digestive diseases and for post-operative complications and symptoms as well as contribute to pre-operative education.

We will also be collecting information on their demographics, operation, nutritional status, laboratory values, testing results and clinical outcomes.

Patients will be asked to complete the Mayo Clinic Upper Digestive Disease Survey at their one month surgical follow up visit and then every three months for 1 year after surgery, then with each surveillance clinic visit or a minimum of once per year for their lifetime for patients who undergo surgery and at one month following diagnosis and then every three months for 1 year after diagnosis, then with each surveillance clinic visit or a minimum of once per year for their lifetime for patients that do not undergo surgery.
