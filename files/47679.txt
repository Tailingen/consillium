A Study of Tucatinib Plus Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in HER2+ Breast Cancer
This trial studies how well the drug tucatinib works when given with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). It will also look at what side effects happen when these drugs are given together. A side effect is anything a drug does besides treating cancer.

Participants in this trial have HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer that has either spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed completely with surgery (unresectable). All participants will get both tucatinib and T-DXd.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: tucatinib|DRUG: trastuzumab deruxtecan
Confirmed objective response rate (cORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 according to investigator assessment, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years
Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 according to investigator assessment, DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of objective response to the first documentation of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 according to investigator assessment, PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1 according to investigator assessment, DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR, PR or stable disease according to RECIST v1.1, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to death due to any cause, From start of treatment up to approximately 5 years|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigational participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years|Incidence of dose modifications, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years|Incidence of treatment discontinuations, From start of treatment up to approximately 3 years
