Phase III Trial Comparing Methotrexate and Cetuximab in First-line Treatment of Recurrent and/or Metastatic Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer
To test whether cetuximab improves efficacy/tolerance as compared to methotrexate in first line treatment of unfit patients ³ 70 years old with recurrent and /or metastatic HNSCC. Efficacy assessed by failure free survival
Head Neck Cancer Squamous Cell Recurrent
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Methotrexate
Failure free survival (FFS), Composite criteria of efficacy and tolerance: Failure free survival (FFS) defined as time from randomization to the first event among progression (defined by RECIST criteria), treatment stop (whatever the cause), loss of 2 points or more in Activities in Daily Living (ADL) scale and death (whatever the cause). Patients who don't have any of these events are censored at the date of last follow-up., From randomization to the first event among progression, treatment stop, whatever the cause, loss of 2 points or more in ADL scale and death assessed up to 16 months
Overall survival (OS), Patients with disease progression will be treated off protocol but will be followed for overall survival evaluation., From randomization to death from any cause assessed up to 1 months|Progression free survival (PFS), minimum time from randomization to progression as defined by RECIST criteria or to death from any cause., From randomization to progression assessed up to 16 months
