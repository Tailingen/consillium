Evaluating the Accuracy of Microvessel Ultrasound Imaging for Detecting Extent of Disease in Patients With Angiosarcoma of the Skin
This study evaluates the accuracy of a new ultrasound technology called microvessel imaging for detecting the extent of disease among patients with angiosarcoma of the skin. Microvessel ultrasound imaging uses high frequency waves to visualize vessels in the skin that are not easily seen using other imaging tests.
Skin Angiosarcoma
DEVICE: Ultrasound Microvessel Imaging
Accuracy of microvessel ultrasound imaging, Accuracy with respect to gold standard quantitative measures of disease extent and imaging-based measurements will be evaluated using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient along with 95% confidence intervals (CI's). These will be performed separately pre- and post-treatment. Pearson correlations and 95% CI's between imaging modality measurements will also be estimated to help guide future comparative analyses. Bland-Altman plots will also be generated to visualize agreement., Through to study completion up to one year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the accuracy of depicting extent of disease of cutaneous angiosarcoma before and after neoadjuvant treatment compared to clinical photographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MR) or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging and surgical pathology both on skin biopsies and surgical excision.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo microvessel ultrasound imaging on study.
