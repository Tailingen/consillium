A Study of Escalating Doses of DCDS0780A in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of DCDS0780A in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
