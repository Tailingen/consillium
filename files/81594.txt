Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin With Concurrent Radiotherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: A Multicentre, Single-arm, Phase II Trial.
Based on the Phase I trial completed by the sponsor, the Phase II clinical trial aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of image guidance volume-modulated arc radiation therapy concurrently with Nab-Paclitaxel plus Cisplatin for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.
