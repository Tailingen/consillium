Induction Chemotherapy for Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer
This is a multicentre, open-label, parallel arms, phase IIII study that randomises patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive either induction chemotherapy followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery (experimental arm) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery alone (control arm)
Recurrent Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Combination drug|RADIATION: Chemoradiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Surgery locally recurrent rectal cancer
Proportion of patients with a clear resection margin, A resection margin is considered clear (R0), if there are no tumour cells in any of the resection surfaces as determined by microscopy (resection margin \> 0mm), Scored within 1 one month of surgery
