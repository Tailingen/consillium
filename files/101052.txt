Investigating Multigene Methylation Dynamics in Treatment Response Surveillance for Gastric Cancer
The primary objective is to determine whether pretreatment-to-posttreatment changes in circulating multigene methylation levels correlate with objective response rates (ORR) assessed by contrast-enhanced CT/MRI and levels of serum tumor markers. Secondary endpoints include: (a) time-dependent association between methylation fluctuation patterns and progression-free survival (PFS), (b) comparative diagnostic accuracy of methylation indices versus conventional biomarkers, and (c) feasibility of using methylation thresholds to guide adaptive therapy modification.

Multi-gene methylation levels, Group one: Preoperative, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years postoperatively.|Multi-gene methylation levels, Group two: pre-neoadjuvant therapy baseline, 1 week following neoadjuvant therapy, and postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months (1.5 years), 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years
Tumor Markers (including CEA, AFP, CA125, CA19-9, CA72-4, etc.), Tumor Markers (including CEA, AFP, CA125, CA19-9, CA72-4, etc.) results will be extracted from historical medical records, with test dates typically ranging from baseline (within 3 months pre-enrollment) to follow-up intervals aligned with standard clinical practice (e.g., every 3-6 months post-treatment). These time points may not synchronize with the methylation assessment schedule., Group one: Preoperative, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years postoperatively.|Imaging Examinations (including contrast-enhanced CT, PET/CT, ultrasound, X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.), Imaging examinations (including contrast-enhanced CT, PET/CT, ultrasound, X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.) results will be collected from patient records. Imaging time points are determined by clinical needs (e.g., pre-treatment staging, 3-month post-treatment follow-up), with intervals independent of the methylation analysis schedule. The minimum interval between imaging and methylation sampling will be recorded., Group one: Preoperative, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years postoperatively.|Endoscope, Endoscoping results will be collected from patient records.
