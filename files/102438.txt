A Study of ES102 in Combination With Toripalimab in Subjects With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of ES102 in combination with Toripalimab in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ES102|DRUG: Toripalimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by IRC, Proportion of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)., 1-2 years
ORR assessed by investigators, Proportion of subjects achieving CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigators., 1-2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects achieving CR, PR or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by IRC and investigators., 1-2 years|Duration of response (DOR), The time from first documented evidence of CR or PR to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, in subjects who demonstrate a CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 , as assessed by IRC and investigators., 1-2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the date of first study drug administration to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as assessed by IRC and investigators., 1-2 years|Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause., 1-2 years|Adverse events (AE), The number of subjects who experienced an adverse event (AE) will be presented. AE will be collected beginning with subject receiving first dose of the study drug until the time specified in the protocol., 1-2 years|Plasma concentration, Plasma concentration will be obtained by laboratory testing of blood samples taken from subjects before and after administration of the study drug., 1-2 years|Immunogenicity Toripalimab, Frequency of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against ES102 or Toripalimab will be determined., 1-2 years
