ESCAP-2020-CPHG: Treatment Strategies Follow-up Implemented During the First Three Years Following Primary Lung Cancer (PLC) Diagnosed in KBP-2020-CPHG Cohort Patients
The prognosis for primary lung cancer (PLC) is very limited. In France, patients diagnosed for PLC in 2010 and followed in Respiratory Medicine or Oncology department of a General Hospital Centre had a 5-year survival rate of 12.7% (vs 10% in 2000).

Over the last ten years, substantial improvements have been made both in terms of diagnostic (immunohistochemistry and molecular biology) and therapeutic. New treatments have been marketed and are now available in clinic.

New therapeutical strategies have been launched and have proved their efficacy in clinical studies or meta-analyses, generally increasing the survival rate of patients by a few months. However, little information still exists on the use and effectiveness of these molecules in clinical practice.

The CPHG proposes to complete the information collected during KPB-2020-CPHG study by the ESCAP-2020-CPHG study that is a follow-up of therapeutical strategies over the first 3 years of treatment. This study should improve knowledge of the PLC treatment management in General Hospital Centres.
