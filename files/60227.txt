VELCADE/Melphalan/Prednisone Versus Melphalan/Prednisone in Patients With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma
The primary reason for this study is to determine whether the addition of VELCADE (bortezomib) for injection to standard melphalan/prednisone (MP) therapy improves the time to disease progression (TTP) in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma.

Progression-free survival, overall response rate, overall survival, time to first response, duration of response, CR rate, and patient reported outcomes as assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30, FACIT-F and EQ-5D instruments.
