Physical Activity Program and Nutrition Therapeutic Education During Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer Population
The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of resistance training and physical functioning associated with nutrition therapeutic education in head and neck cancer patients, during their treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy).
Neck Cancer
PROCEDURE: APA
feasibility of the APA with a composite outcome measure, The evaluation criteria for the PA program will be:

* The success rate that will be reached if 80% of physical exercises will be performed by the patient, over the 3-month period,
* The level of satisfaction that will be evaluated with questionnaires filled by the patient., 3 months
Evaluation of the personalised diet program and the therapeutic education with a composite outcome measure., The evaluation criteria for the personalised diet program and the therapeutic education will be:

* The success rate that will be reached if 80% of requirements will be addressed by the patient,
* The level of satisfaction that will be evaluated with questionnaires filled by the patient., 3 months
The loss of muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) has been identified as a negative prognosis descriptor, disregarding the type of cancer. It is also a predictive descriptor for treatment-related toxicity. Therefore it appears crucial to save muscle mass of patients, following an adequate physical training together with a personalised diet program. The latter point is of major importance as malnutrition concerns 45% patients having head and neck cancer cancer, who stop physical activity due to extreme tiredness and decrease of quality of life. In the present project, we plan a physical activity program that would be adapted to each patient, accompanied by the rethought diet over a 3-month period. The adapted physical activity (APA) is constituted of two aerobic stages and one resistance training stage per a week. The evaluation will then proceed at three different moments, namely (i) at T0 i.e., beginning of the program, (ii) at 3 months i.e., when the program will be stopped, and (iii) at 6 months i.e., three months after the program stop. This evaluation will include the success rate, the level of satisfaction, the physiological parameters (VO2max, muscle mass and strength, BMI) and quality of life.
