Immunotherapy With Chemotherapy and Chemoradiation for Advanced Squamous Cancer of Nasal Cavity / Paranasal Sinuses (I-NAPA)
This is a single arm phase II study that will evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab, docetaxel, and cisplatin or carboplatin (PDC) as single treatment modality in patients with stage II-IVb (T2-4, any N, M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses (PNS SCC).

Primary Objective

-Increase overall response rate (ORR), following pembrolizumab combined with induction chemotherapy prior to radiation, from historical 60% with induction chemotherapy alone to 80%.

Secondary Objective

* Improve the following efficacy endpoints relative to historical results with chemotherapy alone: progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), organ \[orbital, maxillary, cranial\] preservation rate (OPR), and locoregional failure (LRF).
* To determine safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation in patients with PNS SCC.
* Correlate immune phenotype in tumors and blood, including T cell infiltration and PD-L1 status, with treatment outcomes.
