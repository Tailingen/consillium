Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with a confirmed Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and investigator-assessed complete or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1., Measured from first dose until confirmed response or progression, assessed up to 2 years.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from first dose until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression)., Measured from first dose until progression, assessed up to 2 years.|iRECIST Evaluated Progression Free Survival (iPFS), The interval between the initiation of study treatment and the first documentation of CUPD (second confirmation of Disease Progression) or death due to any cause as defined by the iRECIST standard in the single drug immunotherapy group, Measured from response until progression, assessed up to 2 years.|Duration of Response (DoR), The time from the date of first response until date of disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Measured from response until progression, assessed up to 2 years.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of patients treated with targeted and single immunotherapy assessed by the investigator,, Measured from first dose until confirmed response or progression, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.|Durable Clinical Benefit (DCB), Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) or Stable Disease (SD) in the single drug immunotherapy group and without Disease Progression at more than six months., Measured from first dose until confirmed response or progression, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.|Overall survival (OS), The median survival time of patients, Measured from first dose until death or final cohort data cut-off, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.|One year of Overall Survival rate (1-year OS rate), Percentage of patients who is alive at 1-year from first dose of treatment., Measured from first dose until death, assessed up to 2 years.|Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) in subjects, To evaluate safety and tolerability of each study treatment., Continuously from first dose to end of safety follow up after study treatment discontinuation, assessed up to 2 years.|The 6-month PFS rate, The proportion of patients who are alive and progression-free more than 6 months after the first dose of study therapy Progression-free Survival (PFS) the proportion of patients with PFS â‰¥ 6 months in the total enrollment since the start of the study., Measured from response until progression, assessed up to 2 years.
Based on the fact that a high incidence rate (14.2%) of rare tumor (incidence rate \<2.5/100,000) as defined in this study according to the National Cancer Registry data from National Cancer Center of China, as well as the current status of lacking guidelines and consensus of rare tumor treatment. We proposed this study "A Phase II, open label, non-randomized, multiple-arm, single-center clinical trial in patients with advanced rare solid tumors who failed to standard treatment", aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted drugs of specific tumor-driven genes in patients with advanced rare solid tumors with corresponding actionable alterations, as well as the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint (PD-1) inhibitors in patients with advanced rare solid tumors without actionable alterations. Patients with advanced rare tumors who failed to standardized treatment carrying actionable alterations as "EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion mutation, L858R replacement mutation), ALK gene fusion, ROS-1 gene fusion, C-MET gene amplification or mutation (D1010 mutation, 14 exon mutation, y1003 mutation), BRAF mutation, CDKN2A mutation, BRCA1/2 mutation, HER-2 mutation, HER-2 over expression/amplification, C-KIT mutation", will enroll targeted therapy arms and be given corresponding targeted drugs (Dacomitinib, Crizotinib). And patients without targeted alterations mentioned above will enroll PD-1 inhibitor arm and to be treated with Sintilimab. After acquired resistance patients treated with olaparib and palbociclib will receive combination treatment with durvalumab. After acquired resistance patients treated with vemurafenib will receive combination treatment with atezolizumab. The statistics of current study adopts Simon's two-stage Minimax design: In the first stage of clinical research, 12 subjects will be observed. If the number of CR + PR is less than 1, the trial will be terminated, otherwise, the group will continue to expand to 16 subjects. Therefore, in the first stage, there are 12\*5/(1-10%)=54 patients of targeted treatment group and 126 patients in the immunotherapy group, 180 patients totally in the first stage. If they all enter the second stage, the final target treatment group is 16\*5/(1-10%) = 72 patients and the immunotherapy group which has 168 patients which brings to a total of 240 patients. The sample size of the study shall be adjusted according to the interim analysis. Primary Endpoint of this study is objective response rate (ORR) in immunotherapy group and targeted therapy group assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and investigator. Secondary Endpoints are Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the targeted treatment group assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and investigator; PFS (RECIST 1.1) and iPFS (iRECIST) in the single drug immunotherapy group assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and investigator; Duration of Response (DoR) in the targeted therapy and single immunotherapy groups assessed by the investigator; Durable Clinical Benefit (DCB) in the single drug immunotherapy group; Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) in subjects ect.
