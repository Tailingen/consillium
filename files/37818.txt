Erlotinib and Momelotinib for the Treatment of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutated EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Naive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This study will evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of momelotinib (MMB) and erlotinib, as well as define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of momelotinib (MMB) combined with erlotinib in adults with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Participants will be sequentially enrolled to receive progressively increasing doses of momelotinib (MMB) in combination with erlotinib. Escalation of momelotinib (MMB) doses will proceed to the MTD, defined as the highest tested dose associated with dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first 28 days of combined erlotinib and momelotinib (MMB) treatment. There will be four dose levels and each treatment cycle will consist of 28 days.
EGFR Mutated EGFR TKI Naive Metastatic NSCLC
DRUG: Momelotinib (MMB)|DRUG: Erlotinib
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose limiting toxicities refer to toxicities experienced during the first 28 days of combined erlotinib and momelotinib (MMB) treatment that have been judged to be clinically significant and related to study treatment., Up to 28 days|Safety as Assessed by the Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Up to 2 years plus 30 days|Safety as Assessed by the Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Graded Lab Abnormalities (including Chemistry, Coagulation, Hematology, and Urinalysis), Up to 2 years plus 30 days|Change from Baseline in Vital Signs, Up to 2 years
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug (MMB/erlotinib) to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause; definitive disease progression is progression based on RECIST criteria v1.1., Until disease progression (up to 2 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug (MMB/erlotinib) to death from any cause., Until disease progression (up to 2 years)|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response or partial response., Until disease progression (up to 2 years)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax of momelotinib (MMB), Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration of drug., Predose and up to 24 hours postdose|PK Parameter: AUCtau of momelotinib (MMB), AUCtau is defined as concentration of drug over time (the area under the concentration verses time curve over the dosing interval)., Predose and up to 24 hours postdose|PK Parameter: Cmax of Erlotinib, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration of drug., Predose and up to 24 hours postdose|PK Parameter: AUCtau of Erlotinib, AUCtau is defined as concentration of drug over time (the area under the concentration verses time curve over the dosing interval)., Predose and up to 24 hours postdose
