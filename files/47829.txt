Transplantation of Hematopoietic Progenitors From Haploidentical Donor With Selective in Vitro Depletion Allo-reactive Lymphocytes in Patient With High Risk Hematological Malignancies
Therapeutic exploratory study to evaluate safety, open, nonrandomized, multicentre, prospective, of cohort of patients who will receive different doses of allo-depleted lymphocytes .

This project joins in this pioneering worldwide initiative with its own technology based on the use of proteasome inhibitors in vitro, which advantages are, over other methods described, the continuing viability of regulatory T cells and the use of a product to generate allo-depletion that, contrary to those reported by other research groups, it does not pose problems from the point of view of its use or toxicity as we employ a drug widely used clinically by intravenous administration.
Transplant-Related Hematologic Malignancy
OTHER: Allo-depleted lymphocyte infusion|OTHER: Haploidentical transplantation of hematopoietic progenitors
Number of adverse events and serious adverse events after allo-depleted lymphocyte infusion in vitro., 6 months
Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, 6 months
The main objective of the study is to determine the safety of transplantation of hematopoietic progenitors from haploidentical donor with in vitro allo-depleted lymphocyte infusion.

Secondary objectives:

* To assess the immune reconstitution pre and post-infusion of allo-depleted lymphocytes.
* To analyze the incidence of infections (CMV and aspergillus) post-transplant.
* To analyze the impact of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
* To optimize the dose of allo-depleted lymphocytes to reconstitute an immune response against pathogens without causing GVHD.
* To assess the rate of graft and myeloid and platelet engraftment time.
* To assess the rate of relapses, event-free survival and overall survival. It is hoped to recruit 20 clinically evaluable patients for safety purpose.

The inclusion period is not more than 2 Â½ years. Study duration shall not exceed three years from the inclusion of the first patient. The minimum follow-up of patients is 6 months after transplantation.

The first 5 patients (group 0) will receive haploidentical transplantation of hematopoietic progenitors without subsequent infusion of allo-depleted lymphocytes and then in cohorts of 3 patients, infuse +4 post-transplant day at doses of: 1x105 cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3)/kg(group 1), 3x105 CD3/kg (group 2), 5x105 CD3 / kg (group 3), 1x106 CD3/kg (group 4) and 3x106 CD3/kg (group 5).

Donor: it is performed one leukapheresis at least 30 days (4 weeks) prior to the scheduled progenitors infusion (day 0), in order to obtain effector T cells.
