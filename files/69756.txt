Toripalimab Plus Concurrent Chemo-radiotherapy for Unresectable Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Through multicenter, open-label, randomised clinical trials, we intend to demonstrate that concurrent and adjuvant PD-1 treatment added to concurrent chemo-radiotherapy could further decrease the rate of disease progression and improve the survival outcome of patients with unresectable locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with those treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy alone.

Through multicenter, open-label, randomised clinical trials, patients with unresectable locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma are randomized into concurrent chemo-radiotherapy plus concurrent and adjuvant PD-1 treatment group and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy alone group. The efficacy and safety of patients between these two groups are compared.
