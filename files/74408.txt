Prospective Validation of a Points Score System Predicting 30-day Survival
This is a one-stage single-arm phase II clinical trial designed to prospectively test the survival prediction tool as developed by Lee et al on patients referred to radiation oncology for palliative treatments. Survival prediction score based on objective data including laboratory values, attendance to emergency room, and primary cancer origin will be assigned to each patient at time of enrollment.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Point score prediction tool for 30-day survival
30-day survival of patients with a score of >14 (high-risk group), The percentage of patients with a score of \>14 who are living at 30 days following enrollment, From baseline to 30 days after enrollment
The percentage of patients in each risk group (low, intermediate, and high) who are living at 30 days, 90 days, and 365 days following enrollment, Review of medical records., 30 days, 90 days and 365 days after enrollment|Tabulated patient-report quality of life surveys at 30 days, 90 days, and 365 days, Using the FACIT-Pal-14© questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care 14 Item Version, Baseline, 30 days, 90 days and 365 days after enrollment
This is a one-stage single-arm phase II clinical trial designed to prospectively test the survival prediction tool as developed by Lee et al (section 10.0) on patients referred to radiation oncology for palliative treatments. Survival prediction score based on objective data including laboratory values, visits to emergency room, and primary cancer origin will be assigned to each patient at time of enrollment. The prediction tool assigns a score from 0-20, with 20 indicating the worst survival prognosis; the investigators have designated mortality risk groups as follows: low-risk (score 0-6), intermediate-risk (score 7-13), and high-risk (score 14-20). Patient survival and quality of life will then be monitored at 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day intervals. The study will test the hypothesis that patients with a score of \>14 have a less than 20% chance of survival at 30 days.

Primary Objective:

1. To evaluate 30-day survival of patients with a score of \>14 (high-risk group)

Secondary Objectives:

1. To evaluate 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day survival of patients in low-risk (score 0-6), and intermediate-risk (score 7-13) groups, and to evaluate 90-day and 365-day survival of patients in high-risk group (score \>14)
2. To evaluate patient-reported quality of life at the above intervals using the validated FACIT-Pal-14© questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care 14 Item Version)
