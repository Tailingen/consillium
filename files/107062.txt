Surgery Versus Endoscopic Resection for Incompletely Removed Early Colon CAnceR
Randomized head-to-head comparison trial among patients who have undergone incomplete endoscopic resection of early colon cancer to evaluate the benefits, harms and burdens, as well as the ecological footprint and cost-effectiveness of endoscopic full thickness resection (eFTR), a minimally invasive endoscopic treatment with a colonoscope, as compared to standard-of-care surgery.

Co-primary endpoints are

* Rate of severe adverse events classified as grade III to V according to the Clavien Dindo classification within 30-days after study treatment
* CRC recurrence or sign of lymph nodes or distant metastases at 3 years after randomization comparing the two treatment groups (eFTR versus surgery).
