Feasibility Study of the Microwave Ablation System for Lung Tissue Ablation
Evaluation of safety and technical feasibility of the phenoWave MW Ablation System for microwave ablation of lesions in the lung.
Lung Neoplasm
DEVICE: Flexible Bronchoscopic Microwave Ablation
Safety - AE occurrence, Incidence of complications and occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs), up to 7 days post ablation|Safety - AE frequency, Frequency of AEs, up to 7 days post ablation|Safety - ablated tissue assessment, Percentage of ablated tissue within tumor boundary as assessed on gross and/or histologic evaluation, up to 7 days post ablation|Technical Feasibility, Evidence of thermal ablation in portion of the tumor as assessed on histopathology, up to 7 days post ablation
Navigational Success, Measured distance of phenoWave device tip relative to the planned position from CT data, Immediately after completion of procedure (day 0)|Procedural Measures, Total procedure time and navigation time to position the device, Immediately after completion of procedure and navigation to the target (day 0)
This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, study to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of using the phenoWave MW Ablation System to deliver microwave energy for ablation of lesions in the lung.
