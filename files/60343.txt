Patients with EBV-associated lymphomas have inferior outcomes with standard-of-care therapies compared to those with EBV-negative disease. Nanatinostat is a selective class I HDAC inhibitor which induces EBV lytic phase protein generation, activating (val)ganciclovir to its cytotoxic form. This open-label, multicenter, multinational, single-arm, Phase 2 basket study employs a Simon's 2-stage design to allow termination of enrollment into cohorts where treatment appears futile, and will include the following cohorts of patients with EBV+ relapsed/refractory lymphomas:

1. EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, NOS)
2. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), including PTCL-NOS and AITL
3. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)
4. EBV+ lymphoproliferative disorders other than the above, including Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL)

The study was terminated prematurely and did not reach its target enrollment.
