Exploration of Therapeutic Strategies for NeoRAS Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Based on Circulating Tumor DNA
Following systemic therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC),RAS (including KRAS, NRAS and HRAS gene) status may change from a mutant(MT) to a wild-type(WT),a phenomenon known as "NeoRAS WT"mCRC.NeoRAS WT can be detected by longitudinal circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) analysis.Therefore, this prospective phase II Study was design to explore the detection rate of peripheral blood ctDNA testing for NeoRAS WT and its guiding value for subsequent treatment for mCRC.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Cetuximab
Detection rate of NeoRAS WT, Proportion of occurrence of neoRAS WT, up to 60 months
Objective response rate(ORR) of NeoRAS wild-type patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy, Objective response rate of NeoRAS wild-type patients receiving anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) therapy, Follow-up was conducted for 2 years after enrollment|Progression-free survival (PFS) in NeoRAS WT patients, Progression-free survival (PFS) : time from enrollment to disease progression from any cause, Follow-up was conducted for 2 years after enrollment|Overall survival (OS) in NeoRAS WT patients, Overall survival (OS) : time from enrollment to death from any cause, loss of participants, and time of last follow-up, Follow-up was conducted for 2 years after enrollment
