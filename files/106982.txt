Advanced Solid Malignancies|Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: MLN0128|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: trastuzumab
Dose Escalation Phase: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is the highest dose level at which the participants tolerate treatment without dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle (28 days) of therapy., Cycle 1: Days 1 to 28|Dose Escalation Phase: Number of Participants With at Least 1 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as any of the following occurring during Cycle 1 (Days 1-28) and attributable to MLN0128P: Grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage; Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \> 7 days in the absence of growth factor support; Grade 4 neutropenia of any duration associated with fever 38.5 degrees C and/or infection; Any other Grade 4 hematologic toxicity; Inability to administer at least 75 % of doses of MLN0128 within Cycle 1 due to drug-related toxicity; Any clinically significant occurrence which the investigators and sponsor agree would place participants at undue safety risk; Participants who experienced an adverse event (AE) that met the definition for a DLT., Cycle 1: Days 1 to 28|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Each cycle was a 28 day cycle. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and for non-target lesions, the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined of at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and for non-target lesions., At screening and thereafter every 2 cycles of treatment until disease progression (Up to 65.8 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events(SAEs), AEs Resulting in Discontinuation of MLN0128 and Fatal AEs Within 30 Days of Last Dose of Study Drug, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant., First dose of study drug through 30 days after the administration of the last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 91.4 weeks)

This is a Phase I, open-label study consisting of a dose escalation phase in advanced solid malignancies to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral administration of MLN0128 in 1 or more dosing schedules, combined with paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, followed by an expansion phase for further safety and preliminary efficacy.

Once the MTD is determined for each of the dosing schedules evaluated, a dose and schedule will be selected for the expansion phase, which may enroll participants into 2 arms in parallel:

* Arm A will consist of HER2- unknown cancer participants receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel
* Arm B will consist of HER2+ cancer participants receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel plus weekly trastuzumab
