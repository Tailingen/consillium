A Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Study of TAS-114 in Combination With Capecitabine in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this exploratory study is to investigate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TAS-114 in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors for which the patients have no available therapy likely to convey clinical benefit.
Neoplasms
DRUG: TAS-114/capecitabine
The MTD of TAS-114/ capecitabine (defined as the highest dose level at which less than 33% of the patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment); DLTs defined by protocol, Only drug-related toxicities during the first cycle are considered in the assessment of DLTs., First cycle of treatment (ie. 21 days)
Pharmacokinetic profiles (peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of TAS-114, capecitabine and it's metabolite 5-FU), First cycle of treatment (ie. 21 days)|antitumor activity by tumor assessments according to RECIST criteria, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months
In animal models, co-administration of TAS 114 and capecitabine has shown antitumor effects exceeding the maximum efficacy obtained by capecitabine alone. Developing a novel chemotherapy based on the combined use of TAS-114 and capecitabine may fulfill the need for more efficacious treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors.

The study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of the TAS-114/ capecitabine regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors, will be conducted in two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the MTD; and an Expansion Phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy with the MTD.
