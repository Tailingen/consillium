Active Surveillance for Cancer of the Prostate (ASCaP)
Active Surveillance (A.S.) of prostate cancer (CaP) is the systematic monitoring of men with low-risk, localized lesions, with curative treatment of those whose tumors show substantial progression. A.S. is different from Watchful Waiting (W.W.), which is the palliative treatment of men with progressive prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Active surveillance
Discover and confirm clinical parameters that predict aggressive disease as defined by pre-specified histological, PSA, clinical criteria, or outcomes based on these variables., Interim data analysis will be made every year
Determine the clinical predictors of disease progression. Measure the recurrence-free, disease-specific, and overall survival of men on active surveillance for clinically localized prostate cancer. Determine factors that lead to active intervention, Interim data analysis will be done each year
This protocol is not designed as a formal clinical trial, but rather an observational protocol; no treatments and no randomization are included. Longitudinally, specimens and clinical data will be collected to provide information on the following:

* Imaging studies of the prostate
* Rates of curative intervention
* Measures of tumor recurrence/progression
* Disease specific survival
* Overall survival
* Clinical data to track Quality of Life
