Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) With Lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) vs. Docetaxel in Participants With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Progressive Disease (PD) After Platinum Doublet Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy (MK-7902-008/E7080-G000-316/LEAP-008)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) with lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) vs. docetaxel in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and progressive disease (PD) after platinum doublet chemotherapy and treatment with one prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). The primary hypotheses of this study are that pembrolizumab + lenvatinib (compared with docetaxel) prolongs: 1) overall survival (OS); and progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on blinded independent central review (BICR).
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Docetaxel
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Up to ~47 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

For each item, scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher GHS/QoL. Per protocol, scores for items 29 and 30 will be averaged to compute a combined GHS/QoL scale score. Change from baseline in the combined GHS/QoL scale scores is presented., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline in EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ-LC13) Cough (Item 31) Scale Score, Used in combination with QLQ-C30, the EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a supplemental lung cancer-specific module, including a single-item scale score for cough (Item 31). For this item, individual responses to the question "How much did you cough?" are given on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all; 4=Very much). Scores are transformed to a range from 0-100, with a lower score indicating a better outcome.
