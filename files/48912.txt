A Study of the Safety and Effects of ADH-1 Given Daily to Subjects With Solid Tumors
N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding, is increased as cancer progresses, and is on the surface of many tumor cells. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study will test the safety and effects of ADH-1 in subjects with incurable, solid tumors with a protein biomarker called N-cadherin. This study will identify the amount of ADH-1 that subjects can tolerate.
