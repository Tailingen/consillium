Short Course vs. Standard Course Radiotherapy in Elderly and/or Frail Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme
This is a multi-centre prospective, non-inferiority trial. Patients will be randomized to two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio and will be stratified by age, Karnofsky Performance Status and extent of the surgical resection.

This study will assess the effect of a one-week radiotherapy regimen in comparison with a three-week radiotherapy regimen on the survival of elderly and/or frail patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Frail: ≥\>50 years old and with a KPS of 50% or less50%-70%; Elderly and frail: ≥65 years and with a KPS of 50% - 70%; Elderly: ≥65 years and with a KPS of 80% - 100%).

This is a multi-centre prospective, non-inferiority trial. Patients will be randomized to two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio and will be stratified by:

* Age (\<65 and ≥65 years old)
* Karnofsky Performance Status (≤70 and \> 7050 or higher)
* Extent of the resection at surgery (biopsy only versus complete/near total and gross total or incomplete /partial resection)

Randomization:

Patients will be randomized to receive one of the two following treatments:

Arm 1:

* Short Radiotherapy
* 25 Gy/5 fractions
* 1 week (5 fractions per week)

Arm 2:

* Regular Radiotherapy
* 40 Gy/15 fractions
* 3 weeks (5 fractions per week)
