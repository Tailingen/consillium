Prognostic Markers for a Better Follow-up in Head and Neck Cancer.
To identify tumor specific DNA mutations and aberrations and to follow these in blood over time to predict treatment response/survival and secondly to correlate presence of these markers in blood to pathological parameters (LVI, Pn, WPOI and margins), radiological findings and to tumor stage.
Head and Neck Cancer
GENETIC: DNA exome sequencing of tumor and blood
Recurrence, Recurrent disease within 2 years after surgery. Is presence of these DNA changes in blood correlated to recurrence?, 2 years|Survival, Alive/dead. Is presence of these DNA changes in blood correlated to survival?, 2 years|Treatment response, Is presence of these DNA changes in blood correlated to treatment response?, 6 months
Pathological parameters, Is presence of these DNA changes correlated to pathological parameters (LVI, Pn, WPOI and margins)., 6 months|Radiological parameters, Is presence of these DNA markers in blood correlated to PET-findings?, 9 months|Stage, If patients are stratified by stage, are there any differences in Outcome 1-5 (please see above), 2 years
