Assessment of High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygenation in EBUS Bronchoscopy
This study is a prospective randomised trial where a computer will randomly allocate

patients to one of two possible methods of delivering oxygen during the procedure of

bronchoscopy. This trial compares high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with nasal prongs in

delivering oxygen to patients undergoing endo-bronchial ultrasound guided trans-

bronchial nodal aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) a specialised form of bronchoscopy procedure.

HFNC uses humidified higher gas flow rates than conventional low flow systems such as

nasal prongs which are limited by the respiratory rate and effort.

drop in oxygen saturation during procedure, the difference in oxygen saturation levels between pre-treatment assessments and the lowest saturation level achieved during treatment, through procedure completion defined as withdrawing scope from patient's mouth, an average of 30 minutes
change in venous CO2, Change in venous CO2 1 hour after procedure compared to pre-procedure level, 1 hour after procedure|end tidal CO2 during procedure, Measured with tip of scope at lower trachea, through procedure completion defined as withdrawing scope from patient's mouth an average of 30 minutes|Patient experience measure on a visual analogue scale, up to 3 hours after procedure|endotracheal intubation during or post procedure, 24 hours
