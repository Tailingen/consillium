3D-biomodels for Surgical Planning in Patients With Renal Cancer and Vascular Involvement
Objectives:

Apply 3D- printed biomodels in patients with renal cancer (RCa) and vascular involvement (VTT) to: (1) improve surgical planning, (2) upgrade surgical results, (3) facilitate communication with patients, (4) serve as a model for teaching residents and (5) shortening the learning curve in experienced urologists.

Methodology:

The design of the study is a randomized clinical trial, to determine the safety, precision, feasibility, predictability, efficacy and efficiency of a surgical strategy based on imaging tests and 3D models regarding the surgical planning in patients with RCa and VTT. This is a longitudinal, prospective, experimental and multicenter study on a cohort diagnosed of RCa and VTT from 2018 in the Virgen del Rocío University Hospital (HUVR) or in the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital (HURC). The study will last for 3 years and will be carried out jointly by the HUVR, the HURC and the IBIS, in a multidisciplinary team made up of urologists, radiologists and engineers.

Phase 1, obtaining the 3D printed biomodel and study of feasibility.

Distribution of tasks: Conducted jointly by:

* Radiology team of the HUVR: Segmentation and 3D virtual reconstruction of the image tests. Compare measurements with image tests.
* IBIS / HUVR engineering team. Design and development of specific segmentation algorithm for the tissue selection of interest. Modeling of image and printing of the 3D model.
* Urology team of the HUVR. Identification of anatomical structures and taking measurements in the 3D model. Simulation of surgery following the surgical guide.
* Production center: It will be carried out entirely in the HUVR.
* Process: custom and manufacture 3D models to perform a surgical simulation using imaging tests of operated patients, with different characteristics until achieving an optimum prototype. Different anatomical structures will be measured and compared in the model and in the image (Collection sheet of data). Later, we will check if it is possible to perform a surgical simulation on the model reproducing in it each of the steps necessary to perform the surgery (surgical guide, annex 3).

Phase 2, precision and predictability study:

Distribution of tasks: Conducted jointly by:

* HUVR radiology team and HURC radiology team. Segmentation and 3D virtual reconstruction of the image tests. Taking measurements in image tests.
* IBIS / HUVR engineering team. 3D model printing.

Real surgery and taking measurements in real surgery.

* Production center: 3D printing in the HUVR, precision and predictability study, HUVR and HURC.
* Process: all patients diagnosed with CaR and TTV in the HUVR and HURC will be recruited between the years 2018 and 2021 and will be randomized into two groups. In the control group the surgical planning will be based exclusively on image tests. In the intervention group we will carry out a surgical planning based on imaging tests and the 3D model (on which we will perform a surgical simulation following the guide surgical). Subsequently, the surgery will be carried out, and in each of the groups it will be compared (Gold Standard) with the pre-surgical planning performed.
* precision study Anatomical measurements will be taken before the surgical intervention in the image models, in the 3D model and subsequently in vivo during surgery
* predictability study A prediction will be made of the type of surgery to be performed, the complications, and the necessary human and material resources.

Phase 3, efficacy and efficiency study:

* HUVR urology team and urology team HURC. Data Collect.
* Process: We will check if a surgical planning with image tests and 3D model makes the surgery more effective and efficient than the one based exclusively on imaging tests. Efficacy, will be defined as the ability to achieve a good surgical result. Efficiency will be defined as the ability to obtain good results with the minimum possible costs and in the minimum possible time.

Phase 4, study of satisfaction level with surgical planning based on 3D model and learning curve of urologists:

* HUVR Urology team and HURC urology team: Delivery of satisfaction surveys and data collection.
* HUVR urology team: Comparison of learning curves.
