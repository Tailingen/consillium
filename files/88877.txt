Ultrasound Guided Block of Stellate Ganglion Versus Greater Occipital Nerve in Resistant Migraine and Correlation to Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide
To investigate the efficacy of Ultrasound guided Stellate Ganglion block in chronic resistant migraine patients in comparison to Greater Occipital Nerve Block correlating its effect to serum CGRP level.
Migraine
PROCEDURE: ultrasound guided Greater occipital nerve block|PROCEDURE: Ultrasound guided Stellate ganglion block
Changes in Headache impact test (HIT-6), Each of the six questions of the HIT-6 receives a score from 6-13. The final HIT-6 score can range from 36 to 78. A higher score indicates more disability due to headache., 3 months|changes in Migraine disability assessment test (MIDAS), The MIDAS questionnaire is based on five disability questions that focus on lost time in three domains: school work or work for pay; household work or chores; and family, social, and leisure activities. The scoring is:

0-5: little or no disability 6-10: mild disability 11-20: moderate disability 21+: severe disability, 3 months|changes in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), a score used to assess pain severity at that moment in time using a 0-10 scale, with zero meaning "no pain" and 10 meaning "the worst pain imaginable", 3 months
Changes in circulating CGRP level, 1 month
40 Patients diagnosed with Chronic resistant migraine to 2 anti-migraine drugs for 3 months will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion. Eligible patients with resistance or intolerability to 2 drugs or more will be classified into two groups by using simple randomization methods through Using a computer-generated random number sequence.

Each group will contain 20 patients one group will undergo ultrasound guided bilateral Greater Occipital nerve Block and the other group will undergo ultrasound guided bilateral Stellate Ganglion Block
