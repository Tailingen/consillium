SBRT Combined With Osimertinib Compared With Osimertinib for Stage IV NSCLC
This is a Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Controlled study to evaluate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) as a potential treatment for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has a mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has been receiving treatment with Osimertinib
