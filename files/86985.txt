A Phase I/II Study of BI-505 in Conjunction With Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of administering BI-505 in conjunction with high dose melphalan and stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma patients.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: BI-505|OTHER: High dose melphalan|OTHER: Autologous stem cell transplantation
Phase I: Determine the safety and feasibility of administering BI-505 in conjunction with HDM+ASCT in multiple myeloma patients, UNK, Adverse events will be assessed within 30 days of ASCT in the safety part of the study.|Phase II: Determine the effect of BI-505 on rate of stringent complete response for multiple myeloma patients with measurable disease pre-ASCT., UNK, At Day 100 after ASCT
Determine the effect of BI-505 on rate of stringent complete response (sCR) at day 100 in subgroups stratified according to response to initial therapy (+/- VGPR)., UNK, Day 100 after ASCT|Determine the effect of BI-505 administered in conjunction with HDM + ASCT on IMWG response category (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR) at one year post-ASCT and progression-free survival., UNK, At one year and up to three years after ASCT|Evaluate the effect of BI-505 on MRD-negative rate at day 100 and change in MRD status at day 100 compared to baseline., UNK, Day 100|Evaluate anti-myeloma effect of BI-505 monotherapy, prior to HDM + ASCT, UNK, Prior to HDM + ASCT (from Day -17 until Day 0)|Evaluate bone marrow immune cell composition and phenotype, including macrophage infiltration and expression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression on multiple myeloma plasma cells, as potential biomarkers of response to BI-505, UNK, Day 100 compared to Baseline (Day -17 and Day -2)|Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of BI-505 in this clinical setting by analysing Cmax, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), All dosing visits throughout the study (up to 9 biweekly infusions of BI-505).
