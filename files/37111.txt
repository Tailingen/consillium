A Study of High Dose Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer That Responded to Initial Chemotherapy Treatment
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of high-dose radiation therapy after initial chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The main question it aims to answer is:

• For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that responded to initial chemotherapy (stayed stable or decreased in size), will high-dose RT (radiation therapy) contribute to improving treatment outcomes, enhancing quality of life, or increasing overall survival rates?

Participants will:

* Undergo an optional tumor biopsy.
* Be treated with high dose radiation therapy.
* Complete quality of life questionnaires.
* Donate research blood samples.
