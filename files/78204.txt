Vaccine Therapy in Treating Women With Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vaccine
Characterize the safety profile of the Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector vaccine|Identification of a tolerable, immunologically active dose level
Assess efficacy based on serum MUC-1 level
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Characterize the safety profile of Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vaccine in women with metastatic breast cancer.
* Identify a tolerable, immunologically active dose level of this vaccine in these patients.

Secondary

* Evaluate the immune function in these patients before and after treatment with this vaccine.

OUTLINE: Patients receive MUC-1 vector vaccine subcutaneously on day 0.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 9 months.
