A Phase 1 Trial of ERX-315 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study to assess the safety of ERX-315 in patients with advanced solid tumors that have failed approved systemic therapies.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Breast Cancer|Metastatic Ovarian Cancer|Metastatic Endometrial Cancer|Metastatic Liver Cancer|Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: ERX-315
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities of ERX-315, First cycle dose limiting toxicities characterized by type, frequency, severity, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug, 21 days|Incidence of Adverse Events as a measure of safety and tolerability of ERX-315, Adverse events as characterized by type, frequency, severity (grade), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug., 84 days|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities as a measure of safety and tolerability of ERX-315, Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity, and timing., 84 days|Determination of the recommended phase 2 dose, To determine the recommended phase 2 dose(s) for additional evaluation of ERX-315 in clinical trials for participants with advanced solid tumors, 84 days
Assessment of pharmacokinetic outcome measure of Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)., AUC will be determined by non-compartmental analysis and assessed after single and multiple doses of drug, 21 days|Assessment of pharmacokinetic outcome measure of Peak Plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax will be determined by non-compartmental analysis and assessed after single and multiple doses of drug, 21 days|Assessment of pharmacokinetic outcome measure of drug half-life (t1/2), t1/2 will be assessed after single and multiple doses of drug, 21 days|Antitumor activity of ERX-315 based on Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be assessed by RECIST v1.1, 84 days|Antitumor activity of ERX-315 based on Best Overall Clinical Response (BOCR), BOCR will be assessed by RECIST v1.1, 84 days|Antitumor activity of ERX-315 based on Duration of response (DOR), DOR will be assessed by RECIST v1.1 and time frame of response, 84 days|Antitumor activity of ERX-315 based on Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS will be assessed by RECIST v1.1 and time frame of response, 84 days
Impact on patient reported symptoms using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) Questionnaire, Effect of ERX-315 on the changes from baseline in patient reported symptoms using the PRO-CTCAE Questionnaire, 84 days|Serum LIPA lipase activity as pharmacodynamic markers of ERX-315 activity, The effect of ERX-315 on serum LIPA lipase activity may be evaluated, 84 days|Circulating tumor DNA levels as pharmacodynamic markers of ERX-315 activity, The effect of ERX-315 on circulating tumor DNA levels may be evaluated, 84 days
The goal of this open-label, dose escalation and cohort expansion Phase 1 clinical trial is to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ERX-315 in patients with advanced solid tumors, who have progressed on prior approved systemic therapies. Participants will receive ERX-315 as an intravenous (IV) injection twice a week, over 21-day cycles.
