Emotional Support Messages Following a Cancer Diagnosis
Cancer patients will be randomly shown one of 18 emotional support messages created by the research team that differ based on how much of the message consists of positive statements and how much consists of negative statements. The messages with negative statements also differ based on whether the negative statements occur at the start or end of the message. After viewing the message, participants have the opportunity to rate the effectiveness of the message, to what extent the message made them feel better, and to what extent the message affects how they view the message provider as a useful source of emotional support.
