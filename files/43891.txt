Prospective Translational Study Investigating Predictors of Outcome in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients Treated With Nivolumab (I-Rene Trial)
Prospective translational study investigating predictors of outcome in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with Nivolumab (I-Rene trial)
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Investigate the predictive role of circulating miRNAs will be studied with OpenArray technology (OA, Thermo Fisher), To investigate the predictive role of circulating miRNAs in patients who respond to nivolumab versus those who do not respond before treatment, after two infusions (4 weeks), at the first radiological re-evaluation (12 weeks) and at the time of disease progression., 36 months|To evaluate whether the immunological profile of tumor tissue or circulating tumor cells Using Multiplexed Biomarker Imaging (MBI), multiparametric flow cytometry, To evaluate whether the immunological profile of tumor tissue or circulating tumor cells may be a potential predictor of clinical response in patients treated with nivolumab. Using Multiplexed Biomarker Imaging (MBI), multiparametric flow cytometry, 36 months|Characterize alterations in genes and signal transmission pathways. Using Next Generation Sequencing, NGS), o characterize alterations in genes and signaling pathways and to identify mutational burden differences between tumors of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who respond or not to nivolumab., 36 months
