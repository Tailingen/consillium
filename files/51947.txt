Comparison Between PECS BLOCK 2 vs ESP BLOCK in Ocnologic Breast Surgery
The study aims to compare the efficacy of the two operating blocks PECS2 and ESP by measuring postoperative opioid consumption and, secondarily, to compare (between PECS and ESP) postoperative opioid consumption between surgery with/without axillary cavity dissection and with/without implantation of prosthesis or expansion

Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer in the female population. Early detection is the most effective tool for improving prognosis, and the surgical approach plays a central role in the treatment of this disease. However, many are the psychophysical implications that patients face: among the main ones is postoperative and chronic pain, a symptom that greatly worsens the quality of life.

In the last decade it has been witnessed an important development of locoregional anesthesia techniques in all surgeries. In breast surgery, particularly mastectomy, the following locoregional anesthesia techniques are referred to as the Gold Standard:

1. PVB (Paravertebral Block)
2. PECS2 BLOCK (or modified PECS). For the same purposes, ESP Block (Erector Spinae Plane Block) has been applied experimentally, which has already shown its effectiveness in breast surgery in several trials.

By comparing postoperative opioid consumption between the two groups of patients, divided into PECS Block and ESP Block, the study aims to identify which anesthesia block is most effective in order to improve the care of patients undergoing mastectomy.
