Paclitaxel and Carboplatin Combination as 1st Line Treatment in Ovarian Carcinomas
This trial will determine the feasibility and toxicity of dose intense (every 2 weeks) of paclitaxel+carboplatin combination following cytoreductive surgery in patients with stage Ic-IV ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the response rate, Toxicity assestment of the 1st cycle for the first 10 patients. Objective responses confirmed by CT or MRI (on 3rd and 6th cycle)
Toxicity profile, Toxicity assessment on each cycle|Time to tumor progression, 1 year
Dose dense chemotherapy has been proven beneficial in various oncological settings. It is proposed that this concept be tested in ovarian cancer, with the support of growth factors. It is hypothesized that, if feasible, dose-dense chemotherapy may be more effective.
