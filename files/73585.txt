A Real-world Clinical Study of Pyrotinib Maleate Tablets in the Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients With Positive Her-2
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib Maleate Tablets in the treatment of advanced breast cancer patients with positive her-2.
HER2 Positive Breast Carcinoma
PFS, Progress free survival is defined as the length of time from random assignment to disease progression or to death resulting from any cause other than the progress., 1 year|pCR, Pathological complete response is the breast primary focus and axillary lymph node surgery specimen pathological examination without invasive tumor cell residual, 1 year
OS, overall survival is defined as the length of time from random assignment to death or to last contact., 1 year|AE, adverse events are evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0., 1 year|ORR, Objective tumor response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response as best overall response according to radiological assessments, 1 year|DCR, Disease control rate (DCR) refers to the percentage of cases with remission and disease stability after treatment in the total number of evaluable cases, 1 year|DFS, Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from the beginning of randomization to recurrence or death due to Disease progression, 1 year|DDFS, Disease /recurrence free survival (DDFS) refers to a period of time after treatment for a tumor patient where no metastatic lesions were found anywhere else in the body except for the accident of the primary lesion, 1 year
This study intends to carry out multicenter, observational cohort clinical research, using maleic acid pyrrole for his piece of HER-2 positive treatment of advanced breast cancer treatment, observation and verification maleic acid pyrrole for his piece for a line or a single drug resistance by bead in the real diagnosis and treatment in patients with advanced breast cancer environment and the efficacy and safety of new treatments. Biomarkers of breast cancer prognosis are of great significance in predicting the degree of malignancy, metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer, as well as guiding clinical treatment programs.This study will explore the prognostic factors and curative effect of breast cancer patients from multiple aspects, explore the dominant population of breast cancer patients with pyrrolidone maleate, and provide the theoretical basis for individualized treatment for clinical treatment practice.
