Tislelizumab, Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for R/R Hodgkin Lymphoma Followed by Tislelizumab Consolidation in Patients in Metabolic Complete Remission
This trial investigates the efficacy and safety of the drug tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a treatment for patients with R/R HL. Tislelizumab is given in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) followed by consolidation with tislelizumab alone. The study primary question is whether this strategy works as well as the standard treatment with intensive chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant.
