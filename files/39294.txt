Safety and Efficacy of Anti-CD123 CAR-T Therapy in Patients With Refractory/ Relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients with refractory/relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

Overall remission rate(ORR) of anti-CD123 CAR-T Therapy in patients with refractory/relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia, ORR will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 3 years|Overall survival(OS) of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients with refractory/relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia, OS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 3 years|Duration of Response(DOR) of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients with refractory/relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia, DOR will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 3 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients with refractory/relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia, PFS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 3 years|Rate of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) rate and quantity of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry., 3 years|Quantity of anti-CD123 CAR copies in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of anti-CD123 CAR copies were determined by means of qPCR., 3 years
CD123 is a transmembrane subunit of the IL-3 receptor expressed on AML blasts. The investigators have conducted a third generationCD123-targeted CAR containing CD137 and CD28 costimulatory domains.This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
