R-DA-EDOCH Versus R-CEOP90, With/Without Upfront Auto-HSCT in Young Patients With High-risk DLBCL
Patients initially are randomized into 2 arms:

Arm I: R-DA-EPOCH; Arm II: R-CEOP90;

Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH (Arm I) or R-CEOP90 (Arm II), continue to have 2 more cycles for consolidation in each arm, or undergo stem cell harvest and auto-HSCT following standard institutional protocols.

Patients initially are randomized into 2 arms:

Arm I: R-DA-EPOCH; Arm II: R-CEOP90;

Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH (Arm I) or R-CEOP90 (Arm II), continue to have 2 more cycles for consolidation in each arm, or undergo stem cell harvest and auto-HSCT following standard institutional protocols.

The overall purpose of the study is to determine if R-CEOP90 followed by auto-HSCT has similar efficacy compared to that with R-DA-EPOCH.
