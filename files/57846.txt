Adjuvant Tebentafusp in High Risk Ocular Melanoma
At least 50% of patients with high-risk primary uveal melanoma will develop a recurrence following treatment of the primary tumour. Observation is currently the standard of care in the non-metastatic setting. Tebentafusp is the first agent proven to improve overall survival in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a randomized trial. Based on the results in the advanced setting, it is hypothesized that treatment with tebentafusp may reduce the risk of development of disease recurrence.
