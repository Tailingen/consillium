A Trial of SHR-A1921 for Injection in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The study is being conducted to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of SHR-1921.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SHR-1921
Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), To check the numbers of AEs happened during the course of trial., Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Number of subjects with laboratory tests findings of potential clinical importance, To check the Clinically significant and non clinically significant abnormal values during the course of trial., Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Incidence of vital sign abnormalities e.g. Systolic and Diastolic BP, Pulse rate., To measure the vital signs on regular basis for all study participants, Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Measure ECG, Number of subjects with clinically significant abnormal ECG QT Interval, Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of SHR-1921, To check what will be the maximum concentration participants will obtained of SHR-1921 in their blood plasma., Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-âˆž) from time 0 to infinity of SHR-1921, To check the drug profile for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion for SHR-1921 in participants blood plasma, Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of SHR-1921, To check what time will it take to reach the maximum contraction of SHR-1921 in study participants, Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Clearance of SHR-1921, The apparent clearance of SHR-1921(CL/F) of SHR-1921, Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of SHR-1921, To check how much time SHR-1921 will take to eliminate half of it's concentration from participants., Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Pharmacodynamics ("ADA" ) of SHR-1921., To check the" Anti Drug Antibody" develops in participants against the SHR-1921 through blood sample, Screening up to study completion, an average of 1 year
The study is being conducted to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of SHR-1921.
