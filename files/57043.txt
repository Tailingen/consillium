A Clinical Trial of Decitabine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this study was to determine which of the doses of decitabine maximizes genomic demethylation in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Subcutaneous Decitabine
Phase I: To determine which of the subcutaneous (SQ) doses of decitabine administered twice daily for 5 days maximizes genomic demethylation in patients with MDS., Up to 8 cycles (224 days)|Phase II: To evaluate hematological response at the dose selected in the Phase I portion of the study., Up to 12 cycles (336 days)
Phase I: The purpose of this study was to determine which of the subcutaneous doses of decitabine administered twice daily for 5 days maximizes genomic demethylation in patients with MDS

Phase II: To evaluate hematological responses at the dose selected in the Phase I portion of the study.

Note: This study was planned as Phase 1/2 study but only the Phase 1 part was conducted due to a change in product development strategy
