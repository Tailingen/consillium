Integrin Alpha-v-Beta and [18F]-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT in Measuring Response in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and Healthy Volunteers
This pilot clinical trial studies the use of integrin alpha-v-beta \[18F\]-R01-MG-F2 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) and Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Imaging in (PET/MRI) in measuring response in patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy volunteers. Integrins, such as integrin alpha-v-beta-6 (avb6), are a family of membrane receptors that are overexpressed on the cell surface of pancreatic cancers. \[18F\]-R01-MG-F2 targets avb6, which may improve early detection of and better stratify treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer.

Biodistribution of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 (%ID/g), From the Region-of-Interest (ROI) image analysis, the biodistribution data will be reported in percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). ROI analysis will be performed on normal brain, thyroid, lungs, mediastinum, liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder and gluteal muscle., Up to 3 hours after tracer injection|Biodistribution of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 (SUV), From the Region-of-Interest (ROI) image analysis, the biodistribution data will be reported in Standardized Uptake Values (SUV). ROI analysis will be performed on normal brain, thyroid, lungs, mediastinum, liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder and gluteal muscle., Up to 3 hours after tracer injection|Dosimetry of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 (rem/mCi), Using the biodistribution data (uptake in %ID/g or SUV), the tracer's complete dosimetry across all organs, tissues or cells will be determined using the OLINDA software. These data will be reported in rem/mCi., Up to 3 hours after tracer injection|Dosimetry of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 (mSv/MBq), Using the biodistribution data (uptake in %ID/g or SUV), the tracer's complete dosimetry across all organs, tissues or cells will be determined using the OLINDA software. These data will be reported in mSv/MBq., Up to 3 hours after tracer injection
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate the biodistribution and safety of \[18F\]FP-R01-MG-F2 in healthy volunteers.

II. Evaluate the feasibility of \[18F\]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scanning in patients with pancreatic cancer.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive \[18F\]FP-R01-MG-F2 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT or PET/MR scan immediately after and at 60 and 120 minutes. Patients will be followed up at 24-48 hours.
