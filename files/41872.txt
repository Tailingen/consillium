A Phase I Open Label Study of E7974 Administered on a Day 1 of 21-Day Cycle In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974 after bolus IV administration, on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, to patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.
Cancer, Malignant Tumors
DRUG: E7974
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of E7974 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors., Duration of each cycle will be 21 days; patients will attend a follow-up visit 30 days after last study treatment. Follow-up for safety and efficacy will occur 6 months after the last patient is accrued to the study.
Assess E7974 for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) which will correlate AUC with clinical toxicity and efficacy., Duration of each cycle will be 21 days; patients will attend a follow-up visit 30 days after last study treatment. Follow-up for safety and efficacy will occur 6 months after the last patient is accrued to the study.
The MTD for the Day 1 21-Day schedule was defined at the 0.45 mg/m2 dose level. The study was terminated prior to full enrollment of the colorectal cancer (CRC) expansion cohort, due to a lack of demonstrated activity resulting in Principal Investigator (PI) loss interest to continue enrollment. Collection of all outstanding data is ongoing and database lock is estimated to be complete in June 2008.
