Assessment of AMG 420 in Subjects With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
To confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the BI 836909 trial of 400 mcg/d, given as 28-day continuous intravenous infusion in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, to test the 600 mcg/d dose, given as a 28-day continuous iV infusion.
Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: AMG 420
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which graded using the criteria referenced in the publication by Lee et al, 2014 and the Cairo Bishop criteria referenced in the publication by Coiffier et al, 2008 respectively.

A participant was non-DLT evaluable if they dropped out before completion of the DLT-evaluable period for reasons other than a DLT., Day 1 to Week 4|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), The severity of TEAEs were graded using the CTCAE version 5.0 with the exception of CRS and TLS, which graded using the criteria referenced in the publication by Lee et al, 2014 and the Cairo Bishop criteria referenced in the publication by Coiffier et al, 2008. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory tests were recorded as TEAEs., Up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-related TEAE, The severity of treatment-related TEAEs were graded using the CTCAE version 5.0 with the exception of CRS and TLS, which graded using the criteria referenced in the publication by Lee et al, 2014 and the Cairo Bishop criteria referenced in the publication by Coiffier et al, 2008.

Treatment-related TEAEs were those that were considered related to the study treatment by the investigator., Up to approximately 3 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants for whom the best overall response was a stringent complete response (CR), CR, very good partial response (PR), or partial response as determined by the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria. The ORR along with the associated 95% exact binomial confidence interval (Clopper Pearson Method) was determined., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as number of months between first objective response to progressive disease or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first.

Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the distribution of DOR. The median and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated., Up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Response at CR, MRD negativity at CR or better assessed by using the IMWG criteria.

Percentage of MRD negative responders at CR along with exact 2- sided 95% were provided by using the Clopper Pearson method., Up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Response at CR, Number of participants with MRD negativity at CR or better assessed by using the IMWG criteria., Up to approximately 3 years
Cohort 1 will consist of 10 subjects dosed at 400 mcg/d. Cohort 2 will consist of 10 subjects dosed at 600 mcg/d. All doses will be given as a 28-day continuous IV infusion, followed by a 2 week treatment-free interval, until subject experiences disease progression as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.
