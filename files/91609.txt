To Demonstrate Superiority of Decitabine Over Azacitidine in Subjects With Intermediate- or High-risk MDS.
The purpose of this study is to compare the response of patients with Intermediate or High Risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) following treatment with decitabine or azacitidine.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: decitabine|DRUG: azacitidine
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as Proportion of Patients Having Complete Response (CR) and Marrow Complete Response (mCR) After Completion of 3 Cycles of Study Drug., Based on Modified International Working Group Response Criteria for Altering Natural History of Myelodysplastic Syndromes.

Complete Response: Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines. Persistent dysplasia will be noted. Peripheral blood Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL; Platelets ≥ 100 X 10\^9/L; Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 X 10\^9/Lb; Blasts 0%.

Marrow Complete Response: Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pretreatment. Peripheral blood: if hematological improvement responses, they will be noted in addition to marrow CR., 13 Weeks
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as Proportion of Patients Having Complete Response (CR) and Marrow Complete Response (mCR) After Completion of 6 Cycles of Study Drug., Based on Modified International Working Group Response Criteria for Altering Natural History of Myelodysplastic Syndromes.

Complete Response: Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines. Persistent dysplasia will be noted. Peripheral blood Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL; Platelets ≥ 100 X 10\^9/L; Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 X 10\^9/Lb; Blasts 0%.

Marrow Complete Response: Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pretreatment. Peripheral blood: if hematological improvement responses, they will be noted in addition to marrow CR., 36 Weeks
The purpose of this study is to compare the response of patients with Intermediate or High Risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) following treatment with decitabine or azacitidine.
