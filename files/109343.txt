A Study of AZD0466 in Patients With Advanced Hematologic or Solid Tumors
This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD0466 in patients with solid tumors, lymphoma and multiple myeloma at low risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), as well as in patients at intermediate risk or high risk of TLS with hematologic malignancies for whom no standard therapy exists. Once an MTD/RP2D has been determined in the dose escalation portion, further disease-specific expansions (solid tumor and hematologic) will be undertaken. Combinations of AZD0466 with other standard of care treatments may be evaluated in the future.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma|Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: AZD0466
The incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined by assessing the incidence of DLTs., 28 days for Arm A; between 35 and 56 days for Arm B due to varying number of ramp-up doses|The incidence of adverse events, Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of adverse events as measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5., Minimum observation period 28 days for Arm A and between 35 and 56 days for Arm B due to varying number of ramp-up doses; and will continue until the subject is off the study (approximately 6 months)
Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AZD4320 by estimating maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), AZD0466 exposure is evaluated indirectly by AZD4320 concentration measurement. Total AZD4320 is the sum of dendrimer conjugated AZD4320 and released AZD4320. Released AZD4320 in the plasma is the sum of protein bound and unbound AZD4320 which is not dendrimer conjugated., Plasma PK will be measured at each cycle throughout study treatment for approximately 6 months. Cylce length is 28 days for Arm A and between 28-56 days for Arm B due to varying number of ramp-up doses.|Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile AZD4320 by estimating area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), AZD0466 exposure is evaluated indirectly by AZD4320 concentration measurement. Total AZD4320 is the sum of dendrimer conjugated AZD4320 and released AZD4320. Released AZD4320 in the plasma is the sum of protein bound and unbound AZD4320 which is not dendrimer conjugated., Plasma PK will be measured at each cycle throughout study treatment for approximately 6 months. Cycle length is 28 days for Arm A and between 28-56 days for Arm B due to varying number of ramp-up doses.|Characterize urine pharmacokinetic profile of AZD4320 by renal clearance, AZD0466 exposure is evaluated indirectly by AZD4320 concentration measurement. Total AZD4320 is the sum of dendrimer conjugated AZD4320 and released AZD4320. Released AZD4320 in the plasma is the sum of protein bound and unbound AZD4320 which is not dendrimer conjugated., Urine PK will be measured up to 48 hrs after the first treatment dose for select cohorts in Arm A, and pre-infusion and up to 48 hrs after the target dose for select cohorts in Arm B.|Characterize urine pharmacokinetic profile of AZD4320 by amount excreted unchanged, AZD0466 exposure is evaluated indirectly by AZD4320 concentration measurement. Total AZD4320 is the sum of dendrimer conjugated AZD4320 and released AZD4320. Released AZD4320 in the plasma is the sum of protein bound and unbound AZD4320 which is not dendrimer conjugated., Urine PK will be measured up to 48 hrs after the first treatment dose for select cohorts in Arm A, and pre-infusion and up to 48 hrs after the target dose for select cohorts in Arm B.|Number of patients with a tumor response, Disease-specific criteria will be used to assess tumor response., Every 2 cycles (approximately 8 wks) from initiation of study treatment for up to approximately 6 months.
This is a FTIH study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD0466 at increasing doses in patients with malignancies for whom no standard therapy exists, including advanced solid tumors, lymphoma and multiple myeloma with a low risk for TLS (Arm A), and relapsed, refractory hematological malignancies with an intermediate to high risk of TLS (Arm B). The study will also characterize the PK of AZD0466 and explore potential biological activity by assessing pharmacodynamics, exploratory biomarkers, and anti-tumor activity. Once an MTD/RP2D has been determined during escalation, further disease-specific expansions, possibly including, but not limited to small cell lung cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia will begin.
