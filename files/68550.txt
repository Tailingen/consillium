A Phase II Trial of Vinflunine Chemotherapy in Locally-advanced and Metastatic Carcinoma of the Penis (VinCaP)
VinCaP is a multicentre single-arm phase II trial. 22 patients will receive Vinflunine chemotherapy (Vinflunine 320mg/m2 given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle of 21 days, four cycles to be given prior to formal re-staging).
Locally-advanced or Metastatic Penile Neoplasms
DRUG: Vinflunine
Clinical Benefit, To determine the clinical benefit (objective response \& stable disease rate) and toxicity of vinflunine in patients with inoperable (locally advanced or metastatic) cancer of the penis and thus determine whether this drug warrants further research in this indication., 12 weeks
Objective Response Rate, Proportion of patients having achieved partial or complete remission. The proportion of patients with objective response will be calculated and presented along its 95% confidence interval., 12 weeks|Toxicity, Toxicity will be evaluated, using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 scoring, after each cycle, at the end of treatment and at follow up visits. The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicities at these time points and until progression will be reported as well as the Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., Baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks on treatment, and at follow-up, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months (timed from end of last cycle of chemotherapy)|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival will be defined as time from registration until the first of clinically or radiologically documented disease progression, or death from any cause death. Patients alive and progression-free at time of analysis will be censored at date last seen., From registration to first documented disease progression or death from any cause, up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Patients alive at time of analysis will be censored at date last seen. Patients lost to follow-up will be censored at date last seen., Time from registration until death from any cause, up to 24 months|Treatment Compliance, Treatment Compliance will be defined as proportion of planned doses delivered. Reasons for non-delivery of planned doses (patient or clinician preference, toxicity and tolerability) will be collected., 12 weeks
