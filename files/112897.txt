A Biomarker-driven, Open Label, Single Arm, Multicentre Phase II Study of Abemaciclib in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Who Failed to Platinum-based Therapy
Open, multicenter, single arm, phase II, biomarker driven umbrella trial for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (FGFR inhibitor, CDK4/6 inhibitor, pan HER inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor, PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor)
HNSCC|Head and Neck Neoplasms
DRUG: Abemaciclib
Response rate (RR), RECIST version 1.1, 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), RECIST version 1.1, 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from first dose to death due to any cause. Through the follow-up within 30 days after study completion or termination of the last subject, death and date of death will be checked for subject alive during treatment period, 24 months|Duration of response, RECIST version 1.1, 24 months|Toxicity, number of patients with treatment-related AE as assessed by NCI CTCAE version 4.03, 24 months
This study will be conducted as a treatment arm 4 of the umbrella clinical trial.(NCT03292250)

During or after palliative 1st line platinum based chemotherapy, we will perform prescreening NGS based molecular characterization. The molecular characterization will be done by following three methods.

* NGS : Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment (245 genes)
* Nanostring nCounter including immune signature
* IHC : PD-L1

The present trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV (-) HNSCC with genetic alterations of cell cycle pathway who failed to platinum-based therapy. We will also evaluate feasibility and the effect on decision making of next generation sequencing of HNSCC.
