Chest Lymph Node Sampling in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer to be Treated With Curative-intent Radiation Treatment
This study will investigate the role of sampling suspicious chest lymph nodes with a procedure called endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TFNA) or transesophageal ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in patients planned to receive radical dose radiation.

This study will use Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for treatment methods. SABR is a newer radiation treatment that delivers high-dose, precise radiation to small tumors and can be delivered more accurately than with older radiation treatment methods. It is considered a standard treatment for small lung cancers, and select cancers that have spread to the brain.

The purpose of this study is to compare if the lymph node sampling procedure is valuable for determining the extend of nodal disease in metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) compared to imaging alone.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TFNA)|PROCEDURE: Transesophageal ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)
Changes to treatment intent and/or plan, Number of patients whose treatment is changed from stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to conventional dose radiation, change in mediastinal radiation field, change from curative intent to palliative intent treatment, 2 years
Determine the proportion of patients with occult mediastinal metastasis, Pre-staging treatment planning anticipated lymph nodes to be treated compared to post staging lymph nodes to be treated, 2 years|Determine the sensitivity and specificity of radiologic staging of hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes, Nodal staging on imaging alone versus nodal staging after sampling, 2 years|Identify the total number of lymph nodes sampled per procedure, Record the total number of lymph nodes sampled, 2 years|Identify the nodal stations sampled, Record the nodal stations that were sampled, 2 years|Determine the proportion of patients with complications of endoscopic procedure, Number of participants with complications versus number without, 2 years
