Prospective and Retrospective Cohort Study of New Prognostic Factors With Peripheral Blood and Bone Marrow Evaluation at the Time of Diagnosis and During Treatment or Thereafter in Acute Leukemia (Acute Leukemia HSCT Cohort)
The objective of this study is to evaluate the prognostic factors of acute leukemia patients received stem cell transplantation and to invent the molecular genetic test for sensitive detection of minimal residual disease, and thereby this study would contribute to plan the risk adapted treatment. Patients will have samples of blood and/or bone marrow collected during treatment or thereafter
Acute Leukemia
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of diagnosis until death due to any cause within the follow-up period. Surviving patients are censored at date of last contact., 10years
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as survival without disease progression or relapse; patients alive without disease progression or relapse are censored on the last assessment date. Median OS and PFS are calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates with a 95% confidence interval., 10years|Treatment-related mortality, Treatment-related mortality was defined as death unrelated to refractory or progressive disease occurring before first remission was achieved, or any death in complete remission, 10years|Complete remission rate, Response assessment is performed according to the criteria reported by BD Cheson et al. (Revised recommendations of the international working group for diagnosis, standardization of response criteria, treatment outcomes, and reporting standards for therapeutic trials in acute myeloid leukemia), 10 years
