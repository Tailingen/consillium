Validation of a Novel Thoracic Neoplasm Radiotherapy Image Guidance Technique: A Pilot Study
The overall, broad objective of this study is to pilot the BSD technique. The specific purpose of this particular study is to generate pilot data to validate several crucial steps of the BSD technique, in particular steps 1, 2, and 4. Radiation treatments will proceed per standard of care, and will not be modified in any way during this protocol. This study is a non-treatment protocol.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: reproduce breathing cycle utilizing spirometry|PROCEDURE: Freebreathing in Body fix mold
Reproducibility of the guided breathing cycle, 6 weeks
Stability of motion envelope derived from initial 4D imaging compared to CT's obtained throughout the course of therapy, 6 weeks
