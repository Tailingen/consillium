Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of Escalating Doses of SIM0348 as a Single Agent in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open label, phase I trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic characteristics and to assess the preliminary efficacy of SIM0348 as monotherapy in adult subjects with advanced and metastatic solid tumors. The trial starts with a dose escalation and dose expansion part (Part 1) followed by a cohort expansion part (Part 2).
