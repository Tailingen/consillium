A Study to Compare Capsule and Tablet Forms of MDV3100 (Enzalutamide) After Administration of a Single Set Dose Under Fasted Conditions in Healthy Male Subjects
A study to evaluate the bioavailability (BA) of a single oral dose of MDV3100 (enzalutamide) formulated as a solid spray dried tablet compared to oral liquid-filled capsules, and the safety and tolerability of oral formulations.

Subjects are admitted to the clinic from days 1 to 5, followed by outpatient assessments up to Day 50. They return to the clinic for an end of study visit (ESV) 7-10 days after the last pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling or after early withdrawal.
