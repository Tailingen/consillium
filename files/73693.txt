Reducing Excision Margins After Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy for HPV Negative Resectable Locally Advanced HNSCC
This study aims to explore the 2-year DFS (disease-free survival) rate and organ retention rate and to explore the ORR, PCR rate, 2y-OS， and quality of life of patients.

This study aims to explore the 2-year DFS (disease-free survival) rate and organ retention rate after AP chemotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 antibody neoadjuvant treatment for HPV negative operable locally advanced head and HNSCC, and to explore the ORR, PCR rate, 2y-OS, and quality of life of patients.
