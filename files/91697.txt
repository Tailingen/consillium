Transparent Cap-assisted SpyGlass for Biliary Stricture
The transparent cap-assisted endoscope has the function of fixing field of view and increasing visual space. It has been widely used in gastrointestinal examination and treatment. In this study, the investigators intend to apply transparent cap-assisted choledochoscopy to endoscopic biliary tract exploration and biopsy to investigate whether transparent cap-assisted choledochoscopy can improve operability, visual field clarity, and biopsy accuracy.
Bile Duct Stricture|Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography|Biliary Disease|Biliary Tract Neoplasms
DEVICE: Transparent cap
The clearness of visual field, The clearness of visual field was evaluated by the operating physician and was rated as "clear" or "not clear.", Immediately|Intubation rates of bile duct ends, cystic duct openings, and left and right hepatic duct bifurcations, Comparison of intubation rates between transparent cap SpyGlass and standard SpyGlass, Immediately
Biopsy accuracy, Biopsy accuracy between clear cap SpyGlass and standard SpyGlass was evaluated by comparing the coincidence rate of biopsy histopathology and postoperative pathology, 1 week
Recently, endoscopy has become more widely used in clinical practice. A straightforward method of improving mucosal visualization involves attachment of a transparent cap to the end of the endoscope. It has been widely used in gastrointestinal examination and treatment.This is a before-after study. In patients with suspected bile duct stricture, tandem ERCP combined with SpyGlass choledochoscopy procedures were carried out on the same day in random order, first without a transparent cap and then with a cap (without-to-with), or first with a cap and then without a cap (with-to-without). The differences in maneuverability, visual field clarity and biopsy accuracy of choledochoscopy with and without transparent cap were recorded to explore the application prospect of transparent cap assisted choledochoscopy.
