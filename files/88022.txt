Reduced Intensity Conditioning Transplant Using Haploidentical Donors
This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT from partially HLA-mismatched first-degree relatives utilizing PBSC as the stem cell source. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of graft rejection and acute GVHD. A secondary objective will be to estimate the incidence of the relapse, NRM, OS, chronic GVHD and EFS.

DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplant
Graft Rejection, Measurement of donor cells vs. recipient cells, 100 days
Overall Survival, Number of participants still alive 2 years after transplant, 2 years|Relapse Incidence, Number of patients with disease reoccurrence at 1 and 2 years post-transplant, 2 years|GVHD Incidence, The number of participants that developed graft-versus-host-disease before or at 100 days after transplant, 100 days
Patients will receive a haploidentical transpalnt using a fludarabine melphalan prepartive regimen. Patients will get cyclophosphamide on days 3 \& 4 post-transplant.
