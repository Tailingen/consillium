Dual Targeting of EGFR With Cetuximab and Afatinib to Treat Refractory wtKRAS Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a multicentric, phase II and open label study.75 patients are expected to be randomized in 35 centers. The main objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of Afatinib -cetuximab combo versus cetuximab alone in treatment of patients with refractory wtKRAS metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab + Afatinib|DRUG: Cetuximab
Non progression rate at 6 months, The progression rate is defined as percentage of patients without progression at 6 months after observation of all patients at 6 months, 6 months
Overall response rate (OR), Overall response rate is defined as percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete or partial response as per RECIST V1.1 criteria, 6 months|Progression free survival, It is define as the time of from randomization to date of first documented progression or any cause of death, until progression or death, expected average approximately 4 months|Overall and specific survival, Overall and specific survival is defined from time of randomization to the date of documented death, until death, on average approximately 14 months|Quality of life, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29 are questionnaires developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients, During treatment, on average approximately 4 months|Tolerance of the treatment, Safety of the study treatment will be assessed on occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs), until progression, expected approximately 4 months
Patients who will sign the inform consent will be enrolled into one of two groups. Group A will receive Afatinib ( 40mg per day) and Cetuximab (500mg/m2)every two weeks until progression. Group B will receive Cetuximab (500mg/m2) alone every two weeks until progression and after progression,patients from group B will receive afatinib (group A treatment) until progression. The criteria for evaluation will be tumor response and progression documented by CT scan and according to RECIST criteria version 1.1.

Patient will also sign a inform consent before participating in biological study. The aim of this translational study is to collect tumor and blood sample in order to determine, the biological factors which are predictive of the response to treatment.
