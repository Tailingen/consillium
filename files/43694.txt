Impact of Clinical Evident Portal Hypertension on HCC With TACE (CHANCE-CHESS 2301)
The purpose of this study is to discuss the prognostic value of CEPH among HCC patients underwent TACE treatment, its impact on overall survival, and try to stratify patient cohorts for a better treatment strategy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Portal Hypertension
PROCEDURE: TACE Â± Systemic therapy
Overall Survival(OS), The OS is defined as the time from the initiation of any treatment to death due to any cause., up to approximately 2 years
Objective response rate(ORR) per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) per mRECIST., up to approximately 2 years|Progression free survival(PFS) per mRECIST, The PFS is defined as the time from the initiation of any treatment to the first documented progressive disease (according to mRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as standard therapy for intermediate-stage HCC according to the current guidelines and is also the most widely used in advanced HCC in real-world practice. Clinically relevant portal hypertension increases the risk of hepatic decompensation, which impairs survival in patients with HCC. The purpose of this study is to discuss the prognostic value of CEPH among HCC patients who underwent TACE treatment, its impact on overall survival, and try to stratify patient cohorts for a better treatment strategy.
