Loncastuximab Tesirine and Rituximab as Bridging Therapy Prior to Standard-of-care CD19 CAR T-cell Therapy in Patients With Large B-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn if the study treatment Loncastuximab tesirine and Rituximab is safe and efficient before standard of care chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.
