Palbociclib Plus Letrozole in Hormone Receptor Positive Residual Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
PROMETEO II is a single-arm window of opportunity trial to evaluate biologic and anti-proliferative effects of palbociclib and letrozole in HR+/HER2-negative operable breast cancer (BC) patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and help to identify biomarkers for better patient selection.

Change in gene expression of 752 genes, Gene expression changes of 752 genes in all the patients, between posttreatment and pretreatment samples following therapy with palbociclib and letrozole., Gene expression will be analyzed in pretreated sample and at surgery 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment|Changes of the PAM50 intrinsic subtypes, To evaluate the changes of the PAM50 intrinsic subtypes between samples, Intrinsic subtype will be evaluated in pretreated sample, after NAC, and at surgery following therapy with palbociclib and letrozole.|Rate of cell cycle suppression according to breast cancer subtype., To determine the association between PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and biological response following neoadjuvant treatment, At surgery, 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment|Correlation of rate of cell cycle suppression with gene expression changes of 752 genes., To determine the association between gene expression from pre-treatment samples with biological response after neoadjuvant treatment., Cell cycle suppression and gene expression will be evaluated pretreatment and at surgery 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment.|Correlation of pCR and RCB with gene expression changes of 752 genes., To determine the association between gene expression from pre-treatment samples with pathological response after letrozole and palbociclib treatment., At surgery, 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment|Changes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Changes in TILs by immunohistochemistry (eg, percentages (%) of stromal TILs) in lesions before and after treatment., At surgery, 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment|Changes in Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) expression, Changes in PDL1 expression immuno-histochemistry (IHC) in lesions before and after treatment., At surgery, 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment|Increase in CelTIL score, CelTIL score is a metric for quantifying broad changes to the tumor microenvironment and is calculated by the following equation:

CelTIL score = -0.8 × tumor cellularity (in percent) + 1.3 × TILs (in percent). The minimum and maximum unscaled CelTIL scores will be -80 and 130. This unscaled CelTIL score will then be scaled to reflect the reported values ranging from 0 to 100 points where an increase in CelTIL scores represent favorable changes to the tumor microenvironment., At surgery, 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment|Correlation of pCR and RCB with PIK3CA mutations, p53 mutations and other genomic alterations., DNA mutation analysis in pretreatment samples will be performed on tumor DNA samples to assess the predictive value of the most prevalent mutations in early HR+ breast cancer subtype., DNA mutations will be analyzed in pretreatment samples.|Changes in ctDNA, Determination of changes in ctDNA in plasma samples, ctDNA evaluation will be performed post-NAC and at surgery, 4 weeks after palbociclib and letrozole treatment.
This is a single-arm window of opportunity trial to evaluate biologic and anti-proliferative effects of palbociclib and letrozole in HR+/HER2-negative operable BC patients with residual disease after NAC and help to identify biomarkers for better patient selection.

The primary endpoint will be the Complete Cell Cycle Arrest (CCCA) determined by Ki67\<2.7%, centrally assessed at surgery after 4 weeks of palbociclib and letrozole.

Tumor measurement will be performed by ultrasound (US) for disease evaluation and confirmation of residual disease will be performed at screening at the end of NAC. The biopsy after chemotherapy will only be done after confirmation of residual disease by US. Ki67% ≥ 5% after NAC by local determination will be necessary to be included in the study.

Patients will be administered palbociclib at a dose of 125 mg once daily, day 1 to day 21 followed by 7 days off treatment in a 28-day cycle and letrozole: oral, 2.5 mg per day continuously, one cycle of treatment.

After the finalization of the neoadjuvant treatment, patients will undergo surgery. Surgery specimens will be collected for histological examination and biomarker analysis

The end of the study is defined as the date of post-surgery visit and will take place 4 weeks (+/- 7days) after the surgery in order to monitor the patient's safety and collect the surgery information.
