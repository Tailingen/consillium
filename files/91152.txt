A Study to Evaluate the Cardiac Safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Tumor
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the cardiac safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in patients with advanced malignant tumor who has received at least first-line treatment.
Advanced Malignant Tumor
DRUG: Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome
Cardiac adverse event, up to approximately 5 years.
Overall response rate (ORR), up to approximately 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), up to approximately 3 years.|Overall survival (OS), up to approximately 5 years|Incidence of treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), up to approximately 3 years.
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the cardiac safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in patients with advanced malignant tumor who has received at least first-line treatment. About 120 patients will be recruited in this study. Patients with solid tumors will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m\^2 by an intravenous infusion (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w, 1 cycle). Patients with lymphoma will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m\^2 by an intravenous infusion (IV) every 4 weeks (q4w, 1 cycle). All the patients will receive the treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxic reaction, death, or withdrawal by investigator's or patient's decision.
