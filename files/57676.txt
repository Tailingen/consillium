Study of DS-8273a With Nivolumab in Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, and immunoregulatory (pharmacodynamic; PD) activity of DS-8273a administered in combination with nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) to subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: DS-8273a|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Safety (adverse events) of the protocol therapy, Safety will be evaluated for all treated subjects using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 2 years
Anti-tumor activity of the protocol therapy, Tumor response will be determined for all subjects by RECIST 1.1 as well as by immune-related response criteria, Up to 2 years
Principal investigator hypothesize that TRAIL D5 antibody DS-8273a administered in combination with nivolumab will be well tolerated and that the addition of DS-8273a will augment the clinical efficacy of nivolumab.
