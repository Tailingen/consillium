A Biomarker Screening Protocol for Participants With Solid Tumors
Biomarker Screening Protocol for Preliminary Eligibility Determination for Adoptive T-cell Therapy Trials:This is a decentralized, multi-site, US-based biomarker screening study to identify participants who have specific disease indications and tumor expression of target(s) of interest that may inform eligibility for active and future Lyell clinical trials. No investigational treatments will be administered in this non-interventional screening study. Only previously obtained archival tumor tissue will be allowed on this study for biomarker analysis. Fresh tumor biopsies are not permitted on this study. The study will be conducted virtually and participants will utilize telehealth and e-consent modules. If participants tumors express the biomarkers of interest they can be referred to open and enrolling clinical trials. Participation on the screening study does not guarantee enrollment or treatment on an interventional clinical trial.

To identify participants whose tumors express biomarkers, such as ROR1, that may inform eligibility for active and future Lyell clinical trials, 5 years
To explore tumor expression of biomarkers, such as ROR1, by different methods (e.g., IHC versus next-generation sequencing [NGS]), 5 years
