A Study to Assess an ATX Inhibitor (IOA-289) in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The objective of study IOA-289-102 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of IOA-289 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with standard chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Blood and tumour samples for PK and PD will be collected and assessments for determination of any clinical efficacy will be completed.
