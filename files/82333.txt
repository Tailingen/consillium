Individualized Precision Treatment Based on Ovarian Cancer Organoid Model
The research purpose of this study is to use organoid cultured from patients' own ovarian cancer tissues as models, screen potential clinical therapeutic drugs (such as paclitaxel, gemcitabine, etc.) in vitro, formulate individualized drug treatment plans for individual patient, and evaluate the clinical application value of organ like drug sensitivity technology.
Ovarian Cancer
DEVICE: Organoid culture
Objective remission rate, partial or complete remission ratio according to RECIST criteria, 6 months
Progression free survival, 3 years
Under the guidance of ultrasound, the lesions were punctured to obtain tumor cells; The cells were amplified and cultured by organ like culture method to establish ovarian cancer like organoid. The drug sensitivity tests of different drugs were carried out on similar organs. Number of drugs tested: 10 (paclitaxel, carboplatin, lobaplatin, doxorubicin, etc.); After the test is completed, sufficient chemotherapy for full course of treatment shall be carried out according to the drug sensitivity results; After chemotherapy, blood and imaging evaluation were performed; Collect the information of patients from initial treatment to the end of chemotherapy; Matching the corresponding number of patients with platinum resistant relapse who did not undergo organ like culture; At each end point, the evaluation and comparison were carried out and the research conclusions were drawn.
