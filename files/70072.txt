MRI Study of Radiation-Induced Damage to White Matter and Blood-Brain-Barrier
This is a study to determine if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques can detect early changes in white matter (in the brain) and the blood-brain barrier resulting from radiation therapy.
Brain Neoplasms
RADIATION: Whole Brain Irradiation|RADIATION: Partial Brain Irradiation|BEHAVIORAL: Neuropsychological Testing|BEHAVIORAL: Quality of Life Questionnaire|DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Assessments
Change in Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) with different radiation dose at different timepoints., Linear mixed models will be used to relate Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) changes and radiation dose., Baseline, at 3 weeks on radiation therapy (RT) (partial brain irradiation only), last week of RT, 6 weeks post RT, 4 months post RT (whole brain irradiation only), 6 months post RT, 18 months post RT (partial brain irradiation only)
Associate changes in Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) assessments with changes in neurocognitive function and clinical symptoms, from baseline, and at different timepoints., Changes in Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) assessments will be compared graphically to changes in neurocognitive function and clinical symptoms. Parallel analysis will be conducted on each of the neurocognitive tests to determine if MRI assessments can identify patients at increased risk for later neurocognitive dysfunction., Baseline, 6 weeks post radiation therapy (RT), 4 months post RT (whole brain irradiation only), 6 months post RT, 18 months post RT (partial brain irradiation only)
Patients will be assigned to one of two groups based on the type of radiation they will be receiving: whole brain irradiation or partial brain irradiation. Patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessments, neurocognitive testing (Quality of Life and Neuropsychological assessments), and clinical evaluation.
