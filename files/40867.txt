Autofluorescence Detection of Oral Malignancies and Database and Biospecimen Collection to Identify Biomarkers of Head and Neck Tumor Progression
This research may help dentists or surgeons to better detect areas in the mouth that are either prone to cancer or are early cancers. The earlier the detection on cancer in the mouth, the better the chance that treatment or prevention can be more effective.
Oral Cancer
to investigate whether the use of a fluorescent light in the mouth can detect precancers or early cancers that are not seen on normal clinical examination., The first purpose of this activity is to investigate whether the use of a fluorescent light in the mouth can detect precancers or early cancers that are not seen on normal clinical examination., Once at time of consent (day 1)
The second purpose is to collect other samples from the mouth in hopes to identify changes in the proteins and/or genes that will help identify how cancers start in the mouth., The second purpose is to collect other samples from the mouth in hopes to identify changes in the proteins and/or genes that will help identify how cancers start in the mouth., Once at time of consent (day 1)
