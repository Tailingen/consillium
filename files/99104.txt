Regorafenib Plus FOLFIRI With Irinotecan Dose Escalated in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
A prospective, multicenter, randomized in a 2:1 ratio, controlled, clinical trial with two parallel arms will be conducted to compare irinotecan dose escalated FOLFIRI according to UGT1A1 genotyping plus 120 mg regorafenib with 120 mg regorafenib alone in previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
