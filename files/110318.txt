REcommened Communication With Sympathy in Terminally Ill Cancer Patients Treated With Palliative Sedation
* In terminally ill cancer patients, palliative sedation has been applied to intractable refractory symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, delirium, agitation.
* Palliative sedation is generally an adaptive strategies using midazolam, which is composed of intermittent bolus, limited continuous, or 24hr continuous infusion depending on the time of drug application.
* In the application of palliative sedation, caregiver's negative feelings such as anxiety or guilt for palliative sufficiency are one of the biggest challenges as the patient's consciousness is reduced, and they feels disconnected from the patient.
* In general, hearing is known to persist until the very last moment of the end of life, regardless of consciousness. In addition, maintaining communication with patients and caregivers is the most important part of the hospice.
* This study evaluate the efficacy of healthcare provider's recommended communication with sympathy, "Regardless of the patient's outward consciousness, talk with the patient and express empathy. Hearing will be maintained until the end."
