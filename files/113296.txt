A Study of DCR-STAT3 in Adults With Solid Tumors
This is a sequential, ascending-dose, multicenter study conducted in patients with refractory solid tumors designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of DCR-STAT3.
Solid Tumor, Adult|Refractory Tumor
DRUG: DCR-STAT3
Incidence of adverse events and dose limiting toxicities, safety and tolerability, Cycle 1 (8 weeks)|Severity of adverse events, measured according to CTCAE 5.0 criteria, Cycle 1 (8 weeks)
Pharmacokinetic (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, Day 1 and Day 29 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 8 weeks)|Pharmacokinetic (Urine), Urinary excretion, Day 1 and Day 29 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 8 weeks)
The primary goal of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DCR-STAT3 in adults with refractory solid tumors. Secondary study goals are to evaluate potential antitumor effects of STAT3 knockdown, as assessed by circulating blood biomarkers indicative of immune activation, as well as any direct impact on tumor size by appropriate imaging and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Antitumor effects will be evaluated for DCR-STAT3 as a monotherapy.
