A Study of AK-1286 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 open label multicenter study to evaluate the maximum tolerance, safety, tolerance and PK of AK-1286 in patients with advanced solid tumors, so as to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose of AK-1286 and obtain the preliminary efficacy information of patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: AK-1286
Occurrence of drug limited toxicities (DLTs), To assess by the occurrence of Drug Limited Toxicities (DLTs), From Time of First dose through DLT observation period, 21 days|Incidence of Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), To assess by the occurrence of Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Number of patients with changes in laboratory parameters from baseline, To assess safety of AK-1286, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Number of participants with changes in clinically significant vital sign from baseline, To assess safety of AK-1286, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
The overall response rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) will be estimated based on the proportion of evaluable patients whose overall response (ORR) during study treatment is CR or PR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1.response (ORR) during study treatment is CR or PR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Progression free survival（PFS）, PFS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to The tumor progresses for the first time, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival（OS）, The time from randomization to death for any reason, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Disease control rate（DCR）, The percentage of cases with remission (PR+CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
