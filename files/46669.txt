Dysphagia in Head and Neck Cancer With Radiation
This study focuses on swallowing dysfunction, a common issue affecting 60-75% of head and neck cancer patients due to tumor damage, treatment complications, and chemoradiotherapy side effects, which can lead to malnutrition and reduced quality of life. With limited research on the effects of radiation doses on swallowing muscles and nutrition, this study aims to evaluate these impacts in non-surgical patients undergoing radiotherapy, conducting assessments before treatment, three months after, and within one year post-treatment.

Swallowing dysfunction is a common and debilitating symptom in head and neck cancer patients, affecting approximately 60-75% during the disease course, primarily due to tumor destruction, postoperative complications, and side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Combined chemoradiotherapy exacerbates adverse effects, such as mucositis, odynophagia, taste alterations, xerostomia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, which can result in dehydration, significant weight loss, and detrimental impacts on nutritional status, functionality, and quality of life. Limited research exists on the effects of radiation and chemoradiation doses on swallowing muscles, quality of life, and nutritional changes in these patients. This study aims to evaluate the impact of radiation doses on swallowing muscles and quality of life in head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy while identifying malnutrition risk in this population. Non-surgical patients receiving radiotherapy as the primary treatment will be recruited, with swallowing, muscle, and nutritional assessments conducted before treatment, three months after treatment, and within one year post-treatment.
