Intrapleural Bevacizumab and Cisplatin Therapy for Malignant Pleural Effusion Caused by Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
To determine the efficacy and Safety of intrapleural Bevacizumab and cisplatin as a treatment for malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Malignant Pleural Effusion
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin
Number of Participants With "Complete Response" and "Partial Response", Response assessed by type-B ultrasonic tests; Complete remission (CR) was considered when the accumulated fluid had disappeared and was stable for at least four weeks; partial remission (PR) was considered when \>50% of the accumulated fluid had disappeared, symptoms had improved, and the remaining fluid had failed to increase for at least four weeks; The total efficiency ORR was calculated by taking the sum of CR+PR, from randomization, This treatment was given every two weeks,responses were made by biweekly
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), baseline to biweekly,until disease progression|Overall Survival (OS), randomization to four weeks,until death|Adverse Reactions, Up to 1 month after the last treatment|Qualify of Life (QoL), baseline to biweekly,until death
Quantitative RT-PCR(Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) for VEGF-A(Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A), before intrapleural administration
