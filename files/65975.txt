Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib in Advanced Well-differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors
The purpose of this study is to:

* Assess overall radiographic response rate (ORR)
* Assess progression-free survival (PFS)
* Test the safety and tolerability of Pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib
Neuroendocrine Tumors|Neuroendocrine Carcinoma|Neuroendocrine Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Objective Radiographic Response Rate (ORR), Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based response rate. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest). The SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 mm, for example, does not qualify). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Up to 12 months
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from first documented evidence of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from initial treatment to the first documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time from initial treatment until death from any cause., At 12 months
The purpose of this study is to:

* Assess overall radiographic response rate (ORR)
* Assess progression-free survival (PFS)
* Test the safety and tolerability of Pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib
