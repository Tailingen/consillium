Adaptive Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced NSCLC Based on Dynamic Enhanced MRI
This study is a randomized phase III trial that aiming to investigate the role of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) guided hypofractionated radiotherapy (hypo-RT) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) who are planned to receive hypo-RT combined with concurrent chemotherapy and consolidative immunotherapy. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups:

1. The study group will undergo adaptive dose-painting hypo-RT based on DCE-MRI.
2. The control group will undergo hypo-RT based on enhanced CT.

The treatment-related toxicity, local control and long-term survival will be evaluated compared between MRI-guided and CT-guided hypo-RT.
