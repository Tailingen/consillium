A Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between Apatinib Mesylate and Transporter Pgp Substrate Digoxin in Advanced Solid Tumor Subjects
Apatinib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2#VEGFR-2#, Induces Transporter Pgp function in vitro. This study in patients with advanced cancer evaluated the effect of Apatinib on Transporter Pgp function by comparing the pharmacokinetics of Transporter Pgp-specific probe drugs in the presence and absence of Apatinib. The probes used Substrate Digoxin.
