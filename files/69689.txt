Combination of Platinum Doublets and Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in NSCLC
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Different chemotherapy and radiation regimens have been advocated but in general, cisplatin-doublets are deemed standard of care. Decreasing the overall treatment time of irradiation by hypofractionation is thought to increase the efficacy. Extensive experience is available on the combination of daily-dose cisplatin in combination with hypofractionated radiotherapy. However, no data is available on the safety of cisplatin doublets and hypofractionated radiotherapy
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: hypofractionated radiotherapy|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Etoposide
Incidence of treatment related Adverse events (according to CTCAE v 4.03), safety defined by the rate of grade 3-5 adverse events, within 3 months FU
safety defined by the rate of grade 3-4 treatment related adverse events, safety will be assessed by the incidence of grade 3-4 related adverse event (CTCAE v 4.03), 3 months|disease control rate, 1 year|progression free survival, 2 years|overall survival, 2 years
biomarker, assessment of circulating cell free tumor DNA for residual disease, through study completion, an average of 2 years
Patients presenting with locally advanced NSCLC will be consented to participate in this phase 2 trial that evaluates the concurrent treatment of cisplatin (Day 1: 75mg/m2) and pemetrexed (Day 1: 500mg/m2 for non-squamous cell lung cancer) or etoposide (Day1-3 100mg/m2 for squamous cell lung cancer), 3-weekly regimens, together with radiotherapy (24 daily fractions of 2.42 Gy to the mediastinal lymph nodes with an integrated boost of 2.75 Gy to the primary tumour). An interim analysis is planned following the first cohort of 25 patients to assess safety.
