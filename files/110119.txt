Add-on Study for Protocol G200802 (NCT02463032): Effect of GTx-024 on Maximal Neuromuscular Function and Lean Body Mass
This is a multiple site, proof of concept feasibility study to describe the effect of GTx-024 9 or 18 mg on physical function in female subjects, from protocol G200802, with ER+/AR+ breast cancer.
