This is a randomized clinical trial of Paclitaxel (Genexol®) and Cisplatin versus Paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol-PM®) and Cisplatin in advanced non small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel (Genexol®)|DRUG: Paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol-PM®)
response rate, overall responses are complete response and partial response, up to 6 cycles
overall survival, OS was calculated by the time from randomization date to the date of death, up to 3 years|progression-free survival, PFS was calculated by the time from randomization date to objective tumor progression or death., up to 3 years|toxicity profiles, Incidence of AE, laboratory test results (hematology, blood chemistry, and urine test), physical examination, vital sign, and ECOG performance were used for safety endpoints, up to 6 cycles
