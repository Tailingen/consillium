INSIDE: Identification of Genomic Screening Pathways in Cancer Patients With DNA Repair Alterations
400 patients will be enrolled and divided into 3 cohorts: Cohort A: patients with high risk localized prostate cancer (PC) defined as \>cT3 or PSA \> 20 ng/mL or presence of ECE or SVI at mpMRI;

Cohort B: patients with de novo metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC);

Cohort C: patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing on a standard treatment.

Number, type and frequency of DDR and MMR germline/somatic alterations, Evaluation of the frequency, number and type of DDR and MMR germline/somatic alterations in the study population, 24 months|Changes in PSA levels in the 3 cohorts, Evaluation of PSA levels (baseline versus follow-up) in the 3 cohorts compared with radiological assessment, 36 months
Number of patient-derived preclinical models, Number of patient-derived preclinical models (primary 2D cell lines, organoids or PDXs), 36 months
In this study 150 patients will be enrolled in cohort A, 100 patients in cohort B and 100-150 patients in Cohort C.

Considering the known frequency of DDR and MMR germline/somatic alterations, it is expected to see:

* 15-23 patients with germline/somatic DDR defects and 5-7 MMR alterations in cohort A;
* 20-25 patients with germline/somatic DDR defects and 5-7 MMR alterations in cohort B;
* 25-35 patients with germline/somatic DDR defects and 7-10 MMR alterations in cohort C.

Patients within Cohort A will be followed up with PSA every 3 months for 3 years and early scans. They will also receive a blood sample for ctDNA/CTC before (when feasible) and after radical treatment, 6 months and 12 months (if not progressed), at time of PSA or radiological progression;

Patients within Cohort B will be followed up with PSA and scans every 3 months. They will also receive a blood sample before (when feasible) or after the start of systemic treatment, 6 months and 12 months (if not progressed), at time of PSA or radiological progression.

Patients within Cohort C will be followed up with PSA monthly and scans every 3 month. They will also receive a blood sample for ctDNA/CTC before (when feasible) or after the start of systemic treatment, 6 months and 12 months (if not progressed), at time of PSA or radiological progression.
