To Demonstrate Equivalence in Analgesic Efficacy & Bowel Function Between OXN PR Higher Dose & Lower Dose Tablet Strengths in Subjects With Non-cancer or Cancer Pain
This study is aimed to demonstrate equivalence between combinations of lower strength OXN PR tablets (OXN PR LST) and single higher strength OXN PR tablets (OXN PR HST) taken at the same overall daily dose.

Study OXN3508 is a multicenter double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, cross-over, 2-period, phase III study in male and female subjects with severe non-malignant or malignant pain that requires around-the-clock opioid therapy at a daily dose of 120/60 mg or 160/80 mg oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release (OXN PR).
