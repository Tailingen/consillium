Effects of Deep Regional Hyperthermia in Patients With Anal Carcinoma Treated by Standard Radiochemotherapy
Randomized study to investigate the efficacy of deep regional hyperthermia in patients with anal carcinoma treated by standard radiochemotherapy with MMC and 5-FU.
Anal Carcinoma
RADIATION: Irradiation|DRUG: Mitomycin C|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|PROCEDURE: Hyperthermia
Improvement of complete remission, 12 weeks after start of treatment
Colostomy-free survival, 5 years after start of treatment|locoregional relapse-free survival, 5 years after start of treatment|Overall relapse-free survival, 5 years after start of treatment|Overall survival, 5 years after start of treatment|Response rate, 5 years after start of treatment|Rate of acute and late toxicity, 5 years after start of treatment|Quality of life, 5 years after start of treatment
Pat. with anal carcinoma and treated with standard radiochemotherapy with Mitomycin C and 5-FU will in the experimental arm receive deep regional hyperthermia (6x).
