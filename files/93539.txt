The Application Value of Artificial Intelligence in MRI Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Bladder Cancer
This study was a prospective, multicenter observational clinical study, A total of 150 patients with bladder malignant tumor who was admitted to the urology department of each center for treatment and underwent electric resection or radical cystectomy were planned to be enrolled. In order to analyze the sensitivity、specificity and accuracy of artificial intelligence in predicting postoperative pathological staging, Patients who entered the group were followed up for 3 years, then, we analyzed the correlation between artificial intelligence prediction results and patient OS PFS RFS. It was preliminarily verified that the results of the artificial intelligence model have the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
To explore the application value of artificial intelligence in the precise diagnosis and treatment of bladder tumor, and to improve the accuracy of MRI diagnosis of bladder cancer stage and grade through artificial intelligence., 2、Through Concordance analysis of artificial intelligence diagnosis assay results with gold standard results of surgery, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of artificial intelligence diagnosis before the operation., 1 year
Overall survival, The correlation between artificial intelligence model and OS in bladder cancer patients was analyzed to preliminarily verify the potential ability of artificial intelligence model results in predicting the prognosis of bladder cancer patients., 3 years after surgery
recurrence-free survival, The correlation between artificial intelligence model and RFS in bladder cancer patients was analyzed to preliminarily verify the potential ability of artificial intelligence model results in predicting the prognosis of bladder cancer patients., 3 years after surgery|progression-free survival, The correlation between artificial intelligence model and PFS in bladder cancer patients was analyzed to preliminarily verify the potential ability of artificial intelligence model results in predicting the prognosis of bladder cancer patients., 3 years after surgery
Preliminary research: This research is multi-disciplinary joint research by combining artificial intelligence with magnetic resonance, it can make the preoperative determination of bladder cancer stage more accurate and guides the clinician worker's treatment plan. At present, It has been constructed that an artificial intelligence model based on preoperative magnetic resonance images to predict staging and patient prognosis. We built a staging prediction model through deep learning artificial intelligence network, and collected magnetic resonance image data and related postoperative pathological data of patients, afterwards, We followed 576 patients on the basis of staging model construction. By obtaining OS, PFS, and RFS of patients, a part was randomly selected as a training set for training the deep learning network model. The other part is used as a test set to verify its accuracy. This study was a prospective, multicenter observational clinical study, A total of 150 patients with bladder malignant tumor who was admitted to the urology department of each center for treatment and underwent electric resection or radical cystectomy were planned to be enrolled. In order to analyze the sensitivity、specificity and accuracy of artificial intelligence in predicting postoperative pathological staging, Patients who entered the group were followed up for 3 years, then, we analyzed the correlation between artificial intelligence prediction results and patient OS PFS RFS. It was preliminarily verified that the results of the artificial intelligence model have the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer.
