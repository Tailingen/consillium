A Study of T-DXd as Monotherapy or in Combination With Anti-cancer Agents in Patients With Selected HER2-expressing Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cancer agents for the treatment in locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic patients with selected HER2-expressing solid tumors which are not eligible for curative therapy.
Advanced Solid Tumors (Excluding Gastric Cancer and Breast Cancer)
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed ORR is the proportion of patients who have a confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response per RECIST 1.1., An average of approximately 12 months
Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death in the absence of disease progression., An average of approximately 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., An average of approximately 12 months|Confirmed best objective response (BOR), BOR is a patient's best response during their participation in the study up until RECIST 1.1-defined progression or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST 1.1-defined progression., An average of approximately 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of objective progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death., An average of approximately 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death due to any cause., An average of approximately 12 months|Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be utilized for all events., An average of approximately 12 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of T-DXd, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody and MAAA-1181a., An average of approximately 12 months|Immunogenicity of T-DXd, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies against T-DXd in serum at each time point., An average of approximately 12 months
