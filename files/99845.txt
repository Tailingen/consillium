A Ph 2 Study of Fosbretabulin in Subjects w Pancreatic or Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors w Elevated Biomarkers
This study will investigate the safety, symptoms and biomarker response of subjects with biopsy-proven well-differentiated, low-to-intermediate-grade, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) or or Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs) with elevated biochemical markers who have relapsed during or after receiving prior standard of care therapies, including octreotide, chemotherapy or targeted therapy.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: fosbretabulin tromethamine
Number of Participants With Improved, Stable, or Worsened Change In Chromogranin A (CgA) Biomarker Levels From Baseline, The mean change from baseline in chromogranin A (CgA) biomarker level is considered improved if a 25% reduction occurs and worsened if the mean change from baseline is increased by 25%., Baseline and 4 months|Number of Participants With Improved, Stable, or Worsened Change In 5-hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) Biomarker Levels From Baseline, The mean change from baseline in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) biomarker level is considered improved if a 25% reduction occurs and worsened if the mean change from baseline is increased by 25%., Baseline and 4 months|Number of Participants With Improved, Stable, or Worsened Change In Serotonin Biomarker Levels From Baseline, The mean change from baseline in serotonin biomarker level is considered improved if a 25% reduction occurs and worsened if the mean change from baseline is increased by 25%., Baseline and 4 months
Number of Participants With Partial Response (PR), Progressive Disease (PD), or Stable Disease (SD) Based on RECIST 1.1, The objective response rate (complete response, partial response, progressive disease, or stable disease) was determined by the investigator assessment of the participant's CT or MRI using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) for target lesions. Partial Response (PR) is when there is at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) is when there is at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions, as well as an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (including appearance of new lesions). Stable Disease (SD) is when there neither a PR nor PD is noted., Baseline and 4 months
Subjects enrolled in this PNET/GI-NET study (OX4218s) will receive weekly dosing with fosbretabulin for up to 3 cycles or approximately 9 weeks.
