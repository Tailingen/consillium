The Possible Influence of Different Follow-up Modalities on Overall Survival in Ovarian Cancer
The study is designed as an observational cohort study, aiming to evaluate, whether a structured recording of symptoms by a mobile app contributes insight in the follow-up modalities of ovarian cancer patients.
Patient Reported Outcome Measures|Ovarian Neoplasms
DEVICE: Mobile app ovarian cancer followup (ePRO)
Overall survival three years after end of therapy, Overall survival three years after the end of primary therapy / start of follow-up, 3 years

GRADE ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS 0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction

1. Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work
2. Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours
3. Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours
4. Completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair
5. Dead, 3 years|Amount and frequency of patient data entries, Amount and frequency of patient data entries, 3 years|Platinum-sensitivity and the patients' platinum free interval (PFI), Platinum-sensitivity and the patients' platinum free interval (PFI), 3 years|Number and type of unplanned hospitalizations and emergencies., Unplanned hospitalizations and emergencies are defined as additional consultations outside of planned therapy or control visits at the treatment center or with the investigator, as well as unplanned visits to other physicians (e.g., GP) or emergency services., 3 years|Symptoms that led to further diagnostic measures and possibly the detection of tumor relapse, Symptoms that led to further diagnostic measures (imaging diagnostics and CA-125 testing) and possibly the detection of tumor relapse, 3 years
The observational study will examine different follow-up modalities for ovarian cancer patients with the ultimate goal of improving follow-up strategies for an improved well-being and better clinical outcomes. The primary objective is to quantify the effects of conservative clinical diagnostics by collecting symptoms via ePRO in addition to intensive diagnostics (CA-125 testing, imaging diagnostics) during follow-up, on survival, time to clinical recurrence and well-being.
