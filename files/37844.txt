Hepatic Artery Infusion of Adebrelimab Combined With Bevacizumab in the Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Failure of Systemic Therapy Combined With Interventional Therapy
The goal of this prospective single arm, Phase II Clinical Study is to explore and evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic artery infusion of Adebrelimab combined with Bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who failed in systematic therapy combined with interventional therapy.

Participants will receive hepatic artery infusion of Adebrelimab 1200mg, d1, q3w, combined with hepatic artery infusion of Bevacizumab 5mg/kg, d1, q3w, HAIC treatment for 3-4 times.
