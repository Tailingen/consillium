Define the Optimal Uptake Time of 68Ga-OPS202 When Used as a PET (Positron Emission Tomography) Imaging Agent in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer
The purpose of this clinical research is to define the optimal uptake time of 68Ga-OPS202 as a PET imaging agent to be used to detect and localize breast cancer somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) positive lesions.

68Ga-OPS202 is a radiolabelled imaging agent to be used in association with PET. 68Ga-OPS202 is made of two main components: 1) OPS202, an antagonistic somatostatin analogue which binds to the somatostatin receptor (type 2) present on the surface of the tumor cells and 2) Gallium 68, a radioisotope that, combined with OPS202, can be seen in the PET scanner.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Satoreotide trizoxetan
Percentage of Subjects With Sufficiently Avid Lesion(s) Identified as a sstr2 Positive Lesion (Co-Primary Endpoint), The percentage of subjects with sufficiently avid lesion(s) to be identified as a sstr2 positive lesion using 68Ga-satoreotide trizoxetan was to be determined., At 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 hours post injection on Day 1.|Differences in the Number of Lesions Detected by 68Ga-Satoreotide Trizoxetan Between the 3 PET Acquisition Timepoints in Primary Breast Lesions (Co-Primary Endpoint), The differences in the number of lesions detected by 68Ga-satoreotide trizoxetan between the 3 PET acquisition timepoints, and reader interpretation was to be determined., 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 hours post injection on Day 1
