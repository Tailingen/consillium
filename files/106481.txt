A Phase 1/2 Study of TY101 for Locally Advanced /Metastatic Solid Tumors and Relapsed or Refractory Lymphomas
A multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1/2 study, to evaluate TY101 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, effectiveness and immunogenicity in patients with Locally Advanced /Metastatic Solid Tumors and Relapsed or Refractory Lymphomas. The study includes two parts: dose escalation and expansion cohort to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy.
Locally Advanced /Metastatic Solid Tumors|Relapsed or Refractory Lymphomas
DRUG: TY101
Safety and Tolerability measured, Number of Participants with treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs) by CTCAE v5.0., 90 days after the last dose.|Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), DLT is the primary endpoint for safety in the dose escalation phase and will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., 3 weeks after first dose for each dose group.
Pharmacokinetics(Cmax), Maximum Concentration(Cmax), Up to approximately 12 months|Pharmacokinetics(Tmax), Dose escalation: Peak time(Tmax), Up to approximately 12 months|Pharmacokinetics(AUC), Dose escalation: Area Under Curve(AUC), Up to approximately 12 months|Pharmacokinetics(t1/2), Dose escalation: half life(t1/2), Up to approximately 12 months|Pharmacokinetics(PPK), Dose escalation: Population pharmacokinetics(PPK), The PPK evaluation will be further designed based on the results of the dose escalation phase.|Objective response rate(ORR), Efficacy observation, Up to approximately 12 months|Overall Survival(OS), Efficacy observation, Up to approximately 12 months|Progression-free survival(PFS), Efficacy observation, Up to approximately 12 months
