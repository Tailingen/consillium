The Necessity of a Second Transurethral Resection in High-risk Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Patients With Negative Urine Biomarker After Initial Transurethral Resection
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of using a urine biomarker test to guide the decision-making process regarding the necessity of reTURBT in NMIBC patients. The main question aims to answer whether patients with negative urine biomarker tests can safely avoid reTURBT without compromising recurrence-free survival. Participants who have completed the initial TURBT and tested negative for the urine biomarker will be enrolled in the study. They will then be randomized 1:2 into two groups:Group A: Participants will not receive reTURBT and Group B: Participants will undergo reTURBT. Researchers will compare the RFS rates between Group A (no reTURBT) and Group B (reTURBT) to determine if the urine biomarker test can safely spare patients from unnecessary reTURBT.
Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: Urine biomarker -Guided without reTURBT
2-year RFS rate, the proportion of participants experiencing a recurrence during follow-up within 2 years, from initial TURBT to the first confirmed recurrence within 2 years
RFS, the duration from the completion of initial TURBT until the first recurrence of cancer is detected or until the end of the follow-up period, whichever comes first., from initial TURBT to the first confirmed recurrence within 2 years
This clinical trial aims to address the clinical question of whether a urine biomarker test can effectively guide the decision-making process regarding the necessity of reTURBT (repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumor) in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The primary objective is to assess whether patients with negative urine biomarker tests can safely avoid reTURBT. Participants eligible for enrollment in this study will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio into two groups:Group A: Participants assigned to this group will not undergo reTURBT. They will receive standard follow-up care as per institutional guidelines. Group B: Participants assigned to this group will undergo reTURBT. Following reTURBT, they will also receive standard follow-up care. The main task for participants will involve providing urine samples for the biomarker test before reTURBT. Those in Group B will additionally undergo reTURBT, a standard surgical procedure involving the removal of residual tumor tissue from the bladder.Throughout the study period, researchers will assess their recurrence-free survival rates and RFS. The goal is to determine whether the urine biomarker test can safely spare patients from unnecessary reTURBT while maintaining comparable RFS rates. This study adheres to ethical guidelines and has obtained approval from the appropriate institutional review boards. Participant confidentiality and data integrity will be strictly maintained throughout the study duration. The results of this trial have the potential to inform clinical practice guidelines and improve the management of NMIBC patients by offering a personalized approach to treatment decision-making.
