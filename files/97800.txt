BIOLOGICAL: Blood sample
Prospectively validate the discriminating capacities of the RadioDtect© individual radiosensitivity blood test on the occurrence of early radio-induced toxicities., The validation will be based on ATM protein quantification assay to predict acute toxicities, 24 months|Prospectively validate the discriminating capacities of the RadioDtect© individual radiosensitivity blood test on the occurrence of early radio-induced toxicities., evaluation of acute toxicities of grade ≥ 2 to 3 months according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03 criteria, 24 months
Prospectively validate the discriminating capacities of the RadioDtect individual radiosensitivity blood test protein assay according on the occurrence of late radiation-induced toxicity at 12 months, The validation will be based on ATM protein quantification assay to predict late toxicities, 12 months|Prospectively validate the discriminating capacities of the RadioDtect individual radiosensitivity blood test protein assay according on the occurrence of late radiation-induced toxicity at 12 months, evaluation of late toxicities of grade ≥ 2, according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03 criteria, 12 months
