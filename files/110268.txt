An Extension to Study MA21573, Evaluating Tocilizumab in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis and an Inadequate Response to Current Non-Biological DMARDs and/or Anti-tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Therapy
This study was an extension to study MA21573 \[NCT00750880\], which was an open label single arm study to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy, or combination therapy with non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis.

For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response).
