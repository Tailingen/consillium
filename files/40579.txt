Universal CAR-T Cells (REVO-UWD-01) for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is an investigator initiated trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a GCC-targeting CAR-T therapy (REVO-UWD-01) in the metastatic colorectal cancer. It also aims to explore the feasibility of using a novel universal CAR-T cell platform.
CRC (Colorectal Cancer)|Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Universal CAR-T cells injection for treating mCRC
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose of GCC-CAR-T cells that can be administered without causing unacceptable side effects, measured during the dose escalation phase., Within the first month post-infusion.|Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), The incidence of treatment-related toxicities that prevent further dose escalation., Within the first month post-infusion.|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), The frequency and severity of adverse events that arise following the administration of UWD-01-CAR-T cells., From the administration of UWD-01 CAR-T cells through six months post-infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a measurable reduction in tumor size (complete or partial response) following GCC-CAR-T therapy., Measured at 3 and 6 months after treatment.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time during and after treatment that the patient lives without disease progression., From the start of treatment up to 5 years.|Overall Survival (OS), The duration from the start of treatment to the time of death from any cause., From the start of treatment up to maximum follow-up period of five years.|Duration of Response (DOR), The time from initial tumor response (CR or PR) to disease progression or relapse or any cause of death., From the administration of UWD-01 CAR-T cells to a maximum follow-up period of five years.
The study will use T cells from healthy donors, modified using a novel universal CAR-T technology, to treat metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The antigen-binding site of the CAR molecule recognizes GCC as the target.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GCC-CAR-T therapy in universal CAR-T cell treatments?
* What are the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE)?
* What is the treatment\&amp;amp;#39;s efficacy, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS)? Researchers will assess whether universal CAR-T cells have good safety and efficacy in treating colorectal cancer, while improving accessibility and lowering treatment costs.

Participants will:

* Receive universal GCC-CAR-T cells through a 3+3 dose escalation scheme.
* Undergo chemotherapy conditioning before CAR-T infusion.
* Be monitored for adverse events, immune response, and disease progression.

The study will collect data on both short-term outcomes (within the first few months post-treatment) and long-term safety and efficacy.
