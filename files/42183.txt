Long Term Outcomes Following Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Laparoscopic Supracervical Hysterectomy
Objective: To compare the occurrence and intensity of pelvic pain as well as patient satisfaction and quality of life after total laparoscopic and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.

Design: Prospective randomised trial.

Null hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference in occurrence and intensity of pelvic pain following TLH compared with following LSH.

Null hypothesis 2: There is no significant difference in patient satisfaction and quality of life following TLH compared with following LSH.

Sample: 62 consecutive premenopausal women referred to the department for hysterectomy on the basis of a benign condition. The expected mean pain reduction (m) in the LSH group: 3.32, sd (s): 2.71.24 A difference in mean pain reduction (d) equal to 1 sd is considered a clinically important improvement (standardised difference d/s=1). Number of women required (power 90 % and a level of significance 0.05): 62 patients.

Methods: The study participants are randomised to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 31), or laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (n = 31).
