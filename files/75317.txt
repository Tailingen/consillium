Personalised Postoperative Radiochemotherapy in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The current trial is evaluating the integration of a pretherapeutical FDG-PET/MRI in the adjuvant radiochemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. As a secondary hypothesis the intention is to develop of a multi-parametric decision support system for personalised medicine by integrating functional imaging, γH2AX-analysis and genetic information.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Integration of PET/MRI in radiotherapy
locoregional progression free survival, 15% improvement in loco-regional PFS at 2 years through integrtion of pre-operative PET/MR imaging into RT treatment planning, 2 years after primary diagnosis
Disease free survival, 2 years after primary diagnosis|Overall survival, 2 years after primary diagnosis|Development of a multi-parametric decision support system, after termination of recruitment and follow up up to 5 years
