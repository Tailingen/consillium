Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

DRUG: sunitinib malate
Objective Tumor Response Rate (Complete Response [CR] and Partial Response [PR]) Using RECIST Criteria, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, While patient remains on treatment, up to 30 weeks|Feasibility of Treatment, Ability to remain on treatment without dose reduction, While patient remains on treatment, up to 30 weeks
Progression-free Survival, Time to disease progression or death from any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, Time from start of treatment until death from any cause., Up to two years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the overall response rate of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with sunitinib malate.

II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the feasibility of administering this drug to patients with ECOG performance status 2 (cohort B).

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, cohort study.

Patients are assigned to one of two cohorts according to ECOG performance status (ECOG 0-1 \[cohort A\] vs ECOG 2 \[cohort B\]). Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.
