Two Different Dietary Interventions for Girls With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the MEtabolic Syndrome REduction in NAvarra (RESMENA) diet versus a control diet based on American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for the treatment of PCOS in adolescents with obesity and PCOS. A total of 40 adolescents diagnosed with PCOS between the ages of 13-18 years were randomized to either a Resmena or control diet for 6 months. Dietary status, anthropometry, body composition, biochemical parameters, and reproductive endocrine hormones were compared between the 2 groups before and after the intervention.

Waist circumference in cm, waist circumference was measured, change between the first day and the sixth month of the study|body composition analysis, body composition analysis (fat mass /kg), fat percentage (%), fat-free mass (kg)) were made by using the InBody 720 (1-1000 kHz; InBody Co., Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a high meal frequency, low carbohydrate, high protein, high n-3 PUFA, healthy fatty acid and antioxidant content, low glycemic load Resmena diet or a control diet based on AHA recommendations on anthropometric measurements, body composition, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism levels, inflammatory markers and reproductive endocrine levels in adolescents with obesity and PCOS..Randomized controlled study design was used in the study. Patients in the study were allocated to the control and study intervention groups. Participants were invited to face-to-face interviews at the beginning of the study and monthly for 6 months.

Anthropometric measurements, body composition analysis, and a physical activity questionnaire were performed at the beginning and end of the study, and three-day food consumption records and blood samples for the measurement of biochemical parameters were collected. In addition, the physical activity and food consumption records of the participants were repeated in monthly controls and their anthropometric measurements and body composition were analyzed and compared.
