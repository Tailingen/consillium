Cryoablation Versus BCG Instillation Therapy for High-risk NMIBC
This trial plans to enroll 190 eligible patients and randomize them into two groups with a 1:1 ratio, with 95 patients in each group. The experimental group will receive immediate cryoablation therapy at the resection site after TUR, while the control group will only undergo TUR and receive conventional BCG instillation therapy postoperatively. Both groups of subjects will undergo Re-TURBT or cystoscopy 10-12 weeks after surgery to compare the tumor-free residual rates and adverse events between the two groups.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: Transurethral cryoablation|PROCEDURE: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor|DRUG: Bcg Intravesical
Tumor residual rate, 10-12 weeks after the initial TUR, Re-TUR or cystoscopy is performed on the original resection site, and a biopsy of the tissue at the original resection site is conducted to analyze and observe whether there is any tumor residue at the original tumor site., 10-12 weeks after initial TURBt
Recurrence, Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer recurrence during follow-up, 2 years|Progression, Muscle invasive bladder cancer recurrence during follow-up, 2 years
