The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TL-118 alone or in combination with pancreatic cancer chemotherapy.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: TL-118
Clinical Benefit Measurement, Clinical Benefit Measurement is a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), performance status and weight. Clinical benefit requires an improvement in at least one parameter, without worsening in any others, sustained for at least 4 weeks, Baseline up to 2 years
Safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability profiles will be judged by:

* Local and systemic toxicities.
* Number, type and degree of toxicities as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, Baseline up to 2 years|Response Rate (RR), RR measured every 8 weeks after enrollment up to 2 years|Overall Survival, OS measured at 16 and 52 weeks after treatment initiation or at death, whichever comes first up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS measured at 8 weeks after enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death, whichever comes first, up to 2 years
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TL-118 alone or in combination with pancreatic cancer chemotherapy.
