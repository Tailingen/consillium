Effects of Vitamin D in Patients With Breast Cancer
This protocol is a randomized, phase 2 "window of opportunity" trial assessing the biological effects of short term oral vitamin D administration on breast cancer clinical and translational markers in patients awaiting surgery at the Ottawa Hospital. It takes advantage of the current wait times (2-8 weeks) for breast cancer surgery as a "window of opportunity" to rapidly assess biological changes with vitamin D intake.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Vitamin D3|OTHER: Placebo
Pre and post vitamin D administration Ki67 levels and Caspase 3 levels (as assessed according to the apoptosis assay), Participants will have Ki67 and Caspase 3 levels performed on the tissue that was used to initially diagnose breast cancer. Those levels will then be compared to the tissue acquired at the time of surgery which will occur 2-8 weeks from diagnosis., baseline and 2-8 weeks from baseline
Serum levels of 25-0HD and in vivo breast (cancer and non cancer) tissue levels of 1,25(OH), Participant will have Serum levels of 25-0HD and in vivo breast cancer tissue levels of 1,25(OH) taken at baseline and surgery, Baseline and 2-8 weeks from baseline at the time of surgery
