A Trial to Learn if Fianlimab and Cemiplimab Are Safe and Work Better Than Anti-PD1 Alone in Adult Participants With Resectable Stage 3 or 4 Melanoma
This study is researching an experimental drug called REGN3767, also known as fianlimab (R3767), when combined with another medication called cemiplimab (each individually called a "study drug" or called "study drugs" when combined) compared with cemiplimab alone. These types of immunotherapy study drugs are collectively known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapies are treatments that use the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. The study is focused on participants with a type of skin cancer known as melanoma.

The objective of this study is to see if the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab is an effective treatment compared to cemiplimab in participants with high-risk, resectable melanoma. Participants will receive treatment before surgery, undergo resection, and then will have the option to continue treatment after resection.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from receiving the study drug(s).
* How much study drug(s) is in the blood at different times.
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug(s) (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects). Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections.
* How administering the study drugs might improve quality of life.

The FACT-M is scored on a 5-point Likert-scale: "Not at all", "A little bit", "Somewhat", "Quite a bit", and "Very much.". A Higher score represents higher Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)., Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in functioning per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QoL) C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including a global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) scale. Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much." A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change., Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in global health status/QoL per EORTC QLQ-C30, Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in overall health state per European Quality of Life Dimension 5 (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L consists of EQ-5D descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems., Up to 4 years
