Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth
Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer|Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer|Stage III Ovarian Epithelial Cancer|Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer
DRUG: imatinib mesylate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Response rate (complete and partial confirmed response), Up to 3 years
Toxicity as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0, Up to 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the response rates (confirmed, complete, and partial) in patients with platinum- and taxane-refractory stage III or IV ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with imatinib mesylate.

II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate, preliminarily, CD117 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression levels with response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
