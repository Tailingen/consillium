Time-Restricted Eating to Address Persistent Cancer-Related Fatigue
This study will assess the feasibility of delivering a 12-week time-restricted eating intervention as well as the intervention's preliminary efficacy on persistent cancer-related fatigue among cancer survivors compared to a general health education control. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: time-restricted eating or control. Those in the intervention arm will self-select a 10-hour eating window in which to consume all food and beverages (water is allowed any time, black coffee and unsweetened tea are allowed in the morning). Both groups will receive weekly educational tips on healthy lifestyle behaviors in cancer survivorship. This study will also explore relationships between fatigue, circadian rhythm, and glucose metabolism.

The hypothesis is that recruitment will be feasible, and participants will adhere to time-restricted eating and complete study activities over the course of the 12 weeks. The second hypothesis is that time-restricted eating will lead to less fatigue at 12 weeks compared to the control, accounting for baseline fatigue levels.

Feasibility, as Assessed by the Percentage of Participants Who Enrolled Completed the Study, To assess feasibility, the percentage of participants who provide evaluable data regarding their eating window at baseline and 12 weeks will be assessed., 12 weeks|Fatigue, as Assessed Using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Questionnaire, FACIT-F fatigue subscale scores will be compared for those in the time-restricted eating group vs. the control group at week 12, controlling for baseline levels. This questionnaire is 13-items long. The scale is from 0-52, and a higher score indicates less fatigue., 12 weeks
