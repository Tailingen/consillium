Clinical Study of CAR-CLD18 T Cells in Patients With Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and engraftment of CAR-CLD18 T cells in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
GENETIC: CAR-CLD18 T Cells
Safety and tolerance, During the trial conduction, especially within the 24 weeks of treatment phase when CAR-CLD18 T cell administered, all adverse events (including laboratory abnormality and clinical events) will be closely monitored, and all â‰¥ grade 3 adverse events per CTCAE (v 3.0) will be recorded, including but not limited to the toxicities potentially suspected to relate to infusion procedures and/or CAR-CLD18 T cell therapy as listed below:

* Fever
* Chills
* Nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms
* Fatigue
* Hypotension
* Respiratory distress
* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Cytokine release syndrome
* Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
* Liver and kidney dysfunction, 24 weeks
Engraftment, Duration of in vivo survival of CAR-CLD18 T cells is defined as "engraftment". The primary engraftment endpoint is the number of DNA vector copies per mL blood of CAR-CLD18 T cells at regular intervals through week 4 following the initial infusion. Q-PCR for CAR-CLD18 T vector sequences will be performed until any 2 sequential tests are negative, documented as engraftment and persistence of CAR-CLD18 T cells., 2 years

For patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who have not been cured with first line chemotherapy, and who are not willing to undergo second line chemotherapy after the failure of first line chemotherapy while there are no effective therapies for their unmet medical needs known at this time, and for patients with advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma which has relapsed after surgery or for which there is no surgical indication, who have not been cured with or refused to receive other standard regimens, single or multiple doses of CAR-CLD18 T cells will be given to observe safety and efficacy of CAR-CLD18 T cells.

Primary objectives:

Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the autologous T cells transduced with anti-Claudin18.2 lentiviral vector in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Secondary objectives:

Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of CAR-CLD18 T cells in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the following parameters:

Time of tumor progression (TTP);

Disease Control Rate (DCR);

Objective Remission Rate (ORR);

Overall Survival (OS).
