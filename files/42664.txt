Light-Scattering Spectroscopy for Detection of Breast Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies light-scattering spectroscopy in finding disease in patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as light-scattering spectroscopy, may help find and diagnose breast cancer
Healthy, no Evidence of Disease|Stage II Breast Cancer|Stage IIIA Breast Cancer|Stage IIIB Breast Cancer|Stage IIIC Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: light-scattering spectroscopy
Accurate classifications of women with or without breast cancer, Exact binomial probabilities will be used., Up to 1 year|Utility of optical markers in distinguishing cancer involved breasts from normal breasts, Multivariate analyses will be used., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether light-scattering spectroscopy can reliably distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical stage II or stage III breast cancer and those without breast cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo light-scattering spectroscopy of the breast in addition to standard of care as it relates to screening for breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer.
