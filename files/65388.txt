Treating Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma with Tazemetostat
Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma With EZH2
DRUG: Tazemetostat
efficacy of Tazemetostat in EZH2 (MT) (Cohort 1), Objective response rate (ORR) of Cohort 1 evaluated by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) \[based on the International Working Group-Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma \[IWG-NHL\] (Cheson) 2007\], 22 months
efficacy of Tazemetostat in EZH2 (WT) (Cohort 2), Overall survival (OS) of Cohort 1 and 2. OS: defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to death for any cause., 22 months|safety of Tazemetostat in EZH2 (WT) (Cohort 2), The incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Occurrence of AEs (including SAEs) will be monitored based on the changes in vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and laboratory examinations. The severity of AEs will be graded based on NCI CTCAE V5.0., 22 months|Geomean maximum concentration (Cmax) of tazemetostat and its metabolite EPZ-6930 in blood, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration that a drug achieves in a test area of the body after the drug has been administered. Plasma concentration-time profiles of tazemetostat and EPZ-6930 will be plotted using non-compartmental analysis and will be analyzed to determine Cmax. Cmax will be summarized as the geomean and geomean CV% for all participants., Cycle1Day1: predose of first administration; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. Cycle1Day15: predose of first administration ; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. Cycle2Day1 and Cycle3Day1: predose of first administration.|Median time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of tazemetostat and its metabolite EPZ-6930 in blood, Tmax is defined as the time from dosing to reach the maximum observed concentration a drug achieves in a specified compartment or test area of the body after the drug has been administered. Plasma concentration-time profiles of tazemetostat and EPZ-6930 will be plotted using non-compartmental analysis and will be analyzed to determine Tmax. Tmax will be summarized as the median (min, max) for all participants., Cycle1Day 1: predose of first administration; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. Cycle1Day15: predose of first administration; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. Cycle2Day1 and Cycle3Day1: predose of first administration.|Geomean area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of tazemetostat and its metabolite EPZ-6930 after administration of tazemetostat, AUC represents the total drug exposure over a defined period of time. AUC will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Plasma concentrations of tazemetostat and EPZ-6930 will be analyzed using a non-compartmental analysis approach to determine individual participant estimates of AUC. AUC will be summarized as the geomean and geomean CV% for all participants., Cycle1Day1: predose of first administration; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose. Cycle1Day15: predose of first administration; 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose|Geomean minimum observed concentration at steady-state (Cmin) of tazemetostat and its metabolite EPZ-6930 in blood, Cmin is defined as the minimum observed concentration at steady-state during one dosing interval. Cmin will be summarized as the geomean and geomean CV% for all participants., Cycle1Day15, Cycle2Day1 and Cycle3Day1: predose of first administration
This is an open-label, monotherapy, Phase II Study clinical study. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Tazemetostat in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. It is planned to enroll 39 Chinese patients in 2 cohorts.
