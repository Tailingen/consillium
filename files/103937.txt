Study of S-1 as Second Line Treatment on Advanced Pancreatic Cancers
A randomized , open-label, multicenter, phase II study to compare the efficacy of S-1 and S-1 plus Leucovorin as second line treatment on gemcitabine-refractory patients with inoperable or advanced pancreatic cancers，investigate the correlation between efficacy and the expressions of thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: S-1 plus Leucovorin
Progression Free Survival(PFS), Assuming a 1.8 months median PFS in the S-1 arm, the study was designed to detect an improvement in PFS to 3.5 months in the S-1 plus Leucovorin arm, or 96% prolongation. The calculated number of PFS events needed to detect this difference with α (two-side) of 0.05 and power of 0.8 was 70. Assuming an average enrollment rate of 2.2 patients per month during planned 3-years study period, a total of eighty patients would be able to provide sufficient number of PFS events for the study at end of the study. However, a total of 90 patients were planned for the study, in consideration of comparison for safety and the overall survival between the two treatment groups., up to 3 years
