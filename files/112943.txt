Improving Exercise Capacity With a Tailored Physical Activity Intervention
The purpose of this research is to test whether participating in either a physical activity intervention or a series of educational classes will help to preserve exercise capability, heart function, brain-based activities (like memory), and quality of life.

Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 pathways:

* First pathway consists of organized health workshops. These workshops are intended to provide information on topics such as proper nutrition, management of stress, sleep practices, and emphasis on a healthy lifestyle that may help the participants through cancer treatment. This pathway will also test whether stretching may help participants through cancer treatment.
* Second pathway participants will take part in some unsupervised and some potentially supervised moderate activity sessions each week throughout participants' cancer treatment to take place either remotely or in person, depending on availability of facilities at the time visits are scheduled.

Change in Peak VO2, An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to assess post-intervention group differences in VO2, adjusted for baseline peak VO2., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention
Change in Peak Exercise Cardiac Output, Measured on a continuous scale and will be analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA (RMANCOVA) approach., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Calculated A-V Oxygen Levels, Measured on a continuous scale and will be analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA (RMANCOVA) approach., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Changes in Measurements of Pre-exercise Left Ventricular Function, Measured on a continuous scale and will be analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA (RMANCOVA) approach., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Neurocognitive Function - Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT-R) consists of memorization of a list of words to test the ability to recall immediately after memorization (immediate recall) and after a 20-minute delay (delayed recall). This test has three parts and two alternate forms. Total scores could range from 0 to 30. Lower raw scores indicate difficulties with the task., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Neurocognitive Function - Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), The Controlled Oral Word Association Test is a verbal fluency test in which participants are asked to say as many words as possible from a given category and in a specified timeframe (typically 60 seconds). COWAT is measured by calculating the total number of acceptable words produced for at the given letter of the alphabet. Errors and perseverations (word repetitions) are not included in this score., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Neurocognitive Function - Digit Span-Backward Test, The digit span backward test is used to assess working memory. Participants are given a series of digits and asked to repeat them backward. The item score is the sum of the scores on the two trials for that item (range=0-2). The total raw score for backwards digit span is the sum of the item scores; maximum backwards digit span total raw score is 16 points., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Neurocognitive Function - Trail Making Test, The Trail Making Test (TMT) asks patients to connect consecutive "targets" (numbers and/or letters) on a page arranged in a specific geometric pattern. Scoring is based on time taken to complete the test (e.g. 35 seconds yielding a score of 35) with lower scores being better., At baseline and 6 months after study intervention|Change in 6-Minute Walk Distance, Measured on a continuous scale and will be analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA (RMANCOVA) approach., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (FACT-Lym or FACT-B), FACT-Lym is 42-item questionnaire to assess the quality of life for lymphoma patients. 5-point Likert scale - 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Subscale domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, Lymphoma Subscale. Some items are reverse scored. Subscales scores are added to get the total score. The higher the score, the better the quality of life. Scores can range from 0-168.

FACT-B is a 37-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) that measures five domains of health-related quality of life in breast cancer patients. These include physical, social, emotional and functional well being on a Likert scale 0-4 with (not at all) to 4 (very much). The higher the score, the better quality of life. Scores can range from 0-148., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Fatigue Questionnaire, Questionnaire to assess the difference in the level of fatigue participants experience will performing study interventions. 5-point Likert scale - 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The higher the score the higher level of fatigue participants experience. Score range 0-52., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Physical Activity Levels - Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, The questionnaire is a 4-item measure used to classify participants' activity levels during a typical 7-day period based on how many times on average participants exercise more than 15 minutes during their free time of strenuous, moderate or mild exercise., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Physical Function - Balance Test, Participants will be asked to maintain balance for up to 30 seconds in three positions characterized by a progressive narrowing of the base support: heel of one foot beside the big toe of the other foot (semi-tandem position), heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other foot (tandem position), and single leg stand., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Physical Function - Chair Stand Test, The repeated chair stand test will be performed using a straight-backed chair placed with its back against a wall. Participants will be first asked to stand from a sitting position without using their arms. If they can perform the task, they will then be asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible. The time to complete the task will be recorded., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Physical Function - 4-Meter Walk Gait Speed Test, The gait speed test will assess the participant's ability to walk 4 meters. Participants will be instructed to start at a marked walking course with toes touching the start line and when cued to start, will begin walking at their usual speed. The time to walk from the starting line to the end of the 4-meter walk will be recorded, At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention|Change in Physical Function - Grip Strength, Grip strength will be assessed using an isometric handgrip dynamometer while the participant is seated with the head facing straight ahead. The elbow should be bent at a 90 degree angle and the wrist should be at the mid-prone position. The participant should exert maximally and quickly (about 1 second) and two trials should be made alternately with each hand, with at least 30 seconds between trials for the same hand (recorded in kilograms)., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after study intervention
Primary Objective: To determine if a \>10% difference exists in the % change (i.e., 2.06 ml/kg/min difference) in peak VO2 (volume or amount of oxygen your body consume) from baseline to 6 months of intervention between participants receiving the Physical Activity Intervention (PAI) versus Healthy Living Intervention (HLI).

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine if a \>10% difference exists in the % change in peak exercise cardiac output, calculated A-VO2 difference, and pre-exercise measures of left ventricular function from baseline to 6 months of intervention between participants receiving the PAI versus HLI.
* Among these same participants, 1) to compare PAI and HLI groups on their baseline to 3 \& 6 months after initiating cancer treatment changes in 6-minWD, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), fatigue, strength, physical activity, cognitive \& physical function, 2) to determine the relationships between the 6-month time-dependent changes in these and peak VO2; and 3) to examine whether time-dependent changes in peak exercise cardiac output and/or calculated arteriovenous oxygen difference are associated with similar time-dependent changes in peak VO2.
* Assess physical activity engagement via accelerometry.
