Evaluation of the PreCursor-M+速 in CIN2
The goal of this observational study is to to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of PreCursor-M+ on a post-aliquot of liquid-based cytology (LBC) cervical samples (biopsy) obtained by physicians in a group of women with histologically-proven diagnoses of CIN2.

The PreCursor-M+速 assay is a multiplex real-time methylation specific PCR test that identifies the level of promotor methylation of the host cell genes FAM19A4 and miR124-2, known biomarkers associated with cervical carcinoma and transforming CIN in cervical cells.

To evaluate the clinical course of CIN2 at 2 years after the first diagnosis, with an interval evaluation at 6 months.

After enrolment, women will be divided into two groups: "active surveillance" and "immediate treatment". In the first group, clinical outcomes to be assessed, in relation to the PreCursor-M+ result at baseline, will include regression to \<CIN2, persistence of CIN2, and progression to CIN3+. In the second group, we will evaluate the histological diagnosis at cone specimen (downgrading or upgrading) and the 2-year cumulative incidence of CIN2+ recurrence based on the PreCursor-M+ result at baseline.

Evaluation of methylation of the host cell genes FAM19A4 and miR124-2, The PreCursor-M+速 assay is a multiplex real-time methylation specific PCR test that identifies the level of promotor methylation of the host cell genes FAM19A4 and miR124-2, known biomarkers associated with cervical carcinoma and transforming CIN in cervical cells. This test can identify patients with spontaneous regressing precancer lesions (negative result) from patients with a progressing precancer lesion (positive result)., 6 months
