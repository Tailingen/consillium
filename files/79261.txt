A Study of FDA022-BB05 in Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FDA022-BB05 for the treatment in locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic patients with selected HER2 overexpressing/expressing solid tumors which are not eligible for curative therapy.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: FDA022-BB05
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with CR and PR assessed by investigators according to RECIST v 1.1, up to 24 month|Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Occurrence of AEs and SAEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0., up to 24 month
Duration of response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death., up to 24 month|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is the percentage of subjects who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)., up to 24 month|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is the time from date of first dose of study treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death., up to 24 month|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from date of first dose of study treatment until death due to any cause., up to 24 month|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of Serum FDA022-BB05 Following First Dose, The serum PK parameters of FDA022-BB05 and its analytes for area under the concentration-versus-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration as calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method (AUClast) and AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) elimination rate constant associated with the terminal phase were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods., From cycle1 to Cycle10 (each cycle is 21 days. )|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Maximum (Peak) Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Serum FDA022-BB05 Following First Dose, The serum PK parameters Maximum (peak) Observed serum concentration of FDA022-BB05 and its analytes were estimated using standard non-compartmental method., From cycle1 to Cycle10 (each cycle is 21 days. )|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Serum FDA022-BB05 Following First Dose, The serum PK parameters of Time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) for FDA022-BB05 and its analytes were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods., From cycle1 to Cycle10 (each cycle is 21 days. )|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of Serum FDA022-BB05 Following First Dose, The serum PK parameters of Terminal elimination half-life for FDA022-BB05 and its analytes was estimated using standard non-compartmental methods., From cycle1 to Cycle10 (each cycle is 21 days. )|Number of participants who developed measurable anti-drug antibodies, Individual participant data and descriptive statistics will be provided for data at each time point., up to 24 month
