Clinical Relevance of the Salvage Treatment for Colorectal Neuroendocrine Tumors
we evaluated all related clinical and pathologic data of rectal NET cases, including the resection margin status, NET grading, and lymphovascular invasion status. Finally, the present study was aimed at (1) determining the risk factors for LN and distant metastases in colorectal NETs (2) clarifying the clinical significance of the salvage treatment for colorectal neuroendocrine tumors following initial endoscopic resection with positive resection margin status and (3) compare different salvage treatment of this uncommon disease through conducting a large, multi-center cohort study.
