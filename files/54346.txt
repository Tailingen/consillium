Comparison of Letrozole With Lerociclib Versus Letrozole With Placebo Control in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic or Recurrent, Grade 1 or Grade 2 Endometrial Cancer
This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to compare the combination of lerociclib (administered at 150 mg twice a day (BID) with letrozole (administered at 2.5 mg once a day (QD) to that of placebo with letrozole (2.5 mg QD) in female participants with Grade 1 or Grade 2 (ie, low-grade histology) endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC) and advanced/metastatic or recurrent disease.

The study population will consist of female participants with endometrioid EC who are treatment-naïve in the advanced/metastatic setting (ie, the first-line \[1L\] population). Participants may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation for localized disease if the adjuvant therapy was administered ≥ 6 months prior. All participants must also be naïve to prior endocrine therapy for EC, and confirmed as medically postmenopausal to be eligible.

The study will comprise a Screening Period of up to 28 days in duration; a Study Treatment Phase; a Safety Follow-up Period spanning the time of study treatment discontinuation-including discontinuation due to confirmed disease progression, as applicable-through 28 days after the participant's last dose of any study intervention or the start of subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first); and a Survival Follow-up Period that will continue until the participant's death or until at least 50% of all study participants have died (whichever occurs first).

While receiving their randomized assigned study treatment, participants will undergo imaging assessments via computed tomography (CT) of the chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast- or, if CT is medically contraindicated (eg, due to iodine allergy), via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
