Yellow 560 Microscope for Intraoperative Visualization of Fluorescein Stained Intracranial Lesions
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using Fluorescein Sodium and the Yellow 560 microscope to aid in treatment of intracranial tumors and vascular lesions.
Adult Intracranial Neoplasm|Vascular: Intracranial
DRUG: Fluorescein Sodium
Concordance Between Surgical Impression of Residual Lesion and Appearance on Post-operative Imaging, We will perform fluorescein fluorescence/angiography at surgery and assess if fluorescence reveals any residual tumor or vascular lesion (aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or arteriovenous fistula) following surgical intervention. For subjects with brain tumors we will then perform a regular postoperative MRI and assess if there was any residual tumor and measure the accuracy of fluorescein fluorescence to assess the amount of the residual tumor seen on the postoperative MRI. Similarly, for the aneurysms or other vascular lesions, we will perform a regular postoperative angiogram and assess the accuracy of fluorescein angiography results in estimating the amount of residual lesion., up to 1 week. For subjects where clinical post-operative MRI/angiography was not performed within 7 days, MRI/angiography completed within 3 months post-operatively was utilized for evaluation.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using Fluorescein Sodium and the Yellow 560 microscope to aid in treatment of intracranial tumors and vascular lesions. The objectives of this study aim to investigate the use of Fluorescein in assisting with evaluating complete tumor removal and thorough treatment of intracranial vascular lesions as well as tumor biopsy procedures. The hypothesis is that Fluorescein Sodium will help surgeons better identify residual tumor and vascular lesions and its use will allow surgeons to obtain better surgical results and prognostic outcomes.
