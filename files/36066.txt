A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of TQ-B211 Plus Docetaxel in Patients With HER2-positive MBC.
To evaluate the efficacy,safety and immunogenicity of TQ-B211 plus docetaxel versus Herceptin® plus docetaxel in Patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was chosen as the comparator in the control group,as it represents a common first-line treatment option used in HER2+ MBC population in China.
HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: TQ-B211|DRUG: Herceptin®|DRUG: docetaxel
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) determined on the basis of investigator assessments., Baseline up to week 24（Baseline up to 8 cycles）
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of initial confirmed PR or CR to the date of disease progression or death within the study., up to week 120|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, on the basis of investigator assessments., up to week 120|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, stable disease (SD) and Non-CR/Non-progressive disease (PD)., up to week 120|Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., up to week 120
