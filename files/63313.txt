Study of TRC105 Combined With Standard-Dose Bevacizumab for Advanced Solid Tumors for Which Bevacizumab is Indicated
The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose for TRC105 when added to standard dose bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors for which bevacizumab is indicated.
Adult Solid Tumor
DRUG: TRC105 and Bevacizumab
Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose of TRC105 in Combination With Bevacizumab, Three patients will be initially enrolled and treated at each dose level. If none of these 3 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 28-day evaluation period, dose escalation will proceed following review of safety data with appropriate site staff including the principal investigators at all sites. If 1 of 3 patients experiences DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if â‰¥ 33% of patients experience DLT in a given cohort. DLT will have occurred when a patient has 1 or more toxicity listed in the table below that is at least possibly related to the combination of bevacizumab and TRC105 during the first 28 days (cycle 1)., 1.5 years
TRC105 Pharmacokinetic Concentrations, Plasma TRC105 concentrations will be measured at specified timepoints., 1.5 years|Immune Response to TRC105, HAMA and HACA titers will be measured at specified time-points., 1.5 years|Objective Response According to RECIST 1.1, The best response according to RECIST 1.1 for each patient with measurable disease and who received at least one dose of study drug will be listed by cohort and tumor type, 1.5 years
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor types. TRC105, a monoclonal antibody to CD105, is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor that complements bevacizumab in preclinical models. Together, these antibodies may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with bevacizumab alone. The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose for TRC105 when added to standard dose bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors for which bevacizumab is indicated.
