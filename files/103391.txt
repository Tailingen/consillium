A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Cemiplimab Â± ISA101b in HPV16-Positive OPC
This will be a blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 2 study in which subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to cemiplimab plus placebo or cemiplimab plus ISA101b.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx|HPV16 Positive
BIOLOGICAL: ISA101b|DRUG: Cemiplimab|OTHER: Placebo
Overall Response Rate, Measured using RECIST 1.1, 25months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0 "Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0"., 25 months
Duration of response (DOR) by independent review in subjects randomized to receive ISA101b plus cemiplimab compared to placebo plus cemiplimab., 25months
This study will assess the ability of ISA101b to improve Overall Response Rate in subjects with HPV16 positive OPC, when combined with cemiplimab, an investigational anti-PD-1 antibody being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. ISA101b is a therapeutic cancer vaccine that induces specific immune responses to the oncogenic E6 and E7 antigens from HPV16. Trials in HPV16 driven malignancies indicate it has activity in HPV16 driven malignancies including oropharyngeal and cervical cancers. Cemiplimab, also known as REGN2810, is in late stage trials and appears to have similar activity to approved anti PD-1 antibodies in a number of malignancies .
