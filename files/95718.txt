A Clinical Study of Raludotatug Deruxtecan in People With Ovarian Cancer (MK-5909-003)
Researchers are looking for other ways to treat relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Relapsed means the cancer came back after treatment. High-grade means the cancer cells grow and spread quickly. Serous means the cancer started in the cells that cover the ovaries, the lining of the belly, or in the fallopian tubes.

Standard treatment (usual treatment) for people with relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer may include:

* Chemotherapy, which is a treatment that uses medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing
* Targeted therapy, which is a treatment that works to control how specific types of cancer cells grow and spread

Raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd) is a study treatment that is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Researchers want to know if R-DXd is safe to take with standard treatment and if people tolerate them together.

Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) Per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), DLTs are defined as toxicities during the DLT evaluation period that are assessed by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment and include: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting ≥7 days; Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding; Grade 4 lymphocytopenia lasting ≥14 days; Grade 4 anemia of any duration; any other Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days; febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4 meeting pre-specifications; pre-specified hepatic organ toxicities; all Grade 3 or higher other nonhematologic toxicities except those pre-specified; other pre-specified nonhematologic toxicities; any delay in treatment with the planned dose of ≥21 days or discontinuation of treatment due to a toxicity during the DLT evaluation period, or Grade 5 toxicity. The number of participants with DLTs will be reported., Up to 21 days|Number of Participants with One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants with one or more AEs will be reported., Up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 3 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). ORR will be assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to approximately 3 years
