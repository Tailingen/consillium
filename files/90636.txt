Short-Course Radiotherapy Followed by Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Camrelizumab in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (UNION)
The study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical study, and the purpose of the study is to compare the pathological complete response rate (PCR) of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with short-term radiotherapy, sequential Camrelizumab and CAPOX (group A) to long-term concurrent chemoradiotherapy, sequential CAPOX (group B) in patients with LARC. A total of 230 patients were included in this study.
Rectal Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Short course radiotherapy sequential camrelizumab and chemotherapy
pathological complete response (pCR) rate, Pathological complete response rate (PCR) assessed by the blind Independent Review Committee, defined as the absence of viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0N0), an expected average of 5 months
3-year event-free survival rate, The percentage of patients without disease recurrence or progression or death due to any cause after 3-year follow-up, an expected average of 3 years|Overall Survival, The time from the date of randomization to the death caused by any cause, an expected average of 5 years|R0 resection rate, The rate of negative margin microscopically, an expected average of 2 years|3-year disease-Free Survival, The time from the first day of disease free (operation date) to local or distant recurrence, or the death event caused by any reason, whichever occurs first, an expected average of 3 years|dverse events (AEs) were graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5Â·0, Adverse events and surgical safety, an expected average of 1.5 years
Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T3-4/N+) were randomly assigned to experimental group A or control group B according to the ratio of 1:1,who will receive preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, and the Primary endpoint of the study is Pathological complete response rate(PCR ) assessed by the blind independent review committee (BIRC), defined as the absence of viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0N0)
