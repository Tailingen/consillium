Clinical Evaluation - A Phase IIA Proof of Concept Study of Regorafenib (Bayer 73-4506) in Biopsy-amenable Asian Colorectal Cancer Patients
1. Primary Endpoints

   * Biomarker data suggestive of regorafenib-mediated inhibition of the RAS-RAF- MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway,of various tyrosine kinase receptors and/or of angiogenesis.
   * Evaluation of potential relationships between biomarker data and clinical activity.
   * Evaluation of a novel biomarker technology (Prometheus COPIA platform)
2. Secondary Endpoints

   * Biomarker data suggestive of regorafenib-mediated effects on circulating rare cells.
   * Comparison of tumor genetic profiles obtained using DNA isolated from plasma, tumor biopsies and circulating tumor cells.
   * Patient safety data
   * Pharmacokinetics of regorafenib
   * Changes in tumor metabolic activity as measured by PET CT scan (optional)
