PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating women who have recurrent, stage III, or stage IV endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity and safety of doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.
* Determine the response rate, response duration, and overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
