A Study of JMT203 in Patients With Cancer Cachexia
This is an open-label, multicenter Phase I clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of JMT203 in patients with cancer cachexia.

This is a study of JMT203 in patients with cancer cachexia, comprising two parts: Phase Ia, which involves a dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of JMT203 in patients with cancer cachexia, and Phase Ib, which is a cohort-expansion study of JMT203 in the same patient population. The primary objectives of Phase Ia are to assess the safety/tolerability of JMT203 in patients with cancer cachexia and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if any) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of JMT203. In Phase Ib, the primary objectives include evaluating the preliminary efficacy of JMT203 in treating cancer cachexia and determining the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JMT203.
