Safety, Pharmacodynamics (PD), Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of SHP141 in 1A, 1B, or 2A Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of topical SHP141 applied directly to skin lesions in patients with Stage IA, IB, or IIA Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma. This study will also investigate the effect of SHP141 on skin lesions in patients with Stage IA, IB, or IIA CTCL.

Percentage of Patients With Complete or Partial Response as Measured by Change in Lesion Severity Using CAILS (Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity), Response assessed by change in lesion severity using Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) Assessment Tool which measures clinical signs of CTCL by erythema; scaling; plaque elevation; hypo- or hyperpigmentation, each on a scale of 0-8; and lesion size (cm2), on a scale of 0 (no lesion; 0 cm2) to 18 (300 cm2). Up to five index lesions are each scored, and a subtotal CAILS score is provided for each index lesion. A total score is calculated by summing these subtotals. Response criteria measure the change in CAILS score from baseline to follow-up as follows: Complete Response (CR): 100% decrease in CAILS score; Partial Response (PR): 50% - 99% decrease in CAILS score; Stable Disease (SD): \< 25% increase to \< 50% decrease in CAILS score; Progressive Disease (PD) â‰¥ 25% increase in CAILS score., Weekly through day 28 (days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28) and again day 42
