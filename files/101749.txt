A Study of IBI129 in Subjects with Unresectable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1/2 multicenter, first-in-human study of IBI129. It includes a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion section to identify MTD/RP2D of IBI129, plan to enroll 22\~180 subjects, and a phase 2 to explore efficacy, safety and tolerability of IBI129 at RP2D in specified types of solid tumor. Approximately 182 evaluable subjects will be enrolled for phase 2
