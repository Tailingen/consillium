Study of RV001V in Biochemical Failure Following Curatively Intended Therapy For Localized Prostate Cancer
This Phase II trial will enroll approximately 180 adult male patients with an earlier histologic diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma and a biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 3 years of radical prostatectomy (RP) or definitive RT and no distant metastasis or locoregional recurrence. The trial is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study of a peptide cancer vaccine (RV001V).

Time to PSA progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to doubling of PSA from the baseline value. The time to doubling will be estimated from a log-linear regression of PSA values., Up to 3 years
