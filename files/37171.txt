U87 CAR-T in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of U87 injection solution in patients with advanced malignant head and neck tumors.
Nasopharynx Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: U87 autologous CAR T-cell
Incidence of Adverse events after U87 CAR-T cells infusion [Safety and Tolerability], An assessment of severity grade will be made according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 28 days post administration of CAR-T-cells
Pharmacokinetics of U87 CAR-T cells, Time at the maximal concentration(Tmax), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics of U87 CAR-T cells, Area under the concentration-time curve(AUC), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics of U87 CAR-T cells, The maximal concentration of eripheral blood (Cmax), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacodynamics of U87 CAR-T cells, Concentration levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines such as IL-6, IFN Î³, ferritin and CRP at each time point, 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Objective Response Rate (ORR), as assessed by Investigators, The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Duration of response (DOR), as assessed by Investigators, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death., 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of first infusion of U87 to the date of death due to any cause., 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by Investigators, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause., 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Disease control rate (DCR), as assessed by Investigators, Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years post CAR T cell infusion
Following consent, patients must have tumor tissue evaluated by IHC assay. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (U87). Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive preconditioning prior to U87 infusion. All subjects will be asked to continue to undergo long-term gene safety follow-up.
