Continuous Pectoral Nerve Block in Breast Cancer Surgery
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of continuous pectoral nerve block on postoperative analgesia consumption in breast cancer surgery.
Nerve Blocks|Breast Surgery|Postoperative Pain
PROCEDURE: PECS group|OTHER: Control group
analgesia consumption, postoperative 12 hours, 12 hours
analgesia consumption, intraoperative, during the surgery|postoperative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score, postoperative pain assessment will be performed using NRS score (NRS 0=no pain, NRS 10= most severe possible). The NRS scores will be recorded at postoperative 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 hours, 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 hours
Pectoral nerve block has been developed as an alternative to thoracic paravertebral and/or thoracic epidural blocks in recent years. It is frequently applied for postoperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery.
