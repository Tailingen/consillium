An Efficacy and Safety Study of JNJ-56021927 (Apalutamide) in High-risk Prostate Cancer Subjects Receiving Primary Radiation Therapy: ATLAS
The purpose of this study is to determine if apalutamide plus gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist in participants with high-risk, localized or locally advanced prostate cancer receiving primary radiation therapy (RT) results in an improvement of metastasis-free survival based on conventional or prostate specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging evaluated by blinded independent central review (BICR).
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Bicalutamide|DRUG: Bicalutamide Placebo|DRUG: Apalutamide Placebo|DRUG: GnRH (agonist)|RADIATION: 74-80 Grays (units of radiation)
Metastasis-free Survival, Metastasis-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of radiographic bone or soft tissue distant metastasis based on conventional imaging or prostate specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging by blinded independent central review (BICR), histopathologic diagnosis of distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 108 Months
Event-free Survival on Conventional Imaging or PSMA-PET Imaging, Event-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of prostate specific antigen (PSA) failure by the Phoenix definition, local or regional disease recurrence on conventional imaging or PSMA-PET imaging by BICR or histopathologic diagnosis, distant metastasis on conventional imaging or PSMA-PET imaging by BICR or histopathologic diagnosis, or death., 108 Months|Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as time from randomization to the date of PSA nadir plus (+) 0.5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) and rising., 108 Months|Metastasis-free Survival (MFS) on Conventional Imaging by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), MFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of radiographic bone or soft tissue distant metastasis based on conventional imaging by BICR, histopathologic diagnosis of distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 108 Months|No Evidence of Disease (NED), NED is defined as: alive; no prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression; no distant metastasis on conventional imaging or PSMA-PET imaging by BICR; no local or regional recurrence on conventional imaging or PSMA-PET imaging by BICR; no subsequent therapy for prostate cancer; testosterone recovery to age-related pre-androgen deprivation therapy (pre-ADT)/baseline or greater than (\>) 200 nanogram per deciliter (ng/dL)., 108 Months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause., 108 Months|Time to Distant Metastasis, Time to distant metastasis is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of radiographic or pathological bone or soft tissue distant metastasis on conventional imaging or PSMA-PET imaging by BICR or histopathologic diagnosis of distant metastasis., 108 Months|Event-free Survival on Conventional Imaging, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of prostate specific antigen (PSA) failure by the Phoenix definition, local or regional disease recurrence on conventional imaging by BICR or histopathologic diagnosis, distant metastasis on conventional imaging by BICR or histopathologic diagnosis, or death., 108 Months|Time to Next Local or Systemic Treatment, Time to next local or systemic treatment defined as time from randomization to first subsequent therapy, including re-initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and local treatments for local-regional recurrence or distant metastasis., 108 Months
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of apalutamide plus GnRH agonist compared with GnRH agonist among participants with high-risk, localized or locally advanced prostate cancer receiving primary radiation therapy (RT). The study will include a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, a Posttreatment Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up Phase. Participants will either receive either apalutamide (experimental) or bicalutamide 50 milligram (mg) capsule plus placebo as control group. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
