A Phase 1/ 2, First-in-Human, Open-Label, Accelerated-Titration, Two-Part Clinical Trial of TK-8001 in Patients With HLA-A*02:01 Genotype and Advanced-Stage/ Metastatic MAGE-A1+ Solid Tumors
The aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and anti-tumoral activity of autologous T cells transduced with a T cell receptor specific for MAGE-A1 in eligible patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous CD8+ T-cells, transduced with MAGE-A1 directed TCR
Safety and tolerability, Incidence and grade of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); Number and type of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Up to 15 years after TK-8001 treatment (1 year short-term follow-up, 14 years long-term follow up)|Preliminary anti tumor activity, Evaluation of overall response rate (ORR), stable disease rate (SD), partial response rate (PR), and complete response (CR) rate of TK-8001 monotherapy, according to RECIST Version 1.1 and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, V1.1) in cancer immunotherapy trials (iRECIST), Up to 15 years after TK-8001 treatment, or until disease progression
End of dose escalation, RP2D will be determined through integrated evaluation of adverse events, serious adverse events, antitumoral activity, and evaluation of the biological and physiological effects of TK-8001 in the body., 28 days after TK-8001 treatment of last patient in Phase 1
This is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, accelerated titration, two-part clinical trial of TK-8001 (MAGE-A1-directed TCR-transduced autologous CD8+ T-cells) in subjects with HLA-A\*02:01 genotype and advanced stage/metastatic, MAGE-A1+ solid tumors (including but not limited to melanoma \[skin or uveal\], NSCLC, urothelial, breast, gastric \[including gastroesophageal junction\], esophageal, sarcoma, HNSCC, HCC, biliary tract, cervical, and salivary gland cancer) that either have no further approved therapeutic alternative or are not eligible for them or that are in a non-curable state as per the Investigator's assessment and have received a minimum of two lines of systemic therapy.

This two-part clinical trial will consist of a Phase 1 Part, which includes dose-escalation and expansion, and a Phase 2 Part.

In the Phase 1 Part dose-escalation, at least 6 subjects and up to 18 subjects (if DLT occurs) will receive escalating doses of TK-8001, with up to three dose levels explored. During the Phase 1 Part expansion, up to 20 additional subjects may be treated on DL3 if cleared during dose escalation to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of TK-8001 (Cohort 1).

An additional cohort of up to 10 subjects with brain metastases (Cohort 2) may also be treated on DL3 if cleared during dose-escalation. The maximum total number of subjects to be treated on DL3 during Phase 1 will be 33 subjects.

In the Phase 2 Part, up to 30 patients will receive TK-8001 to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of TK-8001 and to confirm the RP2D.

Both the Phase 1 Part and Phase 2 Part of the trial will consist of the following periods: Screening and Leukapheresis Period, Conditioning Period, TK-8001 Treatment Period, DLT Monitoring Period, Short-term Follow-up Period (Year 1), and Long-term Follow-up Period (Year 2 - 15).
