A Dose Finding Study of TKM-080301 Infusion in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) and Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) Patients
This study will be a Phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding trial conducted at multiple clinical centers. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and PK of TKM-080301 in adult patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that are refractory to standard therapy or for whom there is no standard therapy. After the determination of the maximum tolerated dose this dose will be utilized in an expansion cohort or subjects with refractory neuroendocrine tumors (NET) or adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) tumors.
