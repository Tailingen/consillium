An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study of Nivolumab, Compared to Placebo, in Patients With Bladder or Upper Urinary Tract Cancer, Following Surgery to Remove the Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of Nivolumab compared to placebo in participants who have undergone radical surgery for invasive urothelial cancer.
