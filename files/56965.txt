Dexamethasone Reduces Postoperative Emesis by Decreasing PGF2α and LTC4 Levels
Hypothesis: Dexamethasone reduces postoperative emesis in thyroidectomy and mastectomy patients.
Thyroid Cancer|Breast Cancer
Number of participants will be evaluated to show effect of dexamethasone in reducing postoperative emesis, participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, till they are discharged in avarage 3 days for postoperative emesis., up to 3 days
This study has been done to further study the effectiveness of dexamethasone in the prevention of postoperative emesis after breast and thyroid surgery and at the same time, the mechanism of action was investigated. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial it was hypothesized that corticosteroids exert their antiemetic effects in postoperative period via plasma prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 α) and plasma leukotriene C4 (LTC4) inhibition.
