DRUG: Recombinant oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (R130)
Subject incidence of adverse events, To characterize the safety profile of R130 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors as measured by the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0),such as fever, fatigue, flu like symptoms, chills, Injection site reaction,etc., Up to 6 months|Subject incidence of laboratory abnormalities, Up to 1 month|Systemic Immune Response, Detection of increased systemic immune Response markers in sera (IL2,IL4,IL6,IL8,IL10,TNFa，IFNγ, etc.) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by multi-Color fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), Up to 6 months
Disease Assessment for Disease Control Rate, CT will be performed to evaluate the efficacy endpoints of DCR by the investigator with RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST. DCR (proportion of patients) = with CR +PR +SD /CR + PR +SD + PD., Every 10 weeks for 12 months|Disease Assessment for Duration of Response, The time length between the first confirmed objective response per RECIST 1.1 to the treatment and the subsequent disease progression per RECIST 1.1, Every 10 weeks for 12 months|Quality of Life Assessment, Comparison of patients' quality of life before and after R130 treatment as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-30 (V3.0)., Every 6 weeks for 12 months
