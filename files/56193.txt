Neoadjuvant Degarelix With or Without Apalutamide (ARN-509) Followed by Radical Prostatectomy
RATIONALE: Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy using luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and/or anti-androgens has already demonstrated to downstage primary prostate cancer in patients treated by radical prostatectomy without a survival benefit. There is no evidence yet of a survival impact of LHRH antagonist (LHRHa) +/- new-generation anti-androgens in this setting. Thus novel studies are needed to assess this treatment combination.

PURPOSE: To assess the difference in treatment antitumor effect between arms by measuring pathological tumor volume with minimal residual disease (MRD) following radical prostatectomy + pelvic lymph-node dissection (RP + PLND) for intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer patients.
