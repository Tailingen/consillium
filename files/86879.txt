A Randomized Phase 3 Trial of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin Versus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a randomized Phase 3 study comparing pemetrexed and cisplatin combination to gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCSLC). Gemcitabine plus cisplatin is currently the standard of care for NSCLC. It is thought that pemetrexed plus cisplatin may be as effective and may have fewer side effects than the standard of care.
