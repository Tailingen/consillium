The intervention is designed to maintain quality of life for those in greatest need and least access to resources. This innovative and scalable web-based collaborative care intervention is expected not only to improve patients' quality of life, at the end of life, but also reduce caregiver stress and depression, and potentially health morbidity and mortality of patients and spousal and intimate partner caregivers from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Study findings are expected to lead to research examining the dissemination and implementation of the intervention.
