FATE-NK100 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Monoclonal Antibody in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label, dose-escalation study. The study will be conducted in three parts (i.e. regimens) in an outpatient setting as follows:

* Regimen A: FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies.
* Regimen B: FATE-NK100 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer, HER2+ advanced gastric cancer or other advanced HER2+ solid tumors.
* Regimen C: FATE-NK100 in combination with cetuximab in subjects with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) or head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), or other epidermal growth factor receptor 1 positive (EGFR1+) advanced solid tumors.
