Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome After Preoperative Stellate Ganglion Block for Breast Cancer Surgeries
This study investigate the effect of pre-operative ultrasound guided stellate ganglion block with local anesthetic on the frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes in the first 6-month post cancer breast surgeries with axillary dissection.
Breast Cancer|Breast Pain
PROCEDURE: Stellate Ganglion Block|DRUG: Multimodal Analgesia
Incidence of Neuropathic pain Syndromes, relative frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes post breast surgeries with axillary dissection after preoperative ultrasound stellate ganglion block. This is accomplished using the grading system for neuropathic pain (GSNP),0: No Pain,1: Pain, 2: Possible neuropathic: Pain with (A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease AND Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible, 3: Pain Probable neuropathic: Positive sensory signs (allodynia, hyperalgesia, electric, burning, numbness, itching, maybe motor or autonomic changes) on the distribution of the injured nerves or beyond, 4: Pain Definitive neuropathic: diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system OR a surgeon's clear verification of an intraoperative nerve lesion (intercostobrachial in MRM with Axillary Evacuation in Breast Surgery), 6 months after surgery|patient daily activity and functional capacity, Assessment of patient daily activity and functional capacity is evaluated using Eastern cooperative oncology group "ECOG" scoring, (0=fully active, 1= able to perform light effort, 2= in bed \<50% of the day 3=in bed \>50% of the day, 4=bed ridden, 5=died) so the low score the better., 6 months after surgery
opioid consumption, opioid consumption using the Visual analogy scale (VAS) score,Post-operative opioid consumption measured by number of rescue dose of morphine 5mg IV administered when VAS was more than 4 and total requirement per 24 hours was recorded., Post-operative 24 hours
In this study Eighty Female patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, underwent breast surgery with axillary dissection at National Cancer Institute, Cairo University were included in this study. Patients will be randomized into two equal comparable groups of patients.

(Group A the study group) was received pre-operative ultrasound guided stellate ganglion block one hour before surgery and multimodal analgesia and (Group B the control group) was received multimodal analgesia only.

The present study showed in regards to the acute pain management of the stellate ganglion block: intraoperative hemodynamics, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (MABP, HR) were statistically significant less in group A (Stellate Group) than group B (Control Group) and this leads to significant less opioid consumption in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group). In the 1st 24h postoperative opioid consumption measured by number of rescue dose of morphine 5mg IV were administered when visual analogue score was more than 4 and total requirement per 24 hours was recorded. The results show statistically significant less opioid consumption in Group A (Stellate Group) with average visual analogue score 3.5 in 1st 24h than Group B (Control group) with average visual analogue score 5.5 in 1st 24h.

The present study showed in regards to the chronic pain management of the stellate ganglion block that, the 6-month relative frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes, using the grading system for neuropathic pain (GSNP) shows statistically significance lower frequency of neuropathic pain syndromes in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).

Assessment of patient daily activity and functional capacity using Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) scoring showed statistically significance higher performance status (lower numbers in the score) in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).

Number of patients discharged on tramadol \& or Lyrica whom developed Post Mastectomy Pain syndrome (PMPs) is statically significant lower in Group A (Stellate Group) than Group B (Control group).
