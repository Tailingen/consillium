Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of U01(ssCART-19) in B-Cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label phase1 study to assess the safety and efficacy of U01(ssCART-19) cell therapy in the treatment of patients with refractory or recurrent B-cell lymphoma .
B Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: ssCART-19
The types, frequency, and severity of treatment related adverse events, After CAR-T cell infusion, we will observe the potential adverse events, especially Cytokine Release Syndrome(CRS) and neurotoxicity Using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) V5.0, Day1 to Week 4|Objective response rate(ORR), At 1,3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months post-treatment follow up|Duration of response (DOR), At 1,3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months post-treatment follow up|Progression free survival(PFS), At 1,3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months post-treatment follow up|Overall survival(OS), At 1,3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months post-treatment follow up
Kinetics of CAR-T cells, Use flow cytometry or qPCR to monitor the kinetics of CAR-T cells, Day1 to Month 3|Monitoring changes in IL-6, ferritin, and CRP in peripheral blood following CAR-T cell infusion, Day1 to Month 3
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are critical complications in CAR T-cell therapy. Research highlights IL-6 as a central driver of CRS, as activated CAR T-cells secrete this cytokine, which in turn stimulates monocytes to produce additional IL-6. To mitigate this risk, ssCART-19-a modified anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy-incorporates small hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology to silence the IL-6 gene, thereby reducing IL-6 secretion by both CAR T-cells and monocytes. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of the U01 (ssCART-19) therapy in patients with refractory or recurrent B-cell lymphoma .
