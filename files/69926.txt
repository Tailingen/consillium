Breast Cancer Survivors: Main Physical and Psychosocial Problems After Completion of Treatment
Breast cancer directly affects women physically, psychologically and socially in the process of diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment. Despite the improvement in conventional breast cancer treatments that led to longer disease-free survival, many patients still suffer from physical, psychological, social and spiritual problems after treatment. The neglect of physical and psychosocial problems faced by patients who are between 1 and 2 years after the end of treatment negatively impacts the quality of life of this population.
