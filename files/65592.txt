Adjuvant Erlotinib Intercalating Chemotherapy or Adjuvant Chemotherapy Alone in NSCLC With Common EGFR Mutation
This study will be performed as a local multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical study. It will compare the adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC with common EGFR mutation (Exon 19 deletion or L858R) who underwent total resection and the Erlotinib-Intercalation adjuvant chemotherapy with the chemotherapy alone. The patients will be randomly assigned to the Intercalation combination chemotherapy regimen and the chemotherapy alone regimen at the ratio of 1:1. The treatment regimen of each arm is as follows.
NSCLC
DRUG: intercalation therapy using pemetrexed, cisplatin and erlotinib|DRUG: Vinorelbine, cisplatin
Disease-free survival (DFS), Time from randomization to disease recurrence or death of any cause, 3 years
Overall survival (OS), 3 years|Treatment-related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 3 years
