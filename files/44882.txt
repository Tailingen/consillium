Efficacy and Safety Study of ABP 980 Compared With Trastuzumab in Women With HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of ABP 980 against trastuzumab in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: ABP 980|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: Lumpectomy or Mastectomy with Sentinel Node or Axillary Node Dissection
Percentage of Participants With a Pathologic Complete Response, Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as the absence of invasive tumor cells in the breast tissue and in axillary lymph nodes, regardless of residual ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Participants underwent a lumpectomy or mastectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) within 3 to 7 weeks after the last dose of study drug in the neoadjuvant phase. The pathology evaluation of surgical specimens for pCR analysis was conducted by local laboratories at the study sites., 3 to 7 weeks after the last dose of study drug in the neoadjuvant phase
