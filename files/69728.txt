Rituxan and BEAM With Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Transplant for Indolent Lymphoma
To determine the response rate, complete and partial, of patients with indolent lymphoma receiving Rituxan and BEAM with autologous stem cell transplant.
Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituxan|DRUG: BEAM|PROCEDURE: Autologous stem cell transplant
Response rate, Disease response at day 100, 100 day
Overall survival, Survival time from diagnosis until death, diagnosis until death
Objectives: I. To determine the response rate, complete and partial, of patients with indolent lymphoma receiving Rituxan and BEAM with autologous stem cell transplant. II. To determine if the addition of Rituxan changes the toxicity profile attributed to high-dose BEAM chemotherapy.

This protocol is a phase I/II trial combining the Rituxan as a pre and post-transplant agent to aid in the chemotherapy sensitization and the treatment of minimal residual disease post-transplant.
