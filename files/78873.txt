Humanized CD7 CAR T-cell Therapy for r/r CD7+ Acute Leukemia
This is a prospective,open-label, single center and single arm phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T cells expressing humanized CD7 chimeric antigen receptors treatment for patients with refractory/relapsed CD7 positive acute leukemia.
T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma|Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Humanized CD7 CAR-T cells
Number of Adverse Events, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0, 12 months
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR includes CR, CRi, MLFS and PR. Complete remission (CR)#Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0x 10\^9/L; platelet count \>100x10\^9/L. CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)#All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0x10\^9/L) or thrombocytopenia (\<100x10\^9/L). Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required. Partial remission (PR): All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 2 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse(CIR), time from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse., 2 years|the duration of CAR T-cells in vivo, the time of CAR-T cells' persistence in blood and the copies of CAR-T cells, 2 years
The patients will receive infusion of CAR T-cells targeting CD7 to confirm the safety and efficacy of CD7 CAR T-Cells in CD7+ relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.
