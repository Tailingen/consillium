Bronchoscopic Cryoablation Combined With Chemo-Immunotherapy in NSCLC With Central Airway Obstruction
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bronchoscopic cryoablation combined with sintilimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with central airway obstruction.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Sintilimab, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin
Objective Response Rate of Airway Tumor, The ORR for Objective response of airway tumors after cryoablation combined with immunochemotherapy was evaluated according to the investigator's Solid Tumor Response Assessment Criteria (RECIST) version 1.1, defined as the proportion of subjects who were evaluated for complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) to airway tumors after the first documented treatment, Time from first dose to last dose, or up to 24 month
Pathological Response Rate of Airway Obstruction, The pathologic response rate of airway tumors obstruction in patients treated with cryoablation combined with immunochemotherapy was evaluated according to the investigator which was defined as the proportion of subjects with endoscopically assessed airway pathologic residual tumors â‰¤10% after treatment recorded for the first or last time after cryoablation, Time from first dose to last dose, or up to 24 month|Airway Obstruction Response Control Rate, The DCR for airway tumors obstruction in patients treated with cryoablation combined with immunochemotherapy was assessed according to the investigator's RECIST 1.1, defined as the proportion of subjects evaluated for complete (CR) + partial response (PR) and stable SD for intraairway tumors after the first recorded treatment, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|FEV1R improvement rate of airway obstruction, Calculated according to the subjects' pulmonary function measures assessed by the investigator: FEV1 (post-treatment) -FEV1 (pre-treatment)/FEV1 (pre-treatment) \*100%, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Airway Obstruction Response Duration, The duration of response in subjects with CR or PR was assessed according to the Solid Tumor Response Assessment Criteria (RECIST) version 1.1 developed by the investigators, defined as the time from the first recorded evaluated airway tumor CR or PR to airway disease progression or death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival of patients treated with cryoablation plus immunochemotherapy was assessed according to the Investigator Response Evaluation criteria (RECIST) version 1.1, defined as the duration of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Overall survival, To assess overall survival, it was defined as the first dose at which the subject died from any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Adverse events, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Life quality score, Score according to EORTC QLQ-L30+QLQ-LC13 table, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
This is a prospective interventional clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bronchoscopic cryoablation combined with sintilimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer with central airway obstruction.

Approximately 39 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and central airway obstruction, without EGFR-sensitive mutations (19del, L858R, and T790M), were enrolled and treated with bronchoscopic cryoablation combined with Sintilimab, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or meeting the criteria for discontinuation of the trial drug.

The primary endpoint is the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) of airway tumors. Secondary endpoints include the pathological response rate (PRR) of airway tumors, disease control rate (DCR), improvement rate of FEV1, duration of response (DOR) for airway tumors, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life assessment, and safety. Recruitment for the study is expected to begin in mainland China around October 2024, with the trial anticipated to conclude in October 2027.
