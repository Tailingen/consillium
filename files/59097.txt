A Prospective Cohort Study to Evaluate Molecular pRognostic Factors and Resistance Mechanisms to Osimertinib in Adjuvant Treatment of Completely Resected pIB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma With Common EGFR Mutations (L858R and Del19)
IFCT-2202 ROSIE study aims to incorporate a broad-panel centralized NGS testing at baseline in all patients with completely resected NSCLC with common EGFR mutation after confirmation of an optimal preoperative extension assessment and with a centralized review of the quality of the surgical excision. Furthermore, the IFCT-2202 ROSIE study also aims to study the molecular events associated with relapse on, or after osimertinib exposure, that should result in the opportunity to accede to optimal treatment in case of metastatic relapse.
