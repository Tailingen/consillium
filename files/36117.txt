Impact of Aminoglycosides in Hypotensive Septic Oncology Patients
This study evaluates the impact of aminoglycosides in hypotensive septic oncologic patients. In the oncologic patient population, sepsis is a major health concern due to high mortality rates and healthcare costs. Prior research shows aminoglycosides antibiotics are frequently used to treat sepsis, but their clinical impact in hypotensive oncology patients upon the progression of sepsis is not known.
