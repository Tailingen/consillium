Genetically-informed Therapy for ER+ Breast Cancer Post-CDK4/6 Inhibitor
The purpose of this study is to learn if certain drug combinations are effective treatments for patients with advanced ER+/HER2- who have previously been treated with palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Neratinib|DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Abemaciclib
Rate of clinical benefit within each arm in patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor., Clinical benefit rate will be measured as the proportion of participants who experience stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks, complete response, and partial response per RECIST 1.1., 6 - 12 months
Incidence rate of adverse events within each treatment arm., Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE within each treatment arm., 12 months|Progression-free survival within each treatment arm., Progression-free survival will be measured by the time between the initiation of study treatment to the time of progression per RECIST 1.1., 12 months|Rate of objective response within each treatment arm., The proportion of participants within each arm who experience objective response defined as complete or partial response per RECIST 1.1 while on study treatment will be measured., 12 months
