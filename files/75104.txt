A Study to Compare CNTO 328 (Anti-IL-6 Monoclonal Antibody) and VELCADE-Melphalan-Prednisone (VMP) With VMP Alone in Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of CNTO 328 (siltuximab) when it is administered together with velcade-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) in comparison with VMP alone in participants with multiple myeloma (a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow).

Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Complete Response (CR) - European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Criteria, CR was assessed using EMBT criteria: disappearance of the original monoclonal paraprotein from the blood and urine on at least 2 determinations for a minimum of 6 weeks by immunofixation studies, \<5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least 1 determination, if skeletal survey is available: no increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response), disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas for at least 6 weeks., Up to disease progression, approximately 3 years
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Overall Response ie, Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) - European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Criteria, CR or PR was assessed using EBMT criteria. CR: disappearance of the original monoclonal paraprotein from the blood and urine on at least 2 determinations for a minimum of 6 weeks by immunofixation studies, \<5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least 1 determination, if skeletal survey is available: no increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response), disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas for at least 6 weeks; PR: \>=50% reduction in the level of serum monoclonal paraprotein for at least 2 determinations 6 weeks apart, if present, reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion by either \>=90% or to \<200 mg for at least 2 determinations 6 weeks apart, \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas (by clinical or radiographic examination) for at least 6 weeks, if skeletal survey is available: no increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions, Up to disease progression, approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Stringent Complete Response (sCR) - International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria, sCR was assesses by IMWG Criteria: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, \<=5% plasma cells in bone marrow, normal free light chain ratio, absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. sCR is a CR that has been confirmed by immunofixation + free light chain assay + either bone marrow immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence, Up to disease progression, approximately 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time between randomization and either disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., From the date of randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, as assessed up to the last efficacy assessment for disease progression (approximately 3 years)|1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate, The 1-year PFS rate was defined as the percentage of participants surviving 1 year after randomization without disease progression or death., 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as length from the earliest date a participant achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to either date for disease progression (including relapse from CR) or the censoring date for progressive disease. Responders without disease progression were censored at the last efficacy assessment for disease progression., From the date participants achieved CR or PR to either date for disease progression (including relapse from CR) or the censoring date for progressive disease, as assessed Up to 30 days after last dose of study medication|1-year Survival Rate, Percentage of participants who are alive at the end of year 1 after randomization, 1 year|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time interval in days between the date of randomization and the participant's death from any cause., From the date of randomization till the date of death, as assessed up to the end of study (approximately 3 years)|Change From Baseline to Cycle 9 in Global Health Status/Quality of Life Subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30), Global health status/quality of life is a subscale of the EORTC QOL C30, which comprises two questions related to overall health/quality of life during the past week. The raw score to each question ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The raw mean score of health status/quality of life subscale is calculated for each participant and a linear transformation applied to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher ("better") health and quality of life., Baseline (Day 1 predose) and Cycle 9 (Week 54)
The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2) and will consist of screening period up to 2 weeks; treatment period; maintenance period (CNTO 328 hereafter referred to as siltuximab) for a maximum of 18 months and follow up period until the study ends. Part 1 is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single group safety lead-in part to evaluate the safety of siltuximab. Approximately 12 patients will be treated with siltuximab in combination with VMP. If the safety profile of the combination is acceptable, the study will proceed to Part 2. Part 2 is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label, 2-arm (Arm A: siltuximab + VMP; Arm B: VMP alone) study. Approximately 104 patients will be equally randomized, followed by a maintenance period with siltuximab in particiants in Arm A who achieve a partial response (PR) or better. Particiants in both parts of the study will be treated up to a maximum of nine 6-week cycles provided there is no evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from treatment. Study medication will be continued for at least 2 additional cycles after confirmation of complete response, and preferably for the full 9 cycles of the treatment period. Participants who will be receiving maintenance treatment after the 12-month effectiveness analysis may continue to receive treatment with siltuximab only after careful consideration by the treating physician and on evidence of clinical benefit and in the absence of unwarranted toxicities. Safety assessments will include evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study.
