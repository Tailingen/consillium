Psychiatric Problems in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Their Caregivers
Cancer in childhood represents a significant health challenge, with approximately 400,000 children and adolescents aged 0-19 years diagnosed annually. The oncological landscape of pediatric populations is characterized by diverse malignancies, with leukemias, brain cancers, lymphomas, and solid tumors such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumors constituting the predominant diagnostic categories. Among these, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) emerges as the most prevalent childhood malignancy.

Historically, a cancer diagnosis portended an almost invariably fatal outcome. However, contemporary medical interventions have dramatically transformed this narrative. Since 1980, mortality rates across pediatric cancer types have declined by more than 50%, representing a remarkable advancement in clinical oncology. Notably, ALL demonstrates an exceptionally optimistic prognosis, with over 90% of patients achieving complete remission.

Despite these encouraging survival statistics, the cancer experience extends beyond physiological parameters. Children diagnosed with leukemia and their familial support systems frequently encounter complex psychological challenges. These manifestations encompass a spectrum of emotional responses, including anxiety, shock, denial, depression, and adaptive difficulties. Critically, these psychological sequelae are not confined to the diagnostic and treatment phases but often persist even after disease remission

The multidimensional nature of the cancer experience prompted the emergence of a specialized subdiscipline in 1992. Termed "psycho-oncology" in the United States and "psychosocial oncology" predominantly in European contexts, this field addresses two fundamental psychological dimensions:

Emotional and psychosocial responses of patients, families, and caregivers throughout the disease trajectory Psychological, behavioral, and social factors potentially influencing cancer morbidity and mortality.

Consequently, contemporary pediatric oncological care adopts a holistic paradigm. The therapeutic objective transcends mere physical restoration, aspiring to ensure the comprehensive social and emotional well-being of both the child and the familial ecosystem.
