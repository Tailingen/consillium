The HistoSonics System for Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Liver Tumors Using Histotripsy (#HOPE4LIVER EU/UK)
This trial is a single arm, non-randomized prospective trial. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the HistoSonics System for the treatment of primary or metastatic tumors located in the liver.
Liver Neoplasms|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Metastases
DEVICE: HistoSonics System
Primary Efficacy: Technical Success, Technical success, defined as the treatment volume/treatment dimensions being greater than or equal to the targeted tumor, and with complete tumor coverage, via computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. \[Core Laboratory Adjudicated\], ≤36 hours post-index procedure|Primary Safety: Procedure-Related Major Complications, Number of index procedure related major complications, including device-related events defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher toxicities observed up to 30-days post index-procedure. \[Clinical Events Committee Adjudicated\], 30 days post-index procedure
Secondary Efficacy: Technique Efficacy, Technique efficacy, defined as the lack of a nodular or mass-like area of enhancement within or along the edge of the treatment volume assessed via CT or MR imaging at 30-days post-procedure. \[Core Laboratory Adjudicated\], 30 days post-index procedure|Secondary Safety: All Adverse Events, Number of adverse events (serious and non-serious) reported within 30 days post-index procedure. \[Clinical Events Committee Adjudicated\], 30 days post-index procedure
This trial is a single arm, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective trial. Following histotripsy treatment of liver tumor(s), subjects will undergo imaging ≤36 hours post-index procedure to determine technical success. Subjects will then be followed for 30 days. Additionally, subjects will be evaluated at 6 months and followed annually for up to five (5) years post-index procedure.
