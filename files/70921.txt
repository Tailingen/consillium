Fructooligosaccharides in Treating Patients With Blood Cancer Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant
This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of fructooligosaccharides in treating patients with blood cancer who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells (called graft-versus-host disease). Nutritional supplements such as fructooligosaccharides may reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in patients with blood cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

Maximum tolerated dose defined as the ability to take 70% of all doses over 21 days, Will employ the Bayesian optimal interval design., At day 21
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Conduct a dose escalation trial to determine the tolerability of the fructo-oligosaccharides prebiotic in allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

Patients receive fructooligosaccharides (FOS) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 21 days starting at 7 days before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 100 days.
