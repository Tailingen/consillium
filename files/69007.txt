PSMA-based 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT: Evaluating Its Application in Real Life
The purpose of the study is to provide pilot data on the clinical situations in which ordering a 18F-DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was thought to be clinically useful, and to document how the results of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT affected patient management. The results of this study could then serve as a guide to help OHIP to consider these scenarios when deciding the precise indications for funded 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans in the future. In this study the investigators will image subjects with prostate cancer using 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and record how the result of the study affected patient management.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT
To acquire pilot data on the use of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT following conventional imaging (CT and bone scan) for the detection of metastases in men with prostate cancer, To acquire pilot data on the use of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT following conventional imaging (CT and bone scan) for the detection of metastases in men with prostate cancer when: 1. The CT scan shows indeterminate lymph node(s) in the pelvis that could potentially be treated radically with radiotherapy if found to be positive on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT; 2. The subject is suspected to have oligometastatic disease (\< 4 sites of disease) that could potentially be treated with stereotactic/ radical doses of radiotherapy., 1 year
