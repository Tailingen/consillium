A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability of DN1508052-01 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase I, open-label, multicenter study in adult patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. DN1508052-01 will be administered subcutaneously on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 in 28-day cycles. Other dose regimens may be explored based on the analysis of emerging PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety data. This study is designed to determine the MTD, RP2D and investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, biomarkers, HPV status and ISR in DN1508052-01-treated patients.

DRUG: DN1508052-01
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is the highest dose of DN1508052-01 in subjects with DLT less than 33.3% during the DLT observation in the dose escalation, 28 days
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Assessment of the cidence and severity of treatment-related AEs in who received at least 1 dose of in DN1508052-01, Up to 24 months|Time to peak (Tmax) of plasma concentration, Pharmacokinetics profile of DN1508052-01 :Time to peak (Tmax) of plasma concentration, Up to 2 months|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics profile of DN1508052-01 : Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Up to 2 months|Halflife (T1/2), Pharmacokinetics profile of DN1508052-01 : Halflife (T1/2), Up to 2 months|Clearance/ bioavailability (CL/F), Pharmacokinetics profile of DN1508052-01 : Clearance/ bioavailability (CL/F), Up to 2 months|Area under curve (AUC), Pharmacokinetics profile of DN1508052-01 : Area under curve (AUC), Up to 2 months|Efficacy Assessments, Subjects will be assessed using RECIST v1.1.

Study Population is adult patients (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.The selected starting dose, 0.01 mg/m2 of DN1508052-01, SC, on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each cycle.The starting dose will proceed with one patient. The next dose 0.1 mg/m2 will be explored if safety data permit in that there is no instance of a ≥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE v5.0) Grade 2 AE that is at least possibly related to the study intervention.then Dose escalation will then proceed following the 3+3 cohorts design.Dose escalation will continue until MTD or RP2D is reached, or the dose escalation will be terminated at the discretion of Investigators and Sponsor (or its designee) based on the analyses of emerging PK, PD, safety and efficacy data.The Primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase Ⅱ dose (RP2D) and assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of DN1508052-01 as a single agent when administered subcutaneously to adult patients with advanced solid tumors.
