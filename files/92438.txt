Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Endometrial Cancer
The study aims to determine whether next generation sequencing and microsatellite analysis of cervical cytology is sensitive for the detection of endometrial carcinoma.

Definitive diagnosis of endometrial cancer relies on endometrial biopsy, in addition to imaging. Biopsy is however invasive and often painful, and its sensitivity in only moderate. Cervical cytology could be an alternative. This is a proof-of-concept study. The investigators will carry out next generation sequencing of cervical cytology in patients with confirmed endometrial carcinoma, in order to determine whether activating variants are identified. About 15% of endometrial carcinomas are microsatellite instable (MSI). The investigators will therefore also carry out MSI analysis using MSICare in the subset of cases with MMR-deficient cancer.
