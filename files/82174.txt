A Phase 1/2 Study of FS118 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with advanced tumors to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of FS118. This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study, designed to systematically assess safety and tolerability, to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for FS118 in participants with advanced tumors and to determine the efficacy of FS118 in participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel. In addition to safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and efficacy will also be assessed.
