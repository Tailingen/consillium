Impact of PErioperative Nutrition Intervention on Bioimpedance Phase Angle (IPENIPA) In Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to measure the mean difference of phase angle after nutritional intervention in breast cancer patients. The main question it aims to answer is:

1. Can perioperative nutrition interventions improve phase angle in relation to other bioimpedance parameters, handgrip strength and surgical outcomes in breast cancer population?

Researchers will compare oral nutritional supplement to a placebo to see if oral nutritional supplement can improve phase angle.

Participants will:

1. Be randomized into either arm
2. Take oral nutritional supplement or placebo according to the result of randomization for 7 days preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively
3. Have their measurements (weight, height, phase angle, handgrip strength) done at least 7 days preoperative, 1 day preoperative and 30 days postoperative
