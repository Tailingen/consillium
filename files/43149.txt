Comparing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor Versus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has achieved promising pathological remission rates in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and has offered new hope for patients with locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. In our center's previous phase II study on locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy showed good 1 - year laryngeal preservation rate and 1 - year PFS rate. However, in locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor, compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can improve laryngeal preservation survival, event - free survival and overall survival remains unclear.

Thus, this study aims to explore in locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer whether neoadjuvant immuno - chemotherapy, compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can improve laryngeal preservation survival and bring benefits in quality of life.
Laryngeal Carcinoma|Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT)|DRUG: Neoadjuvant and maintenance Tislelizumab|RADIATION: Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT)|PROCEDURE: Surgery and adjuvant (chemo-)radiotherapy
2-year Laryngectomy-free Survival Rate, Laryngectomy-free survival (LFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of local recurrence, total laryngectomy, or death, with the time calculated based on the first event that occurs., 2 year
Early response rate, Early response rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] in the primary tumor after one cycle of neoadjuvant therapy, day 14 to day 21|Objective response rate to neoadjuvant therapy, Objective response rate to neoadjuvant therapy is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes after three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy., day 56 to day 63|2-year Event-free Survival Rate, Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following events: disease progression precluding surgical treatment, local recurrence, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 year|2-year Overall Survival Rate, Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., 2 year|2-year Laryngectomy-free Survival Rate with a functional larynx, Laryngectomy-free survival with a functional larynx (fLFS), defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of an endpoint event, which includes: evidence of local recurrence; total laryngectomy; death; or survival at 2 years with tracheostomy, nasogastric tube, or gastrostomy., 2 year|2-year Local Recurrence-Free Survival Rate, Local Recurrence-Free Survival (LRFS): Defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of local recurrence or to death from any cause., 2 year|2-year Distant Metastasis-Free Survival Rate, Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS): Defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of distant metastasis or to death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 year|Adverse event, Adverse events, defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject after randomization up to 2 years post-randomization, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment., 2 year|Quality of life, Quality of life, assessed based on disease-related symptoms and quality of life using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (H\&N)-35 score. For scores related to speech and swallowing function, the higher score indicates more severe symptom., 2 year
