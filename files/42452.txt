Relapse Markers for Colorectal Cancer
This is an observational case-control study which enroll metastatic and non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel blood multi-marker test for the detection of relapse in colorectal cancer patients. This test is based on whole-blood transcriptomic signatures and circulating tumor methylated DNA markers. The patients will be enrolled into 4 study groups, two cross-sectional and two longitudinal groups, to follow up patients up to 36 months from primary tumor resection.
Colorectal Cancer
Sensitivity for relapse detection, Sensitivity of the test for detection of CRC relapse using radiological imaging as the reference diagnostic method, Relapse occurring within 5 years from primary curative intervention|Specificity for relapse detection, Specificity of the test for detection of CRC relapse using radiological imaging as the reference diagnostic method, 36 months disease-free
Concordance analyses, Concordance analyses between the multi-marker and Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) test for all patients and time points, 24 months|Test positivity, Estimation of the multi-marker test positivity for all patients and time points, 24 months|Coefficient of variation of the biomarkers, Intra- and inter-individual coefficient of variation of the biomarkers, pre- and post-surgery and during surveillance up to relapse, 6 weeks|Sensitivity for CRC detection, Sensitivity of the test for detection of primary CRC, up to 1 day prior to tumor resection
