The Comparison Between Epidural and Intravenous Patient-controlled Analgesia for Laparoscopic Gastrectomy
This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of epidural patient-controlled analgesia compared to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy. The investigators hypothesized that epidural PCA would be more effective in pain control than IV PCA even for laparoscopic gastrectomy.
