Low Dose Daily Erlotinib in Combination With High Dose Twice Weekly Erlotinib in Patients With EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different ways of taking erlotinib. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, combination daily low dose and twice weekly high dose erlotinib has on the patient and lung cancer. The investigators are also seeing whether different schedules of erlotinib are better at treating lung cancer that has spread to the central nervous system.

CNS expansion phase:

The pulse continuous regimen will be then assess in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancers and CNS involvement. An additional expansion cohort (A) will enroll 19 patients with newly diagnosed EGFR mutant lung cancer with CNS involvement at diagnosis. The patients in the expansion cohorts will undergo the same treatment plan as the patients in the dose expansion cohort. A patient in the expansion cohorts will not be replaced if he/she does not finish the first 28 day (cycle 1) treatment period.
EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer
DRUG: erlotinib
to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The study will use a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Three to six patients will need to be enrolled at each dose level and assessed for DLT for 1 full cycle (28 days for cycle 1) before dose escalation decision is made., 1 year
to evaluate the safety profile, Toxicity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. The analysis of safety/tolerability data will be descriptive; toxicity events will be individually tabulated., 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from first treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., 1 year|Response rate (RR), sum of complete responses and partial responses according to RECIST 1.1, 1 year|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from first treatment to time of death., 1 year
