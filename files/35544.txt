Interest of Functional MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) (in Patients Suffering From Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Treated With Yttrium
For patients who are suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma and are treated with radioembolization, the purpose of this study is to analyse parameters of functional MRIs that are modified early and to detect parameters that vary significantly after treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: Additional RMIs
Modifications of functional MRI parameters, Before radioembolization and up to 6 months after radioembolization
Correlation between functional MRIs parameters and tumoral response, Measured 6 months after radioembolization|Assessment of alternative morphological response criteria : EASL (European Association for study of the liver) and mRECIST (m response evaluation criteria in solid tumor) criteria. Link with RECIST response., 2 and 6 months|Change of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) release, From day 0 to 2 months
