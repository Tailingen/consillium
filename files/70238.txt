PRecision Oncology CUhk pRogrammE (PRO-CURE)
The main aim of this project is to establish an innovative model of a comprehensive precision oncology platform to help individualizing drug therapy for patients with advanced cancers at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The other objectives include to optimize the genomic matching and access of patients with unique cancer subtypes to the relevant clinical trials of novel therapies, and to construct a personalized drug screening platform for individuals using novel cancer models established from patient-derived cancer cells and tissues. Other objectives include to investigate the utility and feasibility of genomic sequencing using circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA), and to establish a biobank of tumor tissues derived from patients with unique cancer subtypes.
