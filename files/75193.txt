Diagnostic performance of the techniques under investigation, Techniques under investigation are diffusion-weighted imaging for tumour response assessment and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI for nodal assessment, compared to standard T2-weighted MRI., 2 years
To determine the inter-observer agreement for the imaging techniques under investigation, Detection of the differences between expert vs non-expert readers and general vs referral centres concerning diffusion-weighted imaging and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI., 2 years
Rectal cancer is a common form of cancer, and the treatment stratification depends on tumour and nodal stage as determined on MRI. Unfortunately, the information provided by standard T2-weighted MRI is not sufficient to accurately assess nodal involvement and tumour response after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Additional functional information is required for reliable (re)staging. Diffusion-weighted imaging and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI are two new imaging techniques that have all shown great potential in rectal cancer staging. In order to provide definite evidence there is a need for a multicenter study with a large patient population.
