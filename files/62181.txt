Biospecimen Collection and Testing for the Prevalence of Anal Dysplasia and Anal Cancer in Patients With Cervical, Vaginal and Vulvar Dysplasia and Cancer
This trial studies the prevalence of anal dysplasia and anal cancer in patients with cervical, vaginal, and vulvar dysplasia and cancer. Studying samples collected from patients in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the human papillomavirus and how often anal cancer occurs in patients with cervix, vagina, or vulvar cancer.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the prevalence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the prevalence of anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios) of anal pap testing to diagnose anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva.

II. To estimate the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios) of anal high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to diagnose anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva.

III. To estimate the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios) of anal pap testing and HPV testing (anal "cotesting") to diagnose anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva.

IV. To determine associations between gut and cervical microbiomes and anal dysplasia/carcinoma in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina, or vulva.

V. To estimate the prevalence of oral HPV infection in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva.

VI. To compare a new HPV point of care test developed by Rice University with current standard HPV testing.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of anal, cervical, vaginal, and oral samples during their scheduled pelvic exam.
