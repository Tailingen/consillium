Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Effect on Large Surface Photodamaged Skin
In this study, 26 patients were selected and included for full-face photodynamic therapy sessions. All patients presented signs of photoaging skin and multiple actinic keratosis. Photographs and Biopsies were taken before and after the procedure. Clinical and histological aspects as well as immunohistochemical aspects regarding neocollagen induction and tumor expression were evaluated.
