Trial of DFP-14927 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, single-arm, dose escalation study of DFP-14927 intravenous infusion administered to patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Cancer
DRUG: DFP-14927
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The highest dose level at which less than one-third of at least 6 patients (i.e., 0 or 1 out of 6) experience a DLT, From first dose (Day 1) up to 30 days after last dose|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DFP-14927 at which the Phase II study will explore, From first dose (Day 1) up to 30 days after last dose|Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Determined through the frequency/severity of adverse events per CTCAE V5.0, From first dose (Day 1) up to 30 days after last dose
Determine objective response rate (CR or PR) in response to DFP-14927 study treatment, Response to treatment will be assessed per RECIST 1.1, At pre-study and every 8 weeks through study completion, an average of 6 months|Duration of response, Number of days from the time of initial response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death, At pre-study and every 8 weeks through study completion, an average of 6 months|PK parameters to be determined using area under the concentration curve (AUC), The concentration of DFP-14927 in blood plasma vs time, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days), Day 1: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-dose; Day 8: 0,1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-dose and predose on Days 15, 22, and 29 (same as Day 1 of next Cycle)|PK parameters to be determined using maximum drug concentration (Cmax), The maximum concentration of DFP-14927 in blood plasma, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days), Day 1: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-dose; Day 8: 0,1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-dose and predose on Days 15, 22, and 29 (same as Day 1 of next Cycle)
This study will determine the safety and efficacy of DFP-14927 in patients with refractory or relapsed advanced solid tumors. The study will be guided by a standard "3+3"dose escalation by observing the drug-related toxicities and dose-limiting toxicities following weekly IV infusion of DFP-14927 for each 28-day cycle (4 doses per cycle). In addition, the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose for DFP-14927 will be determined.

Furthermore, the study will determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of DFP-14927 during the first cycle of treatment using the weekly dosing schedule.
