Rechallenge of Imatinib in GIST Having no Effective Treatment: RIGHT
The objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes following resumption of dosing (re-challenge) with Imatinib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in patients with advanced/incurable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors following failure of prior imatinib and sunitinib therapies.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Imatinib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free Survival, To compare the progression free survival (PFS) assessed by the blinded independent central review following resumption of dosing (re-challenge) with Imatinib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST following failure of at least prior imatinib and sunitinib therapies, up tp12 weeks
Disease Control Rate, Inclusion of complete response, partial response or stable disease

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Progressive disease (PD), \>20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Insufficient change to qualify for PR or PD., up to 12 weeks|Progression Free Survival, To compare PFS assessed by investigators, up to 12 weeks|Response Rate, Tumour responses were initially determined by the local investigators in accordance with RECIST 1.0.Treatment decisions were based on local onsite radiological review. All imaging data were subsequently collected, anonymised, and reviewed centrally in a double-blind manner by two external academic radiology reviewers.

Response assessment was determined in a masked central review by use of RECIST1.1., Up to 12weeks|Overall Survival(OS) and Time to Progression(TTP), To compare the overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in both arms of the study, Up to 3years|Safety and Tolerability of Imatinib, percentage of patients who experienced toxicity from study treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of imatinib re-challenge in this patient population, Up to 3years
The objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes following resumption of dosing (re-challenge) with Imatinib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in patients with advanced/incurable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors following failure of prior imatinib and sunitinib therapies.
