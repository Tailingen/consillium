This study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (GC101 TIL) therapy versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Autologous TILs are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies and infused i.v. into the patient after NMA lymphodepletion treatment with cyclophosphamide and hydroxychloroquine.
