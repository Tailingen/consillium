A Study of Tarceva (Erlotinib) Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Tarceva in patients with advanced NSCLC for whom Tarceva monotherapy is considered the best therapeutic option. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: erlotinib [Tarceva]
Time to Disease Progression or Death by Line of Treatment, Time to progression or death was defined as the time from inclusion to the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., Baseline, every 6-8 weeks up to 3 years until disease progression or death
Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Benefit by Line of Treatment, Efficacy was analyzed in terms of clinical benefit, defined as the sum of the number of participants achieving complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], or stable disease \[SD\]. Tumor response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (â‰¥)30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum longest diameters associated to non-progressive disease response for non target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference smallest sum of longest dimensions since treatment started associated to non-progressive disease response for non target lesions., Baseline, every 6-8 weeks up to 3 years or until death|Overall Survival (OS) by Line of Treatment, Time in months from the start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (the death date or last known alive date \[if death date was unavailable\] minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1 divided by 30.44)., Baseline, every 6-8 weeks up to 3 years, or until death
