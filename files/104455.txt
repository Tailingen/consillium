Development of a Questionnaire on Patients' Perception of Their Oncology Care Pathway (Onco-PREMs)
Healthcare systems are evolving, giving increasing prominence to the patient-centered model, accompanied by objective and perceived outcomes.

PREMs (Patient Reported Experience Measures) are used to assess how patients feel about their experience of care. PREMs enable patients to take an active role in their own care, and enable healthcare establishments to identify areas for improvement that can be incorporated into their quality processes.

In oncology, the collection of patient-perceived quality regarding their care pathway would enable better coordination of their care. While a few initiatives have emerged in the field of PREMs, the development of a reliable questionnaire assessing patient perception of their care pathway in oncology remains a challenge.
