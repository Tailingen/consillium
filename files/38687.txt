Prospective Cohort of Diagnostic Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Lung Lesions
The primary objective is To evaluate the usefulness and safety of advanced guided bronchoscopy for histological diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions.

The Secondary objective is to establish a strategy that can most effectively use endoscopes for early diagnosis of lung cancer in a real-world care environment by identifying patient/clinical/image/procedure-related characteristics that can optimize the practicality of emerging technologies.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Guided bronchoscopy
Diagnostic yield at index, The proportion of pathologic results that leads to a specific malignant or benign, Upon reports of pathologic results (up to 2 weeks after bronchoscopy)
Diagnostic accuracy at 12 months, True positive + True negative (confirmed benign with follow-up of at least 1yr without progression) / Total procedures

Pathologic results of a malignant or benign specific diagnosis based on the samples collected via index ENB procedure are categorized as true positives or true negatives.

For pathologic results of a benign non-specific diagnosis and non-diagnostic results, follow-up data would be used to determine whether the 12-month status corroborates the benign results. Based on definition scenarios, these results will be determined as true negatives or false negatives. Diagnostic yields based on different scenarios will be reported., Confirmed by follow-up results at 1 year|Sensitivity for malignancy, True positive/Confirmed malignancy cases, Confirmed by follow-up results at 1 year|Complication, Evaluate complications due to guided bronchoscopic biopsy, Confirmed by follow-up results at 1 year
* Patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions who need histological diagnosis due to suspected lung cancer and whose lesions are judged capable of histological examination through guided bronchoscopy will be prospectively recruited.
* This study is a pure non-interventional pragmatic design. In addition to biopsy for lung lesions using bronchoscopy, lung cancer staging and tests necessary for metastases and treatment for diagnosed lung cancer are performed according to existing guidelines and the judgment of medical staff.
* We will analyze the clinical characteristics of guided bronchoscopy procedures used in clinical practice and the main results during the follow-up period of up to one year (diagnostic yield, sensitivity, safety, practicality, and various factors affecting usefulness).
