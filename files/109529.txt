Intraoperative Imaging of Thoracic Malignancies With Indocyanine Green
Our specific aim is to determine if Indocyanine Green (ICG) administered intraoperatively and imaged using our camera will aid in the identification of a suspected lung nodule.
Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: Indocyanine Green
Imaging effectiveness of ICG and imaging system., The primary end-point of the study is to determine the sensitivity of ICG uptake and expression in identifying lung nodules / masses when excited by an imaging probe intraoperatively. This will be accomplished by using the probe to image the tumor, then subtracting the background from surrounding thoracic structures. Uptake will be measured using the scale of the instrument, an arbitrary value of between 1 and 10,000. Uptake will be summarized using the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI)., 1 day after injection of ICG
According to the World Health Organization, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women, and is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually as of 2004. Surgery remains the best option for patients presenting with operable Stage I or II cancers, however the five year survival rate for these candidates remains at a dismal 53% for Stage I and 32% for Stage II1. The high rates of recurrence suggest that surgeons are unable to completely detect and remove primary tumor nodules in a satisfactory manner as well as lingering metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. By ensuring a negative margin through near-infrared imagery with a safe non-toxic contrast agent it would be possible for the investigators to improve the rates of recurrence free patients and thus overall survival. This study is a small pilot/feasibility study to determine if the investigators camera system can be effective at identifying malignancies in lung cancer patients.
