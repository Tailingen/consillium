Trial of Nivolumab With FOLFOX After Chemoradiation in Rectal Cancer Patients
This is a phase II, prospective, open label, one-center study for evaluation of the addition of nivolumab to the chemotherapy phase of the neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Subjects must have received no prior treatment for rectal cancer (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) and no prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.

Eligible subjects will receive chemoradiation for a period of 5 weeks, 6 cycles of chemo-immunotherapy (mFOLFOX6 + nivolumab) for a period of 12 weeks, once every 2 weeks, and will undergo surgery after 4 weeks.

pathological complete response (pCR) rate, pCR is defined when no tumor is found on pathology review of the surgical specimen (TRG -0), Time from start of neoadjuvant treatment until surgical resection, assessed up to 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety), Treatment-emergent AEs will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0, vital signs and clinical laboratory, Time from screening until the end of study drug administration, assessed up to 24 months
Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS will be censored for patients who are alive and free of progression at the time of last follow-up. DFS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, Time from the first day of treatment to the first event of: loco-regional failure, metastatic recurrence, the appearance of a secondary colorectal cancer or death from any cause, assessed up to 42 months|Overall Survival (OS), Patients who are still alive when last traced will be censored at the date of last follow-up. OS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The time interval between the first day of treatment and the date of death of any cause, assessed up to 66 months
