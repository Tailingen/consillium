Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab/Temsirolimus Combination to Treat Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of bevacizumab/temsirolimus is effective in patients with advanced renal carcinoma progressing after anti-VEGF treatment
Kidney Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Temsirolimus
6-month Progression Free Survival (PFS), Proportion of patients who are progression-free at 6month evaluation from treatment initiation, 32 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated from date of treatment initiation until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during treatment and at discontinuation, unless it was performed within the last 4 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of death or last contact, 48 months|Response Rate (RR), RR is defined as the overall percentage of patients with partial (PR) or complete response (CR). The evaluation of responses will be performed according to RECIST criteria, Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during treatment and at discontinuation, unless it was performed within the last 4 weeks|Tumor Shrinkage, Tumor shrinkage will be computed using waterfall plots, Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during treatment and at discontinuation, unless it was performed within the last 4 weeks|Adverse Events (AEs) of all participants will be recorded and assessed upon signature of the informed consent form, until 30 days after the last administration of study treatment., Adverse Events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria and will be reported in a frequency table according to the highest severity grade observed per patient, 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) assessment, QoL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire. The change in the QoL during treatment will be estimated using the Wilcoxon paired t-test, At baseline and every 8 weeks during treatment|Investigation of antiangiogenic factors (FGF, VEGF, VEGFRR), Changes in serum levels of antiangiogenic factors during treatment and correlation to the outcome of study treatment., 36 months
