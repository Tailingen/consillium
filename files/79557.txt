The objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Primary Saliary Gland Adenocarcinoma.
Salivary Gland Carcinomas
DRUG: Surufatinib
Objective response rate (ORR), CR + PR rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
Major pathological response rate (MPR), the reduction of the active tumor below an established clinically significant node., up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess the efficacy of Neoadjuvant Surufatinib for Patients With Salivary Gland Carcinomas, patients by assessment of progression free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., up to 36 months|Assess the anti-tumor activity:DCR, Disease control rate (DCR):CR + PR + SD rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months|Overall survival time, OS was calculated from the date of pharmacy to death from any cause., through study completion, an average of 1 year
The purpose of this study was to explore whether the efficacy and survival time of patients with local advanced primary salivary gland adenocarcinoma could be further improved through the treatment of Surufatinib neoadjuvant for local advanced primary salivary gland adenocarcinoma, and to explore the safety and tolerability of this regimen.A Study of Surufatinib Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Primary Saliary Gland Adenocarcinomaï¼ša Single-arm, Prospective,Open Label Study.
