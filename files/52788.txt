The Evaluation of Surgical Decisions and Prognosis of the Radiomics and Watson Artificial Intelligence in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical decisions and prognosis of the radiomics and Watson artificial intelligence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Liver Resection
DEVICE: Radiomics and Watson artificial intelligence
Postoperative survival, Survival after hepatectomy, 5 years
Disease-free survival, Survival time without tumor after HCC resection, 5 years
Intraoperative blood loss, Operative outcome, intraoperative
Hepatectomy is an effective treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, but liver failure after hepatectomy may lead to increased postoperative mortality.Therefore, it is very important to make preoperative surgical decisions, evaluate the safety of the operation and identify which patients are likely to suffer from liver failure.Imaging omics is a newly emerging research method in recent years, which has great potential in cancer diagnosis and treatment, and can monitor treatment and predict the prognosis of patients, so as to better realize accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases.The artificial intelligence platform developed by IBM Watson for Watson tumor treatment decisions can provide treatment decisions and corresponding theoretical basis to guide surgical decisions based on the key clinical data of liver cancer patients.
