Feasibility Study of SOL (S-1,Oral Leucovorin,and Oxaliplatin) in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer
In China, S-1 is an novel oral fluoropyrimidine with demonstrated high efficacy on gastrointestinal cancer. The new regimen with oxaliplatin and leucovorin is expected to achieve more encouraging efficacy on gastric cancer. This study is aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the SOL regimen on efficacy and tolerability on Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.

DRUG: S-1, leucovorin, oxaliplatin
Response rate, Evaluate the objective response rate followed by RECIST 1.1., 6-8 weeks
Adverse events, Investigators graded all adverse events and toxic effects according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria, The number of Participants with adverse events will be recorded at each treatment visit., 1 year|Overall survival, 3 year|Progress free survival, Tumor assessment will be performed every 3 cycles (9 weeks) from the start of treatment until progression or as for the metastatic site developed during the study (including clinical suspicion). In order to confirm objective tumor response, additional confirmatory scan should be obtained at least 4 weeks following the first radiological evidence of tumor response., up to 9 weeks|Disease control rate, To Assess disease control rate (DCR) as defined CR + PR + SD assessed by RECIST criteria, up to 9 weeks
