Safety and Tolerability of Different Concentrations of an Ingenol Derivative Field Therapy in the Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
The purpose of this study is to determine if the new ingenol derivative gels are as safe as and as well tolerated as ingenol mebutate gel when applied to AK lesions on the forearm for two consecutive days.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: Ingenol once daily for two consecutive days
Safety of a new ingenol derivative compared to ingenol mebutate gel applied topically once daily for two consecutive days to four separate treatment areas containing actinic keratosis on the forearm, Safety data to be collected via CRF entries of AEs/SAEs and photographs., 8 weeks
Evaluate treatment responses on Actinic Keratosis of different concentrations of a new ingenol derivative gel compared to the ingenol mebutate gel as assessed by reduction in number of clinically visible selected AK lesions eight weeks after treatment, Assessed by Reflective Confocal Microscopy scoring of visible selected AK lesions, 8 weeks
Various concentrations of new ingenol derivatives will be applied to AKs on the forearms. Reactions and safety will be compared to a US registered and marketed ingenol gel to ascertain if the new ingenol is at least as safe and as well tolerated as the registered ingenol.
