A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Dosimetry of 68Ga-labelled OncoFAP Derivatives in Solid Tumors
The primary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety and dosimetry of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP for detection/imaging of solid tumors.
Breast Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Oesophageal Cancer|Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: [68Ga]Ga-OncoFAP administration
Safety (AE), Safety of administration of 68Ga-OncoFAP, assessed based on Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE version 5.0), Throughout study, until a maximum of 8 days after the completion of each patient|Cohort A: Dosimetry - Effective dose equivalent (mSv), Effective dose equivalent (mSv) of normal organs following administration of a single dose of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP, for patients in cohort A, Assessed on day 1|Cohort A: Dosimetry - Absorbed doses (mGy), Absorbed doses (mGy) of normal organs following administration of a single dose of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP, for patients in cohort A, Assessed on day 1
Biodistribution profile: SUVmax, Uptake of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP in terms of SUVmax, Assessed on day 1|Biodistribution profile: SUVmean, Uptake of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP in terms of SUVmean, Assessed on day 1|Biodistribution profile: SUVsd, Uptake of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP in terms of SUVsd, Assessed on day 1|PK, Pharmacokinetics of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP based on measurement of residual radioactivity in the blood over time \[MBq/mL, Assessed on day 1|Excretion, Metabolism and excretion of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP based on radioactivity measurements on urine collected at defined timepoints, Assessed on day 1|Immunopathology staining, Correlation of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP uptake with immunopathology staining if and when surgical or biopsy specimen are available, Assessed on day 1|Lesion detection rate, Lesion detection rate compared to standard imaging, Assessed on day 1
Phase I, multicenter study in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor among breast cancer, colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, requiring clinical staging for nodal staging and/or metastatic disease (based on institutional practice and risk stratification). All patients will receive a single intravenous bolus administration of 250 MBq (225 - 275 MBq). \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP biodistribution, PK, and dosimetry of \[68Ga\]Ga-OncoFAP will be assessed based on a series of PET/CT scans, blood and urine sampling.
