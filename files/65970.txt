Detection of Circulating Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies in Biological Samples of Gynecological Cancer Patients.
Quantification of anti PD-1 mAbs in cancer patients is extremely important to monitor pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of immunotherapy. To detect the ICI mAbs in patients' blood plasma samples, we select three anti PD-1 mAbs (cemiplimab, dostarlimab and pembrolizumab) as prognostic biomarkers which will be quantified using different biochemical/analytical assays.
