It is expected that KN510 and KN713 will broaden the range of target patient groups and overcome resistance to the drugs in an innovative manner by targeting the common metabolic process of cancer cells, unlike existing targeted therapies whose application is limited depending on the presence of specific mutation and combination of mutations as they mainly target a single tyrosine kinase.

In this study, the safety and tolerability of combination therapy of KN510 and KN713, including the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), will be evaluated in patients with advance solid tumors and based on this, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined.
