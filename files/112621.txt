Study of Tislelizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy Compared to Chemotherapy Alone for Participants With Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab + either cisplatin or carboplatin + gemcitabine versus placebo+ either cisplatin or carboplatin + gemcitabine in approximately 420 participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy.
