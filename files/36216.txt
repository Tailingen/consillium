A Phase I Open Label Study of the Safety and Tolerability of Elotuzumab (BMS-901608) Administered in Combination With Either Lirilumab (BMS-986015) or Urelumab (BMS-663513) in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
To assess the safety and tolerability, characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of Elotuzumab administered in combination with either Lirilumab or Urelumab in subjects with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Elotuzumab|DRUG: Lirilumab|DRUG: Urelumab
Safety as measured by the rate of AEs, SAEs, deaths is the primary endpoint of this Phase 1 study. All subjects who receive at least one (full or partial) dose of Elotuzumab, Lirilumab or Urelumab will be evaluated for safety, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), During treatment and first 100 days after treatment
