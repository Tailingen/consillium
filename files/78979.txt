Huaier Granule on Reducing the Level of Tumor Markers in Patients With Early-stage Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, single center, single-arm, phase IV study， to evaluate the effect of Huaier Granule on reducing the level of tumor markers in early-stage breast cancer patients.
Early-stage Breast Cancer
DRUG: Huaier granule
Recovery rate of any tumor marker (CEA/CA125/CA153) to normal, The rate at which one or more tumor markers (CEA/CA125/CA153) exceed the upper limit of normal values before patient enrollment and any tumor marker that rises before enrollment decreases to the normal range after the end of Huaier Granule treatment, Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up
The incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and severe adverse events (SAE), The definition and severity grading of AE and SAE refer to the corresponding descriptions in the definition and evaluation section of adverse events, and the incidence rate is defined as the proportion of patients with AE and SAE to the corresponding total population, Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up|The incidence and severity of adverse reaction (ADR), severe adverse reactions(SADR), suspicious and unexpected severe adverse reaction (SUSAR), The definition and severity grading of ADR, severe ADR, and SUSAR refer to the corresponding descriptions in the definition and evaluation section of adverse events. The incidence rate is defined as the proportion of patients with ADR, severe ADR, and SUSAR to the corresponding total population, Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up|The rate at which immune related cytokines （IL-1β，IL-2，IL-4，IL-5，IL-6，IL-8，IL-10，IL-12，IL-17，TNF-α，IFN-α，IFN-γ）return to normal levels, The rate of recovery of immune related cytokines to normal levels was detected at baseline, initial follow-up, and at the end of treatment., The 3rd and 12th months after starting treatment
This clinical trial is expected to include 379 patients in the follow-up stage after breast cancer surgery who visited the Breast Surgery Department of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Hospital from October 2022 to October 2024. Excluding cases where tumor markers (CEA/CA125/CA153) exceed the normal upper limit level in the case of recurrence and metastasis. All participants received treatment with Huaier granules for 1 year, or experienced intolerable toxicity, withdrew from the study for any reason or died, whichever occurred first.

The main research indicator is the recovery rate of tumor markers (CEA/CA125/CA153) to normal.
