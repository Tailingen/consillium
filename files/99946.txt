Adjuvant Tumor Lysate Vaccine and Iscomatrix With or Without Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib in Patients With Malignancies Involving Lungs, Esophagus, Pleura, or Mediastinum
Background:

During recent years, cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA), particularly those encoded by genes on the X chromosome (CT-X genes), have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of CTAs, immune responses to these proteins appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells present within tumor sites and systemic circulation of these individuals. Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with tumor cells expressing high levels of CTAs in combination with regimens that deplete or inhibit T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with primary lung and esophageal cancers, pleural mesotheliomas, thoracic sarcomas, thymic neoplasms and mediastinal germ cell tumors, as well as sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual disease (MRD) following standard multidisciplinary therapy will be vaccinated with H1299 tumor cell lysates with Iscomatrix adjuvant. Vaccines will be administered with or without metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg by mouth (PO) twice a day (BID) x 7day (d) every (q) 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as immunologic responses to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphocytes will be assessed before and after a six month vaccination period.

Primary Objectives:

1. To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to CTAs in patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccines alone in comparison to patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix vaccines in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To examine if oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib therapy diminishes the number and percentage of T regulatory cells and diminishes activity of these cells in patients with thoracic malignancies are at risk of recurrence.
2. To examine if H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccination enhances immunologic response to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous EBV-transformed lymphocytes (B cells).

Eligibility:

* Patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell or non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC;NSCLC), esophageal cancer (EsC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), thymic or mediastinal germ cell tumors, thoracic sarcomas, or melanomas, sarcomas, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who have no clinical evidence of active disease (NED), or minimal residual disease (MRD) not readily accessible by non-invasive biopsy or resection/radiation following standard therapy completed within the past 26 weeks.
* Patients must be 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2.
* Patients must have adequate bone marrow, kidney, liver, lung and cardiac function.
* Patients may not be on systemic immunosuppressive medications at time vaccinations commence.

Design:

* Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or chemo/radiotherapy (XRT), patients with NED or MRD will be vaccinated via IM injection with H1299 cell lysates and Iscomatrix(TM) adjuvant monthly for 6 months.
* Vaccines will be administered with or without with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.
* Systemic toxicities and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post vaccination serologic and cell mediated responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as autologous tumor cells (if available) and EBV-transformed lymphocytes will be assessed before and after vaccination.
* Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.
* Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease recurrence.
* The trial will randomize 28 evaluable patients per arm to either receive vaccine alone or vaccine plus chemotherapy in order to have 80% power to determine if the frequency of immune responses on the combination arm exceeds that of the vaccine alone arm, if the expected frequencies of immune responses on the two arms were 20% and 50%, using a one-sided 0.10 alpha level Fisher's exact test.
* Approximately 60 patients will be accrued to this trial.

Number of Participants With an Immunologic Responses, Immunologic responses are defined as an appearance of new serologic reactivity, or increase in existing antibody response to cancer-testis on the X chromosome (CT-X) antigen. Antigens such as New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO1) and melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family members assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) one month after the 6th vaccine., one month after the 6th vaccine
Fold Change From Baseline of Intensity of Programmed Cell Death Protein 1(PD-1) Expression on Tregs, The Mann=Whitney U test was used to compare the fold change of intensity of PD-1 expression on Tregs between the two groups. A decrease in the fold change is consistent with a better outcome. The difference, or the relative difference, in the values at the two time points were obtained and tested to determine if the difference is equal to zero. If a paired t-test is able to be used, with at least 20 evaluable participants, there is 81% power to detect a change equal to ¾ of a standard deviation of the change at the two-sided 0.025 significance level. This was done in order to allow for a conservative adjustment due to determining the significance of the change in the percent of Tregs on two arms., one month after first 6 vaccinations|Fold Change From Baseline of Percent Tregs, The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the fold change of percent Tregs between the two groups. A decrease in the fold change is consistent with a better outcome. The difference, or the relative difference, in the values at the two time points were obtained and tested to determine if the difference is equal to zero. If a paired t-test is able to be used, with at least 20 evaluable participants, there is 81% power to detect a change equal to ¾ of a standard deviation of the change at the two-sided 0.025 significance level. This was done in order to allow for a conservative adjustment due to determining the significance of the change in the percent of Tregs on two arms., one month after first 6 vaccinations
Percentage of T Regulatory Cells at the Two Timepoints: Baseline and End of Treatment, The immunologic response to autologous tumor or epigenetically-modified autologous Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes will be determined by the difference, or relative difference, in values (by percentage) of T-regulatory cells at the two timepoints. The percentage of T-regulatory cells will determine if oral cyclophosphamide and celecoxib therapy decreases the percentage of T cells on each Arm/Group., Baseline, and end of treatment|Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to final collection of AE data, approximately 9 months and 12 days for cohort 1 and 8 months and 22 days for cohort 2.
