Gut Microbiome Modification Through Dietary Intervention in Patients With Colorectal Cancer: Response to Surgery
The investigators will conduct an open, controlled, randomized clinical trial, in patients with scheduled surgical intervention for CRC in the General Surgery and Digestive System Unit of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital (Murcia, Spain). All the included individuals must have passed the protocol of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital to be candidates for elective major surgery for CRC and must sign the informed consent after being informed of the objectives and the methodology of the study. The Helsinki Declaration will be followed during the duration of the project.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio after receiving a diagnosis of CRC in the endoscopic evaluation; in the control arm, patients will receive standard nutritional recommendations, while patients in the intervention arm will be advised to follow a high-fiber diet rich in PUFAs (total dietary intake of at least 30 grams of fiber per day, and of at least 3 grams of PUFAs per day from food, not supplements) at least 4 weeks before surgery
