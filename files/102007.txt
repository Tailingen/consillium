Preoperative Chemoradiation With VMAT-SIB in Rectal Cancer
This was a prospective phase II study on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer or local recurrence, to evaluate the pathological response and resectability of a neoadjuvant treatment based on the use of a combined treatment with VMAT-SIB and two drugs chemotherapy ( XELOX).
Rectal Neoplasms
RADIATION: VMAT-SIB|DRUG: XELOX
Pathological response rate, Pathological response was determined according to the TNM classification system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The complete resection of the tumor (R) with no histological proven residual disease in the surgical specimen, was defined as pathological complete response (pCR =pT0). Near complete response (pTmic) was defined as the presence of a number of neoplastic cells inferior to 10%., 6-8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy
Acute Toxicity, To score acute toxicity CTCAE v.3.0 was used, During radiation treatment and at the first follow-up visit (4 weeks after RT).
This was a prospective phase II study on patients with LARC or local recurrence, to evaluate the pathological response and resectability of a neoadjuvant treatment based on the use of a combined treatment with VMAT-SIB and two drugs chemotherapy ( XELOX).

The primary aim was to asses the pathological response rate. Key secondary aim was the acute toxicity. Secondary aims were local control, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

The follow-up period of each subjects started at the end of combined treatment and concluded after a period of maximum 60 months or until death.
