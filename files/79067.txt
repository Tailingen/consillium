Moderate Hypofractionated Boost to the Prostate With Pelvic RT in High Risk Prostate Cancer
This is a single-arm phase II prospective trials that is recruiting 100 participants. The study population that is being investigated are patients with localized high-risk or node-positive prostate cancer. Participants will receive external beam radiotherapy as a moderately hypofractionated boost to the prostate with pelvic radiation therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy will be prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician as per standard of care.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Moderate hypofractionated boost to the prostate with pelvic RT (external beam radiotherapy)
Acute Grade >2 Gastrointestinal Toxicity, Acute (less than or equal to 90 days) toxicity will be evaluated by using prospective follow-up and grading according to the latest version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Baseline to 5-year follow-up
Patient-reported quality-of-life assessed by EPIC-26, Patient-Reported Quality of Life will be assessed at baseline and at each follow-up visit (3-weeks post intervention then every 6 months until 5 years, or more frequently if clinically necessary) using the following assessment questionnaires: 26-Item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Measure the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms during the study, Patient-Reported symptoms will be assessed at baseline and at each follow-up visit (3-weeks post intervention then every 6 months until 5 years, or more frequently if clinically necessary) using the following assessment questionnaires: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Graded criteria based on CTCAE version 5.0 for acute genitourinary toxicity and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity, Acute (less than or equal to 90 days) and long-term (greater than 90 days) toxicity will be evaluated by using prospective follow-up and grading according to the latest version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Measure of oncologic outcomes, Time to development of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (biochemmical or ardiographic progression while having castrate levels of testosterone), Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Measure of oncologic outcomes, Biochemical control rate will be assessed at baseline and at each follow-up visit (3 weeks after treatment then every 6 months until 5 years or more frequently if clinically necessary) by the blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Measure of onocologic outcomes, Radiographic control rate will be assess at baseline and weekly during the radiotherapy intervention using cone beam CT or bone scan., Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Prostate cancer specific survival based on death from prostate cancer, Safety will be evaluated by recording prostate cancer mortality at follow-up visits (3-weeks post intervention then every 6 months until 5 years, or more frequently if clinically necessary), Baseline to 5-year Follow-up|Overall survival, Safety will be evaluated by recording overall mortality at follow-up visits (3-weeks post intervention then every 6 months until 5 years, or more frequently if clinically necessary)., Baseline to 5-year Follow-up
