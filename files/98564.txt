Using A Dissolved Oxygen Enriched Dressing in Nipple-sparing Mastectomy
This study will evaluate the effect of OxyGenesys Dissolved Oxygen Dressing in wound complication rates of the nipple areolar complex after a nipple sparing mastectomy.

DEVICE: OxyGenesys Dissolved Oxygen Dressing|DEVICE: Standard Gauze Dressing
Evaluate the Effects of OxyGenesys Dissolved Oxygen Dressing in Wound Complication Rates of the Nipple Areolar Complex Post Nipple-sparing Mastectomy, Wound Complication Rate, 30 days
To Evaluate Scar Formation 30 Days Post Nipple-sparing Mastectomy, Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale - range = 1 - 10. "1" is best condition ("normal skin") and "10" is worst condition ("worst scar imaginable"). The scale is used to assess each of six different wound characteristics, including vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area. The means of these combined scores and their respective standard deviations are reported for each study group. The range of the final evaluation score, based on the collective evaluation of each of the six wound characteristics is "6" (if each of the six scores equals "1") to "60" (if each of the six scores equals "10")., 30 days post nipple-sparing mastectomy|To Assess Pain Using the Numerical Rating Scale, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) - range = 0 - 10. "0" corresponds to "no pain" and "10" indicates "worst pain imaginable". The means of these scores and their respective standard deviations are reported for each study group., 30 days
This study will recruit women who are undergoing a bilateral mastectomy for either cancer or a positive BRCA gene. Women will be randomized to a different treatment per breast. One breast will receive the OxyGenesys dressing and the other will receive the standard gauze dressing. The study will evaluate wound complication rates and compare the two treatments.
