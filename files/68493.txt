Study Evaluating SKI-606 in Subject With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral SKI-606 (100, 200, 300 or 400 mg) administered on a daily schedule to subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors and to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in this subject population. This study will also obtain preliminary information on the pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of orally administered SKI-606 in subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors
