Autologous HBV-specific T Cell Receptor Engineered T Cells (TCR-T) in Patients With HBV-related Advanced HCC
Adoptive cell therapy with TCR-T cells targeting HBV antigens represents an innovative opportunity for treatment of HBV-related HCC. SCG101 is a genetically modified autologous TCR-T cell therapy with a natural high-avidity TCR directed towards the HLA-A\*02-restricted HBsAg peptide. This is a phase 1 clinical study of SCG101 alone and with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors in HBV-related HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
GENETIC: SCG101|BIOLOGICAL: PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor
Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities defined as dose limiting toxicities (DLT), To assess the tolerability of SCG101 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), 28 days
Efficacy: antitumor activity of SCG101 in subjects with HBV-related HCC, Tumor response assessment in accordance with mRECIST and iRECIST, Up to 2 years|Efficacy: antiviral activity of SCG101, Changes in serum levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) before and after SCG101 infusion, Up to 2 years
This is an open-label, multi-center clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of SCG101, with and without PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, in patients with HBV-related HCC. Lymphodepleting regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will be given prior to SCG101 infusion.
