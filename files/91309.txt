The Effects of Intraoperative Tranexamic Acid on Perioperative Bleeding In Craniotomies
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of a drug called tranexamic acid (TXA) on reducing blood loss in participants undergoing surgery to remove brain tumors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does TXA 20 mg/kg IV bolus of TXA, and 1 mg/kg/hr infusion of TXA reduce the amount of estimated blood loss during surgery?
2. Does TXA 20 mg/kg IV bolus of TXA, and 1 mg/kg/hr infusion of TXA prevent re-operation, disability or death related to bleeding inside the head during and after surgery? Participants are randomized to receive 20 mg/kg IV bolus of TXA or matching placebo within 30 minutes of start of surger, and then 1 mg/kg/hr infusion of TXA or matching from the start of surgery to end of surgery. Treatment allocation is blinded. Investigator will compare the two treatment arms to see whether there are differences in the amount of blood loss during surgery and bleeding-related complications. Investigators will also monitor for any side effects of TXA.

Excessive blood loss during and after a neurosurgical procedure may increase illness and cause death. The surgeons and their team put in a lot of effort during surgery to and prevent excessive bleeding during and after surgery. One of the medications that may help is tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is a medication that is widely used in cardiac, orthopedic and trauma surgery to prevent heavy bleeding, the need for blood transfusion and reduce death. During neurosurgery, there is not enough proof whether giving TXA to participants reduces blood loss, and there are no clear guidelines regarding the use of TXA. Investigators are interested in studying the effect of TXA on blood loss in participants undergoing craniotomy to remove a brain tumor. A craniotomy is an operation where a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain to remove a brain tumor. One of the risks associated with this procedure is bleeding. Currently, some participants undergoing this type of surgery receive TXA and others do not, as the decision to administer TXA is based on an investigator's preference. Therefore, a study investigating the impact of TXA on bleeding during or following craniotomy, as well as its safety, is needed to better inform practice and potentially improve outcomes of surgery.
