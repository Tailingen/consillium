Establish the PK of Belinostat in Patients With Wild-type, Heterozygous, and Homozygous UGT1A1*28 Genotypes
This is a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the PK profiles of belinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or hematological malignancies who have heterozygous and homozygous UGT1A1\*28 genotypes and wild-type UGT1A1 gene. Enrolled patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts (A, B, or C) based on their UGT1A1 genotype
Solid Tumors|Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: Belinostat IV
Plasma and urine concentrations of belinostat will be measured, PK will be measured for area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), steady state volume of distribution (Vdss),PK will be measured for total body clearance (CLtot),PK will be measured for fraction excreted unchanged (fe), PK will be measured for renal clearance (CLren), PK will be measured for non-renal clearance (CLnonren), PK will be measured for peak concentration (Cmax),and half-life (t1/2), 26 Weeks

This is a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the PK profiles of belinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or hematological malignancies who have heterozygous and homozygous UGT1A1\*28 genotypes and wild-type UGT1A1 gene. Enrolled patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts (A, B, or C) based on their UGT1A1 genotype

Enrollment into all cohorts will occur simultaneously rather than sequentially. Belinostat will be administered via a 30-minute infusion once daily from Day 1 to Day 5 of one 21-day cycle. Clinical safety will be monitored in each patient. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from Day 1 to Day 3, and urine samples for PK analysis will be collected from Day 1 to Day 4.
