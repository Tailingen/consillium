Docetaxel, Gemcitabine and Pazopanib as Treatment for Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Chemotherapy treatment with docetaxel and gemcitabine is a standard treatment for patients with soft tissue sarcoma. This study is designed to explore whether the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib enhances the anticancer effect of the chemotherapy drugs.

The Phase I component of this study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of pazopanib when given with docetaxel and gemcitabine. The Phase II component is designed to determine the overall response rate of the combination of docetaxel, gemcitabine and pazopanib prior to surgical resection in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
