Axillary Radiotherapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer With Limited Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes
This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of axillary radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer with limited positive sentinel lymph nodes.

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that complete axillary lymph node dissection is not necessary in patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes who undergo breast conserving surgery, whole breast irradiation, and systemic therapy. However, whether or not the regional lymph node should be irradiated and if radiation given, whether or not all levels of axillary lymph node and internal mammary and supraclavicular lymph node should be irradiated is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of axillary level I-II areas radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes and no further axillary lymph node dissection.
