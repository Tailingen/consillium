Colorectal Cancer Screening in Xinxiang City
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of the fecal protein dual-index test reagent for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC).
Colorectal Cancer
Sensitivity of colorectal cancer detection, Sensitivity of colorectal cancer detection, 180 days|Specificity of advanced neoplasia detection, Specificity of advanced neoplasia detection, 180 days
Positive predictive value of colorectal cancer detection, Positive predictive value of colorectal cancer detection, 180 days|Negative predictive value of colorectal cancer detection, Negative predictive value of colorectal cancer detection, 180 days|Sensitivity and specificity of advanced adenoma detection, Sensitivity and specificity of advanced adenoma detection, 180 days
The project uses fecal hemoglobin and transferrin dual-index combined with reagents that can be self-tested at home (referred to as fecal protein dual-index detection reagents), combined with colorectal cancer risk factor questionnaires, to carry out colorectal cancer screening in people of specific ages in the city, aiming to achieve early screening, early diagnosis and early treatment, and evaluate the effect of fecal protein dual-index detection reagents in early screening of colorectal cancer, so as to provide a scientific basis for optimizing the national screening program.
