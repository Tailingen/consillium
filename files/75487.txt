Research on Nutritional Risk Indexes and Inflammatory Indicators in Postoperative Complications and Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Patients
The goal of this observational study is to explore the influence and predictive significance of nutritional risk indicators and inflammatory indicators on postoperative complications and prognosis of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The main question it aims to answer is:

Can preoperative nutritional risk and inflammatory indexes predict postoperative complications? Do preoperative nutritional risk and inflammatory indexes better predict the prognosis of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer? Which index is the best predictor of postoperative complications or prognosis for patients?
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
Postoperative Complications, Surgical complications within 30 days after comprehensive staging or cytoreductive surgery recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system, Within 30 days after surgery|Progression-free survival, Interval between first diagnosis and first recurrence, death, or last follow-up, From the date the patient diagnosed with primary ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer to the date of disease progression or death or last follow-up, whichever occurred first, assessed up to 100 months.|Overall survival, Interval between first diagnosis and death, or last follow-up, From the date the patient diagnosed with primary ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer to the date of death or last follow-up, whichever occurred first, assessed up to 100 months.
