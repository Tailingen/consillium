Compression Bandages in Upper Limb Lymphedema
Despite different types of bandages are using in the lymphedema treatment, numerous of them have not been directly compared. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of five different kinds of bandages on limb volume and lymphedema-related symptoms. It was also measured as secondary variables the comfort of the bandage related by the participants and the directly cost of each kind of bandage during the treatment.

DEVICE: Multilayer bandage|DEVICE: Double compression bandage|DEVICE: Cohesive bandage|DEVICE: Adhesive compression bandage|DEVICE: Kinesiotaping bandage|OTHER: Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) + Intermittent Pneumatic Compression|OTHER: Upper limb exercises|BEHAVIORAL: Educational strategy
Change in arm volume, To assess the volume of the limb it will be used the circumference measurement. The assessment will be with the subject in upright position with the arm placed on a table, the forearm relaxed on the table, the shoulder in a neutral rotation, a flexion of 45ยบ of the elbow, and forearms in supine position. The reference will be the elbow fold where was measure the circumference of the limb in 5cm intervals. The circumference measurements will be converted into volume values with the truncated cone formula in each 5 centimeters long., 3 assessments to evaluate changes: at baseline (before intervention), after intervention (1 month from baseline) and 6 months after intervention|Change in heath related quality of life lymphedema, It will be assessed by Lymphedema specific PRO instrument: Upper Limb Lymphedema (ULL)27 spanish validated version, 3 assessments to evaluate changes: at baseline (before intervention), after intervention (1 month from baseline) and 6 months after intervention
Change in comfort of the bandage, Numeric scale ranging from 0-10: 0 comfortable - 10: very uncomfortable, 3 assessments to evaluate changes: at baseline (before intervention), after intervention (1 month from baseline) and 6 months after intervention
