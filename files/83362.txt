Venetoclax-Dexamethasone in Relapsed and/or Refractory t(11;14) Amyloidosis
The purpose of this study is assess safety, safest dose, and effectiveness of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone in participants with t(11;14) positive relapsed (comes back) or refractory (did not get better) light chain amyloidosis.
AL Amyloidosis
DRUG: Venetoclax Oral Tablet, 200 mg|DEVICE: FISH assay|DRUG: Venetoclax Oral Tablet, 400 mg|DRUG: Dexamethasone Oral, 10 mg|DRUG: Dexamethasone Oral, 20 mg|DRUG: Daratumumab Injection|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Ixazomib|DRUG: Venetoclax MTD with Dexamethasone
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) (Phase 1), The number of participants with dose limiting toxicities for each treatment dose will be used to determine the MTD. Dose limiting toxicity defined as grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 5 days, any grade febrile neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, other therapy related non-hematologic toxicity of grade 2 or higher that requires discontinuation of therapy, clinical tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), laboratory TLS if the metabolic abnormalities are considered clinically significant by the investigator. All other grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) will be considered as DLTs with a few exceptions., Up to 6 cycles (approximately 6 months)|Hematologic ≥ Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) Rate (Phase 2), Hematologic ≥VGPR rate defined as proportion of participants achieving VGPR, low serum differential free light chain concentration (dFLC) partial response (PR), or a complete (CR).

VGPR is defined as the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) \[dFLC\] \< 40 mg/L. Low dFLC PR is defined as achieving a dFLC\<10 mg/L, low dFLC PR will be considered as a deep hematologic response and included in the ≥VGPR category). CR is defined as negative serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis along with a serum free light chain ratio that lies within the normal range or skewed towards the non-amyloid forming light chain, as per institutional laboratory values, Up to 6 cycles (approximately 6 months)
Overall Organ Response Rate (ORR) (Phase 2), ORR defined as proportion of evaluable participants achieving organ response in each involved organ, Up to 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Phase 2), PFS defined as time from the date of enrollment to hematologic progression or death, whichever is earlier, Up to 1 year|Overall Hematologic Response Rate (HRR) (Phase 2), HRR defined as proportion of patients achieving partial response (PR) or better, Up to 1 year|Duration of Hematologic Response (DOHR) (Phase 2), DOHR defined as time from the date of first documentation of hematologic response to the date of first documented hematologic disease progression, Up to 1 year|Time to hematologic ≥VGPR (Phase 2), Time to hematologic ≥VGPR defined as time from the first dose of study treatment to achievement of deep hematologic response (VGPR, low dFLC PR, or a CR), Up to 1 year|Time to next treatment (TTNT) (Phase 2), TTNT defined as time from the date of enrollment to initiation of a subsequent line of therapy, Up to 1 year|Major Organ Deterioration-Progression Free Survival (MOD-PFS) (Phase 2), MOD-PFS defined as time from the date of enrollment to one of the following events (whichever occurs first): death, clinical manifestation of cardiac/renal failure, or development of hematologic progression of disease, Up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS) (Phase 2), OS defined as the time from the date of enrollment to death from any cause, Up to 1 year|Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (Phase 2), PROs defined as longitudinal score of "Physical Functioning" domain of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Profile v2.0 The Physical Functioning domain contains four items with a 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty) numeric rating., Start of each cycle (Day 1 of each 28 day cycle) and Follow-up (every 8 weeks for up to 1 year)
This study is a phase 1/2 study of venetoclax-dexamethasone combination therapy in relapsed/refractory t(11;14) systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) amyloidosis. The phase 1 is a dose escalation designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of venetoclax in combination with low-dose weekly dexamethasone. There will be four candidate-dosing cohorts of venetoclax with or without dexamethasone in the Phase I dose-escalation. Dose escalation will be guided by the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design with accelerated titration up to a total sample size of 15 participants.

The phase 2 portion is a randomized open-label study comparing the MTD or RP2D of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone versus investigator's choice (daratumumab, pomalidomide, bendamustine, or ixazomib (with or without dexamethasone).
