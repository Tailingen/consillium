Predictors of Acute and Persistent Postoperative Pain in Lung Cancer Surgery
The aim of this observational study is to investigate if preoperative quantitative sensory testing, anxiety and depression symptoms, and biological markers are associated with the risk of developing acute and chronic postoperative pain after video-assisted Thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Preoperative test
Numerical Rating Scale, Pain intensity on a Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 indicating no pain to 10 indicating worst pain imaginable during the first two postoperative days., 48 hours postoperative|Numerical Rating Scale, Pain intensity on a Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 indicating no pain to 10 indicating worst pain imaginable at follow up. Collected using the Brief Pain Index, 365 days postoperative
Total equipotent opioid dose, 48 hours postoperative, Total equipotent opioid dose in milligrams during the first 48 hours after surgery.|Time to first administration of opioid, 48 hours postoperative, Time in hours to first postoperative administration of Pro Re Nata (PRN) opioids|Mobilisation, Time in hours to full mobilisation defined as walking with or without aids., 48 hours postoperative|Patient-reported satisfaction of postoperative pain management assessed by self-made questionnaire in Danish, Patients are asked to fill out a questionnaire rating their general satisfaction with pain management and sufficiency of pain treatment on a scale from 0 to 10. The questionnaire also assess whether the patients had any perceived side effects and how uncomfortable they were on a scale from 0 to 10., Measured twice. Once 48 hours after surgery or at non fixed time(on average 4 days and a maximum of 3 months) as well as at 365 days
Examination of the level of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, TNFa, etc.) and circulation microRNA, Change in expression of microRNA and Inflammatory mediators from before surgery until two days after surgery, 48 hours postoperative
This observational study examine acute and chronic postoperative pain in patients undergoing VATS. In the study preoperative biomarkers, quantitative sensory testing and questionnaires are used to create prediction models for acute and chronic postoperative pain. The study will serve as background information on the risk factors and predictive factors as well as an exploration of the impact of surgical stress from VATS on circulation microRNA and inflammatory mediators.
