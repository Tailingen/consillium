An Efficacy and Safety Study of MORAb-003 in Platinum-Resistant or Refractory Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
The study is being conducted to find out if paclitaxel works better when given together with an experimental drug called MORAb-003 (farletuzumab) or alone in patients with platinum-resistant or refractory relapsed ovarian cancer
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: MORAb-003 (farletuzumab)|DRUG: 0.9% Saline|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of the first observation of progression as determined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or death regardless of cause. If progression or death was not observed, the PFS time was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment without evidence of progression before the date of initiation of further antitumor treatment, or the cutoff date (whichever was earlier)., Date of Randomization to date of disease progression or death (whichever came first), assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death, whatever the cause. If death was not observed for a participant, the survival time was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive or the cutoff date, whichever was earlier., Date of Randomization to date of death, assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months
Best Overall Response, BOR was defined as the percentage of participants having either a confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) using modified RECIST criteria by independent radiologist review. RECIST criteria was adjusted based on current medical practices and on possible differences between ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. Tumor assessments performed up to the initiation of further antitumor treatment were considered. Target lesions selected for response assessment were measured using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans then graded according to the modified RECIST criteria, adjusted based on current medical practices and on possible differences between ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. Participants were assigned to one of the categories of change in disease state; CR, PR, progressive disease (PD), stable disease ( S)D, or not evaluable (NE)., Date of first study drug to disease progression/recurrence, assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months|Time to Tumor Response (TTR), TTR was derived for those participants with objective evidence of CR or PR, and was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the first documentation of object tumor response (TR). Analysis was based on the Kaplan-Meier estimated percentage of responders. This statistical analysis method measures the effect of study drug on tumor response over a period of time., Date of Randomization to the first documentation of objective TR, assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months
Progression Free Survival Based on Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG), Due to termination of the study, data were not collected and the outcome measure for PFS based on GCIG was not analyzed., Length of study|Serologic Response Rate, Due to termination of the study, data were not collected and the outcome measure for Serologic Response Rate was not analyzed., Length of study
Safety was assessed by the monitoring and recording of all adverse events (AEs), including drug hypersensitivity adverse events (DHAE), and serious adverse events (SAEs); clinical laboratory test (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); tolerability (discontinuations, treatment delays, dose reductions); physical examinations (including vital signs assessment); 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) obtained in triplicate and reviewed by independent blinded cardiologist, and Karnofsky's performance status.
