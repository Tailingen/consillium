Study to Explore the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of AMG 305 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to:

* Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 305 in adult participants
* Determine the optimal biologically active dose (OBD), at or below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with MTD 1 as the maximum tolerated starting dose and MTD 2 as the maximum tolerated target dose
* Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AMG 305
Percentage of Participants who Experience Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Day 1 to Day 28|Percentage of Participants who Experience Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment. TEAEs are any event that occurs after the participant has received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory tests, as assessed by the investigator, will also be reported as TEAEs., Up to a maximum of 2 years|Percentage of Participants who Experience Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Up to a maximum of 2 years
