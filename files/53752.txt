Triplet (FOLFOXIRI) vs. Doublet (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) Regimen as a 1st Line Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma
This is a prospective randomized phase II trial was done in clinical oncology department at Kasr Alainy hospital, Cairo university (NEMROCK) to evaluate the role of intensification of chemotherapy in the first line for treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma by adding third agent to standard doublet regimen on oncological outcomes \& assess tolerance to the intensified treatment
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOXIRI Protocol
Overall response rate (ORR), the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, 6 months ( from staring treatment till finishing 12 cycles, each cycle every 2 weeks)|Rate of adverse events, Adverse events (haematological \& non-haematological) were assessed before each cycle using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version (CTCAE) 5.0, 2017 with scale from (G0-5) for each event., During the study treatment period till 30 days following the end of therapy
Progression free survival (PFS), the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Documentation of disease progressive disease is defined as per RECIST 1.1 criteria based on investigator assessment, 18 months|Overall survival time (OS), Defined as the length of time from date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause or due to lost follow up, 18 months
Patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, with unresectable measurable metastatic disease, were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio.

Patients were assigned to receive FOLFOXIRI (experimental arm) or FOLFIRI or FOLFOX4 (control arm) biweekly up to 12 cycles.

Randomization was done by enclosed envelope method Evaluation of the patients for surgical resection of residual metastases was done every 12 weeks. In the case of secondary resection of metastases, patients completed with the same chemotherapy regimen received before resection up to 12 cycles Maintenance therapy with capecitabine for 6 months was administered for patients who achieved complete or partial tumor response. In case of disease progression, second line chemotherapy was then administered in both groups until tumor progression, the occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event, or patient refusal
