Evaluation of the Archimedesâ„¢ System for Transparenchymal Nodule Access 2
The Archimedes System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples in the lungs. This study is being conducted to confirm the performance of the Archimedes System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose highly suspicious lung cancer or metastatic disease. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor is conducted.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Archimedes System
Proportion of biopsies yielding tissue sufficient for diagnosis, The number of nodules with at least one biopsy sufficient for a definitive tissue diagnosis divided by the number of nodules sampled by the Archimedes System., Up to 1 year
Procedure planning time, The time from selecting the patient CT until the tunnel path has been selected, reviewed and exported, Up to 1 year|Nodule access time, The time from the start of navigation until the sheath has been placed at the first biopsy target., Up to 1 year|Fluoroscopy time, The total fluoroscopy time from the start of fused-fluoroscopic navigational guidance to the time the devices are removed from the point of entry., Up to 1 year|Patient registration time, The total time it takes to correlate the patient's position via fluoroscopy with the navigational guidance system., Up to 1 year
