A Trial of SHR1701 Combined With Radiotherapy for Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Failure After First-line Treatment
This study is a single center, single arm, open study design. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and efficacy of SHR1701 with synchronous radiotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed after systematic treatment. Large fraction radiotherapy is given to all lesions as much as possible, and low-dose radiotherapy is given to the lesions that cannot be tolerated or have no obvious benefit.
