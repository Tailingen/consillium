Prognostic Impact of Surgical Resection Extent for Supratentorial High Grade Gliomas.
Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials (single arm study) of surgical treatment modalities for supratentorial high grade gliomas within the next two years.
Supratentorial Glioblastoma
PROCEDURE: Supratentorial high grade gliomas resection.
Clinical picture using Modified Rankin's Scale (mRS)., The changes in clinical condition of the patients will be assessed using Modified Rankin's Scale (mRS) before and after treatment.

The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. 0 - No symptoms.

1. - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
2. - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
3. - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
4. - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
5. - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
6. - Dead., 1 year
Recurrence or increased residual, Recurrence of the tumor, within 3 months after treatment
Supratentorial high grade gliomas are for surgical resection in any case according to many factors.

Investigators will compare the outcomes/survival rate and clinical outcome of the different resection types (Total, near total, subtotal/debulking) of supratentorial high grade gliomas according to the clinical condition and comorbidities of the patient, the location and morphology of the lesion, the grading of lesions, and the clinical experience of the neurosurgeon.
