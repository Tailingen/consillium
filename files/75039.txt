NWRD06 DNA Plasmid for HCC After Radical Resection
This is a dose escalation Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Glypican3 (GPC3)-targeted DNA plasmid vaccine (NWRD06) in patients with GPC3-positive primary hepatocellular carcinoma after radical resection.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: 1mg NWRD06 administered by electroporation|BIOLOGICAL: 4mg NWRD06 administered by electroporation|BIOLOGICAL: 8mg NWRD06 administered by electroporation
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), It would be determined based on the rate and severity grade of events or abnormalities through evaluating systemic or local adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs that is definitely, probably, or possibly related to the test drug occurring within 28 days of the last dosing will be classified as DLT during dosing climb., From first administration of NWRD06 to 28 days after the last administration|All adverse events (AE), All adverse events (AE) will be determined based on the rate and severity grade of events, including incidence and severity of serious adverse events (SAE) (according to NCI-CTCAE Standard version 5.0 of common Terms for Adverse Events), 12 weeks
Immunogenicity, GPC3 specific immune response in peripheral blood, At week 0, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 10, week 12 and then collected every 12 weeks until disease progression or specific immune response became undetectable or the study was withdrawn for various reasons or ended (whichever occurred first).
This study is divided into three dose groups:1mg, 4mg, and 8mg. Each patient will be administered NWRD06 by electroporation in entire study period. The Maximum tolerated dose of NWRD06 will be determined by the classical 3+3 dose escalation schedule. The number of patients will be ranged from 9 to 18.

After the completion of treatment, the subjects shall continue to receive safety follow-up until 28 days after the last administration.

Immunologic reactogenicity in blood samples was assessed at week 0, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 10, week 12.

Peripheral blood samples were then collected every 3 months for immunogenicity assessment until disease progression or specific immune response became undetectable or the study was withdrawn for various reasons or ended (whichever occurred first).
