SVV-001 With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Patients With Poorly Differentiated Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC) or Well-Differentiated High-Grade Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET)
The purpose of this study is to determine:

1. The highest dose of the trial intervention that targets neuroendocrine tumors and is tolerated by patients.
2. The highest frequency of dosing of the trial intervention that targets neuroendocrine tumors and is tolerated by patients.
3. The highest dose and frequency of dosing of the trial intervention that targets neuroendocrine tumors with at least the same degree of effectiveness and tolerability as currently available (standard of care) treatments for patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

BIOLOGICAL: Seneca Valley Virus-001 (SVV-001)|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose, MTD is defined as the highest dose of SVV-001 evaluated for which estimated toxicity rate is the closest to the target toxicity rate as assessed by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The MTD will be established as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)., Up to 12 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs): Part 1 Only, The number of participants experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Part 1 will be reported. DLTs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 12 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The number of participants experiencing treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) after starting study therapy will be reported. SAEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 12 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs), The number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events after starting study therapy will be reported. AEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 12 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Measured by RECIST, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) among study participants will be reported. PFS will be assessed in months (6 and 12 months) from start of treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Up to 12 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Measured by iRECIST, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) among study participants will be reported. PFS will be assessed in months (6 and 12 months) from start of treatment according to immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST)., Up to 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Measured by RECIST, ORR is defined as percentage of evaluable patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as best responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Up to 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Measured by iRECIST, ORR is defined as percentage of evaluable patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as best responses according to immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST)., Up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of overall response is defined as time in months from date of onset of response (the first documentation of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) to the date of first disease progression after initiation to study therapy., Up to 2 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Measured by RECIST, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as percentage of evaluable patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as best response, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Up to 12 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Measured by iRECIST, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as percentage of evaluable patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as best response, according to immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST)., Up to 12 months
