Evaluation of PreveCol's Efficiency As a Second Line Method for the Early Colorectal Cancer Detection
The objective of this low-risk interventional study is to evaluate whether the PreveCol® test has sufficient efficiency to be considered as a second-line method for the detection of both colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas when used prospectively in the screening population with a previous positive FOBT result, which could include any of the following: both sexes, age 50-69 years, asympthomatic volunteers. The main aims to be answered are:

* Values of efficacy, efficiency, impact and safety of PreveCol.
* Values of preferences of participants for screening methods.
* Values of PREMs into screening programme.

Participants will provide a blood sample prior to a screening colonoscopy, and complete two questionnaires. They will give their sample, information and clinical data to the investigator or health care personnel.
