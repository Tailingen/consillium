Iron Prehabilitation in Endometrial Cancer
Endometrial cancer patients often have iron deficiency anemia before surgery, which can be effectively treated with oral iron supplementation. Anemia and blood transfusions have been previously associated with perioperative infectious diseases. In the present study the investigators will evaluate the impact of perioperative iron supplementation on the incidence of perioperative infections.

Number of participants with surgical site infection, Participants will be followed-up to determine the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection, Postoperatively (up to 30 days)|Required blood transfusions per participant and aggregated mean differences, The number of perioperative (intraoperative and postoperative) blood transfusions per patient will be monitored and compared among the two groups., Perioperatively (up to 10 days)
Number of participants with other postoperative infections, Participants will be followed-up to determine the incidence of other postoperative infectious morbidity (other than surgical site infection), Postoperatively (up to 30 days)|Duration of hospitalization per participant, The duration of hospitalization per participant will be monitored., Postoperatively (until patient exit) up to 30 days|Onset of adjuvant treatment per participant, The interval between surgery and adjuvant treatment will be monitored., Postoperatively up to 24 weeks|Survival rates of included participants, Patients will be screened for recurrence of disease and their survival status will be screened at 3 years, Postoperatively (at 3 years postoperatively)
Prehabilitation has a multimodal conception based on three fundamental pillars: improvement of the patient's physical condition, nutritional optimization and other measures such as smoking cessation and correction of anemia.

As in the case of multimodal rehabilitation protocols, the actions of prehabilitation programs have synergistic effects, that is, small changes that, by themselves, do not have clinical significance but when added up, they produce a significant improvement in the postoperative evolution of patients.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are considered to be the most common nosocomial infections among surgical patients and constitute a heavy and potentially preventable economic burden on health care providers. Although the impact of blood transfusion on the risk of SSI remains controversial, several studies have shown that anemia and transfusion predispose to postoperative bacterial infections.

In the present study the investigators seek to evaluate the impact of per os iron prehabilitation on perioperative outcomes of endometrial cancer patients, including need for transfusion and infectious morbidity.
