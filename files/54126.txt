Study of Tirabrutinib (ONO-4059) in Patients With Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PROSPECT Study)
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of tirabrutinib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory PCNSL (Part A), and tirabrutinib in combination with one of two different high dose methotrexate based regimens (methotrexate/ temozolomide/rituximab or rituximab/methotrexate/procarbazine/ vincristine) as first line therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, treatment naïve PCNSL (Part B)

Overall response rate (ORR) (Part A), Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete response (CR), Complete response - unconfirmed (CRu), or (=partial response (PR) as determined by an independent review committee according to the International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria., 1 year|Tirabrutinib dose estimate (Part B), Estimate of tirabrutinib dose in combination with each backbone induction regimen (MTR and R-MPV) based upon treatment related AEs, SAEs, and toxicities observed during the initial cycle of induction therapy in the dose-ranging phase, 1 month|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) during induction (Part B), Adverse events at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v5.0 used as a guide for the grading of severity., 4 months|Complete response rate (CRR) (Part B), Complete response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or CRu as determined by an independent review committee according to the IPCG criteria., 4 months
Duration of response (DOR) (Part A and B), Duration of response is defined as the time between the date of first response (CR, CRu, or PR) and the date of the first PD according to the IPCG criteria, or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Time to response (TTR) (Part A and B), Time to response is defined as the time between the date of first administration of tirabrutinib and the date of first response (CR, CRu, or PR) as determined by IRC according to the IPCG criteria., 1 year|Best overall response (BOR) (Part A and B), Best overall response based on independent review committee (IRC) response determination is defined as the best response and is derived programmatically based upon the visit responses determined by IRC from the date of administration of tirabrutinib to the date of PD as determined by IRC or the date of initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy for PCNSL, whichever occurs first., 1 year|Change in corticosteroid dose (Part A), Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the actual corticosteroid dose and the change from baseline at each assessment point., 2 years|Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs (Part A and B), Adverse events at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v5.0 used as a guide for the grading of severity., 2 years|Laboratory abnormality profile of tirabrutinib as measured by incidence and severity of clinical laboratory abnormalities (Part A and B), Results of laboratory tests, 2 years|ECG parameters by 12 lead ECG (Part A and B), Heart rate, RR and QT intervals, QTc (QTcF, QTcB), PR interval, and QRS width., 2 years|PK parameters (Cmax) of tirabrutinib in the plasma (Part A and B), 29 days|PK parameters (Tmax) of tirabrutinib in the plasma (Part A and B), 29 days|PK parameters (AUC) of tirabrutinib in the plasma (Part A and B), 29 days
