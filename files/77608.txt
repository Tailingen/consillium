A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of IGIV-C in Symptomatic Subjects With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
The primary objective is to evaluate whether IGIV-C improves MG symptoms as compared to placebo in subjects with MG.
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
DRUG: IGIV-C|DRUG: Placebo
Improvement in Myasthenia Gravis (MG) Symptoms as Measured by the Mean Change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Total Score., To measure improvement in MG symptoms by the mean change in QMG total score from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 as compared to placebo. Evaluators score 13 individual items (range from 0=best to 3=worst) and the individual scores are added together for the total score (range 0-39). An average 3-point improvement in QMG score indicates clinically meaningful improvement., Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of IGIV-C in subjects with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) on standard of care treatment at study entry in terms of improvement in MG symptoms as measured by the mean change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 24 as compared to placebo.

The safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IGIV-C loading dose of 2 g/kg followed by 7 maintenance dosages of 1 g/kg every 3 weeks through Week 21 in subjects with MG.
