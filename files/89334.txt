Binaural Sound for Remimazolam Maintenance
It is important to decrease the remifentanil dose for general anesthesia maintenance when using remimazolam. We will evaluate the effect of binaural sound on general anesthesia maintenance with remimazolam infusion.
General Anesthesia|Prostate Cancer Stage|Uterine Myoma
PROCEDURE: Binaural sound
Intraoperative remifentanil dose, Intraoperative remifentanil dose will be measured at anesthesia day 0., At anesthesia day 0
Intraoperative remimazolam dose, Intraoperative remimazolam dose will be measured at anesthesia day 0., At anesthesia day 0|Pain score (0:no pain, 10:maximal pain), Pain score (0:no pain, 10:maximal pain) will be measured at anesthesia day 0 and 1., At anesthesia day 0 and 1|Electroencephalography, The relative power of alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and theta band in electroencephalography will be measured at anesthesia day 0., At anesthesia day 0
