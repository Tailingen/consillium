The Efficacy and Safety of the COMBO Endoscopy Oropharyngeal Airway in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Procedure
Hypoxia represents the prevailing adverse occurrence during the sedation of patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol. A recent innovation in this domain is the COMBO Endoscopy Oropharyngeal Airway-a multifaceted device that encompasses capnography monitoring, bite block , oxygenation support, and oropharyngeal airway management. This device has been purposefully designed to cater to the unique requirements of endoscopic procedures. The principal objective of our randomized study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the COMBO Endoscopy Oropharyngeal Airway reduce the incidence of hypoxia on patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol sedation.

The incidence of hypoxia, (75% ≤ SpO2 \< 90% for \<60 s), Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
The incidence of sub-clinical respiratory depression, (90% ≤ SpO2 \< 95%), Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours|The incidence of severe hypoxia, (SpO2 \< 75% or 75% ≤ SpO2 \< 90% for ≥60 s), Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
The incidence of other adverse events, Other adverse events recorded by tools proposed by the World Society of Intravenous Anesthesia International Sedation Task Force, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
