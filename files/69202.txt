A Study to Evaluate Zilovertamab Vedotin (MK-2140) for Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) (MK-2140-004)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate zilovertamab vedotin with respect to objective response rate and duration of response per Lugano Response Criteria as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated in this Phase 2, single arm, interventional study.
Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: MK-2140 (zilovertamab vedotin)|BIOLOGICAL: MK-2140 (zilovertamab vedotin)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Lugano Response Criteria, ORR is percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR by cohort, relapsed or refractory (rr) DLBCL as assessed by BICR according to Lugano Response Criteria 2014 in participants treated with zilovertamab vedotin Q3W. CR is the complete radiologic response. PR is a partial response, \>=50% decrease in sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions for up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites., Up to approximately 50 months
Duration of Response (DOR) per Lugano Response Criteria, Duration of Response (DOR) is time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 50 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to approximately 50 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 50 months
