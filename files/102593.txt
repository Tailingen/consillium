A Study to Evaluate Impact of Ibrutinib on the Quality of Life (QOL) in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of Ibrutinib monotherapy in the QoL of subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) based in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and FACIT- fatigue questionnaires assessment from baseline to 1 year of treatment in Argentinian routine clinical practice.
CLL
OTHER: Standard of Care
Change From Baseline, The FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy) fatigue scale is a self-assessment questionnaire with a 7-day recall period and 13 items evaluating fatigue and its impact on daily life activities. Fatigue is scored 0-52. 0= severe fatigue; 52= no fatigue.

Number of patients with an improvement of at least 3 points in FACIT score (Minimally Important Difference).

This study is assessing a Change from Baseline Fatigue at 6 months., 6 months
Health-Related Quality of Life as Measured by European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions; 5 Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and as overall health using a "thermometer" visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).

Number of patients with improvements in the EQ5D domains by analyzing the variation in each domain and index during follow-up at different time points., At 0,1,3,6,12 months
Number of patients with Clinically Significant Change in hemoglobin, Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Change in hemoglobin will be determined, At 0,1,3,6,12 months
The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of Ibrutinib monotherapy in the QoL of subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) based in European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and FACIT- fatigue questionnaires assessment from baseline to 1 year of treatment in Argentinian routine clinical practice.
