Liver Function Tests, The figures present the number of participants who had abnormal (defined as above upper limit of normal range (ULN)) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and bilirubin levels plus the number of participants who had ALT increases \>3x ULN and ALT increases \>3x ULN with concurrently increased bilirubin \>1.5 ULN., 3 years|Participants With Markedly Abnormal Change in Vital Signs and Body Weight, Vital signs and body weight included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight at the end of trial as compared to baseline. The table presents the number of participants in each group with normal baseline and markedly abnormal value post-baseline., 3 years
The data include participants from both the main study (FE200486 CS06; NCT00117949) and the extension study FE200486 CS06A.
