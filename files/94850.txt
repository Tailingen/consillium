Risk-adapted Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Early Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using the VERO Stereotactic Body Radio Therapy System
The purpose of this study is to perform prospective data analysis on tumor response in terms of local tumor control after 2 years, potential acute and late toxicity and survival in patients with non-metastatic, non-small-cell lung cancer treated by radiotherapy that are medically inoperable due to coexisting comorbidities or that refuse surgery. SBRT regimens used will be 4 fractions of 12 Gy or 3 fractions of 17 Gy depending on tumor location in a risk-adapted approach.
Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiotherapy (Fractionated stereotactic body radiation)
Toxicity of grade 3+ as assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.0, To monitor potential toxicity in patients with stage T1,T2,T3 N0 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with primary stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), From start of SBRT until 1 year. After 1 year until end of follow-up for late toxicity
Time to local progression, Overall survival, local progression free survival, disease free survival, time from start of SBRT to death, local, regional or disseminated recurrence., every 3 months for the first 2 years. From 3 to 5 years every 6 months. After From start of SBRT until date of death, regional fialure of last follow-up. Aanalysis occurs when all patients have been potentially followed for 24 months.
Quality of life, Quality of life, baseline at inclusion, at 1 month-, 3 months- and 12 months from start SBRT
