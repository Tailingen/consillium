A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Dose Escalation, Safety and Tolerability Study of INCB050465 and Itacitinib in Subjects With Previously Treated B-Cell Malignancies (CITADEL-101)
Open-label, dose-escalation study in subjects with previously treated B-cell malignancies to find maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or pharmacologic active dose of a PI3Kδ inhibitor, parsaclisib, as monotherapy and in combination with: itacitinib (INCB039110), a JAK1 inhibitor; rituximab; and rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. Parsaclisib inhibits PI3Kδ, a protein involved in growth and survival of B-cell cancer cells.

Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after a participant provides informed consent. Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (e.g., hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s). A TEAE is defined as an event that was reported for the first time, or the worsening of a pre-existing event, after the first dose of study drug., Up to approximately 53 months (4.4 years)
