Extranodal NK T Cell Lymphoma|NK-Cell Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CD56 CAR T
Overall response rate (ORR), CR+PR.1.Leukemia:Complete Response (CR):Bone marrow blast cells \<5%; primitive cells without Auer bodies; without extramedullary leukemia;Absolute blood neutrophil count was\> 1.0\*10\^9 / L (1000 / μ L);Platelet count\> 100\*10\^9 / L (100 000 / μ L);Not dependent on RBC infusion.Partial Response (PR):Only for Phase I and II clinical trials;Bone marrow cells were reduced to 5 - 25% and at least 50% compared with before treatment;Hematological parameters met the same criteria for CR. 2.Lymphoma:CR:All the evidence of the lesions disappeared.PR:The lymph nodes shrank with no new lesions., From 1 month to 1 year.|progression-free survival (PFS), The time between treatment and observation of disease progression or death from any cause., From 1 month to 1 year.|overall survival (OS), The time from the start of treatment to death from any cause., From 1 month to 1 year.|event-free survival (EFS), The time between the start of treatment and the occurrence of any event, including disease recurrence, death, and so on., From 1 month to 1 year.|Safety evaluation index, 1. Detection of CRS-related factors: such as IFN, IL-6, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, CRP, etc;2. Testing of various laboratory items: blood routine, coagulation function, blood film observation, liver function, renal work, electrolytes, blood glucose, cardiac enzymes, blood cells, T cell subsets, immunoglobulins, etc;3.Adverse events and serious adverse events were observed., From 1 month to 1 year.
CAR T cell index of correlation, The presence of peripheral blood and bone marrow CAR-T cells were measured regularly by using flow cytometry, quantitative PCR techniques., From 1 month to 1 year.
Extranodal NK/TCL is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of less than 50%. In the absence of effective treatment, median survival for advanced disease is only 6-12 months. A retrospective review of the International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Project recently reported that the median overall survival of NK/TCL was 7.8 months, corresponding to the worst survival of all T-cell lymphoma entities. Therefore, despite good results in the combination of chemoracal-chemotherapy strategies, autologous bone marrow transplantation, and L-asparagase in the treatment of recurrent cases, NK/TCL remains difficult to cure, and the need for alternative therapeutic strategies has prompted researchers to explore new molecular targets.

Nerve cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM-1) -CD56 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is a biomarker of nerve cell adhesion molecule and NK cell. CD56 is highly expressed in NK/T cell lymphomas, skeletal muscle tumors, and malignancies with neurological or neuroendocrine differentiation. CD56-CAR T cells can kill CD56+ neuroblastoma, glioma, and SCLC tumor cells in vitro coculture, and CD56R-CAR+T cells can inhibit tumor growth in vivo when tested against CD56+ human neuroblastoma xenogeneic and SCLC models. CD56-CAR T cells have also been reported as a safe and effective treatment for refractory/relapsing rhabdomyosarcoma. This indicates that CD56 CAR has a wide clinical application prospect and strong potential therapeutic value as a new CAR T target.

CD56 CAR T cells constructed by our laboratory can produce more precise killing effect on tumor cells by converting the immune checkpoint PD-1 signal. The results showed that CD56 CAR T cells could be prepared effectively and kill NK/ T-cell lymphoma cell line SNK-6 in vitro. Compared with traditional second-generation CAR T cells, CD56-CAR T cells prepared in our laboratory showed better killing effect on SNK-6 cells in vitro. At present, no clinical studies on CD56 CAR T therapy for NK/T cell lymphoma have been reported. Therefore, in this study, CD56 CAR T was used to treat relapsed and refractory NK/T cell lymphoma /NK cell leukemia to observe its safety and efficacy.
