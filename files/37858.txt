A Study Evaluating Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab Plus ADI-PEG 20 in Patients With Locally Advanced / Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To learn about the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and ADI-PEG 20 when given in combination to patients with locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer
Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: ADI-PEG 20
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

--To evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab + ADI-PEG 20 in Patients with Locally Advanced/ Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

Secondary Objectives:

--To assess the pathologic response rate including pathologic complete response (pCR) per RECIST and degree of necrosis (\>50% in tumor volume) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab + ADI-PEG 20 in treatment-na√Øve locally advanced or metastatic HCC.

Exploratory Objectives:

--To assess the immunological/biomarker changes (pre- vs. post-treatment) in tumor tissues and peripheral blood in response to atezolizumab and bevacizumab + ADI-PEG 20 in HCC therapy and explore any potential association between these biomarker measures and antitumor response.
