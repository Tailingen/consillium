Multimodal Assesment of Acute Cardiac Toxicity Induced by Thoracic Radiotherapy in Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the changes by two modalities: Imaging by Strain by Speckle Tracking and Magnetic Resonance versus soluble markers of cardiac dysfunction as early predictors of cardio-toxicity in cancer patients receiving low or high doses of radiotherapy.
