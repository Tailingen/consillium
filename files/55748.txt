CD19/22 CAR T Cells (AUTO3) for the Treatment of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO3, a CAR T cell treatment targeting CD19 and CD22 followed by limited duration of anti-PD1 antibody in patients with DLBCL
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|DLBCL
BIOLOGICAL: AUTO3
Phase I Escalation - Safety (incidence of Grade 3-5 toxicities) and identification of recommended Phase II dose and schedule., Within 75 days of AUTO3 infusion|Phase I Expansion - Safety (incidence of Grade 3-5 toxicities) in the outpatient / ambulatory care setting, Within 75 days of AUTO3 infusion|Phase II - Overall response rate as per Lugano criteria, Up to 2 years
Feasibility of generating AUTO3: number of patients' cells successfully manufactured as a proportion of the number of patients undergoing leukapheresis., Up to 8 weeks post leukapheresis.|Complete response rate, as per Lugano criteria., Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DOR)., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS)., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS)., Up to 2 years
The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation and expansion phase, and a Phase II. Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled in both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product AUTO3 which is a CD19 and CD22 dual targeting CAR T cell product. Following pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO 3 intravenously as a single dose and in addition a limited duration of treatment with an anti-PD1 antibody (either as part of the pre-conditioning regimen or consolidation). Patients will then enter a 36-month follow-up period.
