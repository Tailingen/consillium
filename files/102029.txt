A Study of PF-08046049/SGN-BB228 in Advanced Melanoma and Other Solid Tumors
This study will test the safety of a drug called PF-08046049/SGN-BB228 in participants with melanoma and other solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread through the body. It will also study the side effects of this drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.

This study will have 3 parts. Parts A and B of the study will find out how much PF-08046049/SGN-BB228 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046049/SGN-BB228 is safe and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.
