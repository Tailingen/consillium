Proximal Molecular Effects of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This pilot study seeks to evaluate the feasibility of measuring the proximal effects of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on the expression of potential therapeutic target molecules in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Specifically, this study proposes to evaluate the extent to which CRT induces the differential expression of components along two critical, and potentially interdependent, molecular pathways: the arachidonic acid and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways.
