Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab Biosimilar (Herzuma®) Plus Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) in Patients With HER-2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy has been approved as the first line therapy in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. When patients experienced progression beyond trastuzumab containing therapy, T-DM1 is considered as the second line therapy followed by trastuzumab plus any other chemotherapeutic agents or lapatinib plus capecitabine.

A biosimilar drug is a biological product that is highly similar to a licensed biological product, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, or potency. Several trastuzumab biosimilar products have been approved after efficacy and safety studies which were usually as the first line setting with taxane combined.

Even though trastuzumab biosimilar drugs demonstrated similarity of equivalence with trastuzumab in these studies, the efficacy of their second use beyond progression with other chemotherapeutic agents has not been tested yet. In addition, the investigators don't have any data regarding possible cross reactivity between trastuzumab and trastuzumab biosimilar drugs.

In this study, the investigators plan multicenter phase II clinical trial to test the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of trastuzumab biosimilar, Herzuma® in combination with TPC in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer who progressed after 2 or more HER-2 directed chemotherapy.
