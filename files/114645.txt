A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Elix Cycle Balance and Daily Harmony on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
This is a virtual, open-label, 2-armed study that will last 6 months. All participants will take the supplements daily and complete questionnaires at baseline and at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (study may be concluded at week 20 if results are seen earlier). The study will involve 70 participants with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), 35 who are on hormonal birth control, and 35 who are not.

A subgroup of 20 participants from the non-birth control group, who experience hormonal acne/frequent hormonal breakouts will provide photographs of the face for expert skin grading at baseline, week 12, week 20, and week 24 (if the study is continued until week 24).

Questionnaires will be used to monitor changes in the menstrual cycle (regularity, frequency, predictability), bloating, fluid retention, weight gain, mood (mood swings, anxiety, mental clarity/focus, brain fog), pain, fatigue, acne, facial/bodily hair, and sleep quality. Expert skin grading will be carried out by a dermatologist to monitor changes in acne and skin clarity indicative of systemic effects of androgen excess. Likert scale responses will be statistically compared from baseline to each check-in. Participant responses on product feedback will be presented as % scores.
