Microtransplantation Versus Auto-SCT in ≥PR Multiple Myeloma Patients
Comparison of the efficacy and safety of microtransplantation and autologous transplantation in the treatment of ≥PR multiple myeloma patients, 2-year PFS and OS were also been observed. To identify the role of microtransplantation in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
Microtransplantation|Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation|Multiple Myeloma in Relapse
PROCEDURE: stem cell transplantation
progression-free survival, 2 years|overall survival, 2 years
rate of complete remission, 2 year|minimal residual disease, 2 year|hematopoietic recovery, 3 month|infection, 3 month|GVHD, 1 year|relapse, 2 year
NDMM patients induction therapy with 4 cycles PCD/PAD regimen, achieve ≥PR, eligible for SCT, were randomly divided into two arms. One arm receive microtransplantation, and the other accept auto-SCT. Comparison of the efficacy and safety of two arms, 2-year PFS and OS were also been observed. Clear the above program related hematopoietic recovery, remission rate, infection and recurrence rate, survival rate and the formation of micro inlay, minimal residual disease and GVHD, etc. To identify the role of microtransplantation in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
