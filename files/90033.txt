Study About no Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Totally Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy
Laparoscopic gastrectomy has fewer infectious complications compared to open surgery. Recently, the incidence of postoperative infectious complications was greatly reduced due to the development of surgical techniques and improvement of prevention and control of surgical infection. Previous multicenter, phase II study (KSWEET-01) revealed that the incidence of infectious complications of laparoscopic gastrectomy without prophylactic antibiotics was not significantly higher than previously reported data.

Therefore, this study aim to prove the safety of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy without prophylactic antibiotics, specially reference to the postoperative infectious complications.
Gastric Cancer|Complication of Surgical Procedure
PROCEDURE: No use of antimicrobial prophylaxis|PROCEDURE: Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis
Incidence of surgical site infections within 30 days, The diagnosis of infectious complications is made according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surgical site infection diagnosis criteria according to physical or radiological findings., within 30 days after operation
Length of hospital stay, From date of operation until the date of hospital discharge, up to 6 months|Incidence of remote non-surgical site infections, Any postoperative infectious complications other than surgical site infections, within 30 days after operation
The purpose of this study was to investigate the non-inferiority of incidence of infectious complications in the experimental group that did not use prophylactic antibiotics compared to the control group using prophylactic antibiotics.

The primary endpoint is the incidence of surgical site infections within 30 days after surgery and the difference limit of the non-inferiority of the experimental group is assumed to be - 0.05 (5%). Assuming that the incidence of postoperative infectious complications in the control group is 5% and the incidence of infectious complications in the experimental group is assumed to be about 8%. It is assumed that the significant level is 5% and the power is at least 80%.

According to the above method, a total of 260 patients (130 patients in each group) are needed when 117 patients are needed in each group and about 10% of drop rates and protocol violence are considered.
