M108 Plus CAPOX Versus Placebo Plus CAPOX as First-line Treatment for Claudin (CLDN) 18.2-Positive, HER2-Negative, PD-L1 CPS<5, Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma.
Gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, which is one of the major leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, is a global challenge to human health. However, standard chemotherapy has limited efficacy in advanced gastric cancer, and there is an urgent need to explore and develop new therapeutic targets and combination therapy modalities. The main purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of M108 monoclonal antibody plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) versus placebo plus CAPOX as first-line treatment measured by progression free survival (PFS). This study will also evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and the immunogenicity profile of M108 monoclonal antibody, as well as its effects on quality of life.
Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric Cancer|Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: M108 monoclonal antibody|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression free survival (PFS), Compare PFS (Based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by Independent Review Committee (IRC)) of patients treated with M108 monoclonal antibody or placebo plus CAPOX., From date of randomization to the date of disease progression, death or end of study, assessed up to 24 months
Overall survival (OS), Compare OS (Based on RECIST 1.1 by IRC) of patients treated with M108 monoclonal antibody or placebo plus CAPOX., From date of randomization to the date of death or end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events (AEs), An AE is any adverse medical event that occurs during a clinical study, whether or not related with medicinal product, including signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory test results and diseases. The incidence and severity of AEs during the clinical study are recorded and analyzed., From date of randomization until 28+7 days after the last dose
The aim of this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is to explore the efficacy and safety of M108 monoclonal antibody plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for Claudin (CLDN) 18.2-Positive, HER2-Negative, PD-L1 CPS\<5, locally advanced or metastatic gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ration to receive M108 monoclonal antibody plus chemotherapy or placebo plus chemotherapy.
