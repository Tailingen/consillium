PSMA-PET/MRI Unfavorable-Risk Target Volume Pilot Study
The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility and toxicity of using prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) and multi-parametric magnetic resonance imagining (mpMRI) with PET-MR technology to define radiotherapy targets, while meeting all the current planning criteria.

Early Genitourinary Toxicity After Radiation, Grade 3+ late genitourinary toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity as classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, End of treatment to 1 year post-treatment
Late Genitourinary Toxicity After Radiation, Grade 3+ acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity will be defined according to CTCAE, version 5.0 during radiation therapy and at 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months post-radiotherapy. Additionally, this will be reported as a cumulative incidence over the entire 5-year course of the study., Baseline to 5 years post-treatment|Biochemical Control Using Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels, Biochemical control will be defined according to the Phoenix criteria (PSA rise of 2 ng/mL over nadir)., At 2 and 5 years after radiation therapy|Patient-reported Quality of Life Using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) and Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices (PCSI), Measuring patient-reported quality of life using EPIC-26 and PCSI prior to radiation therapy and over time in subjects with prostate cancer who have received PSMA-PET/MRI to define radiotherapy target volumes.

Patient-reported quality of life will be measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) and the Urinary Obstruction/Irritation scale of the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices (PCSI). Patient-reported quality of life will be measured before the start of radiation therapy., Baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months post radiotherapy|Screened Subjects, Measuring the proportion of screen subjects who are enrolled on the study, Through study completion|The Feasibility of Meeting Dose Constraints, The feasibility of meeting dose constraints will be defined as the proportion of subjects' radiotherapy treatment plan meets dose constraint criteria for PTV max, CTV, DIL, rectum, bladder, urethra, bowel, and penile bulb, as defined in the protocol., Baseline|Performance of PSMA-PET/MRI to PSMA PET/CT, Performance of PSMA-PET/MRI to PSMA PET/CT will be defined as the rate of identification and delineation (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) of the dominant intra-prostatic lesion in comparison to a gold standard of image-guided prostate biopsy. Rate of identification of positive pelvic nodes and Rate of identification of distant metastatic disease in the pelvis., Baseline|Rate of Identification of Positive Pelvic Nodes and Distant Metastatic Disease in the Pelvis, Rate of identification of positive pelvic nodes and distant metastatic disease in the pelvis will be defined using PSMA-PET/MRI to PSMA PET/CT images, Baseline
PSMA-PET is highly sensitive and specific for detecting prostate cancer. PSMA-PET and mpMRI can potentially help guide target volumes for patients with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer receiving radiation by designing a radiation treatment plan so that the entire prostate receives the prescribed dose of radiation in addition to the visible tumor in the prostate as detected by mpMRI and/or PSMA-PET receiving any inevitable intrinsic plan "hot spots" or areas of dose above the prescription.
