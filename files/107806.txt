Vibro-Acoustography Imaging in Diagnosing Breast Masses in Women With a Breast Mass or Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as vibro-acoustography imaging, may be an effective method of diagnosing breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vibro-acoustography imaging works in diagnosing breast masses in women with a breast mass or breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: breast imaging study
Detection and differentiation of breast masses with an estimated specificity of â‰¥ 70% using vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging, 25 minutes for Breast VA imaging
OBJECTIVES:

* To study in vivo detection of breast masses by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging.
* To evaluate the performance of VA imaging in differentiating between benign and malignant breast masses identified as BI-RADS 4 or 5.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo clinical mammography of the breast, followed by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging using ultrasonography over 90 minutes. Patients may also undergo further imaging using clinical ultrasonography.
