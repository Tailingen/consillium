Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is considered the gold standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, some studies show that age or comorbidities is the relevant predictor of postoperative complications, conditioning the safety of the surgical procedure itself, thus affect the survial. Even with the advances in surgical techniques and care, age still is a significant risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, elderly patients with gastric cancer could receive minimally invasive surgery with reduced nodal dissection, i.e., D1 lymphadenectomy, in order to prevent postoperative complications. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive operation and is proved to be an acceptable alternative to open surgery. At present, there is no RCTs to confirm the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic D1 lymphadenectomy for elderly patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. This study is to compare the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic D1 versus D2 lymphadenectomy for elderly patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma（cT2-4a, N-/+, M0）to evaluate the safety of laparoscopic D1 lymphadenectomy, and to verify its results in terms of survival in elderly patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.
