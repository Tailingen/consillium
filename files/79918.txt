Proteomics in Small Cell Lung Cancer
The aim of this study is to gather insight into tumor-derived circulating extracellular vesicles-proteins in patients with newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
Identification and validation of protein biomarkers, For identification and validation of protein biomarkers both untargeted and targeted proteomics will be performed, including a discovery-based bottom-up mass spectrometry approach and label-free Quantification Nano Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LFQ nLC-MS/MS), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based proteomics, and Western Blot analyses., 3 years
The study will include 50 patients with newly diagnosed SCLC, referred to systemic antineoplastic treatment at the Dept. of Oncology, Aalborg University Hospital and blood samples from 50 healthy blood donors.

The blood samples from SCLC patients will be collected before chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Etoposide and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.

Imaging will be performed at the Dept. of Radiology, Aalborg University Hospital before chemotherapy and after 3 cycles of the treatment.
