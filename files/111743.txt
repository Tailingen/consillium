A Study of 68Ga-ABY-025 PET for Non-invasive Quantification of HER2-expression in Advanced Breast Cancer
A large multi- center phase II/III study with 68Ga-ABY-025 PET and biopsies in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, where the primary endpoint of the study is to find out the correlation between the HER2 expression measured by 68Ga-ABY-025 PET and standard histopathology from relevant tumor biopsies.
