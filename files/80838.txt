Multispectral Bimodal Fluorescence Guided Surgery of High-grade Glioma With Cetuximab-800CW and 5-ALA (5-aminolevulinic Acid)
The MIRROR study is a prospective, single center phase I feasibility and dose finding study in patients with high-grade glioma, to establish the safety, feasibility, and optimal dosage of Cetuximab-IRDye800CW for fluorescence guided surgery, in comparison to the standard of care (SOC), 5-ALA fluorescent imaging agent. The main research objectives of this study are:

1. To determine the optimal dosage of Cetuximab-IRDye800CW for fluorescence guided surgery
2. To assess the safety and tolerability
3. To correlate fluorescent signals measured by in vivo multispectral imaging with Cetuximab-IRDye800CW and 5-ALA with those measured by ex vivo imaging

The study population will consist of patients, aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with high-grade glioma and scheduled for surgery.
