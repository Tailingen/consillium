Bevacizumab and Cetuximab in Combination With FOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This trial will evaluate the combination of modified infusional 5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6), bevacizumab, and cetuximab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. FOLFOX6 has proven to be a safe and effective regimen in first line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. The role of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitors in an earlier treatment setting in combination with optimal chemotherapy regimens is an important emerging question.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), the Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Worsening of Their Disease, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between the start date of treatment and the date of occurrence of progressive disease or death., 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), the Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Death, Measured from the date of first treatment until the date of death from any cause, 36 months|Number of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety With FOLFOX6 Combined With Bevacizumab and Cetuximab, The toxicity assessments were made according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE version 3.0) of the National Cancer Institute. Number of participants with Grade 1 to 5 adverse events are reported here., 18 months
All patients received cetuximab: 400 mg/m2 (first cycle only) administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 and 250 mg/m2 IV on day 8 with all subsequent cycles 250 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8. Day 1 cetuximab was immediately followed by bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV, and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 IV bolus, followed by 2400 mg/m2 administered as a continuous infusion over 46 hours via a pump (outpatient) and leucovorin 350 mg IV (modified FOLFOX6). Cycles were 14 days.
