A Study in Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research question(s):

* To see how the body absorbs, processes, and gets rid of cetuximab when the drug is taken in combination with carboplatin \[pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis\]
* To see if any drug interactions occur between cetuximab and carboplatin.
