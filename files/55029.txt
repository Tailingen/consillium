Overall Response Rate (ORR) after 1 course of treatment, Defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or partial response (PR).Biological characteristics exploratory studies were analyzed by single-cell sequencing and Atac-seq. Further, according to European LeukemiaNet risk group, we analyzed the outcomes of patients by molecular subtype as a sub-group analysis., 1 months after the start of study treatment

Despite advances in therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the past decades, some patients still suffer from relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, resulting in poor outcomes. With a median overall survival (OS) of 4-7 months under classic chemotherapy approaches, it is imperative to explore new treatment options.Accumulating research has demonstrated the importance of epigenetic modification in the pathogenesis of chemoresistance. Recent studies have shown that combining venetoclax with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as azacitidine, or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) improves the response and survival rates in R/R AML patients. To enhance the response rate, we designed a regimen that combines chidamide, azacitidine, cytarabine, aclarubicin, and G-CSF with venetoclax (CACAG+VEN regimen) for the treatment of patients with R/R AML. In this study, we intend to compare the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combined with the CACAG regimen with Best-Available Therapy(BAT) regimen in the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
