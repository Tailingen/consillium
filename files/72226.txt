A Study of Tasisulam-sodium Versus Paclitaxel as Treatment for Metastatic Melanoma
The primary purpose of this study was to see how tasisulam-sodium affected metastatic melanoma when compared against paclitaxel as measured by overall survival.
Melanoma
DRUG: Tasisulam-sodium|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Overall Survival (OS), OS is duration from enrollment to death; OS censored for participants who were alive at last contact., Randomization to date of death from any cause (assessed at every cycle and every 60 days following treatment discontinuation) up to 14.32 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is time from date of first dose to first observation of disease progression (PD); PD=20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or death from any cause., Randomization to date of objectively determined PD, or death from any cause (assessed at every cycle and every 60 days following treatment discontinuation) up to 13.70 months|Percentage of Randomized Participants Having a Confirmed Best Response of Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR), Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., First date RECIST criteria met for CR or PR (whichever occurred first) until first date of documented PD, or death from any cause (assessed every other cycle) up to 13.70 months|Duration of Response (DoR) for Participants Having an Objective Response of Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR), Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Analysis was adjusted for Baseline Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH); Disease Stage; Sex; Previous Single Agent Immunotherapy Treatment; Age Group. Due to limited number of responses for either treatment arm, DoR analysis was not performed., First date RECIST criteria met for CR or PR (whichever occurred first) until first date of documented PD, or death from any cause (assessed every other cycle) up to 13.70 months|Percentage of Randomized Participants Having a Confirmed Best Overall Response of Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) Plus Participants With an Overall Response of Stable Disease (SD), Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; SD=small changes that do not meet above criteria; PD=20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., First date RECIST criteria met for CR, PR, or SD until first date of documented progressive disease (PD), or death from any cause (assessed every other cycle) up to 13.70 months|Time to Deterioration in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma Trial Outcome Index (FACT-M TOI) Score, FACT-M measures domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL): physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns of melanoma. FACT-M TOI is the sum of FACT-M physical well-being, functional well-being, and melanoma subscales. Scores range from 0 to 120; Higher scores=better quality of life (QoL). FACT-M TOI score deterioration was defined as time from randomization to a minimally important difference in TOI score or death., Randomization to first date of deterioration in FACT-M TOI, or death from any cause (assessed every cycle and up to 30 days following treatment discontinuation) up to 13.21 months|Change From Baseline at Cycle 2 in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M) up to 30 Days Following Treatment Discontinuation, FACT-M measures domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL): physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns of melanoma. Total scores range from 0 to 172; Higher scores=better HR-QoL. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was adjusted for treatment group, cycle, treatment-by-cycle interaction, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, stage of disease at study entry, and best response to previous chemotherapy., Baseline at Cycle 2, up to 30 days following treatment discontinuation|Change From Baseline at Cycle 3 in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M) up to 30 Days Following Treatment Discontinuation, FACT-M measures domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL): physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns of melanoma. Total scores range from 0 to 172; Higher scores=better HR-QoL. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was adjusted for treatment group, cycle, treatment-by-cycle interaction, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, stage of disease at study entry, and best response to previous chemotherapy., Baseline at Cycle 3, up to 30 days following treatment discontinuation|Change From Baseline at Cycle 4 in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M) up to 30 Days Following Treatment Discontinuation, FACT-M measures domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL): physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns of melanoma. Total scores range from 0 to 172; Higher scores=better HR-QoL. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was adjusted for treatment group, cycle, treatment-by-cycle interaction, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, stage of disease at study entry, and best response to previous chemotherapy., Baseline at Cycle 4, up to 30 days following treatment discontinuation|Change From Baseline at Cycle 2 in EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) up to 30 Days Following Treatment Discontinuation, EQ-5D consists of 5 items that assess participant's overall health. Participants choose 1 of 3 options that best describe the status of each item. EQ-5D United Kingdom (UK)-based index scores range from -0.59 (worst health) to 1.0 (1.0=perfect health; Positive change from baseline=health improvement). Least Squares (LS) Mean value was adjusted for treatment group, cycle, treatment-by-cycle interaction, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, stage of disease at study entry, and best response to previous chemotherapy., Baseline at Cycle 2, up to 30 days following treatment discontinuation|Change From Baseline at Cycle 3 in EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) up to 30 Days Following Treatment Discontinuation, EQ-5D consists of 5 items that assess participant's overall health.
