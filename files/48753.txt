Sunitinib in Refractory Adrenocortical Carcinoma
Although a first randomized trial in patients with advanced ACC leading to the establishment of a first line cytotoxic chemotherapy is ongoing (FIRM-ACT), the failure rate even of this FIRM-ACT study is most likely clearly above 50%. Therefore, the majority of participating patients urgently need a new treatment option. However, up to date there is no evidence for a single regimen that might be promising in these treatment-refractory patients with ACC.

Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor and antiangiogenic activities, which is successfully tested in the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal and neuroendocrine tumors after failure of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The primary objective of this trial is to estimate the response (defined as progression-free survival of ≥ 12 weeks) rate associated with Sunitinib treatment in patients advanced ACC progressing after cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Adrenocortical Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib
Assessment of Clinical Benefit Due to Treatment With Sunitinib, Clinical benefit was defined as stable disease or better for at least 12 weeks, 12 weeks
Assessment of Objective Response Rates, Objective Response Rate defined by RECIST 1.0, 12 weeks|Assessment of Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time of start of study until documentation of Progress. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, up to 400 days|Assessment of Overall Survival, Overall Survival was defined as time from start of treatment until death or last follow-up., up to 36 months|Assessment of Toxicity, Adverse events were rated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (see http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)., up to 400 days
