DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved complete remission (CR)=disappearance of all evidence of disease or partial remission (PR)=regression of greater than or equal to 50% of measurable disease and no new site by end of treatment (EOT) per Cheson 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., Baseline, at Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 during treatment until disease progression death or end of treatment (approximately 12 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs or worsens after receiving study drug., First dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately 12 months)|Number of Participants With Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Findings Reported as Adverse Events, Clinical Laboratory tests included tests of Chemistry, Hematology and Urinalysis prespecified in the protocol. Abnormal laboratory values assessed by the investigator that lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or were considered by the investigator to be clinically significant changes from Baseline were recorded as Adverse Events. Neutropenia (pooled) includes preferred terms Neutropenia and Neutrophil count decreased., First dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately 12 months)|Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs Reported as Adverse Events, Vital signs included blood pressure in the sitting position, pulse rate, axillary temperature and weight. Abnormal vital sign values considered by the investigator to be clinically significant were recorded as Adverse Events., First dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately 12 months)
Complete Remission (CR) Rate, CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR by EOT. CR is defined as disappearance of all evidence of disease per Cheson 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., Baseline, at Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 during treatment, and every 12 weeks during PFS follow-up period, until disease progression death or end of treatment (approximately 12 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time between the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) and the first subsequent documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. CR is defined as disappearance of all evidence of disease. PR is defined as regression of greater than or equal to 50% of measurable disease and no new sites., Up to 3.2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3.2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of death., Up to 3.2 years|B Symptom Resolution Rate, B Symptom Resolution Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with lymphoma-related symptoms (B symptoms: fever, night sweats, or weight loss \>10%) at baseline who achieved resolution of all B symptoms at any time during the treatment period., Day 1 of each cycle (each cycle was of 3 weeks) up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately 12 months)|Cmax: Maximum Observed Serum Concentration for Brentuximab Vedotin Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC), Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1 and 2: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|Cmax: Maximum Observed Serum Concentration for Total Antibody (TAb), Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1 and 2: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE), Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1 and 2: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Brentuximab Vedotin ADC, Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1 and 2: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) for TAb, Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1 and 2: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for MMAE, Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1 and 2: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|AUC(0-∞): Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity for Brentuximab Vedotin ADC, Cycle (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|AUC(0-∞): Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity for TAb, Cycle (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|AUC(0-∞): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity for MMAE, Cycle (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 1: Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 336 hours) post-dose|Number of Participants With Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATA) and Neutralizing Antitherapeutic Antibodies (nATA) to Brentuximab Vedotin, Blood samples were collected to assess the immunogenicity of brentuximab vedotin (ATA development) using a laboratory test to determine ATA titers. Confirmed ATA-positive response was categorized as transient (defined as 1 or 2 post-baseline confirmed ATA-positive responses) and persistent (defined as more than 2 post-baseline confirmed ATA positive responses) and by nATA status. The number of participants in each baseline ATA and post-baseline ATA categories are reported., Baseline, at Cycles (each cycle was of 3 weeks) 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 during treatment until disease progression, death or end of treatment (approximately 12 months)
The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. This study will look at efficacy, safety and PK of brentuximab vedotin in Chinese participants with relapsed/refractory CD30+ HL or sALCL.

The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will receive:

• Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg

All participants will be administered IV infusion on Day 1 each 3-week cycle until the sooner of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 16 cycles.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in China only. The overall time to participate in this study is 3.5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be followed for overall survival (OS) every 12 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, 18 months after end of treatment (EOT) or study closure, whichever occurs first.
