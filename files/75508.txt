The number of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity, as defined in the protocol., Dose-limiting toxicity as described in the protocol that is not related to disease progression, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications and that, despite optimal therapeutic intervention, meets protocol-defined criteria of AZD9833 monotherapy. \[part A only\], Minimum observation period 28 days on treatment.|The number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Data will include clinical observations, ECG parameters, clinical chemistry and haematology and vital signs assessed as the number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v5.0 of AZD9833 monotherapy., 6 months after the last patient recruited starts study intervention or 28 days after the final patient discontinues study intervention|Plasma AZD9833 concentrations and derived PK parameters., To characterise the single- and multiple-dose PK of AZD9833 monotherapy., At predefined intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period (approximately 16 weeks )
The number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Data will include clinical observations, ECG parameters, clinical chemistry and haematology and vital signs assessed as the number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v5.0 of AZD9833 administered in combination with palbociclib or everolimus.., 6 months after the last patient recruited starts study intervention or 28 days after the final patient discontinues study intervention|Plasma AZD9833 concentrations and derived PK parameters (for optional expansion cohorts Part B Cohorts 2 and 3 only). Everolimus (whole blood) concentrations and derived PK parameters (for optional expansion cohort Part B Cohort 3 only)., To characterise the single- and/or multiple-dose PK of AZD9833 administered in combination with palbociclib, and single- and/or multiple-dose PK of both AZD9833 and everolimus in combination., At predefined intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period (approximately 16 weeks )|Objective Response Rate, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Week 8 and week 16 and week 24 and then every 12 weeks (week 36, 48, 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year)|Duration of Response, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Week 8 and week 16 and week 24 and then every 12 weeks (weeks 36, 48 and 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year)|Clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Up to 24 weeks|Percentage Change in Tumour Size, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Week 8 and week 16 and week 24 and then every 12 weeks (weeks 36, 48 and 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year)|Progression Free Survival, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), From start of treatment to disease progression/latest date of evaluable RECIST assessment (approximate 1 year)
This study is designed to investigate and characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of AZD9833 monotherapy (Part A, Part B-cohort 1) or in combination with palbociclib (optional Part B cohort 2) or everolimus (optional Part B cohort 3) and to explore the preliminary anti-tumour activity in Chinese patients
