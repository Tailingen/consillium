Percentage of MM Participants With Clinical and Sociodemographic Characteristics Categorized by Treatment Selection at the Latest Symptomatic Relapse and/or Refractory Episode, Clinical and Sociodemographic variables categorized by treatment selection(immunomodulators\[IMiDs\],proteasome inhibitor\[PI\]+IMiDs,PI,monoclonal antibodies\[mAb\]): Age,sex(male/female),prior treatment lines(0,1,2,3 or more),prior relapses(0,1,2,3 or more),ISS disease stage(I:low risk,β2-Microglobulin\<3.5mg/L,albumin≥3.5g/dL,II:not stage I or III,III:high risk,β2-Microglobulin≥5.5mg/L),CRAB signs(serum calcium\>0.25mmol/L upper limit of normal,renal failure-creatinine clearance\<40mL/min/serum creatinine\>117μmol/L,anemia:reduction of hemoglobin(Hb)\>2g/dL below lower limit of normal or Hb\<10g/dL,bone lesions 1/more osteolytic lesion),risk according to cytogenetic profile(standard:trisomies,t\[11;14\];t\[6;14\];high:d\[17p\],t\[14;16\],t\[14;20\],other),other clinical variables:medullary/extramedullary plasmacytomas,osteopenia,fractures,neurological symptoms,infections,concomitant diseases:diabetes, neuropathy, COPD, cardiovascular disease, liver failure, psychiatric, neurological disorders., Day 1|Number of New Relevant Variables That Are Not Currently Collected in Clinical Records and That Could Influence in the Disease Management at Relapse, Day 1|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire- Core 30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale with a recall period of the previous week. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL., Day 1|HRQOL Based on EORTC Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20) Subscale Score, The EORTC QLQ-MY20 has 20 items across 4 independent subscales, 2 functional subscales (body image, future perspective), and 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms, and side effects of treatment) with a recall period of previous week. Scores from each subscale were transformed from 0 to 100. For the functional scales, high scores represent improvement. For the symptom scales, higher scores represent worsening., Day 1|HRQOL Based on the Spanish Translated Version of EORTC Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20), The EORTC QLQ-MY20 has 20 items across 4 independent subscales, 2 functional subscales (body image, future perspective), and 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms, and side effects of treatment) with a recall period of previous week. Scores from each subscale were transformed from 0 to 100. For the functional scales, high scores represent improvement. For the symptom scales, higher scores represent worsening. Spanish Translated Version of EORTC Multiple Myeloma Module included 4 factors, each factor corresponds to questions related to the particular component of the scale. Factor I indicate symptoms. Factor II indicates future perspectives. Factor III indicate adverse effects of the treatment. Factor IV indicates adverse effects of the treatment and body image. Each of these factors were used for the clinical validity of the scale., Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Health Care Resource Utilization (HU), Healthcare resources used during medical encounters include intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, hospital admissions, visits to the emergency room, days admitted., Day 1
Adult participants with a diagnosis of MM who have received at least one previous treatment line and have experienced symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in the previous 6 months, who are still in follow-up at the time of the study visit will be observed in this study.

The study will look into sociodemographic data, current clinical and therapeutic data, clinical data relative to the latest relapse and clinical data at diagnosis and previous relapses will be collected.

The study will enroll approximately 350 patients.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in a total of 30 public sites in Spain. The overall time to collect data will be approximately 1 year from June 2017 to May 2018.
