PREDICTION OF GERMLINE BRCA 1/2 GENES FROM HEALTHY OVARIES
The project aims at enhancing performance metrics and prospectively validating a radiogenomics model based on ovarian US images for predicting germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 and/or 2 (BRCA) status in women with healthy ovaries. The project is divided in two operational phases:

Retrospective phase

AIM 1: To define and implement a proper and fine-tuned image preprocessing pipeline on the existing dataset; AIM 2: To enlarge dataset size with new real images from different centers and apply data augmentation techniques, deep neural network models combined with the aforementioned handcrafted imaging features from radiomics analysis;

Prospective phase

AIM 3: To further cross-validate the predictive model on US images acquired prospectively in an observational multicenter study.
