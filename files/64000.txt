Response to Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Therapy in Head and Neck Cancer-Related Lymphedema
Assessment of lymphatic structure and function pre- and post- treatment and during recovery in head and neck cancer related lymphedema patients using NIR fluorescence lymphatic imaging: Response to ICD therapy in HNC Patients.
Head and Neck Neoplasms|Head and Neck Lymphedema|Head and Neck Cancer
DEVICE: Head and neck garments for pneumatic compression device|DRUG: NIRFLI with ICG
Lymph Movement Measured by ICG Lymphography., Demonstrate the ability of the Flexitouch system to move lymph/enhance lymphatic uptake (indicated by increased functionality of vessels and/or changes in area of dermal backflow) as measured by Indocyanine Green (ICG) lymphography., Single Treatment, 2 Weeks of Treatment
Dermal Backflow Measured by ICG Lymphography., Resolves dermal backflow as measured by ICG lymphography. A positive change in area indicates an increase in observable abnormal lymphatics, while a negative change indicates a decrease in observable abnormal lymphatics. A positive increase after a single treatment is expected as the manual stimulation of the lymphatics promotes the movement of ICG through the lymphatic space; however, a decrease over time provides an indication of improved lymphatic recovery., Single Treatment, 2 Weeks of Treatment|Symptom Alleviation Measured by Survey Response., Alleviates lymphedema symptoms as measured by survey response., Single Treatment, 2 Weeks of Treatment|Ease of Use Measured by Survey Response., Flexitouch is easy to use as measured by survey responses., Single Treatment, 2 Weeks of Treatment
A non-randomized, non-blinded, single site pilot study designed to assess whether near-infrared fluorescence imaging can report on the efficacy of a pneumatic compression device to move lymph in head and neck cancer survivors with resulting head and neck lymphedema.
