PEG-rhG-CSF Compared With rhG-CSF in Lymphoma Patients After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF compared with rhG-CSF on the recovery of hematopoietic function after autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with lymphoma.
Lymphoma
DRUG: PEG-rhG-CSF|DRUG: rhG-CSF
Time to neutrophil engraftment, 30 days
The duration of neutrophilic granulocytopenia, 30 days|Incidence of febrile neutrophilic granulocytopenia, 30 days|Time to platelet engraftment and number of platelet transfused to the patient, 30 days|Adverse Event, Safety, 30 days
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF compared with rhG-CSF in lymphoma patients after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to PEG-rhG-CSF group or rhG-CSF group. Patients in PEG-rhG-CSF group received PEG-rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 6 mg. Patients in rhG-CSF group received rhG-CSF day +1 after transplantation with a dose of 5μg/kg once per day until the count of neutrophil\>0.5×10\^9 /L.
