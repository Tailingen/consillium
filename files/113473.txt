Children and adolescent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can exhibit a wide spectrum of hepatotoxicity ranging from asymptomatic to clinically significant during induction chemotherapy. Unmonitored hepatic status can lead to a hepatic toxicity that might result in unwarranted interruption of the aimed delivery of dose dense chemotherapy to induce remission and consequent treatment.

To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy in children and adolescent with ALL during induction phase, through recording liver function tests before, during and after induction chemotherapy.
