Conformal Partial Breast Irradiation With CyberKnife After Resection for Early Stage Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible, safe, and effective to use Cyberknife radiotherapy to deliver partial breast radiotherapy after lumpectomy.Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be invited to participate. Adjuvant radiotherapy will be delivered using CyberKnife radiotherapy using twice daily sessions for five days for a total of ten sessions. Short-term and long-term toxicity will be assessed as well as Tumor control and site of failure (if any).

To determine the feasibility of using CyberKnife radiotherapy to deliver partial breast radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer., Subjects will undergo a treatment plan for partial breast irradiation with cyberknife. Feasibility will be determined by monitoring the number of potential eligible subjects enrolled that can be treated while also respecting normal tissue tolerances., one year
To determine if conformal irradiation to the operative bed using CyberKnife produces acceptable local control, Subjects will be followed for disease control following standard guidelines that include periodic PE and imaging with either mammography or screening breast MRaI for 5 years., 1 year
This study will determine the feasibility and toxicity of a short course of accelerated radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer. Successful completion of this project may provide a rationale to offer this treatment for select patients with the benefit of potentially less tissue damage and a shorter overall course of therapy. These improvements may ultimately allow more patients the opportunity of breast conserving therapy to treat their cancer
