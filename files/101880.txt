Staying Connected: a Mobile Health Study With the Noona® and Mobili-T® Systems
Mobile health applications are an attractive technological solution that facilitates access to care for patients conveniently and efficiently. Research has shown that remote mHealth delivery has improved patient reported outcomes of disease severity. While such outcomes have traditionally been collected at one point in time within a clinical setting, the potential exists to now gather patient perspectives remotely. Additionally, when combined with a mobile health device, mHealth apps can objectively monitor a treatment plan.

Before implementing a new technology, it is important to investigate how digital health technologies are best integrated into clinical workflows, and how more than one technology can work together to streamline the process. Additionally, it is important to understand the relative benefits of each system from a user perspective and identify how combined data can benefit clinical workflows. Therefore, the purposes of this project are to demonstrate how two technology companies can work together to assess the feasibility of implementing two related systems into one care pathway.

The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) to assess dysphagia severity in those with a history of HNC, The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a validated and reliable self-administered questionnaire that was specifically designed for patients with a history of HNC. MDADI consists of 20 questions and results in 4 subscales: global, emotional, functional and physical. Although no gold standard questionnaire exists for HNC patients, a recent systematic review revealed that MDADI was one of the most frequently utilized and thoroughly tested instruments for symptom-specific HNC measures. While all subscores will be reported for demographic purposes, only the composite score will be used for statistical analyses., pre-operative|The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) to assess dysphagia severity in those with a history of HNC, The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a validated and reliable self-administered questionnaire that was specifically designed for patients with a history of HNC.
