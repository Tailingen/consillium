The Effect of Mobile Health-based Exercise on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients With Insulin Resistance
Exercise is predicted to have positive effect among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little attention has been paid to the role of physical activity with wearable device in the management of HCC patients in the aspect of improvement in insulin resistance.

We designed this study to investigate whether personalized exercise with mobile health program improves insulin resistance without decompensation in HCC patients with insulin resistance.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Insulin Resistance
BEHAVIORAL: Mobile health
Improvement of insulin resistance, The proportion of normalization of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (\<2.2), After 12 weeks
Improvement of insulin resistance, The proportion of normalization of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (\<2.2), After 24 weeks|Improvement of 6-minute walk test, - Changes in meters assessed using the 6-minute walk test, After 12 and 24 weeks|Improvement of grip strength test, - Changes in kilograms assessed using grip strength test, After 12 and 24 weeks|Improvement of 30-second chair stand test, - Changes in seconds assessed using 30-second chair stand test, After 12 and 24 weeks|Improvement of the score of International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), - Changes in metabolic equivalents (METs) per week calculated using IPAQ-SF, After 12 and 24 weeks|Improvement of quality of life, Improved score of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30, After 12 and 24 weeks|Nutritional status, Comparison of nutrition score using mini nutritional assessment, After 12 and 24 weeks|Adverse events, Any adverse events occurred during exercise, After 12 and 24 weeks
