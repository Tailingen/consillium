Treatment of Children CD19+ Leukemia and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma With CD19-TriCAR-T/SILK Cell Therapy
This is a single arm, open-label, early phase Ⅰ study, to determine the safety and efficacy of CD19-TriCAR-T and CD19-TriCAR-SILK cell therapy in Children CD19+ Leukemia Non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment.

CD19-TriCAR contains an anti-CD19 scFv, a PD-L1 blocker, and a cytokine complex, enabling the CD19-TriCAR-T/SILK to simultaneously targeting the CD19 positive Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma，blocking the inhibitory PD-L1 signal and stimulating innate T/NK cell activation and expansion, thus make it a tri- functional CAR (Tri-CAR). CD19-TriCAR-T is an autologous tri-functional CAR-T cell therapy, CD19-TriCAR-SILK is an Allogeneic tri-functional CAR- NK cell therapy, patients ineligible for leukapheresis or CAR-T therapy will be recommended for CD19-TriCAR-SILK therapy.
