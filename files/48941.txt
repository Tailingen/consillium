This study is a randomized, prospective study, which will analyze the efficacy and safety of the first-line treatment in advanced central non-small cell lung cancer patients by anti-PD-1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy versus anti-PD-1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy combined with bronchoscopic microwave intervention. The efficacy will include objective response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The safety will include adverse events and quality of life.
