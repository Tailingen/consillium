Domvanalimab and Zimberelimab in Advanced Liver Cancers
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about advanced liver and bile duct cancers. The main question it aims to answer is:

If the combination of Domvanalimab and Zimberelimab are effective in treating advanced hepatobiliary cancers that have failed prior treatment.

Objective Response rate of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab., To determine the best objective response rate assessed by RECIST guidelines (version 1.1) of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab in patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancers previously exposed to anti-PD-1/L1 antibody treatments., Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months
Disease Control Rate of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab, To determine the disease control rate of response of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab compared to historical controls assessed by RECIST guidelines (version 1.1), Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months|Overall survival of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab, To determine the overall survial rate of response of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab compared to historical controls assessed by RECIST guidelines (version 1.1), Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months|6-month progression-free survival of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab, To determine the 6 month progression-free survival rate of response of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab compared to historical controls assessed by RECIST guidelines (version 1.1), Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months|Duration of response of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab, To determine the duration of response of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab compared to historical controls assessed by RECIST guidelines (version 1.1), Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months|Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) (serious / non-serious) as defined by CTCAE v5.0, Safety profile of combination zimberelimab and domvanalimab will be measured by the number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) (serious / non-serious) as graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months
