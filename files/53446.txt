Study of ABT-199 (GDC-199) In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM). This study is using the study intervention ABT-199.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. ABT-199 is a pill that blocks BCL-2, a protein that is important for the survival of WM cells.

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how well the study drug works and the safety of ABT-199 as a single agent in participants with WM that has come back or has shown no response to previous treatment.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ABT-199 as a treatment for any disease.
