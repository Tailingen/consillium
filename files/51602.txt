A Clinical Study for Comparison of the Effects Between Gasless Laparoscopy and Conventional Laparoscopy for Distal Gastric Cancer
The aim of this trial is to confirm the non-inferiority of Gasless laparoscopy-assisted distal D2 radical gastrectomy to the conventional laparoscopy-assisted distal D2 radical gastrectomy for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients (T2-4a, N0-3, M0).
Gastrectomy|Laparoscopy
DEVICE: Conventional Laparoscopy|DEVICE: Gasless Laparoscopy
Operative time, The primary end point was operative time for Gasless Laparoscopy-assisted Gastrectomy with D2 Lymphadenectomy and conventional Laparoscopy-assisted Gastrectomy with D2 Lymphadenectomy., During procedure.
Blood pressure, Intraoperative blood pressure, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|End-tidal carbon dioxide, Intraoperative end-tidal carbon dioxide, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|Heart rate, Intraoperative heart rate, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|Estimated blood loss, Intraoperative estimated blood loss, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|Complications, Intraoperative complications, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|Death, Intraoperative death, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|Blood transfusion, Intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.|Tumor size, Tumor size, Through study completion, an average of 2 year.
The primary end point was operative time for Gasless laparoscopy-assisted distal D2 radical gastrectomy and conventional laparoscopy-assisted distal D2 radical gastrectomy. The secondary outcomes of interest were intraoperative vital signs; postoperative pain; and surgeon satisfaction for D2 radical gastrectomy.
