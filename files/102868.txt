CD3/CD28 Bead Activated T-Cells Following Chemo-Immunotherapy in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this research study is to test whether giving T-cells (type of white blood cell that are also known as immune cells) that have been specially processed in the laboratory will help chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients' immune system return to normal faster after chemotherapy. This research study will also look into the ability of the lab to process the T-cells for infusion and the side effects of giving T-cells to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Single arm, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy of administering CD3/CD28 stimulated T cells to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients following treatment with fludarabine or alemtuzumab based chemo- immunotherapy. All patients will undergo an apheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for generation of expanded T cells post- chemo-immunotherapy. Those subjects who achieve a complete or partial response to the chemoimmunotherapy based regimen will receive an infusion of 1.0 x 1010 (+/- 20%) activated autologous T cells expanded from the collected apheresis unit. Prior to T-cell infusion, at Day +30, +60, and +365 after T cell infusion, blood draws will be performed to assess immune reconstitution and immune function as compared to baseline.
