High-Resolution PET-CT Imaging for Surgical Margin Visualization
Imaging will be exploratory and be used intraoperatively. There have been no discovered risks associated with the device to be used in this study, and none are anticipated given the diagnostic and non-invasive, 'ex vivo' nature of device use. Of note, the surgical resection will proceed as per standard of care and will not be affected by the research protocol.

Potential Benefit: Imaging intra-operatively will ensure surgeons to identify at risk resection margins.

Time Commitment: There are no additional visits that will be asked of you to partake in this study.

Drug is FDA approved and Exposure to Radiation is minimal.

DEVICE: Intra-op PET/CT Specimen Scanner
The study will determine the feasibility of intraoperative high-resolution specimen PET-CT imaging in solid tumors., This study is an exploratory pilot study where the main goal is to gather scientific knowledge. Since no results with a certain significance need to be proven, no power analysis will be performed.

Pre-Surgery Preparation: Patients are injected with a PET (18F-FDG) tracer. This tracer highlights cancerous tissues by emitting signals detectable by PET imaging.

Intraoperative Imaging: Once the tumor is removed, the specimen is scanned using the XEOS Aura 10 device in the operating room. This allows surgeons to get detailed images of the tumor and surrounding tissues.

Immediate Analysis: The imaging provides real-time feedback on the tumor's characteristics, such as margins and whether all cancerous tissue has been removed. This can help surgeons make decisions during the operation, like whether additional tissue needs to be excised.

Comparison with Pathology: The PET-CT images are later compared with traditional pathology results to validate their accuracy and usefulness., Day of Surgery.

This pilot study explores the use of high-resolution PET imaging to identify surgical margins in solid tumors after removal. It evaluates the feasibility and potential of using PET-CT to assess tumor specimens and ensures radiation safety with a low-dose 18-FDG injection (20% of the standard dose). Previous studies have shown good tumor visualization in breast, pancreatic, prostate, and head and neck tumors, supporting the method's proof-of-concept. This research aims to gather insights into its clinical usefulness across different cases
