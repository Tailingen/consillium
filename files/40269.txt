Oral Posaconazole in High Risk Patients With Gastrointestinal Dysfunction (Study P05115)
The purpose of this study is: to explore the potential for different dosing strategies of posaconazole oral suspension (POS) to increase plasma levels and to profile the pharmacokinetics of these dosing strategies in patients with compromised gastrointestinal function and at high risk for Invasive Fungal Infection.
