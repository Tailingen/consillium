Digestive System Disease|Neoplasms
OTHER: EPODIG-G program (coordination of supportive care)
Impact of EPODIG-G program on treatment., Number of patients who benefit from all programmed treatment cycles at 24 weeks, 24 weeks after treatment initiation
Dose-intensity evaluation. Cumulative doses and theoretical doses of chemotherapy or targeted therapy., 24 weeks after treatment initiation|Number of adverse events and serious adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0., throughout treatment, at 8, 16 and 24 weeks after treatment initiation|Progression free survival, 3 years after last inclusion|Overall survival, 3 years after last inclusion
At the ICANS an EPODIG-G program, consisting in a coordination of supportive care that are existing in the Institute, is proposed to elderly patients with digestive cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of this early multidisciplinary geriatric program (EPODIG-G), when it is initiated before therapeutic treatment.
