A Safety and Efficacy Study of HCB101, Fc-fusion Protein Targeting SIRPÎ±-CD47 Pathway, in Solid or Hematological Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out whether IV injection of HCB101 is an effective treatment for different types of advanced solid tumors or relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur in subjects aged 18 years old and above.

This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study. This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), anti-tumor activity, and identification of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HCB101 intravenous injection in adults with advanced solid tumors or relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Eligible subjects must have failed standard therapies, been intolerable, or been considered medically inappropriate by the investigator. Subjects will be treated until unacceptable AEs, radiographic or clinical documented disease progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or termination of the study, whichever occurs first.
