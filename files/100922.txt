Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Drainage of Walled Off Necrosis (WON)
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) and double pigtail plastic stents (DPPSs) on the drainage of pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON), mainly to observe the efficacy and safety of LAMS for WON.
Pancreatic Pseudocyst
DEVICE: Lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS)|DEVICE: Double pigtail plastic stent (DPPS)
clinical success, The cysts completely disappeared, or diameter â‰¤ 2cm in the imaging follow-up symptoms have eased, uo to 1 months
adverse event, any adverse event occured after stent inserted, up to 2months/ stent remove|recurrence rate, After the clinical success, imaging examination show cyst again and accompanied by symptoms, up to 12 months|technical success, Stent placed through the wall bracket and pancreatic pseudocyst successfully, up to 48 hours
Patient with pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON) would be treated randomized with lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) or double pigtail plastic stents (DPPSs) under the guidance of Endoscopic Ultrasonography. The investigators compare the effect of the two stents, including technical success, clinical success, adverse event, recurrence, and so on.
