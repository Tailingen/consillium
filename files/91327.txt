This is an open label, multi-drug, biomarker-directed, multi-centre, multi-arm, Phase 1b study in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (urothelial) who have progressed on prior treatment. This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity of multiple agents as monotherapy and as combinations of different novel anti-cancer agents.

The study will consist of a number of study modules (sub-studies), each evaluating the safety and tolerability of a specific agent or combination in patients whose tumours express specific genomic alterations relevant to the molecules under investigation and whose disease has progressed following prior therapy. The allocation of patients to specific modules will depend on the specific eligible genomic alterations identified in their tumours.

Each module will determine the appropriate combination dose for further clinical evaluation based on safety, tolerability and efficacy profile. A maximum tolerated dose will be defined and each arm expanded appropriately to explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological activity at the selected combination doses.

Module A includes an AZD4547 monotherapy arm and a MEDI4736 (durvalumab) + AZD4547 combination therapy arm and will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously, in combination with AZD4547 given orally to selected patients with MIBC with tumours that have fibroblast growth factor receptor mutations or fibroblast growth factor receptor fusions.

Module B will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously in combination with olaparib (AZD2281, Lynparza) given orally to selected patients with MIBC whose tumors have mutations in a homologous recombination repair gene panel and whose disease had progressed following prior therapy.

Module C will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously, in combination with AZD1775 given orally to selected patients with MIBC whose tumours have mutations in genes involved in cell cycle regulation (e.g., loss of either retinoblastoma 1 or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A or amplification of cyclin E1 or MYC family genes).

Module D will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously as monotherapy to patients with MIBC who do not qualify for Modules A, B or C.

Module E will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously, in combination with vistusertib (AZD2014) given orally to patients with MIBC whose tumours do not show genomic alterations that would be eligible for other study modules. Patients whose MIBC tumours harbour the following genomic alterations that have potential to respond to a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor will also be included in Module E: RICTOR amplification, or TSC1/1 mutations.

Module F will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously in combination with AZD9150 given intravenously to patients with MIBC whose tumours do not show genomic alterations that would be eligible for other modules.

Module G will investigate the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 given intravenously in combination with selumetinib (AZD6244) given orally to patients with MIBC. Patients in this module will not be selected for any specific tumour genomic alteration.
