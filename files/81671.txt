FDG-PET as an Imaging Modality to Diagnose and Risk Stratify Subclinical, Imaging Negative Ici-Myocarditis
The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate Fluorodeoxyglucose - Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) as an imaging modality to diagnose and risk stratify subclinical, imaging negative ICI-myocarditis, and to determine whether subclinical ICI-induced myocarditis is a distinct and clinically relevant entity with a risk of progression to fulminant myocarditis.
