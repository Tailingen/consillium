90Y-ibritumomab Tiuxetan Consolidation After 6th R-CHOP Chemotherapy in Patients With Bulky Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
This phase II study is aimed at the clinical efficacy and toxicity of 6th R-CHOP chemotherapy followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) consolidation in patients with limited-stage, bulky diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse
DRUG: ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin)
Objective response, Patients receive six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy per 21-day intervals. Patients with clearly documented progressive disease will be taken off the study when progression is noted. Patients who achieved a complete or partial response after 6th R-CHOP chemotherapy will receive ibritumomab tiuxetan treatment as a consolidation., Up to 24 weeks after the infustion of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan|Safety and toxicity, After Zevalin treatment, safety profiles will be evaluated with physical examination, vital signs, performance status, serum chemistry and electrolytes, and lymphocytes subset using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, every 4 weeks for 6 months, and then every 3 months for the next 6 months., 3 years after the infusion of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan
Progression-free survival, the time from start of R-CHOP to the first recording of disease progression or death of any cause
The patients with limited-stage, bulky diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are known to have a poor prognosis as like to those with advanced disease. However, there are very limited studies to compare the clinical outcome of therapy after chemotherapy only with combined modality using radiation. Defining local failure at bulky sites as one component of relapse, radioimmuotherapy appears to reduce the failure rates at previous bulky sites. We assessed the clinical efficacy and toxicity of 6th R-CHOP chemotherapy and followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) consolidation in patients with limited-stage, bulky DLBCL.
