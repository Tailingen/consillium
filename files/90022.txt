Study of Letrozole in Recurrent Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of letrozole to penetrate the blood brain barrier and concentrate in gliomas.
Brain Tumor
DRUG: Letrozole Oral Tablet|DRUG: Temozolomide
Overall Letrozole AUC in tumor tissue., Pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to determine the overall AUC in the tumor tissue to assess for letrozole penetration through blood brain barrier., 5 days|Progression free survival in letrozole and temozolomide combination, Sub-study expansion cohort only: Progression free survival using RANO criteria at 6 months from the start of the combination of 15 mg letrozole and 50 mg/m2 temozolomide., 6 months
Adverse Events, The number of patients with treatment related toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE v4.0, The time patients remain on treatment until 30 days after treatment completed|Progression free Survival, Patients will be followed for response using RANO criteria to determine time from start of treatment to progression., From start of treatment until time of progression assessed up to 1 year|Overall Survival, Patients will be followed from start of treatment until time of death, From start of treatment until time of death assessed up to 1 year
Nine to forty-two (42 patients only if every cohort required expansion) total patients were planned for the main BN-16-01 phase 0/1 study to explore the ability of letrozole to penetrate the blood brain barrier and gliomas. As of November 2023 The BN-16-01 main study has completed active recruitment (20 subjects were accrued) and all safety and pharmacokinetics data have been analyzed with subsequent publications pending. Characterization of the safety and pharmacokinetics of letrozole in combination with standard of care treatments, such as TMZ has been completed for the main study and provides the rationale for initiation of a sub-study.

A new sub-study "Letrozole and Temozolomide" expansion cohort has been opened to accrual. This Phase 1 expansion cohort of letrozole 15mg administered in combination with 50 mg/m2 metronomic temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with high grade gliomas. 19 subjects total (2 historical subjects from the main study and 17 new accruals) will be enrolled into this expansion cohort.
