Malnutrition is a Severe Health Issue for Cancer Patients. This Study Examines How Preoperative Nutritional Status Affects Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Surgery for Gynecological and Gastrointestinal Tumors.
The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies malnutrition as a significant public health threat. It is a common issue among cancer patients due to various factors. Specific nutrient deficiencies can lead to severe cognitive problems. This study aims to evaluate the impact of preoperative nutritional status on the frequency of postoperative delirium. Additionally, we will compare different parameters that can be used to diagnose preoperative malnutrition.

We included a total of 120 patients aged over 18 years, classified as ASA I-IV, who were undergoing major abdominal surgery for gynecological or gastrointestinal tumors and were expected to remain in the postoperative care unit for more than 24 hours. The patients' preoperative scores, albumin levels, prealbumin levels, and other relevant data were recorded. In the first 24 hours post-surgery, delirium was assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU).
