Recruitment Messages for Current Smokers Recently Diagnosed With Cancer
The objective of this study was to conduct a pilot factorial randomized trial to identify the message frames that are most effective in promoting participation in a tobacco treatment trial for current smokers recently diagnosed with cancer. To do so, we used a multimethod approach to evaluate 3 different message frames across evaluation, effectiveness, and outcome measures. We combine findings from a message design experiment with textual analytic software to provide a holistic understanding of how message frames may or may not differentially affect tobacco treatment trial participation within the context of a cancer diagnosis.

Difference in intent to talk to a physician about participating in a smoking cessation study between factors., The main effect within each message factor level was examined using ANOVA and compared with the control condition., Within 30 minutes
Predictors of intent to talk to a physician about participating in a smoking cessation study., Other message evaluation and effectiveness measures were collected and explored in a multivariable model predicting intent to talk to a physician., Within 30 minutes
Background: A cancer diagnosis can catalyze motivation to quit smoking. Tobacco treatment trials offer cessation resources but have low accrual rates. Digital outreach may improve accrual, but knowledge of how best to recruit smokers with recent diagnoses is limited.

Objective: This study aims to identify the message frames that were most effective in promoting intent to talk to a physician about participating in a tobacco treatment trial for smokers recently diagnosed with cancer.

Methods: From February to April 2019, current smokers diagnosed within the past 24 months were recruited from a national web-based panel for a multimethod pilot randomized trial (N=99). Participants were randomized to a 2Ã—3 plus control factorial design that tested 3 unique message frames: proximal versus distal threats of smoking, costs of continued smoking versus benefits of quitting, and gains of participating versus losses of not participating in a tobacco treatment trial.
