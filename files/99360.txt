Application Value of CTCs Detection for Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients
Evaluating the application value of a new circulating tumor cell detection method for advanced gastric cancer patients in prediction of the prognosis and early evaluation of the result of postoperation adjuvant chemotherapy.
Circulating Tumor Cells|Gastric Cancer
Number of circulating tumor cell (CTC), Number of the circulating tumor cell in peripheral blood from advanced gastric cancer patients undergoing D2 radical resection followed by first-line chemotherapy, Up to 2 years from start of study
Profile and Portion of circulating tumor cell (CTC), Profile and Portion of the circulating tumor cell in peripheral blood from advanced gastric cancer patients undergoing D2 radical resection followed by first-line chemotherapy. There are three type of CTCs: epithelial type CTCï¼Œmesenchymal type CTC and mixed type CTC. The portion of different type of CTC were calculated, for example: the portion of epithelia type CTC number to total CTCs,etc., Up to 2 years from start of study|Progression-free survival, Survival duration since radical resection to clinical finding of relapse disease., Up to 3 years from start of the study|Overall survival, Survival duration since radical resection to patient die., Up to 5 years from start of the study
Evaluating the application value of a new circulating tumor cell detection method for advanced gastric cancer patients in prediction of the prognosis and early evaluation of the result of postoperation adjuvant chemotherapy.
