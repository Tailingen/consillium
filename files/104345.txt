The Molecular Imaging Research of F-18 Labeled DX600 PET Probe
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and has been reported to relate with cancer. Recently, it has also been proved as the key target for COVID-19 infection.

DX600 is a polypeptide that can specific binding to ACE2 specifically with nanomolar affinity reported in literature. This study constrcuted a radio-tracer, DX600 Labeled by PET Radionuclide, to monitoring biodistribution ACE2 in human beings, evaluate the detection ability of radio-tracer in ACE2 over-expression tumors and dynamic changes of ACE2 expression under therapy.
