The Efficacy of Using Pentoxifylline in Patients Undergoing Breast Cancer Surgery
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of pentoxifylline in reducing post surgical complications for breast cancer patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. It aims to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline on postoperative pain and wound healing.

Participants will take oral pentoxifylline then post surgical oral pentoxifylline three times per day for 2 weeks. The researchers will compare the difference in pain score and wound healing relative to the control group.

The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of pentoxifylline in reducing post surgical complications for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy.

It aims to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant pentoxifylline in reducing postoperative pain and improving wound healing in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy surgery.

Participants will take oral oral pentoxifylline 400 mg three times per day 400 mg three times for the day before surgery then oral pentoxifylline 400 mg three times per day for 2 weeks while the control group will take placebo tablet one day before surgey and placebo tablets three times per day for 2 weeks after surgery. the researchers will compare the difference in pain score and time for wound healing relatively to the control group.
