A Phase II Study of Conversion Surgery After IP Paclitaxel With XELOX Chemotherapy in AGC With Peritoneal Dissemination
Advanced gastric cancer combined with peritoneal seeind has dismal prognosis with poor response to systemic chemotherapy and with rapid aggravation of symptoms such as abdominal pain, ileus, and poor nutritional intake. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy through IP port or catheter has lower complication than HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) and can deliver higher dose of chemotherapy with less systemic toxicity. IP chemotherapy combined with systemic chemotehrapy showed benefit in several clinical trials, despite lack of statistical significance in phase 3 clinical trial. Proper dose/combination of chemotherapeutic agents and indication of IP chemotherapy should be investigated through prospective, large-scale clinical trials.

Conversion surgery after cytotoxic chemotherapy showed improved survival in retrospective studies. Our hypothesis is that IP chemotherapy combined with systemic chemotherpay (capecitabine + oxaliplatin) would improve success rate of conversion surgery with R0 resection. In the present study, the treatment regimen consists of intraperitoneal paclitaxel combined with oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX), and will be performed following surgery.
