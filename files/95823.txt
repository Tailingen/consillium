Testing of the Anti Cancer Drugs CB-839 HCl (Telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (Sapanisertib) in Advanced Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of CB-839 HCl when given together with sapanisertib in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). CB-839 HCl and sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose of MLN0128 (sapanisertib) and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) in combination (dose-escalation), Will be evaluated according to dose-limiting toxicities during cycle 1 graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0., Up to 28 days|Response rate (dose-expansion), Response rate will be calculated for each cohort along with an exact 95% confidence interval., Up to 27 months|Median progression free survival (PFS) (dose-expansion), Median PFS will be determined using the Kaplan-Meier method individual for each cohort and for all patients as well., Up to 27 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria., Up to 27 months|PFS, Will be evaluated by Kaplan-Meier estimates., Up to 27 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to 27 months|Metabolic response (18Glutamine [GLN]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]; 18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/CT), Change in tumor uptake of radio-labelled glutamine on PET from baseline to cycle 1 day 8 will be quantified by the standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) (a standard PET parameter) in the largest measurable lesion. The before and after 18F-Gln PET values will be compared using log(after/before) as a measure of relative change., Up to 27 months
Genomic and metabolic signatures, Genomic and metabolic signatures will be correlated with responses. Changes in glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine will be measured, and responders will be compared to non-responders using a two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon test., Up to 27 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the safety and tolerability of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride (CB-839 HCl) (telaglenastat) in combination with MLN0128 (sapanisertib) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To examine preliminary efficacy of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in squamous cell lung cancers (LSCC) and in select, molecularly-defined non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts.

IIa. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib).

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To correlate genomic and metabolomic signatures with response. II. To evaluate metabolic response (18Glutamine \[GLN\]-positron emission tomography \[PET\]/computed tomography \[CT\]; 18Fluorodeoxyglucose \[FDG\]-PET/CT) in NSCLC tumors treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in the dose expansion.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride.

Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and sapanisertib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly.
