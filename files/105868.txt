Brentuximab Vedotin and Bendamustine for the Treatment of Hodgkin Lymphoma and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL)
This is a phase 1/2 multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine, when given together, in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma or Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) that has either returned or did not respond to initial treatment(s). Patients will be accrued at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and at two subsites in Canada.

Brentuximab vedotin will be administered as an outpatient IV infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Bendamustine will be given as an outpatient infusion on days 1 and 2 of a 21-day cycle. Patients may receive prophylactic pegfilgrastim on day 3 of each cycle, or filgrastim for 5 to 10 days, per investigator's discretion. Patients can receive a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy.
