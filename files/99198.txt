Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Adrenal Gland Cancer
Current therapies for Stage IV adrenal gland cancer provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Stage IV adrenal gland cancer

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Stage IV adrenal gland cancer.
Stage IV Adrenocortical Carcinoma
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response rate per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all disease sustained for at least four weeks; Partial Response (PR), \>=50% decrease in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, sustained for at least four weeks., 12 months
Percentage of Participants Who Survived, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months overall survival, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months
OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which patients with Stage IV adrenal gland cancer receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV adrenal gland cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV adrenal gland cancer.
* To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
