Exploratory Study Therapeutic Fasting Reduce Physical Limitations, Quality of Life During Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy
In this explorative study, the feasibility of therapeutic fasting to reduce limitations in physical well-being and quality of life of patients undergoing endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors will be investigated. In addition, the application of the StudyU app, which is currently under development, will be monitored and the app adapted if necessary. In addition, in preparation for a larger multicenter main study, it will be examined whether the muscle and joint complaints frequently experienced by patients undergoing endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AI) can be alleviated by a 7-day guided therapeutic fasting intervention (prolonged fasting / PF) can be improved.
