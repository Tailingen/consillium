The start date is the date of first documented response of CR or PR (i.e. the start date of observed response, not the date when response was confirmed), and the end date is defined as the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying disease., From the date of CR, PR until the date of disease progression or death, approximately 40 months.|[Phase Ib and III] Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, Adverse event (assessed according to NCI CTCAE v5.0) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship., From the date of first dose until 90 days after the final dose. A cycle is 28 days.|[Phase Ib and III] Immunogenicity of HS-20117, Immunogenicity will be measured by the number of participants that are ADA positive., Cycle 1 Day 1: predose through EOT or follow up period (90 days after the last dose).|[Phase Ib] PK parameters: Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of HS-20117, The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration of HS-20117, From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose. A cycle is 28 days.|[Phase Ib] PK parameters: Trough serum concentration (Ctrough) of HS-20117, Ctrough is the observed serum concentration immediately prior to the next administration, From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose. A cycle is 28 days.|[Phase Ib] PK parameters: Area under the curve from time Zero to end of dosing interval (AUCtau) of HS-20117, The AUCtau is defined as the area under the serum concentration-time curve during a dose interval time period(tau), From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose. A cycle is 28 days|[Phase Ib] PK parameters: Time to reach maximum observed serum concentration (Tmax) of HS-20117, The Tmax is defined as time to reach maximum observed serum concentration of HS-20117, From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose. A cycle is 28 days.|[Phase Ib] PK parameters: Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of HS-20117, The t1/2 is defined as the time it takes for the concentration levels to fall to 50% of their value., From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose. A cycle is 28 days.
This is a multicenter Phase Ib/III clinical study evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of HS-20117 in combination with aumolertinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study is divided into two phases, Phase Ib, a dose expansion study and Phase III, a confirmatory study. In the dose expansion phase (Phase Ib), HS-20117 will first be studied in combination with the standard dose of aumolertinib, to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK profile, and immunogenicity of HS-20117 in combination with aumolertinib in the target population, as well as to determine the recommended Phase III dose (RP3D). Following confirmation of the safety and efficacy of HS-20117 in combination with aumolertinib and RP3D in Phase Ib, a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter Phase III study will be initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of HS-20117 in combination with aumolertinib versus aumolertinib in the target population in the confirmatory study phase.
