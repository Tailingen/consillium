A Phase III Study of Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel in Combination with Atezolizumab As a Treatment for Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Hormone Receptor-positive HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
JCOG1919E (AMBITION) is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and paclitaxel in combination with atezolizumab comparing to bevacizumab and paclitaxel in patients with HR-positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer.
