National Registry for Egyptian Pediatric Neuromuscular Diseases
Our aim is to establish multi-center national Egyptian database of information for inherited and acquired neuromuscular diseases in infants and children from 0 to 18 years of age.
Spinal Muscular Atrophy|Muscular Dystrophy|Muscle Diseases|Myasthenic Syndromes|Polyneuropathies
Functional motor ability, Motor power in acquired acute neuromuscular diseases will be assessed at admission and morbidity and mortality at discharge from hospital.

Functional motor ability will be performed every 3 months for children with inherited neuromuscular diseases., 1 year
Cardio-pulmonary function, Pulmonary and cardiac function impairment., 12 months
Aims: An open-ended multi-center, national Egyptian study to collect and analyze data for children with Neuromuscular Diseases (NMD) inherited NMD (spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne/Becker and congenital muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD, CMD), congenital myopathies, and congenital myasthenic syndromes) and acquired NMD (neuropathies, myasthenia gravis and myositis).

Participants: Eligible infants and children with inherited and acquired neuromuscular diseases.

DESIGN: This study is a prospective cohort study.

Outcome measures: Motor development assessment, respiratory and cardiac examination.
