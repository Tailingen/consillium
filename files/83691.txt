A Study of Nivolumab in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether nivolumab monotherapy or in combination with Standard of care (SOC) therapies will provide clinical benefit (i.e., PFS, OS, and DOR) without unacceptable toxicity in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|OTHER: Best Supportive Care|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Crizotinib|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Groups A-D Only, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by investigators (per RECIST v1.1), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), Groups A-C Only, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death., up to approximately 60 months|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Both Study Drugs Discontinuation, Group E Only, Percentage of participants who experienced a treatment-related AE during the course of the study that lead to discontinuation of both study drugs., up to approximately 60 months
Duration of Response (DOR), Groups A-D Only, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from first confirmed response (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) to the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Median computed using Kaplan-Meier method., up to approximately 48 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Groups A-E, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number and percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the date of first dose and the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.

Confidence interval based on the Clopper and Pearson method., up to approximately 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), Group D Only, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death., up to approximately 60 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Group E Only, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by investigators (per RECIST v1.1), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 48 months
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)
