Time on Treatment With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), Uncommon Mutation Cohort: Time on treatment with EGFR-TKI assessed as the time from start of EGFR-TKI treatment until the end of treatment or death by any cause is reported.

Erlotinib was given as state of the art second-line therapy in 2014, and an EGFR mutation was clinically suspected due to the Long-Lasting response. However, due to the unavailability of tumor tissue, this could be proven only after liquid biopsy had subsequently become available at the center in 2016.
