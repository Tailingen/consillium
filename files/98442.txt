Neoadjuvant Immunoradiation for Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a pilot study of neoadjuvant 'immunoradiation' (durvalumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab) administered every 4 weeks for 2 doses, concurrently with standard thoracic radiation (RT) (45Gy in 25 fractions), with one dose of immunotherapy alone delivered in the pre-surgical window, prior to surgical resection, for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC that is deemed resectable with a lobectomy by a thoracic surgeon. If preliminary safety of the durvalumab/thoracic RT combination is established, a second cohort investigating the combination of durvalumab/tremelimumab/thoracic RT prior to surgical resection will be opened. After surgical resection, patients may receive standard adjuvant chemotherapy, as deemed appropriate by the treating investigator.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab|RADIATION: Thoracic Radiation|PROCEDURE: lobectomy|DRUG: Standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy
Toxicities as Measured by Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, Number of participants experiencing adverse events as defined by CTCAE v4.0., 3 months post surgery|Feasibility of Preoperative Immunoradiation, Number of participants with stage III resectable NSCLC who received durvalumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab concurrently with thoracic radiation (RT) in the pre-surgical window prior to surgical resection, for whom planned surgical resection was not delayed., Up to 3 years
Surgical Morbidity and Mortality, Number of participants who experience post-operative death. Calculated through log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards (PH) model. The values in the table represent the number of participants who experienced post-operative death., Up to 3 months post-surgery|Percentage of Participants With Pathologic Response, Percentage of participants with major pathologic response (MPR), partial response (PR) or no response (NR), where MPR is \>90% reduction in tumor cells, PR = 10-90% or NR = 0-10%. The percentage of patients whose tumor samples achieve MPR, PR and NR will be tabulated., Up to 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Radiologic Response, Percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), and stable disease (SD) as defined by RECIST 1.1 and immune-related RECIST criteria when treated with preoperative immunoradiation followed by surgery. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, PD is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, SD is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response as Measured by Recurrence-free Survival, Time from first evidence of response until recurrence when treated with preoperative immunoradiation followed by surgery. Calculated through log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards (PH) model., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Number of months alive after treatment with preoperative immunoradiation followed by surgery. Calculated through log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards (PH) model., Up to 3 years
