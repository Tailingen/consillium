Development and Validation of a New Digital Dermatoscope in the United States
A completely new type of digital dermatoscope has been developed in order to take a significant step forward in technology for skin cancer imaging. By means of this study a better insight can be gained of the current performance and workflow in clinical dermatoscopy. This knowledge will be used to further improve the developed technology.
Skin Cancer
DEVICE: Digital dermoscopy
Performance of the new device in its normal conditions of use, The outcome will be measured by a questionnaire with performance-related questions for clinicians to answer about a set of images from the collected database. A Likert-based scale will be used for the answers: from highly agree to highly disagree., 6 months|Usability of the new device, The outcome will be measured by a questionnaire with usability-related questions for clinicians., 1 month|Safety of the new device in its normal conditions of use, The number of adverse events will be reported to assess safety of the device., 1 year
Develop a database of skin images with the new device with metadata and histopathology of excised lesions, The outcome of the secondary objective will be an anonymized database of digital skin lesion images and corresponding metadata and a set of high quality images amenable to clinician evaluation., 1 year
