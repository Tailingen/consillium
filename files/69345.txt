Phase II Clinical Study of Pyrotinib in First-line Treatment of Primary HER2-amplified/Mutated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pyrotinib maleate as a first-line treatment for HER2-mutated or amplified non-small cell lung cancer. Pyrotinib maleate is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can irreversibly inhibit HER1, HER2, and HER4.
