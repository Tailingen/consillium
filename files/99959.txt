Randomized Phase II, Open-label Efficacy and Safety Study of Second-line Durvalumab Plus Tremelimumab Versus Platinum-based Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With NSCLC and First-line Checkpoint-inhibitor Therapy (Re-Check)
This is an open label, randomized, Phase II multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different second-line strategies: After failure of first line mono-immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PD-L1), and subsequent 2 cycles of standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy, 2 treatment arms will be compared: Arm A (Experimental Arm): After randomization, patients will receive a combination regimen featuring a single, priming dose of tremelimumab together with conventional durvalumab dosing. Durvalumab maintenance therapy will subsequently be continued as study treatment for up to 12 cycles.

Arm B: After randomization, patients will continue to receive another 2-4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Afterwards, patients will end treatment or receive maintenance pemetrexed therapy as per marketing authorization (depending on histology, maximum of 13 cycles) at the discretion of the investigator

PFS1, Progression-free survival 1 using Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1, defined as the time from randomization in the study until objective tumor progression and do not include deaths, 49 months
PFS2, Progression-free survival after initiation of second-line therapy, 49 months|OS, Overall survival after initiation of second-line therapy, 49 months|ORR, Objective response rate - Proportion of patients with CR or PR as best overall radiological tumor response counted from initiation of second-line treatment, 49 months|Subgroup analysis, Objective response rate (best overall response) after randomization, 49 months|DoR, Duration of response - Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression, 49 months|TFST, Time to first subsequent treatment - Time from initiation of second line treatment to initiation of third line treatment., 49 months|Tolerability and adverse events, Adverse events will be assessed by the type, seriousness, severity, and relatedness to treatment. A descriptive analysis of safety related laboratory parameters will complement the safety assessment., 49 months|QoL, Quality of Life measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 (core questionnaire) and the QLQLC13 (lung cancer module), 49 months
Patients without progression after two cycles of chemotherapy (induction treatment phase) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into one of 2 treatment arms (combination treatment phase). PD-L1 expression status will be evaluated based on available data. To better focus on patients with expected good clinical benefit from immunomodulating agents, only patients with checkpoint-inhibitor treatment as first-line monotherapy and a progression-free survival of at least 12 weeks will enter the study (at least two re-assessments after initiation of first-line treatment). Consequently, patients with disease progression as best response of first-line therapy cannot enter this study. Directly re-challenging patients with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA agents after disease progression on checkpoint-inhibitor monotherapy will be avoided by the previous application of two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy as induction treatment, which may also enhance the antigen release from tumor cells and may further support the subsequent immunotherapy.
