Study of Capecitabine and Cyclophosphamide Administered as a Single Pill in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
Primary Objectives:

* To assess the safety for each cohort of patients on a fixed-dose combination pill of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at flat dose and with metronomic schedule (defined as continuous daily treatment without interruption) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
* To assess the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and bioavailability of the fixed-dose combination pill of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at different doses/regimens by metronomic schedule in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess antitumor activity of the fixed-dose combination pill of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at different doses/regimens by metronomic schedule in patients with metastatic breast cancer given at 3 different doses and schedules (regimen 1=standard dose twice daily \[BID\], regimen 2=full dose once daily \[OD\], regimen 3=low dose \[OD\])
* Disease Control Rate (DCR)
* Overall Response Rate (ORR)
* Time to Progression (TTP) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1).
* To evaluate the compliance under treatment.
* To describe evolution of toxicities.
* To assess safety all along patient's treatment.

DRUG: Fixed-dose combination of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide SAR439281
Proportion of patients with adverse events, 12 weeks|Assessment of PK parameter: maximum concentration (Cmax), Daily 12 weeks|Assessment of PK parameter: time to reach Cmax (Tmax), Daily 12 weeks
Disease Control Rate (DCR), 12 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), 12 weeks|Time to Progression (TTP), 12 weeks|Proportion of patients compliant with treatment, 12 weeks
Primary objective will be evaluated at 12 weeks. Patients who show evidence of efficacy will be treated and followed-up until progression of the disease.
