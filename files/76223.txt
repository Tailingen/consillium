The Risk of Falls Index for Patients With Neuromuscular Disorders
The combination of short quantitatively assessing muscular function and balance in combination with short clinical scores, can be a new valid approach to evaluate the patient risk of fall and help to create a quick checkup test to prescribe an appropriate assistive device.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a short battery of clinical assessments used to determine risk of falling for patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD) based on correlation between clinical assessments between two groups of NMD patients and scales used to assess risk of falling for patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: The risk of falls
FBIndex, The primary goal of this project is to provide a short battery of clinical assessments used to determine risk of falling for patients with NMDs based on correlation between clinical assessments: Heel-Rise-Test, Chair-Rise Test, Semi-tandem stand, Trunk Rise Test, and Foot-tapping speed, Timed Up and Go test, 10 Meter Walk Test and Six Minute Walk test, between two groups of NMD patients and scales: "The Falls Efficacy Scale International FES-I" and "The Morse Fall Scale" used to assess risk of falling for patients., 2 years
