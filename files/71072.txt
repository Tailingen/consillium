Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic Characteristics, and Preliminary Efficacy Evaluation of GST-HG161
Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and preliminary efficacy evaluation of the selective c-MET inhibitor GST-HG161 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors: An open, single and multiple administration, dose escalation, and expanded phase I trial
Solid Tumor|C-Met Mutation-Related Tumors
DRUG: GST-HG161
DLT (Dose-Limiting Toxicity), DLT was defined as one of the following adverse events (AEs) observed in 27 days: Grade 4 hematologic AE; Grade \>=3 febrile neutropenia; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade \>=3 nausea, emesis, diarrhea and constipation, despite optimal treatment; Grade \>=3 non-hematological AE., Up to 27 days|MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose), MTD was defined as the dose level at which 1 out of 6 subjects or no one experienced a DLT., Up to 27 days
Area Under Curve (AUC), Plasma samples were collected at different points for pharmacokinetic analysis, Measured on 0,1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours in single-dosing stage and pre-administration of day 6, day 13, day 20 and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours of Day27 in the multiple-dosing stage.|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Plasma samples were collected at different points for pharmacokinetic analysis, Measured on 0,1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours in single-dosing stage and pre-administration of day 6, day 13, day 20 and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours of Day27 in the multiple-dosing stage.|Cl/F, Plasma samples were collected at different points for pharmacokinetic analysis, Measured on 0,1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours in single-dosing stage and pre-administration of day 6, day 13, day 20 and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours of Day27 in the multiple-dosing stage.|T1/2, Plasma samples were collected at different points for pharmacokinetic analysis, Measured on 0,1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours in single-dosing stage and pre-administration of day 6, day 13, day 20 and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours of Day27 in the multiple-dosing stage.|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete or partial response as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 4 months|PFS, PFS(Progression-Free-Survival) was the time from randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever came first., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 4 months
This is a phase I trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and preliminary efficacy GST-HG161.

There are 7 dose cohorts, including60mg, 150mg, 300mg, 450mg, 600mg, 750mg, 900mg QD in the dose escalation stage and GST-HG161 will be administered orally to patients once daily for each dose cohort. Recommended protocal in the dose expansion stage will be determined by the results in the dose escalation stage .
