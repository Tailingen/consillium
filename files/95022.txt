Study Of Intraductal Carboplatin In Women With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)
The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety of 100 mg carboplatin administered intraductally once on Day 1 or twice on Days 1 and 15 in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing surgical management 2 to 4 weeks following the Day 15 intraductal infusion. Secondary objectives are to characterize the biologic and clinical effects with respect to: pharmacokinetics, extent of disease on MRI and mammogram, histopathological assessment of DCIS, and biomarker measurement of Ki-67, TUNEL and G-actin.

This is a randomized, 3-arm, saline-controlled study involving women undergoing surgical management of DCIS. Forty-five (45) women who have been diagnosed with DCIS by core biopsy will receive intraductal administration of either carboplatin or normal saline (NS) into the DCIS-involved breast duct. Thirty (30) patients (i.e., 15 patients per arm) will receive two intraductal infusions of either 100 mg of carboplatin or NS on Days 1 and 15. Fifteen (15) patients will receive an intraductal infusion of 100 mg carboplatin on Day 1 and an intraductal infusion of NS on Day 15. Patients will undergo surgical resection 2 to 4 weeks following the Day 15 intraductal infusion (i.e. 4 to 6 weeks from diagnosis).

The effect of carboplatin on DCIS in the pre-treatment core biopsy specimen and the resection specimen will be assessed. Venous blood samples will be collected for carboplatin PK analysis pre-dose and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours following intraductal infusions on Days 1 and 15.
