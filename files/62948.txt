Dose-dense Chemotherapy Versus Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy as First-line Chemotherapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
To compare dose-dense chemotherapy with intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer.
Advanced Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Intraperitoneal chemotherapy
Progression-free survivals between this intraveous and intraperitoneal chemotherapy groups, months, 10 years
Overall survivals between this two groups, months, 10 years
Women aged 20 and above, diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stage II\~IV), who had received debulking surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (either dose-dense or intraperitoneal) at our institution between 01 January 2006 and 31 December 2018 were included in the study. Patient characteristics, any treatment related side-effects (peri-operative and post-operative complications, chemotherapy related adverse events), treatment response (complete or partial response, stable disease or progressive disease), post-treatment surveillance (disease status: disease-free, recurrence or cancer-related death) will be recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be employed to evaluate the survival benefit of the two different chemotherapy methods.
