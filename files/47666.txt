A Phase III Trial of Recombinant Human Apo-2 Ligand for Injection
The trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human Apo-2 ligand in treating patients with advanced retreated non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant human Apo-2 ligand for Injection|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Overall Survival（OS）, Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the patient, patients family or by checking the patients notes, hospital records, contacting the patients general practitioner or public death registry, where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws., From the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, Assessed up to 36 months
Progression - free survival（PFS）, Progression Free Survival (PFS) : the time from start of study treatment to the first documentation of objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, evaluate once every six weeks (± 7 days) and assessed up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate: the percentage of subjects who have at least one visit response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression, Every 6 weeks (± 7 days) up to 36 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate: the percentage of subjects who have at least one visit response of CR or PR or SD prior to any evidence of progression., Every 6 weeks (± 7 days) up to 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL), An evaluation is made every 3 weeks and until 30 days after the last medication
