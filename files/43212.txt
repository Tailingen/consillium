Comparable Study of Different Radiation Dose in Esophageal Carcinoma
Radiation therapy plus concurrent chemotherapy is now the standard therapy for patients with localized carcinoma of the esophagus selected for nonsurgical treatment. The standard radiation dose is 50-50.4Gy/1.8-2.0Gy/F.All of this were based on 2D radiation technology. Entering new century, 3D-CRT or IMRT has used on esophageal cancer. In China,the recommend radiation dose of concurrent chemoradiation was 60Gy. The study is a clinical phase III, randomized trial to compare the different radiation dose(60Gy vs 50Gy) of concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT or IMRT in patients with unresectable esophageal carcinoma.
