A Comparative Study of BAT1706 and EU Avastin® in Patients With Advanced Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase III, randomized, double blind, multicenter, active comparator, parallel two arm study to compare the efficacy, and to evaluate the safety, and immunogenicity of BAT1706 to EU Avastin® in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC) to demonstrate clinical equivalence of BAT1706 and EU Avastin®.
Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: EU Avastin®|DRUG: BAT1706|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: carboplatin
Overall Response Rate, The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR at Week 18 (ORR18) based on tumor response evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by CIR. Each patient will be assigned to one of the following RECIST 1.1 categories based on independent CIR, irrespective of protocol deviations or missing data:

CR: complete response. PR: partial response. SD: stable disease. PD: progressive disease. NE: not evaluable (insufficient data), Week 18
Progression Free Survival Rate, Progression free survival rate at 12 months, defined as the proportion of patients being alive without documented progression 12 months after randomization, using Kaplan-Meier method., 8 months,1 year and 2 years|Progression Free Survival Time, Progression free survival time defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented clinical or radiological progression or death due to any cause using Kaplan-Meier method., 8 months,1 year and 2 years|Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival rate at 12 months, defined as the proportion of patients being alive 12 months after randomization using Kaplan-Meier method., 8 months,1 year and 2 years|Overall Survival Time, Overall survival time defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause using Kaplan-Meier method., 8 months,1 year and 2 years|Overall Response Rate, ORR at Week 6 (ORR6) and ORR at Week 12 (ORR12), based on tumor response as assessed by CIR, and best ORR of confirmed responses at end of study assessed by local radiologist/Investigator if after Week 18 according to RECIST 1.1., Week 6 and Week 12|Duration of Response, Duration of response defined as the time from first documentation of a response (CR or PR) and the first documentation of progression (assessed by local radiologist/Investigator if after Week 18) according to RECIST 1.1., 8 months
Plasma Level of Anti Drug Antibodies (ADA) and Neutralizing Anti-drug Antibodies (NADA) Correlated With Bevacizumab Plasma Level, Plasma level of anti drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (NADA) correlated with bevacizumab plasma level, 12 months|Bevacizumab Plasma Exposure Following Treatments of BAT1706 or EU Avastin®, Bevacizumab plasma exposure following treatments of BAT1706 or EU Avastin®, 12 months
