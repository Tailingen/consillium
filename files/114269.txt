Pamiparib and Low Dose Temozolomide In Patients With Platinum Sensitive Biliary Tract Cancer
The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the activity of pamiparib plus low dose TMZ as maintenance treatment in improving progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced BTC who have received first line platinum-based chemotherapy.

The primary objective is to test with a one-sided type I error of 10% whether pamiparib plus low dose TMZ as maintenance treatment increases PFS according to RECIST (version 1.1) in the entire study population as compared to standard treatment with Cisplatin-Gemcitabine chemotherapy regimen (or Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin if cisplatin is contra-indicated).

This is an open label randomized controlled multi-center phase II trial.

Patients must meet all the criteria to be eligible. Eligible patients will be centrally randomized between the two arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by the following factors:

* Tumour response CR/PR vs SD vs non-measurable/non-PD after previous platinum-based chemotherapy as confirmed by central review
* Tumour location (intrahepatic bile ducts vs. gallbladder vs. perihilar bile ducts and distal bile duct and /ampulla of Vater tumours).

Patients will receive treatment until progression or for a maximum period of 2 years.

Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival according to RECIST v1.1 from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months, 36 months from randomization
Incidence of adverse events (safety and toxicity), Assessment of adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0 - From date of randomization until the date of end of treatment visit or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 25 months, 25 months from randomization|PFS as per central review, PFS as per central review assessment from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months, 36 months from randomization|overall survival (OS), Overall survival from date of randomization until the date of end of treatment visit or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months, 36 months from randomization|Best overall response, Best overall response according to RECIST v1.1 from date of randomization until the date of end of treatment visit or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months, 36 months from randomization|Global Health Status/Quality of Life/physical functioning, Global Health Status/Quality of Life/physical functioning assessed with EORTC QLQ-30 questionnaire from date of randomization until 6 months thereafter or until date of death from any cause, whichever came first.

This instrument is composed of multi-item and single-item scales. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), three symptom (fatigue, nausea and vomiting and pain) and a global health status/QoL scale and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties).

The scales range from 0 to 100 with the worst score being 0 for functioning scales and 100 for symptom scales., 6 months from randomization|Jaundice scale, Jaundice scale assessed with EORTC QLQ-BIL21 questionnaire from date of randomization until 6 months thereafter or until date of death from any cause, whichever came first.

The Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder Cancer Module (QLQ-BIL21) is a supplementary questionnaire module to be employed in conjunction with the QLQ-C30. The QLQ-BIL21 incorporates five multi-item scales to assess eating, jaundice, tiredness, pain and anxiety. In addition, three single items assess treatment side-effects, drainage bags/tubes and weight loss.

The scales range from 0 to 100., 6 months from randomization
