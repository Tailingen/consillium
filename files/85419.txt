Relationship Between Hand Dynamometer Measurements, PFT, and mFI With Postoperative Outcomes
The study will take place at SBÜ Ankara Atatürk Sanatorium Training and Research Hospital and will include 100 patients over the age of 40 who are scheduled for lung malignancy surgery after 01 April 2024. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients, who will be assigned a number from 1 to 100.

For patients over 40 years of age who are scheduled to undergo lung malignancy resection surgery, demographic data including age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis, comorbidities, and ASA (American Society of Anaesthesiologist) score will be recorded. In addition, hand grip strength measurement, pulmonary function test, and modified frailty index (a scoring system that includes 11 parameters) will be recorded prior to surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative complications will be documented. The duration of the patient's stay in the intensive care unit, chest tube removal, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications will also be recorded. A follow-up call will be made to the patient by the responsible researcher 90 days after the operation to inquire about any complications that may have developed within that time frame.

The study aims to investigate the relationship between preoperative hand grip strength measurement, pulmonary function test analysis (PFT), and modified frailty index with the duration of intensive care unit stay, chest tube withdrawal time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications in patients undergoing lung resection due to malignancy.
