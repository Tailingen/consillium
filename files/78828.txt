Ga-68-PSMA-11 in Men With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to provide access to Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET for evaluation of male veterans with newly diagnosed or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. All patients will receive conventional imaging (MRI, CT, and/or a molecular imaging bone scan) as well as Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET in order to evaluate the utility of diagnostic testing in patients with positive PSA status, a comparison of results from conventional imaging and PSMA PET imagining will be performed.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Ga-68-PSMA-11
Concurrence with Conventional Imaging, Localized vs extra-pelvic recurrence will be determined for each patient based on Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT and standard-of-care radiological imaging, Up to 28 days
Participants (male veterans) with initial diagnosis of prostate cancer or biochemically recurrent disease that consent to participate in the study will receive both conventional imaging (MRI, CT, and/or molecular imaging bone scan) as well as Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Following baseline assessment (Visit #1), Ga-68-PSMA-11 (3-7 mCi) will be administered as a single intravenous administration with PET/CT performed approximately 60 minutes after injection (Visit #2A). At approximately 120 minutes after injection of Ga-68-PSMA-11, the final evaluation for safety and tolerability will occur (Visit #2B)
