TPF Followed by Cetuximab and IMRT Plus Carbon Ion Boost for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Tumors
TPF-C-HIT investigates the combination of induction chemotherapy with TPF followed by radioimmunotherapy with cetuximab and IMRT plus carbon ion boost with regard to efficacy and toxicity of the combination regimen.
Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN): Oro-, Hypopharyngeal and Laryngeal Cancer
RADIATION: carbon ion boost

TPF-C-HIT is a prospective, monocentric phase II trial efficacy, as measured by control and survival rates, as well as toxicity (acute and late effects) of the combined treatment with TPF-induction followed by radioimmunotherapy with the EGFR-antibody cetuximab and carbon ion boost in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). As long-term local control remains a therapeutic challenge in advanced head and neck cancer, locoregional control was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints are survival rates (disease-free survival, PFS, OS), acute and late radiation effects as well as adverse events. For development of prognostic markers, proteomic and genomic analyses are also included in the secondary endpoints.
