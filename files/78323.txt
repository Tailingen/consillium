Fotemustine and Dacarbazine Versus Dacarbazine +/- Alpha Interferon in Advanced Malignant Melanoma
This study evaluated two chemotherapy regimens with and without the addition of interferon in patients with advanced or recurrent melanoma.
Malignant Melanoma|Recurrent Melanoma
DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Fotemustine|DRUG: Interferon Alfa-2b
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause or the date of last follow-up for living patients.

OS curves were estimated with the Kaplan - Meier (K-M) method and treatments were compared with a two - sided log - rank test., 24 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of progression of disease or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, or date of last follow-up for patients without progression and alive at the end of the study.

PFS curves were estimated with the Kaplan - Meier (K-M) method and treatments were compared with a two-sided log-rank test., 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) included Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR).

Complete Response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all symptoms and signs of all measurable disease, lasting for at least four weeks, without appearance of new lesions.

Partial Response (PR) was defined as a \> 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, lasting for at least four weeks, without appearance of new lesions or enlargement of existing lesions., 18 weeks from start of therapy|Treatment Related Toxicity, worst grade CTC toxicity, for each cycle and overall, will be reported for each treatment arm, at end of each 3 week cycle of therapy up to the discontinuation
This study evaluated two chemotherapy regimens with and without the addition of interferon in patients with advanced or recurrent melanoma.
