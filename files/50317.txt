Cyclin B1 Peptide-Pulsed Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine for Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Despite recent advances in the treatment of patients with resected NSCLC, disease recurrence and mortality related to lung cancer are common among patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore novel approaches are necessary to improve the outcome for early stage NSCLC. The preclinical studies conducted with vaccine based approaches provide the rationale to evaluate this as an adjunct to surgery for patients with early stage NSCLC. Administration of the vaccine before surgery will also allow for the evaluation of the tumor specimen for immunological responses to the vaccine.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Cyclin B1 Peptide
Evaluate the ability of cyclin B1 peptide pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine to induce an immune response., One week after second vaccine
In the currently proposed study, patients will receive the first dose of the vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery. The second dose will be administered about 3-4 weeks following surgery. A booster dose of the vaccine will be given 6 months after the 2nd vaccine. The tumor tissue and serum will be studied for immunological responses following therapy with the vaccine. Patients are allowed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated. The choice of the chemotherapy regimen will be at the discretion of the treating physician, preferably 3-4 cycles of platinum combination regimen. The vaccine should be administered at least 2 weeks before chemotherapy is initiated.
