Promoting Organizational Capacity to Implement Cancer Control Programs Among Latino Churches
This research study aims to develop an organizational-level intervention to enable communities to adopt, adapt, implement and sustain evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to address cancer disparities among Latinos. The investigators partner with faith-based organizations, since they play a highly prominent role in Latino community life. This three-phase study will: (1) improve understanding of the organizational infrastructure, skills and resources required by Latino churches to implement EBIs for cancer control, (2) develop a capacity-building intervention; and (3) test the intervention's effectiveness in a randomized trial.
