Studying Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With Rhabdomyosarcoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.

Serum miR-206 as a biomarker for RMS
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether circulating muscle-specific microRNAs, especially serum miR-206, are potential biomarkers for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).

OUTLINE: Archived serum samples are analyzed for miR-206 expression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 samples from patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), 15 from patients with embryonal RMS, and 10 from patients without RMS will be accrued for this study.
