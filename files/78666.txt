A Phase II Clinical Study of Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Patients With High-risk Prostate Cancer
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an effective and safe treatment for low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer(PCa). However, there is no study that has investigated the effectiveness and safety of SBRT with pelvic radiation and gross target volume(GTV) boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients yet. The investigators designed a phase II clinical study of SBRT with pelvic radiation and GTV boost based on mpMRI in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.
