CPX-351 (Vyxeosâ„¢) for Transplant Eligible, Higher Risk Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is a pilot and feasibility study of transplant eligible, higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients to determine the safety and tolerability of a lower -dose and higher-dose CPX-351 regimen, with secondary objectives including complete remission (CR) rates and proportion of patients proceeding to transplant.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: CPX-351|PROCEDURE: Research skin biopsy|PROCEDURE: Research blood draw|PROCEDURE: Research bone marrow aspirate
Safety and tolerability of a CPX-351 regimen in a transplant eligible, higher risk MDS population as measured by the proportion of participants who experience an adverse event by patient, type of event, and grade of event, Through 56 days after the last dose
Overall response rate in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, * Overall response rate = complete remission + marrow complete remission + partial response + hematologic improvement
* Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, 56 days after the last dose|Best overall response in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, -Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, 56 days after the last dose|Remission duration in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, * Defined as the interval from the date complete remission is documented to the date of recurrence. This is determined only for patients achieving a complete remission.
* Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, Through 5 years|Relapse-free survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, -Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, Through 5 years|Progression-free survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, * Defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study drug to disease progression or death from MDS.
* Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, Through 5 years|Overall survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, -Defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Through 5 years|Complete remission + marrow complete remission rates in patients treated with CPX-351, -Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, 56 days after the last dose|Post-induction mortality in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, -Rate of death, Day 30|Post-induction mortality in MDS patients treated with CPX-351, -Rate of death, Day 60|Safety and feasibility of CPX-351 consolidation therapy in MDS patients as measured by the proportion of patients who experience an adverse event by patient, type of event, and grade of event, Through 56 days after the last dose|Proportion of MDS patients treated with CPX-351 proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, Through 56 days after the last dose|Overall survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, -Defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Day 100|Overall survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, -Defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., 1 year|Non-relapse mortality in MDS patients treated with CPX-351 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, Day 100|Non-relapse mortality in MDS patients treated with CPX-351 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, 1 year|Event-free survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, * Defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study drug to date of treatment failure, recurrence, or death due to any cause.
* Patients will be assessed for response according to modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for MDS, Day 100|Event-free survival in MDS patients treated with CPX-351 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, * Defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study drug to date of treatment failure, recurrence, or death due to any cause.
