A Phase II Randomized Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Targeted Therapy or Cancer Immunotherapy Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer of Unknown Primary Site
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of molecularly-guided therapy versus standard platinum-containing chemotherapy in participants with poor-prognosis cancer of unknown primary site (CUP; non-specific subset) who have achieved disease control after 3 cycles of first-line platinum based induction chemotherapy.
Cancer of Unknown Primary Site
DRUG: Alectinib|DRUG: Vismodegib|DRUG: Ipatasertib|DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab Subcutaneous (SC)|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Entrectinib|DRUG: Ivosidenib|DRUG: Pemigatinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), This efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of MGT vs platinum chemotherapy in term of PFS in participants with CUP whose best response to 3 cycles of platinum induction chemotherapy was assessed CR, PR, or SD., From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, until 330 PFS events were observed (approx. 4.3 years for MGT Cat 1 and 3.4 years for Chemotherapy Cat 1).
Overall Survival (OS), From randomization to death from any cause (approx. 4 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Two consecutive occurrences of complete or partial response >/=4 weeks apart (up to approximately 4 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), From the first documentation of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), From randomization to death from any cause, through the end of study (approximately 4 years)
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of molecularly-guided therapy versus standard platinum-containing chemotherapy in participants with poor-prognosis cancer of unknown primary site (CUP; non-specific subset) who have achieved disease control after 3 cycles of first-line platinum based induction chemotherapy.
