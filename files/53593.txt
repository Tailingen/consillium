EGFR mutations are detected in about 50% of East Asian NSCLC and 10% of Western NSCLC. EGFR-mutant NSCLC harbors distinct genomic architecture including high ITH, early diversification, genome instability, low background mutation rates. But despite its high ITH, EGFR-mutant NSCLC usually have better prognosis than NSCLC with other driver mutations even without the application of targeted therapies, indicating that EGFR mutations may have distinct impacts on cancer evolution. This study intends to investigate the genomic architecture, cancer evolution trajectories and their relationship with clinical outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers for this population that could potentially guide therapeutic decisions and improved clinical outcomes.
