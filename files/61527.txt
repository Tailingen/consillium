Comparison of PET Imaging Patterns With PSMA and AR Expression in Prostate Cancer and Bladder Cancer
Patients suffering either from newly diagnosed very high risk locally advanced and/or oligometastatic prostate cancer (cohort A), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC, cohort B), newly diagnosed postate cancer with planned radical prostatectomy (cohort C) or primary bladder cancer with planned radical cystectomy (cohort D) as identified by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, will be included.

PET imaging patterns using PSMA- and FDHT PET scans will be correlated with prostate-specific membrane antigen and androgen specific receptor expression patterns in prostate cancer and bladder cancer.
