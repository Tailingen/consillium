Effects of High-intensity Training Compared to Resistance Training in Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy
The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a high-intensity aerobic training and resistance training on fatigue in prostate, head and neck and rectum cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.

A three-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Patients will be randomised into either a high-intensity aerobic training group or a resistance training group or a control group. Participants in the training groups will exercised for five to eight weeks. Exercise sessions will be take place 3 days per week under the supervision of an experienced therapist. Subjects will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The primary outcome will be fatigue measured using the FACIT-fatigue questionnaire. The secondary outcomes will be: functional capacity, quality of life, executive functions, sleep disturbances, somnolence syndrome, insomnia, depression symptoms.
Prostate Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Rectum Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: High-intensity interval training|BEHAVIORAL: Resistance training
Change in fatigue, Fatigue is measured by FACIT-fatigue questionnaire, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)
Change in functional capacity, Functional capacity is measured by 6-minute walk test, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in quality of life, Quality of life is measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in sleep disturbances, Sleep disturbances are measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in somnolence syndrome, Somnolence syndrome is measured by Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in insomnia, Insomnia is measured by Insomnia Severity Index, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in depression symptoms, Depression symptoms are measured by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in executive functions, Executive functions is measured by the Trail Making Test, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Change in dyspnea, Dyspnea is measured by Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile, Assessments at baseline and 5 weeks (rectum cancer) or 7 weeks (head and neck cancer) or 8 weeks (prostate cancer)|Adherence, Percentage of completed sessions, Weekly through the intervention (during 8 weeks)
