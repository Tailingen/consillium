Iberdomide Vs. Iberdomide Plus Isatuximab Maintenance Therapy Post ASCT in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare a maintenance therapy consisting of iberdomide and isatuximab with an iberdomide-only regimen. The trial is the subsequent maintenance therapy to GMMG-HD8/DSMM XIX trial for patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. The main question it aims to answer is:

• Will the addition of isatuximab lead to decreased amounts of measurable myeloma cells in the bone marrow after two years?
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Iberdomide|DRUG: Isatuximab|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Demonstration of superiority of iberdomide plus isatuximab compared to iberdomide with respect to bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD)., The primary objective of this trial is to compare the two-year MRD negativity rate (sensitivity 2x10\^-6 via next-generation flow cytometry \[NGF\]; from bone marrow aspirate) when treated with iberdomide plus isatuximab, with the MRD negativity after treatment with iberdomide only., 24 months after start of maintenance therapy
Progression-free survival (PFS) from date of randomization., PFS, defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Prospective, multicentre, randomised, parallel group, open, phase III clinical trial for a maintenance therapy, for patients who underwent an induction therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in the GMMG-HD8/DSMM XIX trial.

Investigational Medicinal Product: Iberdomid (oral), isatuximab (subcutaneous administration via a wearable injector system).

Randomisation will be performed centrally by GMMG/DSMM offices after verification of the eligibility of the patient. At the time of study inclusion, randomization will be performed into arm A (iberdomide) or arm B (iberdomide + isatuximab). Randomization will be stratified by centrally assessed MRD negativity status (yes vs. no vs. unknown); assessed by NGF from BMA; sensitivity of 10\^-5; independent of standard IMWG response) and number of HDM/ASCT (single vs. tandem).

Patients randomized in arm A will receive 39 cycles of the drug iberdomide, a Cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Modulating Drug (CELMoD®) that shares structural similarities to the immunomodulatory compounds (IMiDs) such as thalidomide and lenalidomide. Each cycle will last for 29 days. Patients in arm B will receive the same the 39 cycles of iberdomide plus monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody isatuximab subcutaneously. In both arms, patients will receive 20 mg dexamethasone in cycle 1, on the same days as the isatuximab administration in Arm B. End of study will be after 36 months of the maintenance therapy.

There is one primary objective:

- Demonstration of superiority of iberdomide plus isatuximab compared to iberdomide with respect to bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rates (sensitivity 2x10\^-6 via next-generation flow cytometry \[NGF\]) after two years of maintenance therapy.

There is one key secondary objective:

- PFS, defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

Further secondary objectives are:

* Rates of sustained MRD negativity (at sensitivity levels of 10-5 and 2x10\^-6 via NGF from BMA) after 1, 2 and 3 years of maintenance therapy.
* Conversion from MRD positive to negative (at sensitivity levels of 10\^-5 and 2x10\^-6 via NGF from BMA).
* Rates of best overall response to treatment (BOR).
* Rates of partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR) and stringent complete response (sCR).
* Time-to-next-treatment (TTNT).
* PFS on subsequent line of therapy.
* Overall survival (OS).
* Improvement of IMWG response categories (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR).
* Proportions of patients in both treatment arms maintaining BOR and CR from baseline.
* Assessment of quality-of-life (QoL) via the EORTC-QLQC30, EORTC-QLQMY20, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires.
