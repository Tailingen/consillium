Impact of 5-fraction Stereotactic Partial Breast Irradiation and Whole Breast Irradiation on Cosmetic Outcome and Patient-reported Outcomes in Early-stage Breast Cancer
This study aim to investigate the effect of 5-fraction stereotactic partial breast irradiation and whole breast irradiation on patient-reported outcomes, cosmetic outcome, and breast tissue fibrosis in early-stage breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Partial breast irradiation|RADIATION: Whole breast irradiation
Change of patient reported psychosocial functioning score, Patient reported psychosocial functioning measured in 7 point Likert scale, Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy)|Change of patient reported psychosocial functioning score, Patient reported psychosocial functioning measured in 7 point Likert scale, 2 year after radiotherapy (allowed to plus 8 weeks)|Change of patient reported patient treatment satisfaction score, Patient reported patient treatment satisfaction measured in 7 point Likert scale, Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy)|Change of patient reported patient treatment satisfaction score, Patient reported patient treatment satisfaction measured in 7 point Likert scale, 2 year after radiotherapy (allowed to plus 8 weeks)|Change of patient reported physical functioning score, Patient reported physical functioning measured in 7 point Likert scale, Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy)|Change of patient reported physical functioning score, Patient reported physical functioning measured in 7 point Likert scale, 2 year after radiotherapy (allowed to plus 8 weeks)|Change of patient reported body image score, Patient reported body image score measured in 7 point Likert scale, Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy)|Change of patient reported body image score, Patient reported body image score measured in 7 point Likert scale, 2 year after radiotherapy (allowed to plus 8 weeks)|Change of breast cosmesis measures (excellent/good/poor), breast cosmesis result is measures by BCCT.core (Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic results) software

- Investigators will whether there are any changes on patient-reported outcomes, cosmetic outcome, and breast tissue fibrosis after radiotherapy. Any differences of theses parameters according to the radiotherapy techniques (PBI vs. WBI) will be examed., Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy|Change of breast cosmesis measures (excellent/good/poor), breast cosmesis result is measures by BCCT.core (Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic results) software, 2 year after radiotherapy (allowed to plus 8 weeks)|Change of breast-tissue fibrosis measures (gram), breast-tissue fibrosis is measured by tissue compliance meter device., Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy|Change of breast-tissue fibrosis measures (gram), breast-tissue fibrosis is measured by tissue compliance meter device., 2 year after radiotherapy (allowed to plus 8 weeks)
Incidence of Radiotherapy-related complications, Investigators will check whether there are any kinds of radiotherapy-related complications after PBI or WBI. Any differences of complications according to the radiotherapy techniques will be examed., Before radiotherapy (allowed to 8 weeks before radiotherapy)|Incidence of Radiotherapy-related complications, Investigators will check whether there are any kinds of radiotherapy-related complications after PBI or WBI.
