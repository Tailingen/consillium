A Multicenter, Open-label Study for E7040 in Japanese Subjects With Hypervascular Tumor and Subjects With Arteriovenous Malformation
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial embolization with E7040 in Japanese subjects with hypervascular tumor or arteriovenous malformation
Hypervascular Tumor and Arteriovenous Malformation
DEVICE: E7040
Success Rate of Embolization in the Target Vessel, Embolization performance was graded per 1 of 4 levels: (1) complete embolization, 100% disappearance of contrast enhancement in the target vessel as evaluated by post-embolization digital subtraction angiography; (2) intensive embolization, ≥80% disappearance; (3) moderate embolization, ≥50% and \<80% disappearance; (4) mild embolization, \<50% disappearance. Success rate was obtained by calculating the percentage of complete embolization and intensive embolization cases. Embolization performance evaluated by both the Imaging Evaluation Committee and by the Investigator or Subinvestigator., Day 1 (embolization) up to Day 30 after treatment
Success Rate for Operability of Embolization, Operability and usability were evaluated by the Investigator on the basis of the sense of resistance when E7040 was injected, and how smoothly the microspheres could pass through the catheter. The evaluation criteria are very easy to use, easy to use, difficult to use, very difficult to use. Success rate was obtained by calculating the percentage of very easy to use and easy to use cases., Day 1 (embolization) up to Day 30 after treatment
