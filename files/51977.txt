A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Oral SB939 Administered Alone or With Azacitidine
This is an open label, dose escalation study with 3 arms (Arms A, B, and C). Arm A will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SB939 in cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors. Arm B will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses in cohorts of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Arm C will assess the safety and tolerability of SB939 in combination with standard azacitidine therapy.
