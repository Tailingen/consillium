Hypoxic Red Blood Cells for Burns and Hematological Malignancies at Haukeland University Hospital
The overall objective of this study is to collect preliminary safety data on the transfusion of hypoxic RBCs, manufactured with the Hemanext ONE device, in patients with burns and patients with hematological malignancies. The Hemanext ONE device received CE mark in April 2021.

Evolution of the Hemoglobin Level Before and After the Transfusion., The difference in measured hemoglobin (grams/dL) between pre-transfusion and up to 30 minutes post-transfusion., 1 days|Calculation of the Hemoglobin Increment After Transfusion Corrected for Patient Blood Volume and Hemoglobin Dose, The hemoglobin increment from each transfusion will be determined by calculating the difference between the subject's post-transfusion and pre-transfusion hemoglobin (g/dL). It will then be corrected for estimated subject blood volume and the amount of Hb transfused.

The following equation used for the hemoglobin increment calculation:

HgB Increment = (Subject's HgB level post-transfusion - Subject's HgB pre-transfusion)/ (total HgB transfused x Subject's BloodVolume)

Equations for calculating the hemoglobin increment may be found in the following publication: Wendelbo Ø, Opheim EN, Hervig T, Felli Lunde TH, Bruserud Ø, Mollnes TE, Reikvam H.

The primary objective is to assess hypoxic RBCs safety and tolerance assessment up to 24 hours following the transfusion initiation and overall up to 7 days (+/- 1 day) after the transfusion episode (single transfusion course).

Secondary objectives include the following.

1. Assessment of pre and post transfusion hemoglobin levels
2. Assessment of hemoglobin level before the following transfusion, if applicable
3. Assessment of AEs occurrence:

   i. Up to 7 days (+/- 1 day) post transfusion, in comparison with historical control (including but not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion associated circulatory overload, anaphylactic shock, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction).

   ii. Up to the subsequent transfusion episode or up to 28 days (+/- 1 day) after the initial transfusion, whichever comes first.

   iii. From enrollment, up to their subsequent transfusion or 28 days (+/- 1 day) post transfusion, whichever comes first, through the assessment of patient's diary.
4. Assessment of the vital signs during and up to 15 minutes after the transfusion.
