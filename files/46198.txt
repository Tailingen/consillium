Enzalutamide vs. Abiraterone in Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
This study will be a retrospective data analysis to compare outcomes between patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who initiated enzalutamide and those who initiated abiraterone using the 100% Fee-For-Service Medicare claims data. The study will address the following objectives:

Primary objective: To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC who initiated enzalutamide vs. abiraterone

Secondary objectives:

* To compare OS in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC who received only enzalutamide without any subsequent therapy vs. abiraterone without any subsequent therapy
* To compare treatment duration and time to subsequent therapy in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients initiating enzalutamide vs. abiraterone
Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant
DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate
Overall Survival (OS): Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW), OS (time to death) was defined as the time from the initiation of enzalutamide or abiraterone (i.e., index date) to the date of death. Participants who did not die were censored at their last available follow-up, which was defined as the earlier of disenrollment from Medicare or end of data availability. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From index date to date of death or censoring date, whichever occurred first (from 10-Sep-2014 to 31-Dec-2020, approximately 76 months); retrospective data extracted and evaluated from study start date and until study completion (approximately 10 months)
OS Among Participants Without Any Subsequent Therapy: IPTW, OS (time to death) was defined as the time from the initiation of enzalutamide or abiraterone (i.e., index date) to the date of death. Participants who did not die were censored at their last available follow-up, which was defined as the earlier of disenrollment from Medicare or end of data availability. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From index date to date of death or censoring date, whichever occurred first (from 10-Sep-2014 to 31-Dec-2020, approximately 76 months); retrospective data extracted and evaluated from study start date and until study completion (approximately 10 months)|Treatment Duration: IPTW, Treatment duration of the index treatment was defined as the time from the initiation of enzalutamide or abiraterone (i.e., index date) to the discontinuation date. Discontinuation was defined as the earliest of 1) death, 2) last observed administration plus day of supply associated with last administration, or 3) day before the start of next line of therapy. Death, a gap of 90 days or more after the last observed prescription date + day of supply, and initiation of next line of therapy was considered as discontinuation events. Participants who did not discontinue were censored at their last available follow-up, which was defined as the earlier of disenrollment from Medicare or end of data availability., From index date to date of discontinuation event or censoring date, whichever occurred first(from 10-Sep-2014 to 31-Dec-2020, approximately 76months); retrospective data extracted and evaluated from start date and until completion(approximately 10months)|Time to Subsequent Therapy: IPTW, Time to subsequent therapy was defined as the time from the initiation of enzalutamide or abiraterone (i.e., index date) to the start of next line of therapy. Participants who did not start a new line of therapy were censored at their last available follow-up, which was defined as the earliest of 1) death, 2) disenrollment from Medicare, and 3) end of data availability., From index date to start of next line of therapy (from 10-Sep-2014 to 31-Dec-2020, approximately 76 months); retrospective data extracted and evaluated from study start date and until study completion (approximately 10 months)
