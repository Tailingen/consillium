A Study on BReast Cancer Patient Care Using chAtbot and Video Education for Radiation Therapy (BRAVE)
This randomized trial explored whether digital media (videos and chatbots) used for patient education could more effectively reduce anxiety in breast cancer patients during radiation therapy, compared to traditional paper-based methods. Post-surgery breast cancer patients scheduled for radiation therapy were assigned to groups receiving treatment information through different media combinations. The study aimed to assess whether these modern tools more effectively ease anxiety, thus potentially improving patient compliance and treatment experience.

APAIS(Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale), The Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS): The APAIS consists of six self-reported items, primarily assessing anxiety associated with anesthesia and surgery., baseline, before radiation therapy, after all radiation, an average of 1 month
STAI-X(State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults), The STAI is a widely recognized self-report instrument for gauging anxiety levels., baseline, before radiation therapy, after all radiation, an average of 1 month|LASA(Linear Analog Scale Assessments), LASA is a tool to measure a patient's self-assessment of various aspects of their health and wellbeing., baseline, before radiation therapy, after all radiation, an average of 1 month
This study evaluates the impact of patient management and information provision using educational videos and chatbots on patient experience, satisfaction, and patient psychology in the breast cancer radiation treatment process.

The experiment is designed as (2 (with or without using chatbot) X 2 (with or without using video) to distinguish groups.

There is no separate treatment intervention in addition to use chatbot and video utilization.
