Pemetrexed as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
Docetaxel-based therapy has been shown to prolong survival as first-line therapy for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), and has become the standard of care. The beneficial effects of any therapy in HRPC may be diverse and include reduction in tumor bulk (when measurable), reduction in prostate-specific antigen PSA, reduction in symptoms (particularly pain), or stabilization of disease. Clear reductions in tumor bulk or PSA may provide objective evidence of a treatment effect, and stabilization of disease may be just as clinically meaningful in patients who are actively progressing prior to starting therapy. Pemetrexed has shown a broad array of activity in many diseases that until now were thought to be non-responsive to chemotherapy in the second-line setting.

This trial is designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacogenetics of pemetrexed as a single agent in subjects with HRPC whose disease has progressed following one prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimen for HRPC.

Best Overall PSA Response, Best overall Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response

PSA response is defined by a greater than or equal to 50% decline in PSA confirmed by a second PSA value at least 4 weeks after the first PSA response timepoint PSA Stable Disease is defined as less than a 50% decline in PSA and less than a 50% increase in PSA from baseline PSA progression is defined as greater than or equal to a 50% increase in PSA compared to baseline, Start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (for life)
Overall Survival, From study enrollment until death (for life)|OBJECTIVE Overall Response Rate, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Objective overall response rate is defined as Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)

Per RECIST:

CR= Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level PR= Disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of non-target lesion(s) or maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits OR at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter and disappearance of all non-target lesions or persistence of non-target lesion(s) or maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits, Start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (for life)|Rate of Clinical Benefit, A clinical benefit is defined as an improvement for at least 3 consecutive weeks in at least one of the following parameters without any sustained worsening in any other:

\> 50% reduction in analgesic consumption or \> 50% reduction in pain intensity or \> 20 point gain in performance status., Any time among evaluable subjects (for life)|Safety and Tolerability, Safety and Tolerability was evaluated by reporting the percentage of patient who experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE v3.0 criteria.

OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

* Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 will be administered intravenously over approximately 10-minutes on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
* Folic Acid (350-1000 mcg. PO daily) will be taken by patients to reduce toxicity. At least 5 daily doses of folic acid must be taken during the 7-day period preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing should continue during the full course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed.
* Vitamin B12 (1000 Âµg) will be administered as an intramuscular injection during the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given the same day as pemetrexed.
