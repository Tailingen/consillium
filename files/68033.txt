Discontinuation of Imatinib Mesylate in Patients With Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Previously Treated With Interferon-Alpha
To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) previously treated with interferon-alpha (IFN) and presently on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, or nilotinib) with achievement of a complete cytogenetic and at least a major molecular remission, are able to discontinue therapy and maintain a durable remission. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate at 1 year after discontinuation of TKI will be the measurement of this objective.
