A Dose-escalating Pilot Study of Orelabrutinib for Newly-diagnosed PCNSL
This is a single arm, single center, open label pilot study of Orelabrutinib combined with Rituximab, high-dose (HD) Methotrexate and Dexamethasone in newly-diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphpoma (PCNSL). The purpose is to evaluate the safety and to find the optimal dose of Orelabrutinib and Methotrexate in this combination treatment for newly-diagnosed PCNSL patients.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Methotrexate (MTX)|DRUG: Dexamethasone
define the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) contour of Orelabrutinib and MTX, A BOIN waterfall design will be employed. Two dose levels of Orelabrutinib (dose level 1: 150 mg/d, dose level 2: 200 mg/d) and two dose levels of MTX (dose level 1: 3.5g/m2, dose level 2: 5g/m2) will be investigated, generating 4 dose combination. DLT was defined by the occurrence of severe toxicities during the first cycle: any grade 4 hematologic toxicity, grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage, or any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity that failed to respond to supportive therapy and possibly related to orelabrutinib and/or MTX (assessed according to NCI CTCAE V5.0), From the start of the first dose of Orelabrutinib to the end of the first cycle of induction treatment (21 days/cycle)
ORRi, ORRi is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR, CRu or PR during induction therapy, At the end of cycle 6-8 (each cycle is 21 days)|CRi, CRi is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or CRu during induction treatment, At the end of cycle 6-8 (each cycle is 21 days)|TTR, Time to response during induction therapy, At the end of cycle 6-8 (each cycle is 21 days)|ORRm, ORRm is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR, CRu or PR during maintenance therapy, At the end of completion of 1 year of maintenance treatment|CRm, CRm is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or CRu during maintenance therapy, At the end of completion of 1 year of maintenance treatment|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is calculated from the date of start of therapy until the date of first documented progress or death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the duration from start of treatment to time of death., Up to 2 years
concentration of Orelabrutinib, To detect the blood and CSF concentration of Orelabrutinib, The blood and CSF concentration of Orelabrutinib will be evaluated 1.5-2 hours after Orelabrutinib administration before first day of cycle 3.(each cycle is 21 days)|gene mutations and frequency, The types of gene mutations and frequency of tumor are measured by whole exon sequencing., At baseline|cytokine in the CSF, The levels of cytokine will be analyzed by flow cytometry., At the baseline, day 1 at cycle 3, 5 (21 days/cycle), and every 3 months in the maintenance stage (up to 1 year))|circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the CSF, The levels of ctDNA will be analyzed by next-generation sequencing., At the baseline, day 1 at cycle 3, 5 (21 days/cycle), and every 3 months in the maintenance stage (up to 1 year))
The eligible patients will be treated with Orelabrutinib combined with Rituximab, high-dose Methotrexate and Dexamethasone during induction treatment (6-8 cycles; 21 days/cycle): Rituximab 375 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1; HD-MTX 3.5 g/m2 intravenous infusion (3h), d2; Dexamethasone 10-15 mg, iv, d1-4. Orelabrutinib will be given 72h after MTX infusion or until MTX clearance. The study will investigate optimal dose combination of Orelabrutinib and MTX implementing BOIN waterfall design. The starting dose of Orelabrutinib is 150 mg/d and the dose will be escalated to 200 mg/d, throughout the whole cycle. Meanwhile, the starting dose of MTX is 3g/m2 and will be escalated to 5g/m2, throughout induction phase. Dose escalation and movement in dose matrix will be determined by BOIN algorithm. For CR/CRu patients after completion of induction treatment, daily Orelabrutinib will be administered as maintenance treatment for up to 1 year or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, informed consent withdrawal or lost of follow up (whichever occurs first). Patients will be evaluated every 2 cycles during induction therapy and every 12 weeks during maintenance therapy.
