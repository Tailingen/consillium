ENVELOP: Wound Care Following Pilonidal Sinus Surgery
This is a single-blinded, multicentre, prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing post-operative and patient-reported outcomes for patients undergoing application of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after sinus tract excision as compared to excision and standard open wound care in chronic pilonidal sinus disease (PSD).

DEVICE: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy
Time to complete wound healing, Number of days to complete epithelialisation or closure of the wound without any discharge, drainage, scab, and/or the requirement for further dressing. The quality of wound healing will be assessed using a validated patient and observer reported scar assessment tool-POSAS., 6 months post surgery
Measure of post operative pain, Pain measured by visual analogue pain scores which is a scale from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain), between the NPWT and SWC Groups., 6 months post surgery|Measure of post operative complications, Measure of post operative complications between the NPWT and SWC Groups, 6 months post surgery|Measure of quality of life, To compare quality-of-life differences between the two groups from the time of surgery until wound healing is achieved using the, 6 months post surgery|To investigate resource use, To investigate resource use and thereby cost effectiveness of NPWT versus standard wound care, 6 months post surgery|To compare recurrence rates, To compare the 6-month recurrence rates (recurrence being defined as the development of a new sinus or abscess within the natal cleft occurring after wound healing had been achieved) between the NPWT and SWC Groups, 6 months post surgery|Health-related quality of life with the EuroQol-5 dimensions five level index questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), The questionnaire covers five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems (1), slight problems (2), moderate problems (3), severe problems (4) and extreme problems (5). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The raw scores are also converted to an EQ-5D index value using a scoring algorithm (British tariff) ranging from -0.594 (worst perceived health state) to 1.00 (best perceived health state), 1 month|Health-related quality of life with the EuroQol-5 dimensions five level index questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), The questionnaire covers five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression.

The component scores are then added together; the worst scar would receive a score of 60, while the best scar would receive a score of 6, 1 month|Scar assessment - using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), The POSAS is made up of two scales: the patient scale and the observer scale; each of the six components is scored numerically on a scale of 1 to 10.

Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin and subcutaneous tissues arising from hair follicles in the natal cleft. The definitive aetiology of the condition is unknown, however, it is theorised that it is the result of either the obstruction and subsequent inflammation of hair follicles or secondary to hair penetrating through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue. This results in infection, abscess formation, chronic discharge and pain. PSD is a common condition affecting 26 per 10,000 population, with the prevalence reaching 1.1% in young adult males.

PSD causes a significant burden on healthcare services due to high rates of recurrence and readmission following surgery, together with negative impacts on patients' quality of life and self-image. An effective management strategy for the disease is necessary to ensure that post-operative outcomes are optimised and patient-reported outcomes are satisfactory in those whose PSD requires surgery.

The objective of this multicentre, national RCT is to prospectively investigate the effect of negative pressure wound therapy compared to leaving open with standard wound care on time to wound healing following surgical excision of chronic PSD.
