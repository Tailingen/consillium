An Investigational Scan (Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Diffusion Weighted Imaging) for the Evaluation of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases Treatment Response
This trial evaluates the treatment response of colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver (liver metastases) using intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM DWI). IVIM DWI is new kind of imaging scan that may help measure changes in disease before and after chemotherapy in patients with colorectal liver metastases.

PROCEDURE: Diffusion Weighted Imaging
Absolute change in the true diffusion coefficient (D), The absolute changes of parameter D between response and nonresponse groups will be compared using a two-sample t-test., Up to 3 months or 5 months (each cycle is 28 days)
Diffusion related parameters in intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion weighted imaging, Up to 3 months or 5 months (each cycle is 28 days)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine whether intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can detect a difference between the changes in the diffusion related parameters in patients before and after chemotherapy between responders and nonresponders.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Use respiratory-triggered DWI and quantitative T2 maps for the evaluation of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) after treatment.

II. Assess whether changes in these parameters correlate to pathologic treatment response (percent necrosis) determined on pathology.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo IVIM DWI over 10 minutes during standard of care MRI within 30 days of starting chemotherapy and after 4-6 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy.
