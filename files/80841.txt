This observational study has been planned to evaluate the effectiveness of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated advanced FL patients, in the real world setting in Italy. The study will allow to collect real-life data in a significant number of Italian patients when compared to participants in pivotal studies of obinutuzumab and thus will allow to verify in routine practice (after physician hands-on) the effectiveness and safety management in 50 reference sites all over the country.
