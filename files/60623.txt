A Phase 0 Multicenter Study of the Pharmacodynamic Effects of Intratumoral Microdose Administration of PBA-0111 in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, single arm, open-label, localized pharmacodynamic biomarker Phase 0 trial designed to study the biological effects within the tumor microenvironment of PBA-0111 when administered intratumorally in microdose quantities via the CIVO device.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma Adult|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: PBA-0111
Quantification of Cell Death and Immune Cell Biomarkers by immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and In-Situ Hybridization (ISH), Quantification of biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative cells will be performed within the tumor microenvironment around each of the injection sites in each resected patient sample by IHC and/or ISH. An aggregate analysis of this quantification may be done across patient samples to evaluate trends in tumor response. The biomarkers evaluated may include, but are not limited to, drug targets (e.g., GARP, Cluster of Differentiation 16), biomarkers for cell death (e.g., cleaved caspase 3), natural killer cells (e.g., Cluster of Differentiation 56/Cluster of Differentiation 45/Granzyme B), macrophages (Cluster of Differentiation 86, Cluster of Differentiation 68, Cluster of Differentiation 163), and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon-stimulated gene 15, chemokine interferon gamma-inducible protein 10)., 1-2 days after microdose
Number of Patients with Adverse Events, Relationship of adverse event (AE) to study drug(s) or CIVO device will be determined using an AE Relatedness Grading System, Up to 28 days after microdose injection.
CIVO is a research tool composed of a hand-held single-use sterile injector coupled with fluorescent tracking microspheres called CIVO GLO that mark the sites of drug microdose injection, enabling rapid assessment of multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations simultaneously within a patient's tumor. In this Phase 0 intratumoral microdosing study in human patients with localized or metastatic primary HNSCC, STS, or TNBC tumors (who will be undergoing previously planned tumor and regional nodes dissection), we will evaluate PBA-0111's ability to trigger a variety of immune-mediated effector functions that kill tumor cells, within the local tumor microenvironment. The CIVO device penetrates solid tumors and delivers subtherapeutic microdoses of up to eight anti-cancer agents or combinations of anti-cancer agents co-injected with CIVO GLO into discrete regions of the tumor. At the time of the planned surgical intervention (one to two days after the CIVO microdose injection), the injected tumor tissue is then excised, and tumor responses are assessed via histological staining of tumor cross-sections sampled perpendicular to each injection column. Co-injection with CIVO GLO enables identification of each injection site during resection as well as in tissues stained for analysis. Because the platform delivers microdose amounts of each test agent or combination directly into the patient's tumor tissue, hypotheses can be tested earlier in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of the 2006 FDA Exploratory IND Guidance for Industry.
