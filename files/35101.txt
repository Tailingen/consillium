Prolonged Nightly Fasting in Breast Cancer Survivors
This study is being done to examine whether fasting for 13 hours every night is feasible and if it can help breast cancer survivors lose weight and improve their health.

* Previous studies have found that women who are overweight or obese when their breast cancer is found (diagnosed) have a greater risk of their breast cancer recurring. Recent research suggests that prolonged nighttime fasting (\>13 hours) may improve the risk of recurrence for breast cancer.
* This study will examine if fasting for 13 hours per night is doable for participants and will also study what the effect of fasting is on quality of life, mood, fatigue, body size, and markers of health in the blood.

BEHAVIORAL: Fasting
Percentage of Participants adhere to 13 hours of fasting, Feasibility will be demonstrated if â‰¥60% of participants adhere to 13 hours of fasting nightly at least 70% of the nights during the intervention.

Adherence will be assessed through patient-reported fasting logs., 12 weeks
Change in body mass index (BMI) (kg/m^2), Summarize changes from the baseline to follow-up assessment including calculation of the effect size (mean within-subject difference divided by standard deviation of differences) (kg/m\^2). Body mass index calculated using patient height (meters) and weight (kilograms) measured at baseline and at the completion of the study intervention. BMI = weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters., 12 weeks|Quality of life (QOL) Change using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Scale (FACT-G), FACT-G is a 0-108 scale, with lower scores corresponding to worse overall QOL and higher scores corresponding to better overall QOL. Summarize changes from the baseline to follow-up assessment including calculation of the effect size (mean within-subject difference divided by standard deviation of differences), 6 and 12 weeks|Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (min score: 0; max score: 21. A higher score indicates more anxiety and/or depression), Effects of prolonged nightly fasting on psychological well-being using The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Summarize changes from the baseline to follow-up assessment including calculation of the effect size (mean within-subject difference divided by standard deviation of differences), 6 and 12 weeks|Change in fatigue as assessed by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue, 13-item patient-reported measure of fatigue with a 7-day recall period. Items are scored on a 0 - 4 response scale with anchors ranging from "Not at all" to "Very much so". To score the FACIT-fatigue, all items are summed to create a single fatigue score with a range from 0 to 52. Higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.Summarize changes from the baseline to follow-up assessment including calculation of the effect size (mean within-subject difference divided by standard deviation of differences, 6 and 12 weeks|Change in physical activity using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, Calculated score where patient-reported weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities are multiplied by nine, five, and three, respectively. Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by summing the products of the separate components, as shown in the following formula:

Weekly leisure activity score = (9 x Strenuous) + (5 x Moderate) + (3 x Light), 6 and 12 weeks|Change in lipid profile, Summarize changes from the baseline to follow-up assessment including calculation of the effect size (mean within-subject difference divided by standard deviation of differences).

This research study involves fasting (not eating any food or drinking fluids that contain calories) for 13 hours nightly for 12 weeks.

* It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.
* Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments prior to starting the intervention.

  * Baseline assessments include measurements of weight, height, quality of life, fatigue, mood, levels of physical activity, and blood markers.
  * Assessments will be repeated at the completion of the 12-weeks

This is a a Feasibility Study, which means this is the first time that investigators are examining prolonged nightly fasting and its effect on breast cancer survivors body size, blood markers, quality of life, emotional regulation, fatigue and level of physical activity.
