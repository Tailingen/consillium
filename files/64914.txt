Improving Adherence Healthy Lifestyle With a Smartphone Application Based After Surgery in Cancer Patients
Background: The cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lymphatic system and can develop immediately after surgery / radiotherapy of breast cancer, or may appear months later. In the literature there are numerous educational recommendations to avoid the appearance BCRL, but there is a lack of adherence to these recommendations. With the increase of mobile technologies among adults, the mobile devices can be an effective method to meet their education.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness of therapeutic adherence a brief educational intervention through a smartphone-based application in the prevention of lymphedema in women with mastectomies.

Method: 100 women survivors of breast cancer will be randomized to a group that will receive lymphedema prevention education and an app specific for better adhesion compared to the control group will receive education only. They will be monitored for 28 weeks by specific measures of lymphedema onset, volume and perimeter arm and hand strength lymphedema disability questionnaire and other measures of fatigue, quality of life and mood related to cancer.

Discussion: The lack of adherence to health education is the main cause of failure in maintaining these brief educational interventions, whether the program is beneficial, it could be successfully implemented in clinical practice.
Secondary Prevention
OTHER: health education for lymphedema prevention
volume and perimeter arm, Water Displacement (volume) Is performed by the water displacement method, a volumeter to reference point 16 cm proximal to the olecranon, with a Tª of 21ºC. The upper limit is 65% of the distance from the olecranon to the acromion.

Circumferential Measurement (Perimeter) The patient should be seated both arms on a table, shoulder in neutral rotation and in flexion of 45º, forearm in maximun supination, is measured at intervals of 5 cm along both arms, using elbow crease as starting point., baseline and 18 weeks
hand strength, It´s a standardized method to evaluate the hand strengh and it´s relation to the function of the upper extremity. Is done with a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer, has 5 fixed grip posititons., baseline; 18 and 28 weeks|Quality of Life Breast CAncer QLQ-BR23 questionnaire, The QLQ-BR23 consist of 23 items, is divided in dimennsions as body image, sexuality, future perspective and side-effects to different treatment modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy., baseline; 18 and 28 weeks|Cancer related fatigue questionnaire, Quick-Piper scale, self- administered, a 15 items. Consists of 4 subjetive dimensions. Offers the important advantage of brevity., baseline; 18 and 28 weeks|volume and periemter arm, Water Displacement (volume) Is performed by the water displacement method, a volumeter to reference point 16 cm proximal to the olecranon, with a Tª of 21ºC.
