HDI Versus Chemotherapy as Systemic Adjuvant Therapy for Resected Mucosal Melanoma
This is a a multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase III trial comparing High-Dose IFN-a2b with Temozolomide Plus Cisplatin as Systemic Adjuvant Therapy for Resected Mucosal Melanoma.The study objective is to compare efficacy and safety of High-dose IFN-a2b and temozolomide-based chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.
Melanoma
DRUG: Temozolomide Plus Cisplatin|DRUG: High-Dose IFN-a2b
Relapse-free survival (RFS) of high-dose IFN-a2b (HDI) and temozolomide-based chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for resected mucosal melanoma., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 24 months
Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS) of high-dose IFN-a2b (HDI) and temozolomide-based chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for resected mucosal melanoma., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 24 months|Overall survival (OS) of high-dose IFN-a2b (HDI) and temozolomide-based chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for resected mucosal melanoma., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 48 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events of high-dose IFN-a2b (HDI) and temozolomide-based chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for resected mucosal melanoma, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 12 months
The patients who comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The estimated recruiting duration is 36 months. Patients with resected mucosal melanoma were randomized into two groups: HDI group (group A, treated with i.v. 15×10\^6U/m\^2/d IFN-a2b on days 1 to 5 each week for 4 weeks, followed by s.c. 9×10\^6U IFN-a2b three times per week for 48 weeks), and chemotherapy group (group B, per os 200 mg/m\^2/d temozolomide on days 1 to 5 plus i.v. 75 mg/m\^2 cisplatin divided into 3 days,which was repeated every 3 weeks for six cycles). All patients will be followed for at least 2 years.
