Pemetrexed Maintenance in Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma Who Completed First Line Platinum-based Chemotherapy
This study aims to verify superiority of pemetrexed maintenance to observation for patient without disease progression after 1 st line cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: Folic Acid|DRUG: Vitamin B12 Injection|DRUG: Dexamethasone
progression free survival, Time between randomization and disease progression or death from any causes, whichever came first. Alive patients free of progression will be censored at the last follow-up, Every 9 weeks, from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression upto 24 months
objective response rate, Objective response rate will be measured according to RECIST 1.1, every 9 weeks, assess the best overall response from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression upto 24 months|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Safety assessed per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03, every 3 weeks for pemetrexed group, every 9 weeks for observation group from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression upto 24 months|overall survival, Time interval between randomization and death (all causes). Alive patients will be censored at the last date of news or data cut off, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 1 year after the end of treatment|Quality of Life, QoL will be assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionaire, before randomization, then 9, 18, and 27 weeks after randomization
Patients with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis who do not experience disease progression after 4 to 6 cycles of 1 st line chemotherapy administration.

After completion of 4-6 cycles, patients without disease progression on CT which is taken within 3 weeks after administration of the last chemotherapy will be randomized within 4 weeks after administration of the last chemotherapy to assign either maintenance group or observation group.

Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 mixed in normal saline 100 mL as a 10 minute IV infusion on day 1 of each 21 day cycle, with vitamin supplementation (folic acid 1000μg daily orally from 7 days prior to treatment initiation and vitamin B12 1000 μg IM 7 days prior to treatment initiation and then every 3 cycles). Thereafter, vitamin B12 can be injected on the same day of pemetrexed infusion. Dexamethasone 4 mg orally twice daily for 3 days beginning the day before treatment to minimize cutaneous reactions.

Treatment continues until occurrence of disease progression or intolerable toxicities upto maximum of 16 cycles.
