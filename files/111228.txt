Venetoclax in Addition to Sequential Conditioning With Fludarabine / Amsacrine / Ara-C (FLAMSA) + Treosulfan for Allogeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With MDS, CMML or sAML
This trial aims to find the MTD of Venetoclax when added to Fludarabin, Amsacrine and Ara-C + Treosulfan and to evaluate whether the addition of Venetoclax to sequential conditioning with FLAMSA + Treosulfan is safe for allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation in patients with high-risk MDS, CMML or sAML (FLAMSAClax)
