Study of ABT-510 (Thrombospondin Analogue) in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
The goals of this clinical research study are to see how individuals with advanced head and neck cancer respond to treatment with the new drug thrombospondin (ABT-510) and to learn how effective it is in destroying cancer cells. The safety of ABT-510 and the effect ABT-510 has on cells in the body will also be studied.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: ABT-510
Response Rate, Response rate defined as percentage of number of complete response or partial response in total number of participants treated. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>30% decrease in sum longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, reference baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD): \>20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, reference smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1/\> new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD, reference smallest sum LD. Trial conducted by Simon's optimal two-stage design and response rate estimated accordingly. For status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements confirmed by repeat assessments performed at 6 weeks, no less than 4 weeks after criteria for response is first met., Baseline to 6 weeks for PR or CR response assessment (minimal 4 week cycle + assessments). Overall study period 3 years.
This is a phase Ib/II, single-center, open-label study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and biologic efficacy of ABT-510 (thrombospondin). Participants will be patients with incurable head and neck cancer.

Patients will begin at a fixed dose level of thrombospondin subcutaneously twice daily. Cycles of treatment are 28 days (4 weeks). Patients will be treated with thrombospondin until progression of tumor or toxicity.
