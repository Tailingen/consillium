Study on the Diagnosis of Ground-glass Lung Cancer by Microwave Ablation Combined With Puncture Biopsy
This study is a multicenter study. It plans to screen 200 patients with pulmonary nodule lesions with ground glass as the main body, take CT thin-layer scanning 3D reconstruction, apply AI and fragment omics technology to evaluate the risk of malignant transformation of pulmonary nodules, and use microwave ablation to treat pulmonary nodules and combine intraoperative rapid pathology technology to determine the nature of puncture tissue and the degree of ablation, and then explore the optimal ablation time and ablation power.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation combined with biopsy
Local contral rate, LCR is the rate of CR, PR plus SD, up to 36 months|Recurrence-free survival, It estimates the recurrence-free rate of patients who have already survived, with no history of metastasis, a certain period of time., up to 36 months|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., up to 36 months
Detection rate, The detection rate of early lung cancer was calculated, up to 36 months
To explore the optimal ablation time, To explore the optimal ablation time, up to 36 months|To explore the optimal power selection, To explore the optimal power selection, up to 36 months
Combining AI and fragmentomics technology, this study enrolled 200 patients with ground-glass lung cancer for comprehensive evaluation. By collecting detailed characteristic data of ground-glass lung cancer, including nodule diameter, average CT value, solid component ratio (CTR), nodule morphology and other related signs, CT imaging and AI technology, and fragmentomics technology were used for comprehensive analysis to form a set of joint strategies to efficiently screen and diagnose patients with early lung cancer.

Microwave ablation is used to treat lung nodules, and intraoperative rapid pathology technology is used to determine the nature of the punctured tissue and the degree of ablation (observing pathological changes in the lesion area, including cancer cell death and fibrosis of the lesion tissue), determine whether the lesion has been completely ablated, or whether there are residual active cancer cells, and then explore the optimal ablation time and ablation power.

Finally, long-term follow-up of patients after microwave ablation, including collection of intraoperative/postoperative complication data, regular CT review, evaluation of treatment effect, monitoring for recurrence, and improving individualized treatment plans for patients.
