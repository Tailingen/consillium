Tele-Navigation of Lung Cancer Screening (Tele-Navi LCS)
Adherence to annual follow up is critical to achieving mortality benefits and optimizing cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening (LCS). However, adherence to LCS follow-up in the real world is suboptimal. Using telehealth, the investigators will co-create Tele-Navigation of Lung Cancer Screening with patients and LCS stakeholders as an intervention to promote adherence of follow-up LCS. The investigators will then implement the Tele-Navi LCS intervention to a pilot sample of patients and evaluate its feasibility in the primary care setting. The investigators will measure the number of patient participants who completed Tele-Navi LCS and follow-up LCS within 180 days from Tele-Navi LCS.
