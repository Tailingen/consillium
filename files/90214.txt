Awareness About Breast Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in French women, with 52000 new cases each year.

Shift work and night work is recognized by International Agency for Research on Cancer as a potential risk factor. Epidemiological studies find, for most of them, an increased risk of breast cancer compared with general population. Physiological hypothesis rely on the melatonin role in defense against tumorigenesis.

According to High Authority of Health clinical good practice guidelines, the risk does not justify more screening than the organized screening. We do not have information about awareness level of workers in health structures, specially in the Hospices Civils de Lyon.

Investigators would like to know how employees take part to breast cancer screening, specially in night workers.

This study, as a survey, is a first step to evaluate the need for specific actions to increase the participation to breast cancer screening.
