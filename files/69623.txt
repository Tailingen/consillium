A Phase I Study of MK-2206 in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (MK-2206-003)
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and tolerability of several dose levels of MK-2206 in combination with chemotherapy and targeted therapy agents in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The primary hypotheses are that administration of MK-2206 in combination with either carboplatin + paclitaxel, docetaxel, or erlotinib in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors will have acceptable tolerability, a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of ≤30%, plasma exposure and pharmacodynamics that exceed target thresholds, and allow for definition of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in each of the 3 combinations.

DRUG: MK-2206|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: erlotinib|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: corticosteroid
