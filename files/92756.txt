A Trial Using ARV-471 or Anastrozole in Post-Menopausal Women With Breast Cancer Prior to Surgery
This trial is a Phase 2 neoadjuvant study evaluating ARV-471 or anastrozole in post-menopausal women with ER+/HER2- localized breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: ARV-471|DRUG: Anastrozole|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection of breast tumor
Evaluate the effects of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively, on Ki-67 expression in tumors after 2 weeks of treatment, Percent change in Ki-67 expression between baseline and C1D15 tumor biopsies, 2 weeks
Evaluate the safety/tolerability of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively, Incidence of all adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation, From signing of consent to minimum of 30 days after last administration of study drug|Evaluate the pathological response of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively (pathologic stage), Pathologic stage at the time of surgical resection, Approximately 5.5 months|Evaluate the pathological response of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively (pathologic complete response rate), pathologic complete response rate at the time of surgical resection, Approximately 5.5 months|Evaluate the pathological response of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively (modified Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index score), modified Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index score at the time of surgical resection, Approximately 5.5 months|Evaluate the clinical response of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively (breast conserving surgery rate), rates of breast conserving surgery, Approximately 5.5 months|Evaluate the clinical response of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively (radiographic response), radiographical response rate in the primary tumor during cycle 6, Approximately 5 months|Evaluate the clinical response of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively (caliper-based response), Best percentage change from baseline up to C6D1 in caliper measurement of the primary tumor, Approximately 5 months
This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, non-comparative proof of concept study of ARV-471 or anastrozole in participants with ER+/HER2- breast cancer amenable to definitive surgical resection. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the biological activity of ARV-471 and anastrozole, respectively.
