Bintrafusp Alfa in Previously Treated Patients With R/M Non-keratinizing NPC
This would be a phase II prospective single arm mono-institutional study conducted in Queen Mary Hospital (Hong Kong) assessing the efficacy and safety of bintrafusp alfa in previously treated patients with recurrent and metastatic (R/M) non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Recurrent Carcinoma|Metastatic Cancer|Non-keratinizing Carinoma
DRUG: Bintrafusp Alfa
Evaluation of Objective Tumour Response, To evaluate the objective tumor response (ORR) to bintrafusp alfa in previously treated R/M NPC patients per response evaluation criteria of solid tumor (RECIST) version 1.1, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years
Progression-Free survival assessment, To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST version 1.1, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Time-to-progression (TTP) assessment, To assess the time-to-progression (TTP) per RECIST version 1.1, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Median Survival, To assess the median survival, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Toxicity and Tolerability measurement, To measure the toxicities and tolerability in previously treated R/M NPC patients receiving bintrafusp alfa with the most updated version of CTCAE criteria, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate ORR, PFS and TTP per immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to irRECIST, assessed up to 2 years|Survival rate assessment, To measure the survival rate in 12 months and 24 months, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) evaluation, To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in previously treated R/M NPC patients receiving bintrafusp alfa, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Investigate the relationship between the response to bintrafusp alfa and plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, EBV-DNA will be determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the clearance (half-life) during the first 4 weeks of bintrafusp alfa will be measured. The half-life will be correlated with patients ORR, PFS, and OS, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of patients with a CR, PR, or SD â‰¥ 6 months per RECIST 1.1, From the date of screening to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the duration to first documented tumor response, From the date of screening to first radiographically documented tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 2 years|Quality of Life (QoL), To evaluate via the patient-reported EORTC-QLQ-C30 and H\&N-35 questionnaires, Every 12 weeks from the date of screening in the first year of study enrolment
All the patients must be registered with the Investigator(s) prior to initiation of treatment. The registration desk will confirm all eligibility criteria and obtain essential information (including patient number). Patients shall receive Bintrafusp alfa treatment through intravenous therapy every two weeks up until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 2 years. Survival Follow-up till 2 years will also be performed.
