Effect of Low-dose Radiotherapy on Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Oligometastases of NSCLC After Immunotherapy
The purpose of this phase â…¡ trial was to investigate the effect of low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) on the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in oligometastasis, oligoprogression, and oligopersistence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after immunotherapy. At least 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at Hetian District People's Hospital.

Analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment, mIHC: Multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the collected pathological tissue samples(before LDRT (5Gy/5f) and up to 24h after LDRT) using equipment such as fluorescence microscope and flow cytometer. To reveal the effect of LDRT on the tumor immune microenvironment by detecting the expression of different immune markers., 12 months
Number of participants with Adverse Events and/or Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measurement of Safety and Tolerability of Low Dose Radiotherapy, Number of participants with Adverse Events and/or Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measurement of Safety and Tolerability of Low Dose Radiotherapy, 48 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Investigator assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. Progression free survival is defined as time of enrollment to first evidence of progressive disease up to 48 months after the enrollment, 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the difference (in months) between the date of study enrollment to the date death due to any cause up to 48 months after the enrollment, 48 months
LDRT targeting oligometastases has been shown to enhance anti-tumour immunity by reprogramming the TME, thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to collect pathological tissues from oligometastasis, oligoprogression, and oligopersistence of NSCLC after immunotherapy before LDRT (5Gy/5f) and up to 24h after LDRT in order to apply multiplexed fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mIHC) for evaluation of the tumor immune microenvironment. This study will be able to investigate the effect of LDRT on TME in oligometastatic lesions of NSCLC after immunotherapy and assess the efficacy and safety of LDRT.
