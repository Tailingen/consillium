Effect of ICCAUT Strategy on Postoperative Urinary Dysfunction After Radical Rectal Cancer Surgery
In this study, the bladder training include intermittent urethral catheter clamping combined with active urination training, which the investigators called ICCAUT strategy. This prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial will recruit participants with rectal cancer. The participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the ICCAUT group or the free-drainage group. In the ICCAUT group, the participants will undergo intermittent clamping of the urinary catheter prior to its removal. Each time the catheter is released, the investigators will encourage the participants to actively initiate urination to facilitate complete bladder emptying. While participants in the free-drainage group will not receive any specific training. The urinary catheter will be removed on the second day after the surgery for both groups after the bladder is empty. The primary endpoint is the incidence of urinary dysfunction, which include secondary catheterization or incomplete bladder emptying. Secondary endpoints include urinary tract infection, time to first urination after catheter removal, catheter-related bladder discomfort syndrome, postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as urinary function within 30 days.
Urinary Dysfunction|Rectal Cancer|Urinary Catheterization|Urinary Retention Postoperative
PROCEDURE: ICCAUT|PROCEDURE: Free drainage
Rate of urinary dysfunction, Urinary dysfunction is defined as the presence of residual urine volume greater than 100ml, as estimated by bladder ultrasound, after the first voiding following catheter removal, or the need for a second catheterization., within 7 days after the first time of urethral catheter removal
Rate of Urinary tract infections, A urinary tract infection is characterized by an inflammatory response in the urinary tract epithelium resulting from bacterial invasion. To diagnose a urinary tract infection, the following criteria must be met simultaneously: 1) urinalysis indicating a bacterial count above the upper limit of normal and 2) positive urine culture., within 1 days after the first time of urethral catheter removal|The time to first voiding after catheter removal, The time to first voiding after catheter removal refers to the duration, measured in hours, from the moment the catheter was removed until the patient spontaneously voids for the first time., within 1 days after the first time of urethral catheter removal|Graded assessment of catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD), CRBD is a questionnaire given to the patients, to investigate the severity of the discomfort of patients to the urinary catheter, within 1 days after the first time of urethral catheter removal|International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form is used to evaluate the incontinence of voiding. The minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 21. A higher score means a worse outcome, on the second day after the first time of urethral catheter removal, and at the 30th day after surgery|Postoperative complications, Complications that occur within 30 days after the operation will be evaluated and documented according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Complications of grade II or higher were analyzed., within 30 days after the operation|International Prostate Symptom Score, International Prostate Symptom Score is used to evaluate the severity of urinary difficulties. The scoring range ranges from 0 to 35 points for asymptomatic to severe symptoms. There are three levels of severity: 0-7 is mild, 8-19 is moderate, and 20-35 is severe., on the second day after the first time of urethral catheter removal, and at the 30th day after surgery|Incidence rate of residual urine volume greater than 200 ml after the first voiding, Incidence rate of residual urine volume greater than 200 ml after the first voiding, within 1 days after the first time of urethral catheter removal
Urinary catheter placement is a routine procedure performed in proctectomy. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty regarding the need for bladder training before catheter removal. The purpose of this trial is to examine the impact of bladder training on the urinary retention and secondary catheterization following proctectomy.

In this study, the bladder training include intermittent urethral catheter clamping combined with active urination training, which the investigators called ICCAUT strategy. This prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial will recruit participants with rectal cancer. The participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the ICCAUT group or the free-drainage group. In the ICCAUT group, the participants will undergo intermittent clamping of the urinary catheter prior to its removal. Each time the catheter is released, the investigators will encourage the participants to actively initiate urination to facilitate complete bladder emptying. While the participants in the free-drainage group will not receive any specific training. The urinary catheter will be removed on the second day after the surgery for both groups after the bladder is empty. The primary endpoint is the incidence of urinary dysfunction, which include secondary catheterization or incomplete bladder emptying. Secondary endpoints include urinary tract infection, time to first urination after catheter removal, catheter-related bladder discomfort syndrome, postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as urinary function within 30 days.

This trial aims to investigate whether ICCAUT strategy, achieved through intermittent clamping of the catheter combined with active urination training in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery, can impact the rate of urinary dysfunction compared to direct catheter removal. The findings from this study will provide valuable evidence regarding the manipulation of urinary catheters and help guide clinical practice.
