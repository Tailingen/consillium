Sequences Of REGorafenib And Trifluridine/Tipiracil in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
A randomized, phase II study comparing the sequences of regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil, after failure of standard therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Regorafenib then Trifluridine/Tipiracil|DRUG: Trifluridine/Tipiracil then Regorafenib
To evaluate the feasibility of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R), The feasibility of the treatment sequence is defined as the percentage of subjects able to receive both regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil according to the sequence in 3rd and 4th line. Subjects will be considered as having received both 3rd and 4th lines if they are administered at least two cycles of each line of therapy, i.e. percentage of patients being treated until the first tumor evaluation., Expected duration of 5 months from randomization
To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of Overall Survival rate, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time interval from randomization until death from any cause., Expected duration of 9 months from randomization|To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of the progression-free Survival 1 (PFS1), Progression-free survival 1 (PFS1) is defined as the time interval from randomization until death or the disease progression observed in the first sequence of treatment in each arm, evaluated using Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Expected duration of 3 months from randomization|To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of the Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) is defined as the time interval from randomization until death or the disease progression is observed in the later sequence of treatment in each arm, evaluated using RECIST v1.1., Expected duration of 6 months from randomization|To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of the Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as percentage of patients with a best response that is not progressive disease (PD) (either complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], or stable disease \[SD\]) during treatment. DCR will be assessed in each study arm., Expected duration of 6 months from randomization|To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of the Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as percentage of patients with a best response being either complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] during treatment. ORR will be assessed in each study arm., Expected duration of 6 months from randomization|To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of the Time-to-treatment failure 1 (TTF1), Time-to-treatment failure 1 (TTF1) is defined as the time from randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason (including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient preference, or death) during the first sequence of treatment in each arm., Expected duration of 3 months from randomization|To evaluate the efficacy of treatment sequence (R-TT or TT-R) in terms of the Time-to-treatment failure 2 (TTF2), Time-to-treatment failure 2 (TTF2) is defined as the time from randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason (including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient preference, or death) during the second sequence of treatment in each arm., Expected duration of 6 months from randomization|To evaluate the health-related quality of life of cancer patients during treatment, Quality of life data using the patient reported outcomes, quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30) version 3.0 will be collected during the study.

Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Expected 30 days after last study treatment administration, up to 5 years|To evaluate the performance status deterioration, The time to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≥2 deterioration is defined as the time interval between randomization and the first documented ECOG PS ≥2 during the study., Expected 30 days after last study treatment administration, up to 5 years|To evaluate the safety (Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events) during treatment, Data concerning adverse events graded using the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v5.0 will be collected during the study., Expected 30 days after last study treatment administration, up to 5 years
Multicenter, international, comparative, randomized, open-label, phase II study conducted in two parallel groups.

The study population will consist of male and female patients aged ≥18 years old with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies, as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in patients eligible for these treatments.

Patients will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio to treatment arms A and B.

* Arm A: regorafenib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, followed by trifluridine/tipiracil until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
* Arm B: trifluridine/tipiracil until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, followed by regorafenib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
