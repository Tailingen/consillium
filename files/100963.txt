Elimination of PTV Margins Based on Online Adaptive Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Centrally Located Early-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of eliminating the PTV (planning target volume) margins based on online adaptive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with centrally located early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
RADIATION: Online adaptive SBRT
Incidence of grade 3 or higher SBRT-related toxicity, Incidence of grade 3 or higher SBRT-related toxicity, 1-year
Objective response rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose tumor size decreases to a pre-specified value and is maintained for a certain period of time during cancer treatment. It includes the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) as a percentage of the total number of evaluable cases., 2 months after radiotherapy]|Local control rate, The control of the local lesion after treatment., 2-year|Progression-free survival, PFS measures the time from the start date of SBRT to disease progression, death from any cause or last follow up if alive., 2-year
