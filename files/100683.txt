Study of Sulfatinib in Treating Advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma and Iodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma
A multi-center , opened, Phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of Sulfatinib 300 mg Sulfatinib in advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma ( MTC) and iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).
Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: Surufatinib
objective response rate (ORR), the incidence of confirmed complete response or partial response, 16 months after the last patient enrolled
Adverse events evaluated by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03, The safety and tolerability of sulfatinib will be evaluated based on adverse events data. Other safety parameters include physical examination, vital signs, laboratory test results (i.e., hematology, chemistry panel, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and ultrasonic cardiogram, From first dose to within 30 days after the last dose|The disease control rate (DCR), the incidence of complete response, partial response and stable disease, 16 months after the last patient enrolled|Progression Free Survival (PFS), the duration between the randomization date and the first disease progression (PD) or death (whichever comes first)., 16 months after the last patient enrolled|Time to Response (TTR), the period from the date of randomization to the date when the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail)., 16 months after the last patient enrolled
This study adopt Simon's two-stage designs method. In the first stage, When the first 12 patients enrolled complete therapy of Cycle 1, investigators and sponsors will analyze safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data, to determine whether the dose is suitable for TC and enrollment should be stopped during this period.15 subjects will be enrolled in both subgroups (advanced MTC and iodine-refractory DTC), and more 10 subjects in each subgroups will be enrolled after efficacy assessment in the second stage.

Patients receive oral sulfatinib at a dose of 300mg/d within 1 hour after breakfast (once-daily dosing continuously, every 28-day treatment cycle) until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity, or in the opinion of the investigator, patients were no longer deriving clinical beneﬁt、lost to follow-up、withdrew informed consent form, or sponsors terminated the study, whichever comes first.
