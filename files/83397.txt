Pilot Study Evaluating Broccoli Sprouts in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer [POUDER Trial]
The goal of the POUDER trial is to determine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial regarding the application of freeze-dried broccoli sprouts rich in sulforaphane and quercetin in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that receive palliative chemotherapy.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Verum, broccoli sprout grain|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: placebo
Feasibility of a randomized controlled trial, Main objective is to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial regarding the application of freeze-dried broccoli sprouts rich in sulforaphane and quercetin in patients with advanced, surgically non-resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with palliative chemotherapy, One year
Disease status (imaging and tumor markers), Disease status (cancer progress or regress): CT-imaging staging (if available) and serum tumor markers (CEA and CA-19-9) peaks as additional parameters that provide insight into disease status., One year
Substance bioavailability, Urine analysis as marker of substance systemic bioavailability (conversion of the precursor glucoraphanin to the active drug substance sulforaphane). Urine analysis serves as control of the regular intake of the test substance as well., One year
Patients will be randomly classified into two groups - verum and placebo. The patients in the experimental arm will receive capsules with broccoli sprout grain containing a total of 90mg sulforaphane active substance per day over one year as nutrition supplement whereas patients assigned to the placebo group will receive inactive substance (methylcellulose) with identical capsule and portion distribution.
