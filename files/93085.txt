Safety, Tolerability, PK, PD, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of TWP-102 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies.
This is a multi-center, phase I, open clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and efficacy of TWP-102 injection in patients with advanced malignancies. This study consists of two parts, including a dose escalation study and a dose expansion study. The criteria for dose escalation will be based on the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design with sequentially enrolled cohorts.
