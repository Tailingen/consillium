A Study of QL1706 (an Anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 Combined Antibody) Combined With Albumin-bound Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in the Treatment of Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
* Major objectives To evaluate the efficacy of QL1706 combined with albumin-binding paclitaxel and bevacizumab in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
* Secondary Purpose To evaluate the safety of QL1706 in combination with albumin-binding paclitaxel and bevacizumab in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.

Exploratory analysis of the association between the efficacy of the combination regimen and biomarkers.
Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: QL1706
ORR, Defined as the proportion of subjects achieving optimal total efficacy (Bor) as confirmed Cr or PR (according to RECIST v1.1) . The best overall response was defined as the best response recorded (in order of CR, PR, SD, PD, or non-evaluable) from the beginning of treatment until disease progression, or in cases where PD was not achieved before the initiation of subsequent antitumour therapy or before study discontinuation (whichever occurred first) , the best efficacy was recorded (from the start of treatment until the last evaluable tumour imaging assessment) ., up to 6 months
The efficacy of chemotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer has been demonstrated in clinical studies, and QL1706 acts as a bi-functional combination antibody that blocks both PD-1 and CTLA-4, in other cancer trials that have been conducted, it is expected that better efficacy and adverse event rates comparable to those of anti-PD-1 mabs and anti-CTLA-4 mabs will be achieved with combination chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs, it may be possible to obtain better anti-tumor effects in platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients.
