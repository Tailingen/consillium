Safe Study of Dendritic Cell (DC) Based Therapy Targeting Tumor Stem Cells in Glioblastoma
The study induces an immune response towards the stem-cell like part of glioblastomas in combination with standard therapy. The aim is to define and characterize the feasibility, potential adverse effects of such therapy and measure time to progression and survival.
Glioblastoma|Brain Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Dendritic cell vaccine with mRNA from tumor stem cells
Adverse events, During follow-up
Evaluation of immunological response, time to disease progression and survival time, 5 years
