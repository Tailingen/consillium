Single Agent Decitabine in TP53 Mutated Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
In this study, the investigators seek to determine whether decitabine therapy can improve outcomes, specifically overall survival this selected subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with the poorest prognosis based on refractoriness to induction treatment and high risk genetic mutations.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Relapsed, Adult
DRUG: Decitabine|PROCEDURE: Bone marrow biopsy/aspirate|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draw|PROCEDURE: Skin biopsy|PROCEDURE: Buccal swab
Overall Survival of Participants With TP53 Mutation, * Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause. For a patient who is not known to be alive at the end of study follow up, observation of OS is censored on the date the patient was last known to be alive
* To be evaluable for this outcome measure the participant would have to have received at least one dose of decitabine, 1 year
Percentage of Responding TP53 Mutated Patients (CR, CRi), * Complete remission (CR) - Defined as bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 109/L (1,000/μL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100,000/μL).
* Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia - \<1.0 x 109/L (1,000/μL) or thrombocytopenia -\<100 x 109/L (100,000/μL), 12 weeks|Time to Stem Cell Transplant Among Participants Who Are Suitable Candidates for Transplant and Have an Identified Donor, * Document the number of days that it takes each participant to reach transplant
* Transplant eligible participants are those who achieve complete remission (CR), cytogenetic complete remission (CRc), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), or morphologic leukemia free state (mLFS) per 2017 ELN AML Recommendations., 12 weeks|Median Time to Leukemia Relapse (TTLR) in Non-transplant Patients, -Recurrence/morphologic relapse - Defined as relapse following complete remission is defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5-20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in \> 1 week to confirm relapse., 2 years|Event-free Survival (EFS), -Event-free survival is defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study drug to date of treatment failure, recurrence, death due to any cause, or loss to follow up., 2 year|Average Number of Hospital Days, -Document number of hospital days that each participant stays and obtain average for all evaluable participants, During cycles 1 and 2 (60 days)|Response Compared Between Patients With Morphologically Evident Disease Versus Patients With Molecularly Detected Disease at the Time of Enrollment, * Morphologically evident disease (\>5% blasts by cytomorphology)
* Molecularly detected disease (disease detected with flow cytometry, cytogenetic, or mutational analysis if ≤ 5% blasts by cytomorphology)
* Response will be assessed according to the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) recommendations, Through 12 weeks|Survival Compared Between Patients With Morphologically Evident Disease Versus Patients With Molecularly Detected Disease at the Time of Enrollment, * Morphologically evident disease (\>5% blasts by cytomorphology)
* Molecularly detected disease (disease detected with flow cytometry, cytogenetic, or mutational analysis with ≤ 5% blasts by cytomorphology), 2 years|Response Compared Between Patients With de Novo AML Versus Patients With Secondary AML Versus Patients With Treatment-related AML, -Response will be assessed according to the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) recommendations, Through 12 weeks|Survival Compared Between Patients With de Novo AML Versus Patients With Secondary AML Versus Patients With Treatment-related AML, 2 years|Response Compared Between Patients With Presence of Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Addition to TP53 Mutations Versus Patients With Absence of Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Addition to TP53 Mutations, -Response will be assessed according to the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) recommendations, 12 weeks|Survival Compared Between Patients With Presence of Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Addition to TP53 Mutations Versus Patients With Absence of Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Addition to TP53 Mutations, 2 years|Median Number of Hospital Stays, -Document number of hospital days that each participant stays and obtain median for all evaluable participants, During cycles 1 and 2 (60 days)
