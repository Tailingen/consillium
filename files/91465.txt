Geriatric Assessment and Nursing Telephone Intervention in Elderly Women With Ovarian Cancer
Older woman with ovarian cancer have a worse prognosis compared to younger patients. However, the reason is not known. Currently, the standard of care is to evaluate younger and older patients with cancer the same way. However, older patients with cancer often have more complicated issues to manage. For example, older patients often have other medical problems, take more medications, and be dependent on others for help and transportation. Too often, the medical team is unaware of these issues which can effect the patients care.

The purpose of this study is to apply a set of questions designed specifically for patients with cancer who are older than 65 years of age. These questions are called a geriatric assessment.

The investigators want to better understand which older patients with ovarian cancer will be able to tolerate the chemotherapy and surgery and why. This study will also see if a telephone call from a nurse who specializes in caring for older patients will improve patient care. This study will determine how feasible it is to perform geriatric assessments and telephone calls in patients with ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: geriatric assessment and telephone call from nurse|OTHER: geriatric assessment and no call from nurse
feasibility of a geriatric assessment (GA), Geriatric Assessment Measures Selected Based on Reliability, Validity, Brevity, \& Prognostic Value. We will measure: the percentage of patients able to complete GA on their own; the length of time to complete GA; patient satisfaction with the GA, identifying items that were distressing or difficult to comprehend; the percentage of patients who completed all four serial GA;, 2 years|feasibility of a weekly geriatric nursing telephone intervention, the percentage of patients able to complete all weekly telephone calls; the length of time for each telephone call; patient satisfaction with the weekly telephone call., 2 years
estimate if the cancer-specific GA parameters will predict toxicity., describe chemotherapy and surgical toxicity. We will describe the chemotherapy \& surgical toxicity, estimate \& correlation of toxicity with geriatric assessment variables and determine any differences between the telephone intervention vs. the control groups. We will collect 1) Grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity; 2) Hospitalizations; 3) Chemotherapy dose delay or reduction; 4) Percentage of patients who complete all 6 cycles of chemotherapy; 5) Percentage of patients who undergo surgical debulking (optimal, suboptimal, no surgery); 6) Surgical complications (MSKCC GYN Surgical Grading System)., 2 years|differences in the surgical and chemotherapy toxicity, nursing telephone intervention group vs. the control groups.
