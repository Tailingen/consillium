Safety and Efficacy of Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine in Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial is an investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label, single-arm exploratory study of mRNA personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine in the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The main objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and secondary objective is to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine in subjects with advanced solid tumors. According to the characteristics of safety and efficacy data in the dose escalation phase, the dose expansion is performed at the intended clinical dose based on the investigator's judgment, and the treatment will be performed in combination with PD-1 to further evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine at a specific dose.

Both the dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase include a screening period (Week -4 \~ Week -2), a baseline period (Week -1 \~ Day -1), a treatment period (Day 1 \~ Week 8 or 16), and a follow-up period. Subjects who signed and provided the formal informed consent entered the screening period. The treatment period included the initial treatment period (Day 1 \~ Week 8) and the enhanced treatment period (Week 12 \~ Week 16). The investigator determine if the subject is suitable to enter the enhanced treatment period based on the comprehensive judgment of the subject's efficacy, safety, compliance and other factors.

Dose escalation phase is the traditional 3 + 3 design,, 12-18 subjects are expected to be enrolled at 100 μg, 200 μg and 400 μg (3-6 subjects in each group). The low dose group will be enrolled first.

The investigator will choose the optimal clinical dose for dose expansion, which can be one dose group or multiple dose groups. PD-1 will be administered in parallel to further confirm the efficacy and safety of neoantigen tumor vaccine. About 18 subjects will be enrolled. The usage and dosage of PD-1 should aligned with the package insert.
