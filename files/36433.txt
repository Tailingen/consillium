Study of Molecular and Genetic Abnormalities in Patients With Myeloid Neoplasms
The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence and prognostic impact of the most common genetic abnormalities in patients with Myeloid Neoplasms, including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN), Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Myeloproliferative/Myelodysplastic Neoplasms. Patients will have samples of blood and/or bone marrow collected and sent to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for analysis and storage.

Patients with a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia will be treated according to an uniform protocol.

DRUG: Induction Chemotherapy|DRUG: Consolidation Chemotherapy|DRUG: Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Low Dose Cytarabine|DRUG: Decitabine
Prevalence of molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities, As assessed by results of molecular and cytogenetic tests and frequency in the population studied, 2 years
Overall survival, Evaluation of 5-years overall survival in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Myeloproliferative/Myelodysplastic Neoplasms, 5 years|Response rate, Evaluate complete remission (CR) rate at 1 month for patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who received induction chemotherapy. Complete remission was defined by the presence of \< 5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM) with \> 1 x 10\^9/L neutrophils and \>100x10\^9/L platelets in the peripheral blood (PB), 1 month|Disease Free Survival, Evaluate rate of 5-years disease-free survival in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who enter complete remission after induction chemotherapy, 5 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality, Evaluate 5-years cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who achieve complete remission following induction chemotherapy, 5 years|Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Evaluate hematological and non-hematological toxicity in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia treated according to the protocol. Toxicity will be graded as per the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.3, 1 year|Cumulative Incidence of Transformation to Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Evaluate 5-years incidence of transformation to Acute Myeloid Leukemia in patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Myeloproliferative/Myelodysplastic Neoplasms, 5 years
