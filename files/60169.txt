Measure the difference in number of artifacts on 4D CT scans using audiovisual biofeedback in comparison to Free breathing., The first, third, fifth seventh and ninth patients accrued to the protocol will have their free breathing studies performed first. The second, fourth, sixth, eighth and tenth patients accrued to the protocol will have their audiovisual (a/v) biofeedback studies performed first., Day one
