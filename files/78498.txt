This pivotal phase 2/3, multi-center, adaptive design study of L-Annamycin for Injection in combination with Cytarabine Injection as second line therapy for remission induction in adult subjects with refractory/relapsed AML is divided into two parts, Part A and Part B.

Part A (Determination of Optimal Dosage Regimen) Part A of this study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (RDBPC), efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics study comparing two dose levels of L Annamycin for Injection (190 versus 230 mg/m2/day) in combination with Cytarabine Injection (2.0 g/m2/day) versus placebo in combination with Cytarabine Injection to identify the optimal dosage regimen as second line therapy for remission induction in adult subjects with refractory/relapsed AML.

Seventy-five to ninety subjects with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML who have refractory/relapsed AML after having received one prior induction therapy and who have received only one prior induction therapy for the treatment of AML will be enrolled in Part A. Remission induction followed by consolidation therapy or consolidation therapy and maintenance therapy will count as one prior line of therapy. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria after the completion of both screening and baseline assessments will be enrolled. Initially, 45 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment arms listed below (i.e., 15 per treatment arm). Randomization will be stratified by continent. Depending on the outcome of the first interim analysis (see further below), either 45 additional subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment arms listed below (for a total of 30 per treatment arm in Part A) or 30 additional subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either placebo in combination with Cytarabine Injection (Treatment Arm 1) or the L-Annamycin for Injection in combination with Cytarabine Injection arm that was selected to continue after the first interim analysis (i.e., Treatment Arm 2 or 3) (for a total of 30 per treatment arm in Part A, except for the arm that is dropped after the first interim analysis, which will have a total ≥15 and ≤30, depending on how many subjects were enrolled at the point the decision to drop the arm occurs).

* Treatment Arm 1: placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, i.e., the diluent for L-Annamycin for Injection) for three consecutive days in combination with 2.0 g/m2/day Cytarabine Injection for five consecutive days.
* Treatment Arm 2: 190 mg/m2/day L-Annamycin for Injection for three consecutive days in combination with 2.0 g/m2/day Cytarabine Injection for five consecutive days.
* Treatment Arm 3: 230 mg/m2/day L-Annamycin for Injection for three consecutive days in combination with 2.0 g/m2/day Cytarabine Injection for five consecutive days.

L-Annamycin for Injection will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours. The placebo will be administered the same (i.e., IV infusion over 2 hours). Cytarabine Injection will be administered as an IV infusion over 4 hours. The first day of Cytarabine Injection treatment will start on the first day of L-Annamycin for Injection or placebo treatment (Day 1). On the days where both Cytarabine Injection and L-Annamycin for Injection or placebo are administered, the Cytarabine Injection infusion will be initiated after the L-Annamycin for Injection or placebo infusion is completed.Part A of this study will include two interim analyses as follows:

First Interim Analysis: After the first 45 subjects enrolled in Part A of this study have completed their first treatment cycle response assessment at Day 35 ± 14 days, the data for those subjects will be verified/cleaned and locked, and the data will be unblinded and analyzed (n = 15 per treatment arm). Enrollment in the study will not be halted while the first interim analysis is performed. Comparisons will be made between the three treatment arms to determine if continuation of the study should be halted due to a lack of efficacy difference between the placebo in combination with Cytarabine Injection arm (Treatment Arm 1) and the L-Annamycin for Injection in combination with Cytarabine Injection arms (Treatment Arms 2 and 3; i.e., futility analysis) or too excessive of a risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) with Treatment Arms 2 and/or 3 relative to Treatment Arm 1. An unblinded independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will review the available efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data and make recommendations to the Sponsor on how to proceed with the remainder of Part A of the study. The primary options will be to recommend that the study be halted for futility reasons, for safety reasons, or that the study continue. If the iDMC recommends that the study continues, they will recommend if one or both L-Annamycin for Injection dosage regimens (i.e., 190 mg/m2/day or 230 mg/m2/day) continue for Part A.

Second Interim Analysis: After all subjects enrolled in Part A of this study (total of 75 to 90 subjects; see above for explanation of variable total subject number) have completed their first treatment cycle response assessment at Day 35 ± 14 days, enrollment in the study will be temporarily halted, the data will be verified/cleaned and locked, the data for the second group of subjects (i.e., who were not part of the first interim analysis) will be unblinded, and the pooled Part A data will be analyzed. If all three arms were continued after the first interim analysis, three treatment arms will be compared (n = 30 per treatment arm) to determine which of the L Annamycin for Injection dosage regimens (190 mg/m2/day versus 230 mg/m2/day) is the optimal dosage regimen for continuing with for the remainder of the study (Part B) and which dosage regimen will be dropped from further enrollment. If one of the two L Annamycin for Injection in combination with Cytarabine Injection dosage regimens (Treatment Arm 2 or 3) was dropped after the first interim analysis, the remaining arm will be compared against placebo in combination with Cytarabine Injection (Treatment Arm 1) (n = 30 per treatment arm) to confirm that the study should continue with that regimen to Part B.Part B (Expansion at Optimal Dosage Regimen) Part B of this study is a RDBPC, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics study of the optimal dosage regimen of L-Annamycin for Injection in combination with Cytarabine Injection (as determined in Part A) versus placebo in combination with Cytarabine Injection as second line therapy for remission induction in adult subjects with refractory/relapsed AML.

Once the optimal dosage regimen is determined (see Part A above), enrollment will resume under Part B of the study. Approximately 244 additional subjects with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML who have refractory/relapsed AML after having received one prior induction therapy and who have received only one prior induction therapy for the treatment of AML (i.e., the same patient population as for Part A) will be enrolled in Part B.

Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria after the completion of both screening and baseline assessments will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms listed below (i.e., 122 per treatment arm). Randomization will be stratified by continent.

* Treatment Arm 1: placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) for three consecutive days in combination with 2.0 g/m2/day Cytarabine Injection for five consecutive days (i.e., the same as Treatment Arm 1 of Part A).
* Treatment Arm X: optimal dosage regimen (as determined in Part A) of L Annamycin for Injection (190 mg/m2/day or 230 mg/m2/day) for three consecutive days in combination with 2.0 g/m2/day Cytarabine Injection for five consecutive days (i.e., the same as Treatment Arm 2 or 3, respectively, of Part A).
