The Radiation Oncology-Biology Integration Network (ROBIN) Molecular Characterization Trial (MCT) of Standard Short Course Radiotherapy for Rectal Cancer
This trial (molecular characterization trial) focuses on rectal cancer, a common cancer that is treated with radiotherapy (RT) as standard of care and represents a setting in which to study the effects of RT on the immune system.

Deep learning-based radiomics (DLR) was developed to extract deep information from multiple modalities of magnetic resonance (MR) images. Enhancement kinetics of tumor indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant. If enhancement kinetics is rapid is indicative of malignancy and if it is delayed, it is indicative of benign tumor., Baseline, Week 1|Changes in enhancement kinetics from pre-treatment and post-treatment CT will be measured., All patients will have pre-treatment and post-treatment multi-modality planning CTs.
