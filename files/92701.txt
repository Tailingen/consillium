Optical Genome Mapping in Characterization of Multiple Myeloma
The current cytogenetic characterization of Multiple Myeloma (including chromosome and gene abnormalities identification in abnormal plasma cells) encounters some limitations. Indeed current techniques only enable to analyze a limited numbers of predefined abnormalities. New tools that will allow for characterization of abnormalities involved in multiple myeloma development are thus required. The interest of Optical Genome Mapping has already been demonstrated in other hematological diseases. The present study aims at validating Optical Genome Mapping in genetic abnormalities identification for patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM).
Multiple Myeloma
OTHER: Bone Marrow samples collection
Validate the use of Optical Genome Mapping in Multiple Myeloma characterization, Concordance scores for abnormalities detected with Optical Genome Mapping and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), At MM diagnosis
Evaluate Optical Genome Mapping for identification of genetic abnormalities that are not detected with FISH in Multiple Myeloma, Numbers of genetic abnormalities that are detected with Optical Genome Mapping but not detected with FISH, At MM diagnosis
For this study, supplementary samples will be collected during bone marrow biopsy performed at MM diagnosis. These will be used for CD138+ Plasma Cell Isolation and sent to GENTYANE (GEnoTYpage and sequencing in AuvergNE) platform in Clermont-Ferrand for Optical Genome Mapping.
