UZ/KU Leuven Program for Post-mortem Tissue Donation to Enhance Research
UPTIDER is a prospective, interventional, non-Investigational Medicinal Product (non-IMP), non-commercial, single centre post-mortem tissue donation program for metastatic breast cancer patients or patients with a germline pathogenic variant with a moderate to high lifetime risk of breast cancer and at least one malignancy at time of death. The overarching objective of UPTIDER is (i) to unravel metastatic breast cancer evolution, biology, heterogeneity and treatment resistance and (ii) to assess pathogenicity and tumour biology in hereditary cancer syndromes with a high lifetime risk of breast cancer; both through extensive post-mortem multi-level and multi-region sample analysis.
