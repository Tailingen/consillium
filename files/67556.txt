The Value of Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Detecting Bone Marrow Infiltration of Lymphoma
The diagnosis of lymphoma bone marrow infiltration is very important for the staging and treatment mode of lymphoma. Traditional bone marrow cytology and pathology examinations are only performed locally, and missed diagnosis is possible. The study explore the value of multi-parameter pelvic magnetic resonance in detecting bone marrow infiltration with newly diagnosed lymphoma patients . This study also explore the consistency of pelvic magnetic resonance and PET/CT for detection of lymphoma bone marrow infiltration.
Lymphoma
Agreement Between MRI and Bone marrow cytology, pathology and follow-up at Diagnosis, MRI-positive lesions that cannot be confirmed by bone marrow cytology and pathology will be confirmed by MRI follow-up., Within 30 days prior to start of chemotherapy
Agreement Between MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT at Diagnosis, Region based agreement (%; kappa value) of MRI with 18F-FDG PET/CT at diagnosis., Within 30 days prior to start of chemotherapy
