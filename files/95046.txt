Study of Biomarkers in DNA Samples From Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This research study is looking at biomarkers in DNA samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of DNA from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Collect DNA samples from patients with cytogenetically, well characterized, and uniformly treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia for use in analysis of a wide range of host factors influencing etiology and outcome of the disease.

II. Identify host factors that can be determined at onset of treatment to predict outcome of chemotherapy, and thus modify the therapy administered.

OUTLINE:

Previously collected DNA samples are analyzed for polymorphisms at a variety of loci. Gene expression and expression profiles are correlated with genotype and therapy outcomes.
