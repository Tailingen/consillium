Clinical Trial Evaluating Safety of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) Combined With CV01 Delivery of Ultrasound for Sonodynamic Therapy (SDT) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma (HGG) Prior to Resection and Standard Adjuvant Therapy (ALA SDT GLIOMA 401)
This trial is designed to evaluate safety and explore possible efficacy of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (5-ALA HCl, Gliolan®) with CV01 delivery of ultrasound for sonodynamic therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma prior to resection and standard adjuvant therapy.

The study will accrue 10 evaluable high-grade glioma patients. Patients who qualify will receive sonodynamic therapy (5 ALA combined with CV01-delivered sonication) 2 to 5 days prior to standard resection, with one study magnetic resonance imaging being performed between sonodynamic therapy and resection. Resection will be followed by standard radio-/chemotherapy. All patients will be followed up in-study for toxicities and adverse events for 28 days.
Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA)|Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (AO)|Glioblastoma (GBM)
DRUG: 5-Aminolevulinic acid Hydrochloride (Gliolan®)|DEVICE: CV01
Safety and tolerability, Clinical safety and tolerability will be assessed based on the observation of adverse events (AEs). Adverse events will be graded as per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5., From the time the informed consent is signed until 28 days following administration of sonodynamic therapy (end of trial participation)
Radiological changes, Radiological changes (MRI) of Tumor volume, Volume of FLAIR hyperintensity, Volume of cyctotoxic edema, Relative cerebral blood volume and Leakage, Changes from visit 1 (< 8 days before sonodynamic therapy) to visit 3 (2 to 5 days after sonodynamic therapy)|Histopathological efficacy, Anti-tumor activity assessed by Number of cells / mm³ with antibodies against IBA1 and Number of cells / mm³ with antibodies against Caspase III, Biopsies will be collected during standard surgery.
