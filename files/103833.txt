Study of Veliparib in Combination With Nivolumab and Platinum Doublet Chemotherapy in Participants With Metastatic or Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This study seeks to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of veliparib in combination with nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel or carboplatin/pemetrexed) (Phase 1 portion) and to assess whether the addition of nivolumab to veliparib in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy results will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to veliparib with platinum doublet chemotherapy alone in participants with metastatic or advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Phase 2 portion).

A strategy decision was made not to proceed to Phase 2 portion of this study due to change in standard of care.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: nivolumab|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: veliparib|DRUG: carboplatin
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of earliest disease progression (radiographic progression per RECIST version 1.1 or clinical disease progression) or death. If the participant does not experience disease progression or death, then the data will be censored at the date of the last disease assessment., Up to approximately 3.5 years|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of veliparib (ABT-888) in combination with nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy in participants with metastatic or advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)., Up to 6 weeks
Tmax for pemetrexed, Up to approximately 3 weeks|AUC for nivolumab, Up to approximately 3.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of death. For subjects who did not die, their data will be censored at the date of last study visit or the last known date to be alive, whichever is later., Up to approximately 3.5 years|Tmax for nivolumab, Up to approximately 3.5 years|AUC for pemetrexed, Up to approximately 3 weeks|Time to Cmax (peak time, Tmax) for veliparib, Up to approximately 9 weeks|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for veliparib, Up to approximately 9 weeks|Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of nivolumab anti-drug antibody (ADA), Up to approximately 3.5 years|Duration of Overall Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the number of days from the date of first response (CR or PR) to the earliest documentation of progressive disease or death due to disease progression., Up to approximately 3.5 years|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) for pemetrexed, Up to approximately 3 weeks|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) for veliparib, Up to approximately 9 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of the participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to approximately 3.5 years
