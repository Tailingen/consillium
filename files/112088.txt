Sorafenib, Valproic Acid, and Sildenafil in Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma
The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the combination of three drugs, sorafenib (Nexavar®), valproic acid (Depakote®), and sildenafil (Viagra®), when used to treat high-grade glioma, a type of brain tumor.

The study is a single-center, open-label phase 2 study, with an early stopping rule in place for safety. The trial will include patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma.

The trial will be conducted in an adaptive design, with a Simon's mini-max 2-stage design incorporating an interim analysis for efficacy
