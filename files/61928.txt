Study to Evaluate if Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy Improves Recurrence Free Survival in Pancreatic Head Cancer
Net-Pac investigates if radiation prior to surgical resection improves survival in patients with pancreatic head cancer without metastases.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: neoadjuvant RTx|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Local recurrence free survival, At 12 months postoperative
Percentage of surgical R0-resections in both groups, Determined by histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen., Until 10 days postoperative|30-day morbidity and mortality, 30 day period after the operation|Toxicity of preoperative Radiotherapy, Number of patients with adverse events in both groups, number of adverse events in both groups and number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v 3.0) in both groups, Start of the radiotherapy until 12 months postoperative.|Clinical response rate (RECIST-criteria) and histological response rate, Until 1 year postOP|Time to tumor progression (local and systemic), Until 1 year postoperative|Quality of life, Until 12 months postoperative|Overall survival after 1 year, Until 1 year postoperative
The trial is designed to show that neoadjuvant radiotherapy followed by surgery improves local recurrence free survival compared to surgery alone in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head.
