Study of Pralatrexate vs. Erlotinib for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After at Least 1 Prior Platinum-based Treatment
The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the effectiveness (ability to provide beneficial treatment of the disease) and safety of pralatrexate compared to erlotinib when given to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are current or former cigarette smokers and who have received at least 1 prior treatment with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin)
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pralatrexate|DRUG: Erlotinib|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Vitamin B12|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Folic Acid
Overall Survival (OS) of Patients Receiving Pralatrexate vs. Erlotinib, OS was defined as the length of time from randomization until death due to any cause. Patients who were alive at the time of the data cut-off date were censored at the last contact date., Assessed from date of randomization no less frequently than every 16 weeks for up to 2 years after randomization.
Response Rate (RR) to Treatment of Patients Receiving Pralatrexate vs. Erlotinib, Number of patients whose tumors responded to Pralatrexate or Erlotinib, using the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Assessed every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 16 weeks for up to 2 years or until PD or start of subsequent treatment.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) of Patients Receiving Pralatrexate vs. Erlotinib, PFS was calculated as the number of days from randomization to the date of radiological evidence of PD or death due to any cause., Assessed every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 16 weeks for up to 2 years or until PD or start of subsequent treatment.|Adverse Events of Patients Receiving Pralatrexate vs. Erlotinib, Assessed every 2 weeks while on treatment through safety follow-up visit (35 +/-5 days post-last dose) or early termination visit (at time of withdrawal).
