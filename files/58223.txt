A Phase 1 Dose Escalating Trial of Bortezomib in Combination With Lenalidomide in Patients With Myelodysplasia
This study proposes using bortezomib in cohorts of 3-6 patients at the doses of 0.7, 1, and 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 to determine the MTD in combination with lenalidomide 10 mg a day, for 21 days of a 28 day treatment cycle for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

Currently, there are no curative therapies for myelodysplasia except for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Both lenalidomide and bortezomib have activity as single agents in patients with myelodysplasia. This study proposes using bortezomib in cohorts of 3-6 patients at the doses of 0.7, 1, and 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 to determine the MTD in combination withlenalidomide 10 mg a day, for 21 days of a 28 day treatment cycle. The planned bortezomib doses have been evaluated in previous Phase I clinical studies in similar patient populations and have been safe and well tolerated in a twice-weekly schedule of administration. Lenalidomide has been shown to have efficacy in myelodysplasia. The combination of lenalidomide and bortezomib has been used in patients with multiple myeloma.
