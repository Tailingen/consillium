Toxicity Attributed to Genetic Polymorphisms in Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Survivors
The purpose of this study is to identify genetic variations in survivors of testicular cancer and connect these variations to differences in risks of late effects.
Germ Cell Cancer
Renal toxicity (Identify genetic variations predicting renal toxicity), Identify genetic variations predicting renal toxicity., 1 year
Identification of late-effects through questionnaires and linkage to national registries. DNA samples will be gathered through buccal swabs or saliva kits and analysed with whole exome-sequencing.
