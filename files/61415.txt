ObServatory Children Acute RElated Therapy Leukemia
Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AML) of the child are a rare disease and its prognosis varies according to the subgroup. Secondary AMLs remain a subgroup of poor prognosis, whose cytogenetic and molecular characteristics and prognostic value differ in part from de novo AMLs. The purpose of this national observatory is to record scientific and medical information on cases of secondary AML that have occurred in France since 2013 in order to improve the treatment of children and adolescents with this disease in the years to come. This national observatory will contribute to better knowledge and progress in research into these diseases.

Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) are a group of hematologic diseases that arise after chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for a previous cancer or rarely autoimmune diseases. t-MNs had been included in the group of AMLs and remain as a distinct category also in the recent 2016 revision of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasm and acute leukemia. The latency between exposition to anticancer drugs and development of t-MN may vary from some months up to 10 years, even considering the age at diagnosis of the primary malignancy, the kind of cytotoxic treatment previously used, and the cumulative dose and dose intensity. The prognosis of s-AML is generally considered to be poorer than that of de novo AML. The disease tends to be refractory to chemotherapy, and patients' tolerance of treatment generally is reduced because of prior therapies. 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of pediatric t-AML/t-MDS have been reported to be 14% to 30%. However, the results are conflicting and overall lacking when compared with those in adults. The purpose of this national observatory is to record scientific and medical information on cases of secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemias that have occurred in France since 2013 in order to improve the treatment of children and adolescents with this disease in the years to come. The primary objective is to evaluate the association of potential prognostic factors (including clinical-biological factors) with the overall survival of children and adolescents aged 0-18 years diagnosed with secondary AML. The secondary objectives are to test the feasibility of setting up a French national database of secondary AMLs for children and adolescents as a first step towards European implementation, to assess the association of potential prognostic factors with event free survival and the occurrence of treatment-related toxicities, to characterize the molecular abnormalities associated with secondary AMLs in children and adolescents.
