Cohort Study to Identify Cancer Patients at High Risk of Venous Thromboembolism
Cancer patients are at increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively termed venous thromboembolism (VTE). Risk assessment scores for VTE in cancer patients have been previously developed by the groups of Khorana and Vienna CATS. However, routine thromboprophylaxis for ambulatory cancer patients based on these scores is currently not recommended. In the investigators prospective, observational cohort study, the investigators aim to identify cancer patients at high risk for VTE based on clinical characteristics, coagulation biomarkers and the coagulant activity of tissue factor bearing microparticles.
