This research study is studying an investigational drug called EOC237 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: EOC237
Proportion of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Number of subjects who experienced DLT events during 28 days after first administration of EOC237, divided by the number of DLT evaluable Subjects, Up to approximately 3 years|Determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Up to approximately 3 years|the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Up to approximately 3 years
Part 1 Dose Escalation: an open, single/multiple dose, multi-center phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EOC237 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor.

Part 2 Food influence research: to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of EOC237, by investigating the bioavailability following single dose administration under fed and fasted conditions.
