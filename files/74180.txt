Efficacy and Safety of Vorolanib Monotherapy As Third-line or Later Treatment for Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: a Single-arm, Prospective, Open-label Phase II Clinical Study
This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Vorolanib as monotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving third-line or higher treatments. It is a single-center, single-arm, prospective Phase II clinical trial. Thirty-two patients who have undergone at least two lines of systemic therapy and exhibited progression or recurrence will receive 300 mg of Vorolanib daily until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint is the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary endpoints include PFS, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and safety. This research aims to expand the clinical applications of Vorolanib in NSCLC, providing a basis for further investigation.

DRUG: Administration of Vorolanib
6-Month Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients, The primary outcome measure is the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease progression or death within 6 months of initiating Vorolanib treatment. Disease progression will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria through imaging studies, including enhanced chest and upper abdominal CT scans and brain MRI, conducted at regular intervals., 6 months from the initiation of treatment
