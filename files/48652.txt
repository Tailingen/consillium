ObservationaL Study on the Qol of RAS Wild-type mCRC Patients Receiving Anti-EGFR MAbs + FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as 1st Line
This is a national, multicentric, prospective, observational trial. The decision to prescribe FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus panitumumab or FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus cetuximab must have been freely taken by the clinician prior to the study entry for each patient included. Each physician will see his/her patients within the context of routine visits, without any special visit being organised for the purposes of the study. Therefore, the doctor-patient relationship and patient follow-up are not modified. Physicians are totally free to decide on their patients' therapeutic management.

EORTC QLQ-C30 and DLQI questionnaires will be completed by the patients at baseline (Day 1 of Cycle 1), at the first day of every other cycle (every 2 weeks) thereafter, and at ""End of Study Visit" (within 28 days from the end of treatment with anti-EGFR or withdrawal from study for any reason).

Before every cycle, adverse events will be recorded and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0. Treatment's modifications in terms of cycles' delay, dose reductions or drugs' interruptions will be recorded.

Concomitant approaches to prevent or treat dermatological toxicities during the treatment will be registered.

EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire score, -HRQoL will be measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores reported during the treatment will be also expressed as percentage of the scores reported at baseline. The measure unit is the answer score provided by the patient to the questions in the questionnaire, 24 months|QoL questionnaire DLQI questionnaire score, Skin satisfaction will be measured using the DLQI. The DLQI score will also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30. DLQI scores reported during the treatment will be also expressed as percentage of the DLQI scores reported at baseline.The measure unit is the answer score provided by the patient to the questions in the questionnaire, 24 months|%of enrolled subjects, experiencing a specific adverse event according to NCI CTC-AE version 4.0, Tolerability: The toxicity rate, defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing a specific adverse event of any grade, according to CTCAE version 4.02., 24 months|Recording of number of concomitant medications, to prevent or treat dermatological adverse events, Management of dermatological toxicity: concomitant medications, both topical and systemic, adopted to prevent or treat dermatological adverse events will be recorded. The measure is the number of topical and systemic treatment administered for skin toxicity management, 24 months|Time to onset of the dermtological toxicity, Tolerability: Times to onset of dermatological toxicities will be also described. The measure is the times elapsed untill adverse event is occurred (days), 24 months|Dose reduction, To describe the adherence to the treatment in terms of dose reduction.The measure unit is Number of dose reduction occurred out of standard as per clinical practice treatment scheme., 24 months|"number of administered cycles", Evaluate the number of treatment cycles performed by the patients. The measure is the number of cycles administered as per clinical practice scheme indicated in the protocol, by each patient, 24 months|average relative dose intensity of every drug", Will be evaluated the average dose administered to the patient under treatment the measure units are mg or mg/kg, 24 months
Score scale on questionnaire answers, To investigate the impact of dermatological adverse events during the treatment with FOLFOX plus anti-EGFR MAbs on patients' skin satisfaction as measured by means of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire. The measure unit is the score coming from patient answer to questions in the questionnaire, 24 months|Number of cycles on treatment before and of treatment due to AE, To assess the tolerability of administered treatments The measure unit is the number of cycles on treatment before and of treatment due to AE, 24 months|dose delay, To describe the adherence to the treatment in terms of dose delays, - the measure unit is Number of dose delay occurred out of standard as per clinical practice treatment scheme, 24 months|Questionnaire score, To describe the management of dermatological adverse events to assess the effect on skin-related QoL of preemptive Vs reactive treatment of skin toxicities. The measure units is the questionnaire score coming from patient answer to relevant questionnaire administered., 24 months
