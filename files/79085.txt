The number of subjects with adverse events/serious adverse events, Number of patients with adverse events and with serious adverse events including abnormal clinical observations, abnormal ECG parameters, abnormal laboratory assessments and abnormal vital signs that changed from baseline, From time of Informed Consent to 30+7 days post last dose|The number of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), as deﬁned in the protocol., A DLT is defined as any toxicity that occurs from the ﬁrst dose of study treatment up to and including the planned end of Cycle 1 (the DLT assessment period) that is assessed as unrelated to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation., At the end of Cycle 1(each cycle is 28 days)
Maximum plasma concentration of the drug (Cmax), The concentration of VB15010 in plasma will be determined (Cmax will be derived), At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (through study completion, an everage of 1 year)|Objective Response Rate (prostate cancer), Best response until progression, as deﬁned by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 (bone), From Screening to conﬁrmed progressive disease (approximately 1 year)
