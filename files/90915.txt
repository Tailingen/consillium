Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Versus Chimiotherapy in First Line Treatment in PS 2 or Elderly in Advanced NSCLC Patients
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients already have metastatic disease and a systemic, palliative treatment is the primary therapeutic option.

Guidelines for PS 2 patients or older than 75 years old patients at the time of diagnosis recommend for fit patients a carboplatin doublet chemotherapy.

Nivolumab has proven efficacy in 3rd line squamous cell lung carcinoma and is superior to chemotherapy in 2nd line treatment of squamous and non-squamous lung cancer in term of overall survival.

In 1st line, nivolumab failed to show superiority compared to a platin based doublet in terms of progression free survival and overall survival in tumors ≥ 5% PD-L1 expression. The association Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab showed encouraging results in first line setting in phase 1 study.

The investigators think that with regard to the manageable toxicity of nivolumab in lung cancer population and the possibility to obtain long responses, this association could be a valid option for this population of elderly and/or PS2 patients in term of overall survival.
