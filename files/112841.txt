Study of Nerve Reconstruction Using AVANCE in Subjects Who Undergo Robotic Assisted Prostatectomy for Treatment of Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if it is technically feasable to repair nerves that are injured as part of a planned surgical removal of the prostate and the surrounding tissue in subjects with prostate cancer. The study will also examine the long term outcomes on erectile function, continence and overall quality of life in the enrolled subjects.
