Cognitive Function and Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes Investigation in Patients Taking Vorinostat
Psychological well-being and cognitive function will be measured in patients enrolled on the primary study, NCT01790568, a phase 2 trial of vorinostat plus tacrolimus and methotrexate to prevent graft versus host disease following unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Validated questionnaires will be administered to assess patients' level of depression, anxiety, quality of life, perceived cognitive functioning, and sleep quality. Cognitive testing will include reliable and valid measures of processing speed, attention, executive function, episodic memory, and visual learning and memory. The purpose of this study is to determine whether these measures are feasible to administer in patients before and at early time points after bone marrow transplantation .
