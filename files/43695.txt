A Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Carboplatin Plus Etoposide to Investigate Safety and Efficacy in Patients With Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase IIIB, single-arm, single-country, multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus etoposide in patients who have ES-SCLC and are chemotherapy-naive for their extensive-stage disease.
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide
Incidence of Serious Adverse Events, 4 weeks after last dose of study treatment|Incidence of Serious and Non-Serious Immune Mediated Adverse Events, 4 weeks after last dose of study treatment
Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 1 Year, OS at 1 year, defined as the proportion of participants remaining alive at 1 year after initiation of study treatment., 1 Year|Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 2 Years, OS at 2 years, defined as the proportion of participants remaining alive at 2 years after initiation of study treatment., 2 Years|Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 3 Years, OS at 3 years, defined as the proportion of participants remaining alive at 3 years after initiation of study treatment., 3 Years|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS, defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to death from any cause, Up to approximately 54 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Up to approximately 54 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the percentage of patients who attain complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1., Up to approximately 54 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time from initial response to disease progression or death among patients who have experienced a CR or PR (unconfirmed) during the study. Duration of response will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 54 months
Induction treatment will be administered on a 21-day cycle for four/six cycles. Following the induction phase, participants will continue maintenance therapy with atezolizumab. Maintenance with atezolizumab will continue until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit.
