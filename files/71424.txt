Prospective Patient Registry for Radiation Oncology Techniques and Quality
This study will create a patient data registry to collect and analyze information on technology usage and outcomes among patients receiving a broad range of relatively new radiation treatments that have become standards of care in our practice. Review of this information will serve as a basis for development of better patient management plans, to inform decisions about acquisition of new technologies, to provide information about quality in our care delivery, and to create a database that will securely warehouse ongoing information about what treatments the patients we serve need most and the challenges they face in the treatment process. The information gathered is likely to not only improve our services at the University of Maryland and its community sites but to advance medical science and enhance the quality of care for cancer patients.

RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Numbers of patients experiencing toxicities/adverse events both during and at follow-up after radiation therapy with any of 11 therapeutic modalities., Records will be assessed to identify per-patient numbers and grades of toxicities and adverse events resulting from radiation treatment for oncologic conditions as graded by treating physicians according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) during the period of radiation treatment and at each regularly scheduled clinical follow-up appointment, for each of the 11 therapeutic modalities listed as interventions., 5 years
Numbers of patients with different initial diagnoses associated with short- and long-term toxicities with specific radiation treatments., Records will be assessed to identify numbers of patients with specific initial diagnoses (from approximately 100 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems \[ICD 9\] malignant neoplasm diagnoses) who experience short- and long-term toxicities after any of the 11 therapeutic modalities listed as interventions., 5 years|Numbers of men and women who experience short- and long-term toxicities after specific radiation treatments., Records will be assessed to identify numbers of men and women who experience CTCAE-defined levels of toxicity during and after radiation treatment with any of the 11 therapeutic modalities listed as interventions., 5 years|Age differences in short- and long-term toxicities associated with specific radiation treatment modalities., Records will be assessed to identify numbers of men and women between the ages of 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, and â‰¥90 years who experience CTCAE-defined levels of toxicity during and after radiation treatment with any of the 11 therapeutic modalities listed as interventions., 5 years|Patient income differences in short- and long-term toxicities associated with specific radiation treatment modalities., Records will be assessed for income (by patient home zip code per U.S. Internal Revenue statistics available at http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Statistics-ZIP-Code-Data-(SOI)) to identify income level differences and per-patient numbers/ types of CTCAE-defined levels of toxicity during and after radiation treatment with any of the 11 therapeutic modalities listed as interventions., 5 years
The purpose of this study is to create a robust and long-term patient data registry containing limited demographic, diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up data on patients at the study sites undergoing one or more of the following radiation treatments/technologies:

Brachytherapy, including High-Dose-Rate and Low-Dose-Rate Techniques/ GammaPod Therapy/ GRID Treatment/ Image-Guided Radiation Therapy/ Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and Intensity-Modulated Arc Therapy/ MammoSite and SAVI Applicator/ Photodynamic Therapy/ Proton Therapy/ SIR Spheres and Radiolabeled Microsphere Therapy/ Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy/ Thermal Therapy (Hyperthermia)
