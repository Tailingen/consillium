Y-90 SIRT for Unresectable HCC Larger Than 7cm
This is a phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SIRT in patients with HCC greater than 7 cm. After enrollment, patients received yttrium-90 selective internal radiation therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is objective reponse rate (ORR) as assessed by mRECIST. Secondary endpoints were: objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1, disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety (incidence and severity of adverse events).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-Resectable
PROCEDURE: SIRT
Objective response rate (ORR) per mRECIST, The proportion of patients with the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to mRECIST, 3 years
Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, The proportion of patients with the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with the best response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, 3 years|Progression free survival (PFS), The time from date of treatment initiation until the first occurrence of disease progression (according to mRECIST and RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 3 years|time to response (TTR), The time from treatment initiation to first tumour remission (mRECIST and RECIST 1.1), 3 years|Duration of response (DOR), Time from first tumor response to first disease progression (mRECIST and RECIST 1.1 assessment) or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), 3 years|Overall survival (OS), The time from date of treatment initiation to death due to any cause, 4 years|Adverse Events (AEs), Number of patients with AEs assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, 3 years
