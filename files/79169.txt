Clinical Study of HiR+X Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Elderly Patients with DLBCL Intolerant to Chemotherapy
To explore the application of HiR (Zebtorizumab, Lenalidomide) + X (targeted drug) guided by NGS molecular typing, the aim is to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety in newly diagnosed unfit or frail elderly patients with DLBCL aged ≥70 years, and to investigate the genetic subtypes that may benefit from HiR-X.
