Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab in Surgically Resectable Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether the administration of atezolizumab before surgical resection of the tumor is feasible and to evaluate the treatment response, safety, and tolerability of atezolizumab.
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Percentage of Patients Who Complete Neoadjuvant Therapy and Were Eligible for Curative Surgical Resection, Percentage of patients that are able to complete 3 cycles of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and were eligible for curative surgical resection will be measured., 9 weeks
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate will be measured based on RECIST v1.1 criteria at baseline, after cycle 2, and at the time or surgery. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., After cycle 3 (duration of each cycle 21 days)|Pathological Response Rate, Pathological response will be assessed by local pathological review at baseline, after cycle 2, and and at the time or surgery Patients with no viable tumor seen will be classified as a complete pathological response. Patients with \< 10% of viable tumor will be classified as a major pathological response., After cycle 3 (duration of each cycle 21 days)|Changes in Vital Structures, Assessed changes in vital structures preserved following neoadjuvant treatment, 9 weeks|Changes in Surgical Margins, Assess change in surgical margins preserved following neoadjuvant treatment, 9 weeks|Safety and Tolerability of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab, A secondary outcome measure was to assess safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant atezolizumab. Adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and treatment-related toxicities were recorded at each study-related visit., 9 weeks
Primary Objective:

Determine the feasibility of three doses of atezolizumab prior to surgery in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

Secondary Objectives:

* Assess response rates to neoadjuvant atezolizumab

  * Objective response rate following completion of neoadjuvant therapy based on RECIST 1.1 criteria
  * Pathological response rate (major and complete pathological response) in final surgical resection specimen
* Assess change in surgical margins or vital structures preserved following neoadjuvant treatment
* Assess safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant atezolizumab
