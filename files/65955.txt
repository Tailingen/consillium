Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer by Purine Metabolite (Hypoxanthine, Xanthine) in Urine
* This study aim to develope a diagnostic method of pancreatic cancer by using a reagent for analyzing purine metabolite (Hypoxanthine, Xanthine) in urine.
* It is safe and cost effective compare to radiologic or blood test. It can be used for initial screening test for healty population.

DEVICE: Purine metabolite (Hypoxanthine, Xanthine) in urine by CubeBio
Urine, mean concentration of purine metabolites in urine, 1 day
* CubeBio and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital signed a joint technology development agreement to compare the analytical performance of existing analytical methods and purine metabolite analysis reagents developed by CubeBio.
* Through quantitative analysis of hypoxanthine and xanthine in the urine of normal people and pancreatic cancer patients, we plan to confirm the possibility of diagnosing pancreatic cancer using reagents for analyzing purine metabolites.
* Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a key determinant of cure and survival rates, and impact on all aspects of cancer, including rate of progression, treatment, and prognosis.
* This study could change the paradigm of pancreatic cancer screening by evaluating the stability and accuracy of urinary purine metabolite analysis reagents.
