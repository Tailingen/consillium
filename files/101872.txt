APEMESH II - Perineal Reconstruction
The objective of this pilot study is to assess the safety, functional outcome, feasibility and the potential benefits of synthetic mesh strip and gluteus flap reconstruction in perineum in case-control setting.

Several studies have reported over 30% morbidity with perineal wound healing after abdominoperineal resection. Preoperative radiotherapy seems to be a strong predictor for perineal complications. Musculocutaneus flaps and use of biological mesh seem to minimize perineal morbidity.
