Determine the Frequency of Variants in the GBA/PSAP Genes in Patients With MM or MGUS
No effective specific treatment is currently available for the management of Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS). A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms would make it possible to propose treatments specifically targeting the deregulated pathways.

BIOLOGICAL: Evaluation of the presence and number of mutated alleles of the GBA/PSAP genes in patients with MM or MGUS
Frequency of variants in the GBA/PSAP genes in patients with MM or MGUS, The main aim of the research is to determine the frequency of variants in the GBA/PSAP genes in patients with MM or MGUS., inclusion (one day)
Plasma concentrations of LGL1 in patients with MM or MGUS, Compare the plasma concentration of LGL1 in MM and MGUS patients versus control individuals, inclusion (one day)|Reactivity of monoclonal antibodies in MM and MGUS patients, Assess the % (proportion of patients with reactivity (% reactivity greater than 0) and those without (% reactivity equal to 0)) of reactivity of monoclonal antibodies from MM and MGUS patients to LGL1, inclusion (one day)
This study will characterise the links between rare diseases and complex, chronic diseases. Metabolism can be visualised as a complex network in which the various biomolecules represent metabolic nodes and are linked together by connections. The number of connections at a node influences the effect of that biomolecule on the metabolic network(s) as a whole. If a biomolecule has a large number of connections, altering a metabolic pathway involving it will have an effect that will spread throughout the network. On the other hand, metabolic pathways with a high flux have a major impact on the homeostasis of the network. Thus, alteration of such a metabolic pathway cannot be without consequence: a major alteration could induce a rare hereditary metabolic disease with an early-onset clinic, whereas an alteration with a moderate effect could participate in the pathogenesis of complex diseases, and may open up new therapeutic prospects for these tumour pathologies.
