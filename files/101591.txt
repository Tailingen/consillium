Erlotinib and Docetaxel in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After Failure of One Chemotherapy Regimen
Erlotinib has demonstrated efficacy as a single agent in patients with NSCLC and the addition of erlotinib to chemotherapy has not achieved better results in the general population.

However, several preclinical and phase I studies have shown that a sequential treatment of erlotinib and chemotherapy could avoid a possible negative interaction between both drugs when administrated concomitantly, and therefore, it could improve the benefit of the combination therapy.

This study will investigate if the intermittent treatment of a chemotherapy drug, such as docetaxel, with erlotinib could achieve a clinical benefit.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel and Erlotinib|DRUG: Erlotinib
Percentage of patients without disease progression after 6 months of treatment., 6 months
Progression-free survival, Time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death for any cause. Tumour progression will be assessed every 2 months.|Duration of Response, The time from the first complete response or partial response until objective tumor progression or death due to progression disease. Tumour progression will be assessed every 2 months.|Overall Response Rate, The proportion of patients with tumor size reduction (complete response or partial response following RECIST criteria). Response will be assessed every 2 months.|Disease Control Rate, The proportion of patients without tumor size increase (complete response, partial response or stable disease following RECIST criteria). Response wil be assessed every 2 months.|Overall survival, Time from randomization until death from any cause. Follow up wil be assessed every 3 months after finishing study treatment.|Safety profile, Toxicity will be discribed per cycle and per patient according to CTCAE vs. 3, every 3 weeks.
