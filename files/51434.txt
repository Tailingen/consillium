A Study of Zilovertamab Vedotin (MK-2140) in Combination With Standard of Care in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (rrDLBCL) (MK-2140-003)
The purpose of this Phase 2/3, randomized, multisite, open-label, dose confirmation, and expansion study is to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of zilovertamab vedotin (ZV) in combination with standard of care options for the treatment of rrDLBCL. This study will be divided into 2 parts: Dose Confirmation (Part 1) and Efficacy Expansion (Part 2) and will enroll participants who are at least 18 years of age with rrDLBCL. The hypotheses are: ZV in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) is superior to R-GemOx with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per Lugano response criteria by blinded independent review committee (BICR); and that ZV in combination with bendamustine rituximab (BR) is superior to BR with respect to PFS per Lugano response criteria by BICR.

With protocol amendment 4 (effective: 04-April-2024), enrollment in Cohort B (study arms Bendamustine Rituximab \[BR\] and ZV + BR) is discontinued. No efficacy outcome analysis and hypothesis testing will be conducted for Cohort B.

Number of participants who experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Part 1, The CTCAE, Version 5.0 will be used to grade the severity of AEs in this study. DLTs will be reported for Part 1 of this study., Up to ~6 weeks|Number of participants who experienced an adverse event (AE), An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The number of participants who experienced an AE will be reported., Up to ~68 months|Number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE, An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to ~68months|Overall survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause will be reported., Up to ~35 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per Lugano response criteria as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first will be presented., Up to ~26 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Lugano criteria as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to ~26 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, will be reported., Up to ~26 months
