Blood Sample Collection to Evaluate Biomarkers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The primary objective of this study is to obtain de-identified, clinically-characterized whole blood specimens for use in developing and evaluating the performance of new biomarker assays for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

OTHER: Blood Sample Collection|OTHER: Blood Sample Collection
Biomarker Identification, Biomarkers under evaluation include differential methylation of nucleic acids and altered expression of proteins in blood from subjects with HCC compared to those without (but are at risk of developing the disease so are under surveillance), 1 year
Subjects with untreated Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and subjects undergoing HCC surveillance will be enrolled and have blood samples collected. Subjects undergoing HCC surveillance will be followed for up to 6 months. Another blood sample will be collected at the 6 month visit which will be scheduled no longer than 6 months from enrollment.
