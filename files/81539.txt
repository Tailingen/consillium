Phase 3 Trial of a Bivalent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine (Cecolin®) in Young Girls
This randomized controlled trial will evaluate a bivalent HPV vaccine, Cecolin®, in alternate 2-dose regimens, compared to an established HPV vaccine. Gardasil® will be used as the comparator vaccine, as this vaccine is most widely used in low- and low-middle income countries.

Solicited AEs with onset after the solicitation period and through Day 30 post-vaccination were captured as unsolicited AEs., For 30 days after each dose (Month 0 (all groups), Month 6 (Groups 1 and 4), Month 12 (Group 2), and Month 24 (Groups 3 and 5)|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An SAE was any AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes:

1. Death
2. Was life-threatening
3. Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
4. Resulted in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect.
6. Important medical event that may not have resulted in one of the above outcomes but may have jeopardized the health of the study participant or (and) required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of SAEs.

SAEs were collected from the time of first vaccination through the end of the study for each participant., From first dose through the end of study (up to 730 days for Groups 1 and 4, 395 days for Group 2, and 760 days for Groups 3 and 5)
GMC of Anti-HPV-16 IgG Antibodies Prior to the Second Dose, To evaluate the persistence of antibody responses to HPV after a single dose of vaccine, anti-HPV-16 IgG antibodies were measured using HPV-16 VLP ELISA immediately prior to the second dose., Prior to the second dose (Month 6 for Groups 1 & 4, Month 12 for Group 2, and Month 24 for Groups 3 & 5).|GMC of Anti-HPV-18 IgG Antibodies Prior to the Second Dose, To evaluate the persistence of antibody responses to HPV after a single dose of vaccine, anti-HPV-18 IgG antibodies were measured using HPV-16 VLP ELISA immediately prior to the second dose., Prior to the second dose (Month 6 for Groups 1 & 4, Month 12 for Group 2, and Month 24 for Groups 3 & 5).
This randomized, active-comparator controlled, open-label study will enroll total of approximately 1025 girls aged 9 to 14 years, in one country in Africa (Ghana) and one country in South/Southeast Asia (Bangladesh). Participants will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive Cecolin® at 0 and 6 months, 0 and 12 months, or 0 and 24 months, Gardasil® at 0 and 6 months, or Gardasil® at 0 months and Cecolin® at 24 months. For each arm, blood will be collected for immunologic testing at baseline and one month following second dose. Additional blood collections will occur immediately prior to the administration of the second dose, as well as at additional later time points, for immunobridging to other published and ongoing trials. The study also aims to evaluate the performance of a mixed arm (group 5) of Gardasil® followed by Cecolin® and collect data on effects of interchangeability.

Girls of target age will be identified, and their parents contacted to attend an informational session for individual discussion, informed consent, assent and randomization.

The study will be conducted by the research groups in International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Bangladesh and the Malaria Research Center (MRC) in Ghana.
