Phase Ib Study of CBP-1019 in Combination With FOLFOX +/- Bevacizumab, Pembrolizumab, or Enzalutamide for Metastatic TRPV6-overexpressing Solid Tumors of Epithelial Origin
An open-label, Phase Ib dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of CBP-1019 combinations in patients with solid tumors of epithelial origin.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: CBP-1019|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-FLUOROURACIL|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Enzalutamide
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

To determine the safety and tolerability of CBP-1019 combinations (Regimen A: CBP-1019 plus FOLFOX; Regimen B: CBP-1019 plus FOLFOX with bevacizumab; Regimen C: CBP-1019 plus pembrolizumab; and Regimen D: CBP-1019 plus enzalutamide) in metastatic solid tumors of epithelial origin.

To determine the ORR of CBP-1019 combinations in selected metastatic solid tumors of epithelial origin.

Secondary Objective:

To evaluate other indicators of the antitumor activity of CBP-1019 combinations.

Exploratory Objectives:

To explore potential biomarkers associated with response/resistance and major clinical outcomes (toxicity and antitumor activities) through molecular profiling at the DNA, RNA and protein levels.

To explore patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
