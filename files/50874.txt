A Phase I Trial to Establish the Safety and Maximum Tolerated Dose of High-affinity Autologous BCMA-targeting Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Malignancies
The purpose of this phase I study is to determine whether MDC-CAR-BCMA001 (BCMA directed CAR T-cells) is safe and tolerable in the treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell malignancies
Neoplasms|Relapsed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)|Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)|Multiple Myeloma, Refractory|Multiple Myeloma in Relapse
GENETIC: MDC-CAR-BCMA001 (BCMA directed CAR T-cells)
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MDC-CAR-BCMA001, The MTD will be defined as the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate., appr. 24 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events V5.0, appr. 24 months|Incidence and severity of Cytokine release syndrome, Grading of Cytokine release syndrome according to American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy consensus criteria, appr. 24 months|Incidence and severity of Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, Grading of Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome according to American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy consensus criteria, appr. 24 months|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during DLT-evaluation period and beyond, appr.24 months
