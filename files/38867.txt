AGARIC Case Control Study
The aim of the study is to establish the existence of a relationship between the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the risk of colorectal cancer in humans, using 2 reliable and complementary biomarkers: the fatty acid-composition of lipids of the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and the fatty acid composition of erythrocyte phospholipids.
