Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of GSK2256098 in Healthy Volunteers
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new drug and to look at how the drug is handled by your body. This is the first time the drug will be given to people, the drug has been safely given to animals over many days at higher doses than will be given in the study. The study will be done in healthy men and woman to determine what effects, good or bad, it has on thier health. This study will find out:

If the drug has any side effects after one dose of the drug is given? How much of the drug gets into the bloodstream, and how long does the body take to get rid of it? If the drug causes any changes to a substance that is in skin, hair or blood.
Cancer
DRUG: GSK2256098|DRUG: Placebo
To characterize the safety of single doses of GSK2256098 in adult healthy subjects, within 10-14 days following administration of study drug|To characterize the single dose pharmacokinetics of GSK2256098 in blood and urine in adult healthy subjects, 14 days after administration of study drug
To examine the dose proportionality of GSK2256098 pharmacokinetic parameters following single dose administration in healthy subjects, 14 days|To explore dose- and concentration-effect relationships for various safety parameters, if appropriate, 14 days|To estimate the effect of high fat/calorie meal on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of GSK2256098., 14 days|To explore and potentially identify small molecules or cytokines in plasma which may serve as biomarkers for future studies, 14 days
This study represents the first administration of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor GSK2256098 to humans to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary food effect following single oral doses in adult healthy subjects before proceeding to studies in subjects with cancer that will be given at higher doses over an extended period of time. FAK is a protein in the body that is important in cancer development. Objectives of the study will be to characterize the safety of single doses of GSK2256098; to characterize the single dose PK of GSK2256098 in the presence and absence of food; to examine the dose proportionality of GSK2256098 PK parameters following single dose administration; and to characterize the effect of single doses of GSK2256098 on phospho-FAK (pFAK) tyrosine 397 (Y397) levels in skin and hair follicles. Dose- and concentration-effect relationships for various safety parameters will be explored as appropriate.
