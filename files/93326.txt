Laparoscopic Single-site Surgery Versus Conventional Entry in Ovarian Cystectomy
The aim of this work is to evaluate the postoperative consequences of laparoendoscopic single site surgery relative to conventional laparoscopy in presumed benign ovarian cyst.

The hypothesis is that single incision technique might offer advantages over the standard multi-port laparoscopy as potentially leading to less postoperative pain and improved cosmoses from a relatively hidden umbilical scar, as well as risk reduction of postoperative wound infection, hernia formation and elimination of multiple trocar site closure
Ovarian Cyst Benign
PROCEDURE: Laparoendoscpoic single site surgery LESS|PROCEDURE: Conventional multiport laparoscopy
Postoperative pain, The pain will be assessed by a numeric rating scale of 0-10, at 24 hours Â± 2 hour after the intervention
Operative time, the time between the start of the incision up to the cutaneous closing of the trocar orifices, intraoperative|the need for conversion to laparotomy, the need for conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative|the need to add an additional trocar, the need to add an additional trocar, intraoperative
