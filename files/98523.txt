Gamma Knife Radiosurgery vs Initial Conservative Treatment for Vestibular Schwannoma Patients With Preserved Hearing, a Prospective Randomized Study
The effect of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on hearing loss, in patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) and preserved hearing is still unclear. Retrospective data indicate that the hearing is preserved in most patient years after the gamma knife treatment. Recent prospective data suggests that radiosurgery could be a hearing preserving treatment for these patients.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate if GKRS can inhibit progression of hearing loss in patients with VS. Patients with preserved hearing will be offered to participate in the study and randomized ether to GKRS or initial conservative treatment for their vestibular schwannoma. They will then be followed with scheduled magnetic resonance image(MRI) and audiometry and evaluated after one, three and five years after treatment.
Vestibular Schwannoma
RADIATION: Initial Gamma knife radiosurgery
The numbers of participants with preserve hearing, Baseline audiometric investigation will be performed at time of enrollment. Patients will be followed with audiometric investigations after 1, 3 and 5 years after gamma knife or conservative treatment.Primary endpoint will be numbers of patients with preserve hearing for each treatment arm., up to five years after enrollment
Tumor control, MR investigation including digitalized volumetric of vestibular schwannomas will be performed, 1, 2, 5 years after enrollment
