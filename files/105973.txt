Clinical Application of Novel Panels for Early Precision Diagnosis and Relapse Prediction in High-risk Leukemia
Based on the investigator's previous data on risk classification for acute leukemia,the investigators will design a set of panels to detect the gene expression and genomic variants (SNPs, mutation, insertion, deletion and fusion genes, etc), and identify the high-risk subtypes of acute leukemia, such as Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Furthermore, the target therapy (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors,et.al) will be used to treat the identified patients. In addition, more sensitive minimal residual disease (MRD) detection technology will be designed and used to detect the MRD in patients to early predict the disease relapse.
Leukemia, Acute
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: High-risk subtype detection panels
complete remission, Patients achieve complete remission after initial treatment, From date of randomization or initial treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|relapse, Patients' disease progress after complete remission, From date of randomization or complete remission until the date of first documented relapse from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks
patient eligibility criteria: newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients with clinical high-risk markers, reflactory and relapsed patients.
