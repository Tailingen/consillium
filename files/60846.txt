A Study of AK112 With or Without AK117 in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This trial is a Phase II study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of AK112 with or without AK117 in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer who are not suitable for surgery.
