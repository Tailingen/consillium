Long-Term Follow-up in Patients Included in the Meta-analysis "Sleep Apnea Syndrome and Arterial Stiffness"
The meta-analysis "sleep apnea syndrome and arterial stiffness" includes data from 893 patients initially included in 9 studies conducted by the EFCR Department of the CHUGA between 2006 and 2015, presenting a sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) with exploration of their arterial stiffness via the measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV).

Currently, we do not have long-term follow-up data for these patients.

The first objective of the "PWV Follow-up" project is to collect cardiovascular events in these patients through telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire to determine the prevalence of these events. The prevalence of metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths will be also determined as secondary objectives through the same questionnaire.

Others secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in the literature.

The 9 studies were referred as : ADISAS (NCT011968), AGIRSASADOM (NCT010902), BPCO (NCT004044), BPCO-SAS (NCT01195064), DIAMETASAS, Aortic Dissection (NCT01068691), INFRASAS (NCT010892), VALSAS (NCT004094), NIV-OHS (NCT006030).

The objective of this meta-analysis on individual data was to understand the relationship between the severity of the sleep apnea syndrome (measured by the apnea + hypopnea index) and arterial rigidity at the time of diagnosis of SAS.

Currently, we do not have long-term follow-up data for these patients.
