Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After Curative Treatment by Monitoring Circulating Tumor DNA
The goal of the REMNANT study is to confirm the clinical value of detecting a new biomarker, ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA), in the follow-up of patients with operated liver cancer. In order to meet this objective, this biomarker will be measured in your blood before and after surgery, at three and six months.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and develops in 80% of cases in the context of underlying cirrhosis1. Surgical resection, percutaneous destruction and liver transplantation are the three treatments considered curative with a non-negligible risk of recurrence of 35-50% at 2 years2.

Several data in the literature suggest that small subclinical tumors can be detected by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and that the amount of tcDNA detected seems to correlate with risk factors for recurrence such as tumor size or microvascular invasion3, 4.

The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the detection of ctDNA following tumor ablation and its impact on early recurrence.
