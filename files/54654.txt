DRUG: Durvalumab
Resection rate, To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant durvalumab + chemotherapy in terms of resection rate in participants with borderline resectable stage III NSCLC., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
R0 resection rate., To investigate surgical outcomes.R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed.R0 resection rate =The number of subjects whose lesions were completely removed/the number of subjects who participated in the surgery, Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
