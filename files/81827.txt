Radiomics and Radiogenomics Models to Predict Molecular Integrated Risk Classes and Prognostic Factors in Endometrial Cancer.
The aim is to develop radiogenomics models to stratify patients into three main risk categories (Favorable, Intermediate, and Unfavorable) according to the ProMisE model (9) and use these models to predict the most prognostically relevant EC histopathological features (i.e. FIGO stage, degree of tumor differentiation, histotype, LVSI status, myometrial and cervical invasion, lymph node metastases).

These models would support clinicians in personalizing surgical and adjuvant treatment choice among the options considered by the international guidelines.
Endometrial Cancer
OTHER: trascriptomic profiling
Predictive value of the model, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be performed to determine cut-off values for the studied quantitative variables., up to one year
Validity of the model, To test the validity of different clinical and ultrasound variables Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) will be determined, up to one year
