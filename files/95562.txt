ch14.18 Pharmacokinetic Study in High-risk Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and safety of chimeric (ch) 14.18 manufactured by two independent drug makers (United Therapeutics \[UTC\] or the National Cancer Institute \[NCI\]).
Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: ch14.18 -NCI|BIOLOGICAL: ch14.18-UTC|BIOLOGICAL: Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)|BIOLOGICAL: Aldesleukin (IL-2)|DRUG: Isotretinoin
Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC), Twenty-two PK samples will be obtained at the following timepoints:

Courses 1 and 3:

This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, two-sequence, cross-over study for eligible subjects with high-risk neuroblastoma to assess the comparability of ch14.18 manufactured with UTC drug product and ch14.18 manufactured with NCI drug product. Subjects will be randomly allocated to receive ch14.18 manufactured by UTC or NCI during Courses 1 and 2 followed by ch14.18 manufactured by other manufacturer (UTC or NCI) during Courses 3, 4, and 5.
