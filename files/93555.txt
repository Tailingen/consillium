Dose-finding Study of BP-C1 in Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Minimum Efficient Dose (MED) of BP-C1 in the short-term treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Stage IV Breast Cancer
DRUG: BP-C1
Change in Maximum Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) score for Adverse Events, Maximum CTC score will be recorded using CTC v2.0 given as the highest observed CTC score at a given visit. The CTC scores will be recorded using CTC v2.0 divided in 15 System Organ Classes, baseline to Day 32 of treatment and Day 28 of follow-up|Sum Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) score for Adverse Events, The Sum CTC score will be a sum of all registered CTC scores obtained at a given visit. The CTC scores will be recorded using CTC v2.0 divided in 15 System Organ Classes, baseline to Day 32 of treatment and Day 28 of follow-up
Number of registered Adverse Events (AEs), baseline to Day 32 of treatment period and Day 28 of follow-up|Treatment Response, In accordance with RECIST v1.1 the treatment response will be classified as 'complete response', 'partial response', 'stable disease' or 'progressive disease': Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., baseline to Day 32 of treatment and Day 28 of follow-up|Proportion of patients with Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR defined as patients classified as SD, PR, CR, baseline to Day 32 of treatment and Day 28 of follow-up
BP-C1, solution for injection 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent. Active substance of the product, which is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for intramuscular administration, is a cis-diammineplatinum(II) complexed with a polymer containing benzene polycarboxylic acids derived from lignin. The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear and significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin), additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients:

* injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;
* can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;
* has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;
* demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin (in-vitro; in-vivo data);
* exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

In this study BP-C1 will be administered as supportive care to patients with metastatic breast cancer (stage IV), who had undergone at least three lines of chemotherapy.

This study will be open-label, multi-centre with a sequential safety design based on 3-level between-patient Response Surface Pathway (RSP) algorithm. The eligible patients will be allocated to five independent sequences, with three patients in each sequence. The BP-C1 treatment period will be 32 days, the follow-up period will be 28 days after the last BP-C1 dose.
