TRICIN: Prospective Study on the Efficacy of Single Topical Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) 85% in the Treatment of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 1/2)
Trichloroacetic acid 85% =TCA is an investigational device intended to achieve a complete histologic remission in individuals with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1/2. The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved Investigational Plan on subjects, who have given written informed consent.

High remission and regression rates are expected after a single topical treatment with 85% TCA. After a single topical treatment with 85% TCA for CIN 1-2 (Expected 70% or higher; null hypothesis: not higher than 55%). Regression is defined as improvement from high grade lesion (CIN 2) at baseline to low grade lesion (CIN 1) after TCA treatment. Regression from CIN 1 normal squamous epithelium after the TCA treatment is equal to remission and will be counted as a remission in combined analysis. Remission is defined as complete histologic remission of CIN back to normal squamous epithelium after the TCA treatment, i.e., no cervical dysplasia is detectable by histology or cytology after the TCA treatment. Type-specific HPV Clearance is defined as disappearance of the HPV type detected at screening.
