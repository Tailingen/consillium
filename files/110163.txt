Risk Adapted Therapy in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
This randomized phase II trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: rituximab, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,prednisone, filgrastim
Response rate, one year post-registration
Event-free survival, Up to 3 years post-registration
objectives:

1. To compare the response rates and toxicity of R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R in untreated CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.
2. To compare the event-free survival of R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy in untreated CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.
3. To develop predictors of outcome of R-CHOP and DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy.
