Feasibility Study Testing a Sleep Intervention in Prostate Cancer Patients With Insomnia
This study of a randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week sleep program and the randomized controlled trial research procedure. In total 20 participants will be recruited and randomized to the intervention or control group.

This feasibility study of a randomized controlled trial, aims to evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week sleep program consisting on aerobic exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy. In this study the investigators wish to evaluate the program as well as the randomized controlled trial research procedure.

In total 20 participants will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention group (n=10) or control group (n=10).The intervention group will participate in two exercise sessions each week and four sessions based on cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia.
