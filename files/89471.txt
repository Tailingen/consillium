Very Early FDG-PET/CT-response Adapted Therapy for Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (H11)
The main objective of the trial is to show that doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD)-based response-adapted therapy for advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, with treatment intensification (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPPesc) in case of a positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) after one cycle of ABVD, has non-inferior efficacy compared with the intensive BEACOPPesc regimen. A second objective is to assess the prognostic value of FDG-PET/CT after one cycle of BEACOPPesc.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: ABVD + FDG-PET/CT Scan treatment adaptation|DRUG: BEACOPPesc
Freedom from treatment failure, 9 years after first patient in (FPI)
response at the end of therapy, 9 years after FPI|Progression-free survival, 9 years after FPI|Overall survival, 9 years after FPI|Acute toxicity, * Hematological toxicity (blood cell count) can be significant especially for patients who will receive BEACOPPesc .
* Bleomycine interstitial pneumonitis has been frequently reported and requires the immediate stop of further bleomycine administration.
* Rarely, procarbazine allergy and intolerance has been reported.
* Nausea \& vomiting due to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, dacarbazine and procarbazine may be significant.
* Total reversible alopecia occurs in most cases.
* Escalated BEACOPP-related toxic deaths have been reported but do not exceed those observed with standard ABVD., 9 years after FPI|Long-term toxicity in terms of second malignancies, cardiovascular and pulmonary events, 9 years after FPI
