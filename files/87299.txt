The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral AMXT 1501 dicaprate (AMXT1501) in combination with DFMO in patients with advanced solid tumors. Secondary objectives include characterization of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMXT 1501 as well as pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of the impact of AMXT 1501 in combination with DFMO on polyamine uptake by circulating lymphocytes (blood cells).

To these aims, the study will evaluate the safety, PK and PD profiles of orally-administered AMXT 1501 and DFMO. Approximately, 52 patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMXT 1501 and DFMO in combination. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below at which dose escalation is stopped.
