The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called Abemaciclib. Abemaciclib could shrink your cancer but it could also cause side effects. Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will delay the growth of the cancer or shrink the cancer by at least one quarter compared to its present size. Abemaciclib is not FDA approved and has not been tested in liposarcoma, but it has shrunk tumors in patients with breast cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer.
