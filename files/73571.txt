A Study of Opevesostat (MK-568)4 in Japanese Participants With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) (MK-5684-005)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of opevesostat in the treatment of Japanese men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with Next Generation Hormonal Agent (NHA) and taxane-based chemotherapy.

Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) as Assessed Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 by the Investigator, The following events, if considered drug related by the Investigator, will be considered a DLT: Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except anemia and thrombocytopenia; Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or fatigue lasting \>3 days despite optimal supportive care; other nonhematologic grade ≥3 toxicities of any duration (not laboratory); Grade ≥3 nonhematologic laboratory abnormality (if certain criteria are met); febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4; missing \>25% of opevesostat doses as a result of drug-related AE(s) during the first 28 days; Grade 5 toxicity. The number of participants who experience a DLT will be presented., Up to 28 days|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and does not imply any judgment about causality., Up to approximately 24 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and does not imply any judgment about causality., Up to approximately 24 months
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of opevesostat, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine the Cmax., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of opevesostat, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine the Tmax., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)|Area Under the Curve from Time 0 to 12 hours postdose (AUC0-12) of opevesostat, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine the AUC0-12., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of opevesostat, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine the Vz/F., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)|Oral Clearance (CL/F) of opevesostat, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine the CL/F., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)|Half-Life (t½) of opevesostat, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine the t½., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)|Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) response, Percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a reduction in PSA level of ≥50% measured twice ≥3 weeks apart., Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time from first dose of study drug to PSA progression. PSA progression date is defined as the date of 1) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir, confirmed by a second value ≥3 weeks later if there is PSA decline from baseline, or 2) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks if there is no PSA decline from baseline., Up to approximately 24 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS) Per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, Time from first dose of study drug to radiographic progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, Percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a best overall response of either confirmed Complete Response (CR) or a confirmed Partial Response (PR) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, Time from first documented evidence of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from first dose of study intervention to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 24 months|Blood Concentrations of Steroids, Blood samples collected at multiple timepoints after the administration of opevesostat will be used to determine the blood concentrations of steroids., Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, Day 85, and at first visit after the last dose of opevesostat (up to approximately 24 months)
