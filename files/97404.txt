Role of Intraperitoneal Intraoperative Chemotherapy With Paclitaxel in the Surgical Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Ovarian Cancer. Hyperthermia Versus Normothermia
A randomized controlled single-blind clinical trial was performed, in 32 patients diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis from epithelial ovarian cancer, who underwent radical surgery-peritonectomy, achieving an optimal R0-R1 cytoreduction (microscopic tumor residues (R0) or macroscopic tumor residues \< 1cm (R1)) followed by hyperthermia against normothermia intraperitoneal intraoperative chemotherapy with paclitaxel
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: Paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: Radical surgery-peritonectomy
The Grouped Miller and Payne (MP) System for Pathological Response: G1 (Minimal Changes and < 30% Cells Tumour Reduction That Includes MP G1-G2), G3 (Microscopic Foci, Cells Tumour Reduction up to >90% That Includes MP G3-G4) and G5 (no Residual Tumour), Histopathology scoring system to assess response, previous and post intraperitoneal intraoperative chemotherapy. Compare cancer cellularity of the biopsy (before treatment) with the other biopsy (after treatment)., The biopsies were taken before and after the treatment (intraperitoneal intraoperative chemotherapy for 60 minutes) and then they were analysed by two blinded pathologists.
