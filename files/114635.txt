A Study Evaluating AMG 193 in Combination With Other Therapies in Participants With Advanced Gastrointestinal, Biliary Tract, or Pancreatic Cancers With Homozygous Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP)-Deletion
The study aims to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended combination dose of the MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor AMG 193 administered in combination with other therapies in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted gastrointestinal, biliary tract, or pancreatic cancers. The study also aims to determine the safety profile of AMG 193 administered in combination with other therapies in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced MTAP-deleted gastrointestinal, biliary tract, or pancreatic cancers.
