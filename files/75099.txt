Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®) Vaccine In Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
This study will examine the safety and potential effectiveness of poly-ICLC directly injected into malignant pleural mesothelioma at the time of biopsy up to 21 days prior to the cancer being removed by the surgeon
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
BIOLOGICAL: Safety|BIOLOGICAL: Expansion Cohort
The probability of rejecting the investigational treatment is at least 81%, if the DLT rate is greater than 33% and the probability of accepting the treatment is at least 71% if the DLT rate is less than a safe level of 17%., Safety will be assessed by the frequency and severity of toxicities by use of NCI-CTCAE 5.0 criteria., up to 27 days
Objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 using CT imaging., Local Recurrence-free survival from time of first injection until first date that locally recurrent disease is confirmed or date of documented death., up to 27days
* To evaluate the safety and toxicity of IT Poly-ICLC, Hiltonol® prior to surgical resection for patients with MPM.
* To determine objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 using CT imaging.
* To determine recurrence free survival of subjects treated with IT Poly-ICLC followed by surgical resection defined as the time of injection until the first date that recurrent disease is confirmed or date of documented death.
* To evaluate IT Poly-ICLC induced immune changes in the tumor microenvironment by comparing pre-injection biopsy to surgically resected tissue for immune cell infiltration and T cell receptor (TCR) diversity.
* To characterize additional immune parameters in IT Poly-ICLC injected tumors including in-depth phenotypic and functional characterization of immune infiltrating cells.
* To evaluate IT Poly-ICLC induced serological changes and changes of circulating immune cells, including regulatory T cells and NK cells, by comparing pre-injection to post-surgical resection blood samples.
