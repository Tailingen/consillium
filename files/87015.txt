The Effect of a Mobile Application on Patient Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer Patients
The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the interactive nurse support program developed as a mobile application on patient outcomes (symptom management, quality of life, perception of social support and anxiety) in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process; It was planned in a randomized controlled, single-blind design. In the study, a mobile application will be designed for colorectal cancer patients with the content created in line with the literature. In the application, the "about COVID-19" module, which includes information for colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 process, the "learning module" in which the symptoms and suggestions for colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are included, the "discussion" module where patients can share their knowledge and experiences with each other, The "ask the expert" module, where nurses and physicians can ask questions, will be comprised of the "lived stories" module and the communication sections, which include interview videos made with individuals who are in remission only after completing the treatment related to the disease. A pretest consisting of Personal Information Form, Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 Quality of Life Scale, ECOG Performance Scale and Beck Anxiety Scale will be administered to all patients included in the study. The mobile application will be installed on the phones of the patients in the experimental group and they will be used for 12 weeks. Patients in the control group will receive standard care during this process and no intervention will be made. In the sixth and twelve weeks, all participants will be given a posttest. The change in symptom management, quality of life, perceived social support and anxiety levels of the experimental group after mobile application use will be evaluated.

Change of EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Scale and QLQ- CR29 Module score at baseline and one week later fisrt,second,third and forth chemothraphy., EORTC QLQ-C30 Version 3.0 Quality of Life Scale is a scale developed by EORTC and used in cancer patients. Content validity and reliability study was conducted in Turkey by Beşer and Öz, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was r= 0.9014. The first 28 of the 30 items in the scale are of four-point Likert type and the items are evaluated as Never: 1, A little bit: 2, Quitely: 3, A lot: 4 points. In the 29th question of the scale, the patient is asked to evaluate his health on a scale of 1 to 7 (1: very poor and 7: excellent), and in the 30th question, the patient's overall quality of life is asked. High functional scale and general health status scale scores of the patients; A low symptom scale score indicates a high quality of life. EORTC QLQ CR 29 is an adapted quality of life scale for colorectal cancer. All 29 items in the scale are in four-point Likert type and the items are evaluated as Never: 1, A little: 2, Quitely: 3, A lot: 4 points., the first measure will be made before chemotherapy. The second, third,forth and fifth measurement will be madeone week after the first second, third and forth chemotherapy. respectively|Change of memorial symptom assesment Scale score at baseline and one week later fisrt,second,third and forth chemothraphy., The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale was developed by Portenoy et al. (1994). The validity and reliability of the scale were made by Yıldırım et al. (2011), and the Cronbach α coefficient was found to be 0.84. The scale has 32 items and allows to evaluate the frequency and severity of the symptoms experienced by cancer patients. While the 'frequency' and 'severity' levels of the symptoms are answered as a 4-point likert, the 'distress' levels are answered as a 5-point likert. The MSAS total score is obtained by averaging the 32 symptom scores. Each symptom score is calculated by averaging the frequency, severity, and degree of distress. Higher values indicate higher frequency, severity, and distress., the first measure will be made before chemotherapy. The second, third,forth and fifth measurement will be madeone week after the first second, third and forth chemotherapy. respectively|Change of Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale score at baseline and one week later fisrt,second,third and forth chemothraphy., The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support was developed by Zimet et al. (Zimet et al. 1988) and the Turkish validity and reliability of MSPSQ was performed by Eker et al. (Eker et al., 1995). The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support subjectively evaluates the adequacy of social support from three different sources. This scale is a scale consisting of 12 items. It includes 3 groups related to the source of the support, each of which consists of 4 items. These; family, friends and a special person. Each item was rated using a 7-point scale. In the group treated as a special person; Persons such as dating, relatives, neighbors, doctors and nurses are included. The Turkish reliability of the scale was found to be 0.88 Cronbach'sα coefficient. Any score between 12 and 84 can be obtained from the scale, and a high score indicates a high perceived social support., the first measure will be made before chemotherapy. The second, third,forth and fifth measurement will be madeone week after the first second, third and forth chemotherapy. respectively|Change of Beck Anxiety Inventory score at baseline and one week later fisrt,second,third and forth chemothraphy., Beck Anxiety Inventory is a 21-item self-assessment scale developed by Aeron T. Beck in 1988. Ulusoy et al. It was translated into Turkish and validated in 1998 by The items in the scale describe the subjective, somatic and panic symptoms of anxiety. All item scores are summed as "0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe" for each item. The scale is evaluated over a total of 63 points, and a high score indicates a high level of anxiety., the first measure will be made before chemotherapy. The second, third,forth and fifth measurement will be madeone week after the first second, third and forth chemotherapy. respectively
Type of Research:

The research was randomized controlled, analytically planned.

Research Hypotheses:

H0-1: The interactive nurse support program developed with the mobile application in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process has no effect on the quality of life of the patients.

H0-2: The interactive nurse support program developed with the mobile application in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process has no effect on the social support perceived by the patients.

H0-3: The interactive nurse support program developed with the mobile application in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process has no effect on the anxiety levels of the patients.

H0-4: The interactive nurse support program developed with a mobile application has no effect on symptom management in colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process.

Population and Sample of the Research:

The population of the research will be the colorectal cancer patients followed in the Ankara City Hospital Medical Oncology Department Outpatient Clinics.

Calculating Sample Size When previous similar studies on sample size were examined, no similar research could be found in terms of sample characteristics and measurement tools. For this reason, after reaching 10 people in the intervention and control groups, the minimum number of people to be included in the sample will be calculated by performing a power analysis from the research results.

In order to determine the sample size, a similar study (Zhu et al. 2018) was examined, but it was seen that the measurement tools were different. For this reason, after reaching 10 people in the research and control group, power analysis will be made with the G. Power program and the minimum number of people to be sampled will be calculated. It is aimed to increase the number of samples in order to increase the power of the research by guaranteeing the minimum number of people that will constitute the sample size.

Randomization Method:

Among the patients who applied to Ankara City Hospital Medical Oncology Department Outpatient Clinics with the diagnosis of colorectal cancer to receive chemotherapy treatment, patients who meet the criteria for inclusion in the study will be determined. In order to prevent possible interaction between patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the study, data wiil be collected from the control group first, according to the order of admission to the hospital, and after the target number is reached, data will be collected from the patients in the intervention group.
