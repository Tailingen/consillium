Texture and Colour Enhancement Imaging in Improving Detection and Miss Rate of Premalignant Lesions
Texture and Color Enhancement Imaging (TXI) is a newly developed image-enhancing endoscopy technology that has show potential in improving detection of colorectal lesions. This multicenter, randomized, tandem trial is aimed at evaluating whether TXI is superior to WLI endoscopy in terms of diagnosis of premalignant lesions.
Adenoma|Sessile Serrated Adenoma
PROCEDURE: TXI (Group A)|PROCEDURE: TXI followed by WLI (Group B)|PROCEDURE: WLI (Group C)|PROCEDURE: WLI followed by TXI (Group D)
adenoma detection rate, the number of patients with one or more adenomas detected and removed divided by the total number of patient, 1 years|sessile serrated lesion detection rate, the number of patients with one or more sessile serrated lesions detected and removed divided by the total number of patients, 1 years
adenoma miss rate, the number of adenomas detected during the second examination divided by the total number of adenomas detected during the first and second colonoscopy, 1 years|sessile serrated lesion miss rate, the number of sessile serrated lesions detected during the second examination divided by the total number of sessile serrated lesions detected during the first and second colonoscopy, 1 years
