Phase I Pilot Study to Evaluate the Prognostic Value of Perfusion CT for Primary Cervical Cancer
The investigators hope to learn whether perfusion CT is a useful way to assess primary cervical tumor microenvironment and whether there is a relationship between pretreatment perfusion CT measurements and primary cervical tumor size, lymph node involvement (as assessed by standard of care pretreatment fludeoxyglucose Positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT)), and treatment response (as assessed by standard of care 3-month post-therapy FDG-PET/CT).
Cervical Cancer
Measure perfusion in primary cervical tumors using perfusion CT., Treatment response will be assessed using a post-treatment FDG-PET/CT to evaluate for complete response, persistent disease or new disease. The association between pre-treatment perfusion CT parameters and response on the post-treatment FDG-PET/CT will be analyzed., 3-6 months
