First Line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.
Based on conventional chemotherapy approach, data have indicated that the Folfirinox regimen is more effective and tolerate than the treatment by Gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A recent study combining gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel improve the objective response rate.

Primary objective of this study is to identify the maximun tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of first line treatment combining gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel followed by folfirinox in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: GEMBRAX|DRUG: FOLFIRINOX
Determination of the MTD, Phase I: Identify the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of first line treatment combining gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel followed by folfirinox in metatstatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Phase II: Objective response rate of patients treated with this new combination, 18 months
Overall survival, evaluate the safety profile, 12 months
Estimated enrollment:

Phase I: 60 Phase II: 53

Study start Date: August 2013 Estimated study completion date: March 2016

Treatment:

Gembrax: albumin-bound paclitaxel over 30 minutes IV followed by Gemcitabine 10mg/mÂ²/min IV on day 1, 8 and 15 followed by 2 weeks of rest Folfirinox: Oxaliplatin IV associated with LeucovorinIV. After the end of leucovorin administration, bolus injection of 5FU and subsequent continuous 5FU 46-hour infusion at day 29 and 43.
