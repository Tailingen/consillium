Tislelizumab as Cross-line Treatment for Advanced NSCLC
This study is a single-arm, prospective, open phase II clinical study, exploring the efficacy and safety for advanced non-small cell lung cancer after progression of first-line Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy and continuing Tislelizumab in combination with docetaxel. The primary study endpoint of this study is measured by progression-free survival (PFS).

1. Tislelizumab: The recommended dose is 200 mg/dose administered every three weeks on the first day of each cycle.
2. Docetaxel: 60-75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, administered on day 1 of each cycle.
3. Treatment cycle: Tislelizumab in combination with docetaxel until the development of PD, unacceptable toxicities, withdrawal of informed consent, end of study, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.
