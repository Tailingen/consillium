Personalized Vaccine for Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma
A single-arm, single-center, open-labeled study will be conducted with an aim to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the personalized vaccine for patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
Malignant Glioma|Recurrent Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: personalized vaccine
incidences of advent events and severe advent events, would be monitored and measured according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.X.), from initiation of study treatment to 28 weeks post-vaccination
object response rate (ORR) according to iRANO criteria, ORR including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) would be assessed and measured based on the conditions proposed by iRANO criteria, from initiation of study treatment to 24 weeks post-vaccination (last shot)|progression free survival (PFS), time interval (measured in weeks) between initiation of study treatment to progression of disease, up to 48 weeks post-vaccination(last shot)|overall survival (OS), time interval (measured in weeks) from initiation of study treatment to the death of patients, up to 48 weeks post-vaccination(last shot)|immune response based on the criteria encoded by GRT-C903 and GRT-R904, humoral and cellular immune responses including generation of specific antibodies, inflammatory factors, immune cells, will be measured as proposed by GRT-C903 and GRT-R904, Baseline to end of treatment (up to approximately 12 months)
A single-arm, single-center, open-labeled study will be conducted with an aim to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the personalized vaccine for patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
