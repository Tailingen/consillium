β-adrenergic Blocker and a COX2 Inhibitor for Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Recurrence
Colon and rectal cancer is the second most prevalent malignant disease in the western world, causing significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare sources use. Treating colon and rectal cancer with curative intent generally includes resection of the primary tumor. Despite its crucial role, surgery by itself induce physiological changes resulting in significant immune depression and other physiological perturbations, which may in turn play a significant role in the initiation of new metastases and the progression of pre-existing dormant metastases. The aim of this study is to assess the use of perioperative medical intervention using a combination of a β-adrenergic blocker (Propranolol) and a COX2 inhibitor (Etodolac), in order to attenuate the surgically induced immunosuppression and other physiological perturbations, aiming to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence and distant metastatic disease.
