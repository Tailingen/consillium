Development and Validation of a PSN-AI Prediction Model
Heterogeneity concerning survival in synchronous peritoneal metastasis from patients with colorectal cancer exists, thereby further classification is urgently required. This study aimed to validate a PSN-AI model based on DNA ploidy, stroma-tumor fraction, and nucleotyping (PSN) for the prediction of survival of synchronous peritoneal metastasis from colorectal cancer.
