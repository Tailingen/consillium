A clinical trial to evaluate TQB2858 injection combined with Anlotinib Hydrochloride capsule in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic advanced endometrial carcinoma
Endometrial Carcinoma
DRUG: TQB2858 injection|DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride capsules
Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumors shrank by a certain amount and remained for a certain period of time, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) cases, Baseline up to two years
Progress Free Survival (PFS), The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Baseline up to two years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period, including complete remission（CR）, partial remission（PR） and stable disease（SD）;, Baseline up to two years|Duration of Response (DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) ., Baseline up to two years|Overall Survival (OS), The period from the first use of the drug to death from all causes. For subjects who are still alive at the last follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last follow-up. For subjects who are lost follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last confirmed survival time before being lost to follow-up., Baseline up to two years|Incidence of adverse events: Occurrence of all adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs), AEs refer to all adverse medical events that occur after a patient or clinical trial subject receives an experimental drug, which can be expressed as symptoms, signs, diseases, or abnormalities in laboratory tests, but are not necessarily related to the treatment of the experimental drug.
