Diagnostic Comparison of PET-magnetic Resonance and PET-CT in Patients With Oncologic Diseases
Diagnostic accuracy of PET/magnetic resonance and PET/CT will be compared concerning primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM) staging and therapeutic influence. Workflow scenarios will be evaluated to create imaging protocols which are time efficient and diagnostically accurate.
Neoplasm Staging
Number of patients with correct TNM staging defined with PET/magnetic resonance versus PET/CT, 12 month
Number of minutes needed per PET/magnetic resonance protocol compared to PET/CT, 12 month
