Oxycodone in Combination With Parathoracic Nerve Block is Used for Postoperative Analgesia in Lung Cancer
In this study, the effect of oxycodone combined with ultrasound-guided paravertebral nerve block on the postoperative analgesic effect of thoracoscopic lung cancer was investigated, and the effect and reasonable dose of oxycodone were explored, which provided a reference for the clinical multimodal analgesia after thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.
Oxycodone
DRUG: Oxycodone 1mg/kg|DRUG: Oxycodone 1.5mg/kg|DRUG: Sufentanil
The main indicators were NRS scores at rest and cough at 24 h postoperatively., NRS (numerical rating scale) is composed of 11 numbers from 0 to 10, and patients use 11 numbers from 0 to 10 to describe the intensity of pain, and the higher the number, the more severe the pain., at 24h after surgery
Time to double-lumen tracheal extraction, Time to double-lumen tracheal extraction, Within two hours after surgery|NRS score at rest and cough, NRS (numerical rating scale) is composed of 11 numbers from 0 to 10, and patients use 11 numbers from 0 to 10 to describe the intensity of pain, and the higher the number, the more severe the pain., at 2h , 4h, 12h, 48h after surgery|sedation score (Ramsay sedation score), The Ramsay sedation score is the most widely used sedation scoring criterion in clinical practice. It is divided into six levels, reflecting three levels of wakefulness and three levels of sleep. The higher the level, the deeper the level of sedation., at 2 h , 4 h , 12 h ,24 h,48 h postoperatively|sufentanil consumption, sufentanil consumption, Within 48 hours after surgery|oxycodone consumption, oxycodone consumption, Within 48 hours after surgery|analgesic pump compressions, analgesic pump compressions, Within 48 hours after surgery|additional analgesic doses, additional analgesic doses, Within 48 hours after surgery|incidence of adverse reactions: nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, dizziness, itchin, incidence of adverse reactions: nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, dizziness, itchin, Within 48 hours after surgery|gastrointestinal recovery (exhaust time), gastrointestinal recovery (exhaust time), Within 48 hours after surgery|laboratory results of C-reactive protein 1 day before and after surgery, laboratory results of C-reactive protein 1 day before and after surgery, Within 48 hours after surgery|laboratory results of interleukin-6 laboratory test 1 day before and after surgery, laboratory results of interleukin-6 laboratory test 1 day before and after surgery, Within 48 hours after surgery
