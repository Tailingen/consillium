A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Tarceva in Patients With First Relapse of Grade IV Glioma (Glioblastoma Multiforme)
This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter trial of single-agent treatment with Tarceva in patients with histologically confirmed GBM in first relapse. This study seeks to estimate the objective response rate and will investigate whether response rate is related to EGFR amplification status.
