S0910 Epratuzumab, Cytarabine, and Clofarabine in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as epratuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and clofarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving epratuzumab together with cytarabine and clofarabine may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving epratuzumab together with cytarabine and clofarabine works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: epratuzumab|DRUG: clofarabine|DRUG: cytarabine|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Complete Remission, Complete remission (CR) is defined as: \<5% marrow aspirate blasts. Blasts can be \>=5% if the blasts are found to be myeloid and there is no evidence of lymphoblasts by flow cytometry or immunostaining. Neutrophils \>= 1000/mcl; platelets \>100,000/mcl; and no blasts in the peripheral blood. C1 Extramedullary disease status as defined in the protocol. Complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRi) is same as CR but platelet count may be \<=100,000/mcl and/or ANC may be \<1,000/mcl., After induction therapy was completed (1 or 2 months)
Number of Patients With Grade 3 Through 5 Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Only adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug are reported. Any CTCAE 4.0 event of Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life threatening), or Grade 5 (fatal) which were deemed to be related to protocol treatment are included., Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To test whether the complete remission (CR) rate (CR and incomplete CR) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is sufficiently high after treatment with cytarabine, clofarabine, and epratuzumab to warrant further investigation.
* To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with the dosing schedule of cytarabine, clofarabine, and epratuzumab used in this study.
* To investigate, preliminarily, the effect of laboratory correlates (minimal post-treatment residual disease) and cytogenetic factors on prognosis in this patient population. (Not reported here due to limited MRD data)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, clofarabine IV over 1 hour on days 2-6, and epratuzumab IV over at least 1 hour on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity\*.

NOTE: \* Prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate is required for patients \< 22 years of age, and is recommended (but not required) for patients â‰¥ 22 years of age.

Blood samples, bone marrow samples, and/or tumor tissue samples may be collected for further laboratory analysis.

Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years (until 5 years after registration).
