Trough Serum Concentration (Ctrough) of Pertuzumab During Cycle 7 (Pre-Dose Cycle 8), The observed pertuzumab trough serum concentration (Ctrough) at Cycle 7 was assessed following 3 cycles of pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV or the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab SC. The Per Protocol Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis population includes all enrolled participants who adhered to the protocol. Exclusions from the Per Protocol PK analysis population were made for the following reasons: participants were missing the Ctrough pre-dose Cycle 8 PK sample, participants with a Ctrough sample collected with at least 2 days deviation from the planned date on Day 21 (i.e., before Day 19 or after Day 23), participants given a dose amount that deviated from the planned dose by \>20% within 3 cycles (from Cycle 5), participants with a dose delay of more than 7 days, a subcutaneous injection site other than thigh was used, if the Cycle 8 pre-dose and post-dose samples were switched, and an assay error impacting Ctrough measurement., Pre-dose on Cycle 8, Day 1 (up to 21 weeks)
Ctrough of Trastuzumab During Cycle 7 (Pre-Dose Cycle 8), The observed trastuzumab trough serum concentration (Ctrough) at Cycle 7 was assessed following 3 cycles of pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV or the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab SC. The Per Protocol Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis population includes all enrolled participants who adhered to the protocol. Exclusions from the Per Protocol PK analysis population were made for the following reasons: participants were missing the Ctrough pre-dose Cycle 8 PK sample, participants with a Ctrough sample collected with at least 2 days deviation from the planned date on Day 21 (i.e., before Day 19 or after Day 23), participants given a dose amount that deviated from the planned dose by \>20% within 3 cycles (from Cycle 5), participants with a dose delay of more than 7 days, a subcutaneous injection site other than thigh was used, if the Cycle 8 pre-dose and post-dose samples were switched, and an assay error impacting Ctrough measurement., Pre-dose on Cycle 8, Day 1 (up to 21 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Total Pathological Complete Response (tpCR), According to Local Pathologist Assessment, Total pCR (tpCR) was defined as eradication of invasive disease in the breast and axilla; that is, ypT0/is ypN0, according to the local pathologists' assessment. Pathologic response to therapy was determined at the time of surgery. The tpCR rate is the percentage of participants in the ITT population who achieved a tpCR. Participants with missing data for tpCR (i.e., do not undergo surgery or have an invalid pCR assessment) were included in the analysis and classified as non-responders. Rates of tpCR were calculated in each treatment arm and were assessed using the difference between the Arm B: Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab FDC SC and the Arm A: Pertuzumab IV and Trastuzumab IV tpCR rates and corresponding 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs). The difference between the tpCR rates along with corresponding 95% Hauck-Anderson CIs were calculated. The lower bound of the CI will reliably reflect the largest tpCR difference that can be considered unlikely., Following completion of surgery (up to 33 weeks)|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of the Percentage of Participants Who Are Event-Free According to Invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS; Excluding Second Primary Non-Breast Cancer [SPNBC]) Criteria, iDFS (excluding SPNBC) is defined as the time from the first date of no disease (i.e., the date of primary surgery) to the first occurrence of one of the following events: ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence; ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer reccurrence; distant recurrence; contralateral invasive breast cancer; or death attributable to any cause.

Any AEs that were not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 were graded per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to AE. The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade., From first dose of study treatment until 28 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 1 year, 6 months)|Number of Participants With a Primary Cardiac Event During the Neoadjuvant Phase, A primary cardiac event is defined as the occurrence of either of the following events: - Incidence of a symptomatic ejection fraction decrease (heart failure) of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV and a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 10-percentage points from baseline and to below 50%; or - Cardiac death, defined as: Definite cardiac death (due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, or documented primary arrhythmia); or, Probable cardiac death (sudden unexpected death within 24 hours of a definite or probable cardiac event \[e.g., syncope, cardiac arrest, chest pain, infarction, arrhythmia\] without documented etiology)., From first dose of study treatment until the completion of neoadjuvant therapy (24 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Secondary Cardiac Event During the Neoadjuvant Phase, A secondary cardiac event is defined as asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD) of NYHA Class II, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease of at least 10-percentage points below the baseline measurement to an absolute LVEF value of \<50% confirmed by a second assessment within approximately 3 weeks., From first dose of study treatment until the completion of neoadjuvant therapy (24 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Primary Cardiac Event During the Adjuvant Phase, A primary cardiac event is defined as the occurrence of either of the following events: - Incidence of a symptomatic ejection fraction decrease (heart failure) of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV and a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 10-percentage points from baseline and to below 50%; or - Cardiac death, defined as: Definite cardiac death (due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, or documented primary arrhythmia); or, Probable cardiac death (sudden unexpected death within 24 hours of a definite or probable cardiac event \[e.g., syncope, cardiac arrest, chest pain, infarction, arrhythmia\] without documented etiology)., From surgery until 28 days after the last dose of adjuvant treatment (42 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Secondary Cardiac Event During the Adjuvant Phase, A secondary cardiac event is defined as asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD) of NYHA Class II, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease of at least 10-percentage points below the baseline measurement to an absolute LVEF value of \<50% confirmed by a second assessment within approximately 3 weeks., From surgery until 28 days after the last dose of adjuvant treatment (42 weeks)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities at the Highest NCI CTCAE v4 Grade Post-Baseline Over the Course of the Entire Study, Clinical laboratory tests were performed at local laboratories; any abnormal values (High or Low) were based on local laboratory normal ranges. Laboratory abnormalities are presented by the highest (worst) severity grade (according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0) post-baseline. Not every abnormal laboratory value qualified as an adverse event, only if it met any of the following criteria: clinically significant (per investigator); accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment; or required a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy. For a participant with multiple post-baseline abnormalities, only the highest (worst) grade for a given laboratory test is reported. 'Any Grade' indicates the total number of participants with a post-baseline abnormality of any grade for the specified test., From first dose of study treatment until 28 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 1 year, 6 months)
