Anti-CD19 CAR T Cells in Pediatric Patients Affected by Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ ALL and NHL
The primary objective of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and to establish the recommended dose of CD19-CART01 infused in pediatric patients affected by relapsed/refractory B-ALL or NHL with measurable Bone Marrow (BM) involvement. The phase II extension is aimed at testing the efficacy of the treatment at the optimal dose defined in the phase I.
CD19-ALL|CD19-LNH
BIOLOGICAL: CD19-CAR T cell
Phase I - Identification of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale, version 4 and the number of patients experiencing DLT will be evaluated, 4 weeks after CAR T cell infusion|Phase II - Efficacy, Complete remission rate minimal residual disease (MRD) negative response, 4 weeks after CAR T cell infusion
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Assessment of CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD)., 4 weeks after CAR T cell infusion|In vivo persistence/expansion of infused CAR T cell, Detection of infused CAR T cell in the peripheral and bone marrow blood, Up to 5 years|Function of infused CAR T cell, Assessment through functional assays (such as ELISPOT for interferon-gamma release using CD19-positive cells and CD19-negative target cells) and immunophenotyping on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from the patients, Up to 5 years|Cytokine profiling, Define serum cytokine profile after T cell infusion and correlation with cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 10 days after CAR T cell infusion|Disease Outcome, Assessment of relapse rate, Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Up to 3 years|Disease-free survival, Up to 3 years|Elimination of CAR T cell in case of toxicity, Assessment the kinetics of CAR T cells elimination after AP1903 infusion, Up to 15 years
The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or expansion phase. Paediatric/young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL will be enrolled. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture. Autologous CAR T product directed against CD19-expressing tumor cells (CD19-CART01) will be produced and, after a lymphodepletion with conventional chemoterapic agents, the patient will receive CD19-CART01 intravenously. The construct contains also the suicide gene safety switch "inducible Caspase 9"; therefore, in case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to induce the apoptosis of the cells.

After the treatment, the patients will then enter a 36-month follow-up period.
