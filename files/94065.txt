Endoscopic-assisted Microsurgical Removal of Cerebellopontine Angle Lesions
It is a Prospective descriptive hospital based clinical study to determine the value of introduction of endoscope after microscopic excision of cerebello-pontine angle lesions to estimate the following :

1. Intraoperative judgement of lesions excision, residual parts, visualization and operative corridor pre and after endoscope introduction.
2. Post-operative tumor control confirmed comparison between pre and postoperative MRI.
3. Postoperative complications, advantages and disadvantages compared with these when use pure microscopic excision from the literature
Cerebellopontine Angle Tumor
DEVICE: endoscope
post operative residual tumor, post operative MRI will be done and will be compared with the preoperative one to determine if complete excision was done or if there is residual parts, 1 week
