Nivolumab and Eribulin in HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
Cancer therapeutics such as chemotherapy may modulate tumor/immune-system interactions in favor of the immune system. Chemotherapy can result in tumor cell death with a resultant increase in tumor antigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, combining immunotherapy (Nivolumab) with chemotherapy (Eribulin) is a promising anti-cancer strategy.
