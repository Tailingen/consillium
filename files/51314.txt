Trial of Anti-PSMA Designer T Cells in Advanced Prostate Cancer After Non-Myeloablative Conditioning
This study tests the safety and tolerability of autologous anti-PSMA gene-modified T cells (designer T cells) in hormone refractory prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Gene Modified T Cells
Determine the safety of using modified T cells by documenting the type and severity of any side effects and establishing the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), 1 Month
Tumor Response, 1 Month|Pharmacokinetics, 1 Month|Pharmacodynamics, 1 Month
The study creates autologous gene-modified T cells against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA, unrelated to PSA) (designer T cells) by ex vivo modification of patient T cells. T cells are collected by leukopheresis, transported to the RWMC cGMP Cell Manipulation Core and transduced with retrovirus containing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is expressed on the modified cells. This CAR links specificity of an antibody against PSMA with signaling domains of the T cell and redirects the recognition of the T cells to engage and kill prostate cancer cells anywhere in the body. These are administered at a dose of 10\^10 with randomization to either low or moderate Interleukin 2 given by CI (continuous infusion) for one month following the T cell infusion. Subsequent subjects will receive 10\^11 cells with Interleukin 2 at either low or moderate dose, in a non randomized manner, depending upon the outcome of the prior cohort. Prior to T cell infusion, all subjects will receive non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning. This conditioning creates a "space" in the blood and marrow for engraftment of the infused cells to maintain of high level of anti-tumor effector T cells in the body. Each patient is treated with a single dose of T cells, without repeat dosing. Patients are followed for toxicity and response and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of the infused T cells. Patients are on-study for one-month after their T cell dose.
