Influence of Laminoplasty and Internal Fixation on Vertebral Stability After Laminectomy
The lesion located inside the spinal canal caused big trouble for clinical treatment. Traditional laminectomy will destroy the biomechanics and influent the vertebral stability, which might cause kyphosis or other deformity. So in some centers, neurosurgeries praised laminoplasty to make the intactness of posterior column. They thought the laminoplasty can maintain the vertebral stability, and meanwhile the range of motion won't change so much. However, some other scholars thought laminoplasty had no helps for stability because of the pseudarthrosis. They preferred screw and stick system for internal fixation. And we did meet several patients after laminectomy suffered with spinal deformity. So we thought it is necessary for investigating the benefit of patients from laminoplasty and internal fixation.
Disorders Following Clinical Procedure
PROCEDURE: Surgical performance
Vertebral deformity, 3 years
The influence of age on the vertebral deformity, 3 years
After laminectomy for removal of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar lesions, the recruited cases were randomly divided into two groups.

1. The cases in group of laminoplasty, the lamina and spinous process was replanted to maintain the anatomical intactness of spinal canal.
2. On the other hand, the cases in internal fixation group, the pedicle screws were implanted, and tickets were used to complete the internal fixation.

During 3 years follow up, the vertebral deformity and the range of motion were investigated and evaluated. And in the meantime, the patient's age will also be analyzed to detect it's influence for the prognosis.
