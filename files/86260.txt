Enumeration and Molecular Characterization of Circulating Tumour Cells in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
Women with metastatic breast cancer, receiving first line treatment of any kind (chemotherapy, endocrine treatment or treatment with antibodies) will be included in this trial. In connection to treatment, blood samples for determination and enumeration of circulating tumour cells will be collected at different time points. Serum and plasma will be collected and stored for future analysis of RNA and DNA.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
To determine whether numbers of circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood can give information of prognosis, and to evaluate if the numbers of circulating tumour cells can give information of the efficacy of given treatment, Blood samples will be taken before start of treatment, at month 1, month 3, month 4 and month 6.
