Endoscopic Resection of Papillary Adenomas; a Novel Treatment Algorithm to Prevent Recurrence - a Pilot-study (ERASE-pilot)
Recurrence after endoscopic papillectomy is described in up to 33% of the cases (range 12-33%). This leads to re-interventions, a cumulative risk of adverse events, and the need for long-term follow-up. Recurrences most likely originate from either the biliary orifice or lateral resection margins. Ablative methods such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and thermal ablation by cystotome inside the bile duct have been described to treat intraductal extension of which the use of a cystotome seems to have a more favorable safety profile. However, no studies focusing on the preventive use of these ablative methods in patient with papillary adenomas have been performed. It is hypothesized that the curative resection rate can be increased and recurrence prevented by using a combination of snare tip soft coagulation (STSC) of the resection margins and thermal ablation by cystotome of the biliary orifice in patients with and without the suggestion of intraductal extension.

Therefore, aim of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of endoscopic papillectomy combined with thermal ablation of the biliary orifice by cystotome and STSC of the lateral resection margins.
