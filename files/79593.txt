Cisplatin/Etoposide and Concurrent Radiotherapy With or Without Celecoxib in Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Concurrent chemoradiation (ChRT) is a standard care for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with good performance status, and cisplatin/etoposide (EP) regimen is one of the most commonly used regimens. However, the prognosis of these patients is still rather poor. It has been demonstrated that Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Selective (COX)-2 inhibitors can promote chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of tumor cells in preclinical trials.

This is a single-institution, open-label, randomized phase II trial of celecoxib administered concurrently with cisplatin, etoposide, and radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, to determine the feasibility, activity, and toxicity of this combination on unresectable NSCLC, and further to examine biomarkers to predict response to the treatment.

Celecoxib is a non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) Recent studies have shown that celecoxib has antitumor activity, and may increase the tumor sensitivity to radiation. Furthermore, evidence has shown the safety and efficiency of celecoxib in some phase I/II studies. The purposes of this study are to examine the effects of a new combination of celecoxib (CelebrexÂ®) and cisplatin/etoposide (EP regimen), with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy on unresectable stage III NSCLC patients; and to examine biomarkers to predict response to the treatment. Because of poor survival of patients with unresected locally advanced NSCLC, the efficiency of celecoxib plus concurrent EP chemoradiotherapy need to be further investigated.
