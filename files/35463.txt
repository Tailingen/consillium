Diagnostic Study of Early Breast Cancer Using Ultrasound
This is a pilot study designed to investigate new techniques to guide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of Ductal Carcinoma In-situ (DCIS). The microvascularity and stiffness of the lesion may be prognostic factors that can guide the need for more or less extensive therapy or perhaps only imaging follow-up may be needed.
Ductal Carcinoma In-situ
DRUG: Perflutren lipid microsphere
Evidence of the presence of angiogenic tumour vasculature in patients diagnosed with DCIS utilizing contrast enhanced ultrasound., The participant will be followed up till the results of the biopsy, an expected average of 3 months.
Measurement of transient shear wave elastography ., The quantitative intralesional measurement of shear wave modulus will be compared to the angiogenesis imaging and biomarkers., The participant will be followed up till the results of the biopsy, an expected average of 3 months.
Women who have imaging findings suggestive of DCIS, who are having breast ultrasound and who are candidates for surgery will be eligible. They will receive a contrast-enhanced breast ultrasound after the intravenous injection of a microbubble contrast agent which will show the microvascularity. A subset of women will also have ultrasound elastography performed of the abnormality to evaluate its stiffness.
