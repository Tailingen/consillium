A Single-arm, Prospective Study of TBI + BUMEL As a Conditioning Regimen for Salvage HSCT in Patients with R/R AML
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the hematologic malignancies, for which patients typically undergo chemotherapy to achieve complete remission. However, approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to initial treatment, and many experience relapse after achieving remission. For patients with relapsed or refractory AML, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a potentially curative option. Sibling-matched HSCT has demonstrated a disease-free survival rate of 20-30%, while unrelated donor transplants yield an overall survival rate of approximately 22%. Haploidentical transplantation is a viable alternative for patients lacking a sibling donor. A 2019 study involving 1,693 patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML revealed that haploidentical transplants yielded outcomes comparable to other transplant modalities, including HLA-matched and 9/10 matched unrelated donor transplants, thus supporting haploidentical transplantation as a viable therapeutic option.

The conditioning regimen is a critical component of the transplantation. In China, the modified BU/CY conditioning regimen, which combines busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CTX), is widely utilized for tumor cytoreduction and immunosuppression. Some centers also employ post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) to mitigate the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Despite advances, relapse remains a significant challenge. Optimizing conditioning regimens to enhance tumor cell targeting and achieve deeper remission is crucial. Additionally, many patients are unfit due to prior chemotherapy, infections, and organ dysfunction, which may make them unable to tolerate high-intensity conditioning.

Recent studies suggest that melphalan (MEL)-based conditioning regimens may offer advantages over CTX-based protocols. While total body irradiation (TBI) has been traditionally used in conditioning for HSCT, it is associated with considerable organ toxicity.

A low-dose TBI regimen combined with BU+MEL represents a promising conditioning regimen for R/R AML. In preliminary studies, 7 patients treated with this regimen successfully achieved hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. Building on these results, a clinical study is planned to evaluate further the safety and efficacy of the TBI+BUMEL (IBM) conditioning regimen in relapsed/refractory AML, with a focus on improving engraftment rates, reducing relapse rates, minimizing GVHD incidence, and enhancing overall survival outcomes.
Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
PROCEDURE: Salvage Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment, Neutrophil and platelet engraftment is defined as the first occurrence of 3 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count of at least 0.5×109/L and a platelet count of over 20×109/L for 7 consecutive days without transfusion support., on day 28±7 following HSCT|The time to reconstitution of hematopoiesis, recovery of hemopoietic function after treatment, on day 28±7 following HSCT|The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM), Transplant-related mortality was defined as mortality due to any cause other than disease progression within 100 days of transplantation., within 100 days following HSCT
The cumulative incidence and grade of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a medical complication following the receipt of transplanted tissue from a genetically different person., within 1 year following HSCT|The cumulative incidence of relapse, We defined relapse as any clinical evidence of progression or recurrence of original diseases., within 1 year following HSCT|Overall survival rate, We estimated OS from the time of transplant until the date of death of any cause or last follow-up for patients still alive., within 1 year following HSCT|The cumulative incidence of adverse events, Following extraction of the tumor, a blood vessel burst causing increased blood loss during the procedure, an adverse event the surgeon did not expect., within 1 year following HSCT
The aim of this study is to observe the efficacy-related factors and adverse events of the TBI combined with BUMEL regimen as conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia .
