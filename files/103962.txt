Epidural Analgesia Use in Pancreatic Resections
The rationale for this study is to investigate the benefits of epidural analgesia in pancreatic resections in a prospective, single blind, randomized control trial. This study will evaluate both short and long-term outcomes related to epidural analgesia, providing a longitudinal and comprehensive perspective to the advantages and disadvantages of this technique. The investigators hypothesize that the use of epidural analgesia reduces a patient's consumption of morphine or morphine-equivalent in the post-operative period following pancreatic resections.

Total consumption of morphine or morphine-equivalent in patients undergoing pancreatic resections in the control group compared with the study group, -Will be assessed every 24 hours, First 72 hours after surgery
Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by total intraoperative fluid volume, During surgery|Benefit of epidural analgesia as measured by the reduction of persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) after the operation, -Quantitative sensory testing will be performed on the abdomen in close proximity to the surgical incision, Up to 6 weeks post-surgery|Benefit of epidural analgesia as measured by time to tumor recurrence, Up to 2 years post surgery|Benefit of epidural analgesia as measured by disease-free survival, Up to 2 years post surgery|Benefit of epidural analgesia as measured by overall survival, Up to 2 years post surgery|Rate of delirium in the control group compared with the study group, * Assessed for delirium using the 3D-CAM instrument
* Postoperative delirium assessments will be performed when patients can be around sufficiently in order to be assessed for delirium using the Richmond-Agitation-Sedation Scale.
* Will be assessed for delirium once daily in the afternoon/evening, First 72 hours after surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by total post-operative fluid volume, Up to 72 hours post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by volume of fluid boluses, Up to 72 hours post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by amount of antiemetic doses, Up to 72 hours post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by return of bowel function by time to first flatus, Up to 72 hours post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by first bowel movement, Up to 72 hours post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by length of hospital stay, Up to 2 weeks post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by incidence of deep venous thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism, Up to 72 hours post surgery|Effect of epidural analgesia during the initial post-operative period as measured by relative ratios of blood level inflammatory markers, -Specifically interleukin-1-beta (IL-1B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) biomarkers, Up to 6 weeks post-surgery
