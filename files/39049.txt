Study of IV CBL0137 in Previously Treated Hematological Subjects
This clinical trial is a Phase 1, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort-expansion study (Part 2) evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of intravenously (IV) administered CBL0137 in participants with previously treated hematological malignancies.
Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: CBL0137
Part 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Dose (RD), MTD is defined as dose level at which ≥6 subjects have been treated and which is associated with a first-cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in ≤17% of the participants. RD may be the MTD or may be a lower dose within the tolerable dose range. Selection of the RD will be based on consideration of short- and long-term safety information together with available pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy data., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Part 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or partial response (PR) for those with DLBCL, FL, MCL, HL, or CLL/SLL; the proportion of subjects who achieve a CR, CRi, or unconfirmed CR (CRu) for those with ALL; the portion of subjects who achieve a CR or CRi for those with AML; and the proportion of subjects who achieve a stringent CR (sCR), CR, very good PR (VGPR), or PR for those with MM. An ORR of ≥20% is considered the minimum value of potential interest in each of the selected indications., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety and pharmacology of a range of CBL0137 doses administered IV in participants with previously treated lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), or multiple myeloma (MM). Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels of CBL0137 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. An additional 6 participants may be accrued at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or at the recommended dose (RD) to confirm CBL0137 safety and pharmacology as a prelude to further clinical evaluation.

Part 2 of the study provides cohort expansion to further explore the safety, pharmacology, and clinical activity of CBL0137 monotherapy in participants with specific previously treated hematological cancers, including DLBCL, FL, MCL, HL, CLL/SLL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and MM. Twelve evaluable participants with each disease type may be enrolled.
