Preoperative Radiotherapy for Sarcomas of the Extremities With Intensity-Modulation, Image-Guidance and Small Safety-margins
RATIONALE: Modern radiotherapy techniques in a neoadjuvant setting have the potential to minimize morbidity and maximize efficacy. An additional boost dose can be provided locally by HDR-brachytherapy in patients with positive margins after tumor resection.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the safety and efficacy of a combination of modern radiotherapy elements applied to the tumor and small volumes of surrounding normal tissue (IMRT, IGRT; brachytherapy in case of positive resection margin) and see how well it works in treating patients with High-Risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities.
