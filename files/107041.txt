Maintaining Bone Strength in Men With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if giving zoledronic acid three times a year is as effective as five times a year, in increasing bone strength in men with prostate cancer. All participants will receive the active drug but half will receive drug every 6 months and the other half will receive drug every 3 months. Both patient and doctor will know which treatment a patient is receiving.

After 1 year of treatment bone strength will be measured with scans and compared to the strength at the start of the study. All participants will stop receiving the drug after 1 year and will be seen back in the clinic, annually for another 2 years for follow-up.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Zoledronic acid
Change in bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine as assessed by dual energy x-ray absoptiometry (DEXA) scan
To compare the effect of zoledronic acid 4 mg every 12 weeks versus every 24 weeks on:|The percent change in BMD of the total hip following one year of therapy and the forearm following one year of therapy. This will be carried out at a limited number of centres.|Quality of life following one year of therapy.|Various biochemical markers of bone resorption (N-telopeptide, NTX, C-telopeptide, CTX, TRACP, PINP) and bone formation (bone alkaline phosphatase, BAP) during one year of therapy. This will be carried out at a limited number of centres.|Percentage of and rate of vertebral and hip fractures.|Safety and tolerability
