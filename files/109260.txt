VIO Imaging for Skin Tissue Assessment (VISTA)
To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the VIO device in obtaining in vivo images that show tissue features including epidermis, dermis, collagen, blood vessels, and/or pigment.

To demonstrate that the tissue features identified on the images obtained with the VIO device align with the corresponding pathology images procured from the skin biopsy.

To evaluate the ability of blinded readers to correctly identify tissue features on images obtained with the VIO device.

Comparative Reader Percentage Agreement, This outcome measured the % agreement and validation of specific tissue features on VIO images in comparison to gold standard pathology images between N=3 Comparative Readers (CRs). "CRs" were study investigators that were selected based on their experience and medical qualifications. 100% agreement and validation between the CRs was required to proceed to the next study phase., 8 months post-enrollment completion|Blinded Reader Percentage Agreement, This outcome measured the % agreement between N=3 Blinded Readers (BRs) of their assessment of VIO images in comparison to the answer key developed from the Comparative Reader validation. "BRs" were study investigators that were selected based on their experience and medical qualifications. \>90% agreement was required to proceed to the next study phase., 8 months post-enrollment completion|Safety / Adverse Events, Safety will be assessed as the incidence of all adverse events (analyzed by severity, seriousness, and relationship to the device and procedure) that occur through the 7-day follow-up period., 7 +/- 3 days after VIO imaging
Inter-Reader Percentage Agreement, This outcome measured the inter-reader % agreement between N=3 Blinded Readers (BRs) during image analysis. Minimum 90% agreement was required to proceed to the next study phase., 8 months post-enrollment completion|Evaluation of Secondary Histopathology Characteristics, This outcome measured the % agreement between N=3 Blinded Readers (BRs) of their assessment of secondary histopathology characteristics in VIO images in comparison to the answer key developed from the Comparative Reader validation. \>90% agreement was required to proceed to the next study phase., 8 months post-enrollment completion
