A Phase I Study of a DNA Vaccine Encoding Androgen Receptor Ligand-Binding Domain (AR LBD) +/-GMCSF
The purpose of this study is to determine if a vaccine called pTVG-AR can enhance the participant's immune response against prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: pTVG-AR|BIOLOGICAL: gm-csf
Number and severity of adverse events following serial intradermal vaccinations of a DNA vaccine encoding AR LBD, with or without GM-CSF as an adjuvant, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, From first immunization to Week 72|Immune Response Rate, From first immunization to Week 72
Median Progression-Free Survival, Median time to PSA progression will be determined as a function of the date the participant started on androgen deprivation and as a function of treatment start date (week 0). Development of new metastases or discontinuation of study to begin other therapy, while not expected to precede a PSA progression endpoint, would also constitute a progression endpoint., From first immunization to Week 72|18-Month Progression-Free Survival, 18 months|The proportion of patients with a T-cell immune response., Generation of AR LBD-specific peptide-specific CD8+ T cells as defined by ELISPOT and tetramer staining, From first immunization to Week 72|The number of patients that generate antigen specific tolerance, Antigen-specific tolerance generation following multiple immunizations, From first immunization to Week 72|Association between pre-existing immune responses to the AR LBD and development of subsequent effector and memory T-cell immune response, From first immunization to Week 72|Association between development of antigen-specific T cells and 18-month progression-free survival, From first immunization to Week 72
The purpose of this study is to determine if a vaccine called pTVG-AR can enhance the participant's immune response against prostate cancer.
