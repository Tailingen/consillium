Study of E7389 Administered Once Every 3 Weeks In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The malignancies (advanced solid tumors) that have been chosen for evaluation of E7389 are those where E7389 has demonstrated significant pre-clinical anti-tumor activity, both in vitro and in vivo. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the clinical activity of E7389 in the treatment of these, and potentially other, tumor types.
