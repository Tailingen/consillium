Feasibility of Utilising Brushing Cytology and Dermoscopy for Diagnosing Penile Lesions
In an attempt to reduce patient flow into the hospital we are going to assess the use of penile cytological brushings and dermoscopy in diagnosing cancer or non-cancer conditions of the penis.
Penile Cancer
DEVICE: Cytological Brushing
Does cytology results compare equally with standard histological biopsy for detecting cancer, Concordance of cytology vs Histopathology i.e. is the cytology assessment equal to histopathology results when detecting cancer, Through study completion, expected to be 12 months|Does the use of dermoscopy photography enable us to identify abnormal cellular changes that compare equally to the results obtained with standard histological biopsy., Concordance of dermoscopy vs Histopathology in detecting cancer i.e. does the use of dermoscopy photographs enable us to identify cancer and compare equally to results obtained by histopathology, Through study completion, expected to be 12 months
Patient satisfaction with cytological brushing diagnostic method being tested, All patients on study will be asked their views on the cytology brushing technique being used to gauge their satisfaction and experience of the new diagnostic method being tested, Through study completion, expected to be 12 months
Currently the standard of care pathway for all patients suspected of having penile cancer involves the need for a penile biopsy under local (LA) or general anaesthetic (GA). We hope to assess the feasibility of cytololgical brushings and the patient experience of the use of such a technique. Additionally, we will make initial comparison on the concordance between cytological brushing and dermoscope photo vs actual biopsy only.

Importantly for this study, all patients will be offered standard of care: a biopsy under LA or GA. The additional procedures of the cytological brushing and dermoscope photo will be done in an out-patient clinic setting (with no anaesthetic).

If it can be shown that the inclusion of the cytological brushing and dermoscope photo have comparative results over current standard of care histological biopsy, this will provide sufficient evidence to expand this study to acquire more data.
