A Phase I Study of Bavituximab, Capecitabine, and Radiation for the Treatment of Rectal Adenocarcinoma
This is a phase I study incorporating bavituximab into the care of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma simultaneously treated with capecitabine and radiation therapy. There is no reference therapy as we are trying to identify the MTD of bavituximab in this combination.

The investigational drug in this protocol is bavituximab, which will be delivered concurrently with the radiation therapy for 6 weeks (one time each week), followed by 2 weeks of bavituximab administration by itself. If the other therapies are terminated after week 4 the bavituximab treatment may be continued per protocol. A chemotherapy agent, capecitabine, will be delivered twice daily p.o. on the days of radiation treatment, at a dose of 825 mg/m2. Radiation therapy will be administered daily, Monday-Friday, for a total of 28 treatments, delivered at 1.8 Gy/fraction. Surgery will follow the last bavituximab administration by 4-8 weeks (6-10 weeks following completion of radiation therapy.
