Plasma Concentration of IMP7068, Day -7 to repeat dose Day 1; postdose at multiple time points from Day 1 to Day 21 in Cycle 1 (Cycle 1 = 21 days), Day 1 on Cycle 2 (Cycle 2 onwards = 21 day-cycles) and subsequent cycles (Up to 26 months)|Part 1 Dose Escalation: Objective response rate (ORR): percentage of patients who had a best response, Within the first year: every 6 weeks, thereafter every 12 weeks to end of treatment (EOT) visit (approximately 84 days), documented disease progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death or termination of the study (whichever occurs first)|Part 1 Dose Escalation: Progression-free survival (PFS): duration of time from date of first dose to date of disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first), Within the first year: every 6 weeks (±7 days); thereafter: every 12 weeks (±7 days); or when clinically indicated (Approximately 1 year )|Part 1 Dose Escalation: Overall survival (OS): time from date of first dose to death due to any cause, Every 12 weeks±14 days after the last dose, until up to 2 years, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or termination of the study, whichever occurs first|Part 1 Dose Escalation: Duration of response (DOR): duration of time a patient is evaluated as either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response until the first date that the criteria for progression are met, or death., Day 1 through 30 days after last dose, estimated to be 5 months|Part 1 Dose Escalation: Disease control rate (DCR): proportion of patients who had a best response rating of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD), which was maintained ≥6 weeks from Day 1 of Cycle 1, Day 1 through 30 days after last dose, estimated to be 5 months|Part 2 Dose Expansion: Progression-free survival (PFS) duration of time from date of first dose to date of disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first), Day 1 through 30 days after last dose, estimated to be 5 months|Part 2 Dose Expansion: Duration of response (DOR) duration of time a patient is evaluated as either CR or PR as best response until the first date that the criteria for progression are met, or death, Day 1 through 30 days after last dose, estimated to be 5 months|Part 2 Dose Expansion: Incidence of Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), Day 1 through 30 days after last dose, estimated to be 5 months|Part 2 Dose Expansion: Severity of Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) according to the NCI-CTCAE, version 5.0, Day 1 through 30 days after last dose, estimated to be 5 months
This is A Phase 1, Open-Label, Multi-Center, Dose Escalation and Expansion Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of the WEE1 Inhibitor IMP7068 Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors

The study will include a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage. The dose-escalation stage is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMP7068 monotherapy. The dose-expansion stage will be conducted with RP2D to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety and tolerability.

A total of approximately 140-350 patients will be enrolled in the study.

Approximately 60-100 patients will be enrolled into Part 1 dose escalation of IMP7068 monotherapy. A total of 100 patients each with advanced solid tumor will be evaluated in Part 2 dose-expansion of IMP7068 monotherapy.
