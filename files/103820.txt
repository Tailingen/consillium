Phase III Study of SY-5007, a RET Inhibitor, in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic RET Fusion-positive NSCLC
This is a phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of SY-5007 administered orally to participants with locally advanced or metastatic RET-positive NSCLC.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SY-5007
Assessment of ORR by independent review committee (IRC)., Defined as the number (%) of patients with measurable disease with response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by IRC according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every 8 weeks up to 1 year, then every 12 weeks thereafter; up to 3 years.
ORR as assessed by investigators., Defined as the number (%) of patients with measurable disease with response of CR or PR assessed by investigators according to RECIST version 1.1., Up to 3 years.|DCR as assessed by investigators and IRC., Defined as the number (%) of patients who have a best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1., Up to 3 years.|PFS as assessed by investigators and IRC., PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to progression of tumor as assessed by investigators or death from any cause on study., Up to 3 years.|Time to response (TTR) as assessed by investigators and IRC., TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first response of CR or PR., Up to 3 years.|DoR as assessed by investigators and IRC., DoR is defined as the time from first response until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years.|Overall survival (OS)., OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., Up to 3 years.|Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)., AEs are graded according to CTCAE v 5.0., From the screening period to 28 days after treatment completion, up to a maximum of approximately 3 years.
This study will enroll patients with locally advanced or metastatic RET-positive NSCLC. SY-5007 will be administered orally 160 mg twice daily in 28-day cycle continuously until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or protocol-specified parameters. This study is designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity (over response rate \[ORR\], disease control rate \[DCR\], duration of response \[DOR\], progression free survival \[PFS\] and overall survival \[OS\]) and safety of SY-5007 in patients.
