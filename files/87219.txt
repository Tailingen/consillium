Next Generation Personalized Neuroblastoma Therapy
The purpose of this research study is to match genomic aberrations in tumor cells at time of relapse to rationally designed combinations of molecularly targeted agents. This study will be done in two parts:

Part I: Tumor will be accessed at study entry via a biopsy and subjected to deep sequencing to identify protocol-specified biomarkers for therapy assignment.

Part II: If the tumor contains a genetic change defined by the study as being actionable, and other criteria are met, participants will be assigned to therapy based upon the genetic changes identified in the tumor biopsy.

Incidence of dose limiting toxicities when combining ceritinib with ribociclib, The primary variable is the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 28 days of therapy, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Area under the curve from time zero to last quantifiable concentration, Area under the plasma concentration time-curve from zero to the last measured concentration, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Percentage of patients with overall objective response, To describe whether the assigned targeted therapy can mediate anti-tumor effects in subjects with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma within the context of a phase 1/phase1b biomarker-driven trial. Percentage of patients with objective response will be according to the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria., 2 years
Cataloguing of genomic alterations identified from biopsies performed at time of relapse in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, Neuroblastomas undergo substantial mutational evolution during therapy, and relapsed disease is more likely to be driven by a targetable oncogenic pathway. Genomic alterations measured by next-generation sequencing at time of disease progression will be characterized and reported in a descriptive manner., 3 years
