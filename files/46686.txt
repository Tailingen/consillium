A Window of Opportunity Study for Investigating Drug Tolerant Persister (DTP) to Neoadjuvant Osimertinib in Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Harbouring EGFR Mutations
Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for the management of NSCLC(non-small cell lung cancer) harbouring EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) T790M mutation after acquired resistance to previous first-generation EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. Moreover, osimertinib was approved or the treatment of patients with EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) in the first-line setting based on the clinical trial.

The clinical activity and favorable toxicity profile of osimertinib has led to broadly research into this drug as a strategy to inhibit and prevent drug resistance in EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer). Evidences of benefit from EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) patients have been increasing in early stages as well as in advance stages. Therefore, adjuvant or neo adjuvant EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) TKI(Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in operable NSCLC(non small cell lung cancer) patients could improve survival in EGFR(Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutant NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) patients.

Acquired resistance by widespread clinical use has become a hot clinical problem.

A variety of target therapies are being developed to overcome tolerance to osimertinib to improve this outcome.

This is an approach that should improve the molecular and clinical understanding of the drug resistance. Specifically, we want to investigate innate drug resistance and tumor microenvironment to osimertinib by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). and single cell research is obviously needed to develop cancer therapeutic strategies.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib
Objective Response Rage (ORR), after 8 weeks of osimertinib prior to surgery are complete response and partial response determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, until 2 years
Pathological response rate, * Pathologic complete response rate (pCR): defined as absence of (0%) viable tumor present histologically in the resected tumor specimen
* Major pathologic response (MPR): â‰¤10% residual viable tumor following neoadjuvant therapy, A resected tumor specimen is collected during surgery. (Approximately within 10 weeks after dosing)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from curative surgery (no disease) to recurrence/progression/death and From start of osimertinib to documented radiographic relapse/progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria, until 2 years|Overall survival (OS), After completion of the clinical treatment, subjects are followed up for 30 days and then observed at 3months intervals for up to 1 year.|Ratio of inability to resection (operational to non-surgical conversion rate), Last Patient Performed at the last visit (LPLV). Record the percentage of patients who were initially evaluated as possible to undergo resection and were unable to receive resection due to treatment-related adverse events (AEs) or disease progression., It is performed at study completion, an average of 4year|Incidence of Adverse Events, AE captured by CYCAE 5.0 until after 30days of last administration., It is performed at study completion, an average of 4year|Exploratory analysis (Single cell RNA-seq), perform the analysis of single cell RNA-seq. to characterize heterogeneous gene expression programs within TME and interrelate their transcriptional, functional and genetic diversity between pre and post immunotherapy, Screening, At operation(after 8week of administration)|Exploratory analysis (Blood sample : PBMC-peripheral blood mononuclear cells), perform NGS using SignateraTM assay to detect mutations in the sample., until 2 years
