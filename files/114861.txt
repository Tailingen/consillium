A Study to Evaluate the Optimization of the Cytokine Release Syndrome Profile for Glofitamab in Combination With Gemcitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The main goal of this trial is to study the frequency and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are using a combination of glofitamab + gemcitabine + oxaliplatin (Glofit-GemOx) followed by glofitamab-only treatment.
