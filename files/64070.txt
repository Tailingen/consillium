Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block for Management of Post- Dural Puncture Headache in Obstetric Patients
The purpose of this trial is to study the efficacy and efficiency of sphenopalatine ganglion block for management of post dural puncture headache in obstetric patients
Post-Dural Puncture Headache
PROCEDURE: Sphenopalatine ganglion block|DRUG: paracetamol
Numeric rating pain score, Numeric rating pain score will be used to assess the efficacy of SPGB for treatment of PDPH, First 24 hours after the procedure
Total analgesic consumption, total dose of ketorolac will be calculated, First 24 hours after the procedure
Background and objectives: Post dural puncture headache(PDPH) is a common complication of lumbar puncture, it is likely due to the loss of cerebrospinal fluid into the epidural space through the dural tear. The prevalence of PDPH is higher in pregnant women.Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) is a non-invasive intervention with minimal adverse effects, it is indicated in acute and chronic facial/head pain like cluster headache, trigeminal neuralgia, post herpetic neuralgia and pain due to head and neck cancer.SPGB can be performed by different approaches:transnasal,transoral ,sub zygomatic and lateral infratemporal.Transnasal is the easiest, least invasive approach which can be done at bedside.

The objective of this trial is to study the efficacy and efficiency of sphenopalatine ganglion block for management of post-dural puncture headache in obstetric patients.The following will be recorded: pain score will be assessed using the numeric rating pain scale(NRS),heart rate and mean arterial pressure, onset and duration of analgesia, total dose of ketorolac, duration of hospital stay and patient satisfaction
