Ascertainment of Families for Genetic Studies of Familial Lymphoproliferative Disorders
The purpose of this study is to better understand the genetic causes of Hodgkin's disease (a kind of lymphoma) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and related diseases. The doctors have identified the patient because 1) they have had a lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, and have a family member with one of these disorders or 2) they are a member of a family with a lymphoproliferative disorder, including Hodgkin's disease and/or, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or a second cancer after Hodgkin's disease.

To perform linkage and candidate gene studies on informative families for the purpose of identifying novel lymphoproliferative syndrome (LPS) predisposition genes., 2 years
