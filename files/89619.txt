A Trial Testing Early vs Late Onset of EPO Alfa Treatment in Lower Risk MDS
This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase III study

Patients with baseline Hb comprised between 9 and 10.5g/dl will be randomized to receive EPO Alfa 60000 UI/week for at least 12 weeks:

* Either at diagnosis Or
* at the Hb threshold chosen for RBC transfusions (must be \< 9g/dl)
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: EPREX
Time to RBC transfusion dependence in non RBC transfusion dependent lower risk MDS patients with anemia with early (at inclusion of the patient) versus delayed onset,( at the threshold chosen for RBC transfusion) of EPO ALFA, RBC transfusion dependence will be defined by requirement of at least transfusions of 2 PRBC within an interval of less than 8 weeks, given for Hb \<8g/dl or \<9g/dl according to comorbidities and in the absence of other cause of anemia (bleeding, surgery...), taking into account only transfusions given at least 12 weeks after onset of treatment with EPO ALFA., 12 weeks
Erythroid response (according to IWG 2006 criteria), Erythroid response (according to IWG 2006 criteria) after 12 weeks of EPO ALFA treatment, 12 weeks|response duration to EPO ALFA, response duration to EPO ALFA measured from the date of enrollment until failure, 4 years|Overall survival, Overall survival measured from the date of enrollment to death or the date of last contact, 4 years
in this trial we will compare the early introduction of EPO alfa to the delayed introduction in lower risk MDS with non RBC transfusion dependent anemia.

At enrollment patients will be randomised in the 2 arms (early and delayed start of EPO alfa).

Treatment Regimen Epoetin alfa 60000 UI/week for at least 12 weeks

1. Early onset arm: early onset of EPO ALFA 60000 IU/week , at patient inclusion
2. Delayed onset arm: late introduction of EPO ALFA 60000 IU/week, whenever the patient reaches the level chosen RBC transfusions (based on age, comorbidities, anticipated tolerance of anemia).
