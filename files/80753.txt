Pacritinib in Relapsed/Refractory T-cell Lymphoproliferative Neoplasms
The main purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the study drug pacritinib in people with relapsed or refractory lymphoproliferative disorders.
T-Cell Neoplasm|Lymphoproliferative Disorders
DRUG: Pacritinib
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR will be estimated for each disease-specific cohort of patients. Overall response is defined as best disease response recorded from first day of treatment until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Response in PTCL patients is assessed by PET/CT scan using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) criteria. Response in CTCL patients is assessed using the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). Results will be stratified by type: complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], minor response \[MR; a provisional category in RECIL only\], stable disease \[SD\], progressive disease \[PD\]; and by cohort., Up to 2 years
Complete response rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the percentage of PTCL patients who have a best response of CR per the RECIL criteria and percentage of CTCL who a have a best response of CR per the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). CR rate will be analyzed by cohort and summarized with "time-to-event" analysis., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from first observed response (CR or PR) to date of progression (PD) or death, whichever occurs first. DOR will be analyzed by cohort with "time-to-event" analysis., Up to approximately 5 years|Time to next treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as time from first dose of pacritinib to initiation of alternative systemic, antineoplastic therapy. TTNT will be analyzed by cohort using a "time-to-event" analysis., Up to approximately 5 years|Progression- free survival (PFS)., PFS is defined as the time from first day of treatment to date of disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who survive without progression will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. PFS will be analyzed by cohort and summarized with "time-to-event analysis., Up to approximately 5 years|Treatment related toxicities >=grade 3, The analyses of safety endpoint will be conducted using tabulations of adverse events, assessed per NCI CTCAE v5.0, stratified by grade (severity) and attribution for each cohort. Grade 3 or higher treatment related toxicities will be reported., 30 days post end of treatment (+4 days)
Patients will receive single-agent treatment with pacritinib 200mg orally twice daily until any condition for treatment discontinuation has been met. Patients will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) (cohort 1); angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma/follicular helper T-cell (AITL/TFH) PTCL (cohort 2); Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) - mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS) (cohort 3); and other eligible, less common PTCL subtypes (cohort 4).
