A Trial of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Antibody) in Combination With Apatinib in Patients With Advanced TNBC
This is a Phase II, Open-labeled, Randomised, Parallel, Non-comparative, Two-arms, Investigator-initiated Clinical Trial of SHR-1210 (Anti-PD-1 Antibody) in Combination With Apatinib (VEGFR2 inhibitor) in Subjects with Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Subjects with advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer will be recruited. Patients will be randomised to two treatment arms of this study. One arm is SHR-1210 combination with apatinib daily dosing, and the other arm is SHR-1210 combination with apatinib intermittent dosing; each arm will enrolle10-29 subjects (Simons two stage design).

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 combination with apatinib in the treatment of advanced TNBC.
