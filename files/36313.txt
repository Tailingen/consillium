Assessing the Safety and Performance of the Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler and Reloads (Frankenman) in Colectomy
The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Single Use Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler and Reloads from Frankenman used in (hemi)colectomy to remove tumors and create anastomoses in patients with cancer in the ascending colon. The goal of the study will be achieved by assessing the device performance and reporting of peri- and postoperative complications in a prospectively maintained database.
