A Pilot Study to Assess the Clinical Utility of PYLARIFY PET-CT for Detecting Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer, Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Breast Cancer
To learn if piflufolastat F18 can be used in imaging scans for patients with breast cancer, HCC, or pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer|Breast Cancer|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Piflufolastat F18
Accuracy is defined as the number of concordant cases between PYLARIFY PET-CT and the gold standard truth divided by the total sample size., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

* To assess the diagnosis accuracy of PYLARIFY (piflufolastat F18 ) PET-CT for imaging patients with suspected metastatic pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer. Accuracy is defined as the number of concordant cases between PYLARIFY PET-CT and the gold standard truth divided by the total sample size

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess diagnosis accuracy of PYLARIFY (piflufolastat F18 ) PET-CT for imaging patients with suspected metastatic pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer by additional accuracy measures including sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value.
* To evaluate the added clinical usefulness of PYLARIFY (piflufolastat F18) PET-CT for imaging patients with suspected metastatic pancreatic cancer, HCC and breast cancer.
