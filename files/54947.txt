A Phase I, Dose-finding Study of BEZ235 in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia
Primary objectives:

* To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BEZ235 when administered twice daily (BID) as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia
* To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)

Secondary objectives:

* Assess the safety and tolerability of daily oral administration of BEZ235 with a BID schedule
* To describe preliminary anti-leukemic activity of BEZ235 in patients with acute leukemia
* To correlate changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers with basic pharmacokinetic data

Exploratory objectives:

* To assess pre-treatment phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway-related genes in blast cells and all other malignant cells derived from blood or bone marrow.
* To assess the pharmacodynamic changes in components of the PI3K-protein kinase B (AKT)-mTOR pathway in bone marrow following treatment as potential predictive biomarkers of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of BEZ235 in association with clinical responses.
* To identify potential resistance mechanisms and biomarkers that may correlate with efficacy and response from blood and bone marrow samples pre-and post-treatment in case of resistance
