Improving Health-Promoting Behaviors in Adolescent Cancer Survivors Using AWAKE: A Feasibility Trial
A behavioral intervention called Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early Life (AWAKE) focused on increasing hope in order to improve quality of life and health-promoting behaviors in survivors of young adult cancer. The goals of this project are to adapt the AWAKE platform into an intervention acceptable for use in adolescent cancer survivors and their guardians in order to improve survivors' hope, quality of life, and health-promoting behaviors, and to generate the preliminary data needed for a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of the AWAKE platform in this population.

Change in the he Children's Hope Scale score, A 6-item self-report questionnaire assessing children's dispositional hope. Two components, agency (ability to initiate and sustain action towards goals) and pathways (capacity to find a means to carry out goals), are assessed by the measure. Responses are on a 6-point Likert-scale ranging from 1=none of the time to 6=all of the time with higher scores representing increased dispositional hope., Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits
Change in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), 4.0 scale score, The PedsQL 4.0 scale has 23-items that are grouped into four domains: 1)Physical Functioning (eight items), 2) Emotional Functioning (five items), 3) Social Functioning (five items) and 4) School Functioning (five items). 5-point response scale is utilized across child self-report and parent proxy-report (0 never a problem; 1 almost never a problem; 2 sometimes a problem; 3 often a problem; 4 almost always a problem). Subjects are requested to rate how much problems they experienced during the past month. All items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0 100 scale (0 100, 1 75, 2 50, 3 25, 4 0), so that higher scores indicate better Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)., Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits|Change in number of servings of fruits and vegetables, Change in number of servings of fruits and vegetables will be assessed using 9 dietary habits questions from Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits|Change in number of physical activity hours per day, Change in number of physical activity hours per day will be assessed using 5 physical activity questions from Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits|Change in number of screen time hours per day, Change in number of screen time hours per day will be will be assessed using a question from Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits|Change in PROMIS score, The PROMIS Peer Relationships, Anxiety, and Depression scales have self-report and parent-proxy versions. Each scale is scored from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better peer relationships, worse anxiety and worse depression. Questions: 8 peer relationships, 8 anxiety, 8 depression, Baseline, 2 and 4 months follow up visits|Usability of AWAKE, Responses to four usability questions will be based on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very useless/ineffective; 5=very useful/effective) with higher ratings indicating more favorable attitudes., 2 month assessment|Satisfaction with AWAKE, Responses to 16 satisfaction questions will be based on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very useless/ineffective; 5=very useful/effective) with higher ratings indicating more favorable attitudes., 2 month assessment
A behavioral intervention called Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early Life (AWAKE) focused on increasing hope in order to improve quality of life and health-promoting behaviors in survivors of young adult cancer. Adaptation of this intervention to incorporate messaging for adolescents and their guardians has the potential to have a long-term impact on adolescent cancer survivors. The goals of this project are to adapt the AWAKE platform into an intervention acceptable for use in adolescent cancer survivors and their guardians in order to improve survivors' hope, quality of life, and health-promoting behaviors, and to generate the preliminary data needed for a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of the AWAKE platform in this population.
