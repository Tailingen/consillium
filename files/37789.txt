Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab Versus Pentostatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab in Previously Untreated or Treated B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients
The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) the combination of Nipent+Cytoxan+Rituxan has on CLL cancer compared to Fludara+Cytoxan+Rituxan. While all of these drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other cancers, these combinations are experimental for the treatment of CLL.
B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Pentostatin
Infection Rate, infection=febrile events requiring treatment, 6 cycles of 28-day for FCR and 8 cycles of 21-day for PCR, or until PD, CR, or intolerable toxicity
Infective Event Rate, infective events=temperature \>101 without symptoms or temp \<101 with symptoms, 6 cycles of 28-day for FCR and 8 cycles of 21-day for PCR, or until PD, CR, or intolerable toxicity|Percentage of Patients Hospitalized, Percentage of patients who were hospitalized due to any reasons during the study period., 6 cycles of 28-day for FCR and 8 cycles of 21-day for PCR, or until PD, CR, or intolerable toxicity|Hematologic Recovery, defined as Hb \>11g/dL and a platelet count \>100 × 10\^3/mm\^3, 2 months post-treatment|Mean Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) at Post-treatment, mean Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) measured 2 months (8-10 weeks) following the last dose of study treatment, 2 months post-treatment|Complete Remission (CR), Definitions of response is evaluated using guidelines proposed by the National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

Complete remission (CR) requires all of the following for a period of at least 2 months:

1. Absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination and appropriate radiographic techniques. Lymph nodes must be \<1 cm.
2. No evidence of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
3. Absence of constitutional symptoms.
4. Normal CBC as exhibited by:

   * Polymorphonuclear leukocytes ≥ 1,500/mm\^3
   * Platelets \> 100,000/mm\^3
   * Hemoglobin \> 11.0 g/dL (untransfused)
5. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed 2 months after clinical and laboratory results demonstrate that all of the requirements listed in 1-4 have been met to demonstrate that a CR has been achieved. The marrow sample must be at least normocellular for age, with less than 30% of the nucleated cells being lymphocytes.

Lymphoid nodules should be absent., 6 cycles of 28-day for FCR and 8 cycles of 21-day for PCR, or until PD, CR, or intolerable toxicity|Objective Remission Rate (ORR), Complete remission (CR) see Outcome Measure 6. Partial remission (PR) must exhibit criteria 1 and 2 as well as one or more of the remaining features for at least 2 months.

1. ≥50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from the pretreatment baseline value.
2. ≥50% reduction in lymphadenopathy.
3. ≥50% reduction in the size of the liver and/or spleen.
4. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes ≥ 1,500/mm\^3 or 50% improvement over baseline.
5. Platelets \>100,000/mm\^3 or 50% improvement over baseline.
6. Hemoglobin \>11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions. Nodular partial remission (nPR) is defined as a CR with persistent bone marrow nodules; Objective Remission (OR) = CR + PR + nPR., 6 cycles of 28-day for FCR and 8 cycles of 21-day for PCR, or until PD, CR, or intolerable toxicity|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 1-year, PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date, 12 months after registered.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 2-year, PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date., 24 months after registered.
