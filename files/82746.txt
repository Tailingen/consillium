A Randomized Study of Primary Tumor Radiotherapy for Patients With MPE Stage IV NSCLC
This randomized phase II study compare survival outcomes and toxicity of malignant pleural effusion stage IV non small-cell lung cancer patients Intrapleural infusion chemotherapy in combination with concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) VS not combination with concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT).

Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., up to 9 months
Overall survival(OS), Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause, Time Frame: up to 9 months|Treatment toxicities, To assess and record nausea, vomiting, hematologic toxicity,radiation oesophagitis and other treantment complications by CTCAE v4.0, Time Frame: up to 12 months
Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of stage IV NSCLC. MPE caused by lung cancer accounts for about 1/3. According to statistics, the number of MPE cases per year in the United States exceeds 150,000. At the same time, with the development of three-dimensional radiotherapy technology, the wide application of comprehensive treatment concept, and the understanding of the relationship between different metastatic state and survival of stage IV NSCLC, prospective and retrospective studies have confirmed that systemic therapy combined with primary tumor three-dimensional radiation Treatment is more conducive to improving symptoms and prolonging survival than medication alone. Retrospective results and prospective findings have been reported from the single center of the study group \[Chinese Journal of Radiation Oncology, 2011, sixth issue and the first issue of 2012\], taking local three-dimensional radical radiotherapy for chemotherapy, two Complementary technological advantages can significantly prolong survival and improve quality of life, enabling some patients to achieve long-term survival. However, most of the above studies excluded patients with malignant pleural effusion. For stage IV NSCLC of malignant pleural effusion, whether the primary tumor radiotherapy can bring survival benefits, has not yet formed a unified norm and conclusion, and needs further development. the study.
