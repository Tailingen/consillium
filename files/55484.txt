Rituximab Versus Observation as Maintenance Therapy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of Rituximab maintenance therapy to prolong progression free survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who responded to a Rituximab induction therapy.
