Monitoring the Response of Port Wine Stain Birthmarks to Laser Therapy With Wide-field Functional Imaging Technologies
The researcher develop non-invasive imaging modalities for assessment of port wine stain during laser therapy treatment of Port Wine Stain. The imaging modalities will be used to guide immediate retreatment of regions of persistent perfusion during the procedure.
PORT WINE STAIN
DEVICE: Image-guided remove Port Wine Stain
Image-guided surgery remove Port Wine Stain, Image-guided surgery remove Port Wine Stain, 24 hours
The researcher can use imaging system operates by projecting low-power near-infrared structured light patterns on to the tissue of interest in a non-contact, reflection geometry and then capturing the reflectance with a camera.The system can image the depth-resolved optical properties of in-vivo tissues, allowing rapid, non-invasive visualization of sub-surface structures of Port Wine Stain.
