Avastin and Tarceva for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
Primary Objectives:

1. (Phase I) To establish the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of the combination of OSI-774 (Tarceva™) and rhuMAb VEGF (Avastin™) in patients with advanced Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).
2. (Phase II) To assess response rate and tolerability of the regimen at the dose level established in the phase I portion of this study.

Secondary Objectives:

1. (Phase I and II) To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction between the combination.
2. (Phase I) To establish a phase II regimen of the OSI-774/ rhuMAb VEGF combination, for further study alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Avastin|DRUG: Tarceva
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Tarceva in combination with Avastin, After each 21 day cycle
Response in Patients With NSCLC Receiving Combination Avastin and Tarceva, 6 weeks (2 cycles)
Patients will be treated with oral Tarceva daily for 21 days each cycle. Patients will receive Avastin by IV on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. If a patient has no grade 3 or 4 toxicities after the 1st cycle, then the patient may continue the same doses of Tarceva and Avastin for another cycle. If the patient has response or stable disease after 6 weeks (2 cycles), the patient may continue on the same doses of Tarceva and Avastin. A patient may receive treatment on this study for up to one year, unless his or her disease progresses or side effects become too severe.

The starting dose is 100 mg daily of Tarceva and 7.5 mg/kg every 21 days of Avastin.
