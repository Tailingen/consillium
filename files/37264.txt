Sirolimus, Tacrolimus, and Antithymocyte Globulin in Preventing Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Undergoing a Donor Stem Cell Transplant For Hematological Cancer
RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus, sirolimus, antithymocyte globulin, and methotrexate before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sirolimus, tacrolimus, and antithymocyte globulin work in preventing graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for hematological cancer .

Cumulative Incidence of Grade II-IV Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) at Day 100, Patients were evaluated for the development of acute GVHD within the first 100 days post HSCT. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was determined using competing risk analysis. Competing risks for acute GVHD were death and nonengraftment., 100 Days Post Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)|Severity of Acute GVHD, All patients were considered for the evaluation of the severity of acute GVHD., 100 Days Post HSCT|Cumulative Incidence of Chronic GVHD, Patients were evaluated for the development of chronic GVHD from 101 days post HSCT to last contact or documented evidence of the disease. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was determined using competing risk analysis. Competing risks for GVHD were death and nonengraftment., 2 year point estimate was provided.|Severity of Chronic GVHD, All Patients were considered for the evaluation of chronic GVHD severity., Patients were evaluated until they developed chronic GVHD, a median of 130 days post HSCT

Competing risks for NRM were death due to disease progression, relapse and nonengraftment., 100 day point estimate was provided|Non-relapse Mortality at Two Years Post HSCT, Patients were evaluated for non-relapse mortality (NRM) throughout the study.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the incidence and severity of acute- and chronic-graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after HLA-matched or -mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic peripheral blood transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies scheduled to receive immunosuppressive combination of sirolimus, tacrolimus, and anti-thymocyte globulin as GVHD prophylaxis.
* To determine the safety of this combination in the first six months post-transplant.

Secondary

* To determine the time-to-engraftment, non-relapse mortality rate, overall and disease-free survival, incidence of disease relapse, and incidence of opportunistic infections with this GVHD prophylaxis.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to conditioning regimen (fludarabine phosphate and melphalan vs fractionated total-body irradiation \[FTBI\] and etoposide vs FTBI and cyclophosphamide) and degree of donor/recipient HLA mismatch (high-risk vs low-risk).

* Conditioning regimen: Patients receive 1 of 3 standard conditioning regimens beginning on day -9 or -8 and continuing to day -1 or 0.
* Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: Patients receive HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.
* Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously beginning on day -3 and then orally when tolerated, oral sirolimus on days -3 and -2, anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-8 hours on days -3 to 0, and methotrexate\* IV on days 1, 3, and 6. Tacrolimus and sirolimus continue for 3-6 months (with taper).

NOTE: \*Only patients with high-risk HLA mismatch receive treatment with methotrexate.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
