"Clinical Evaluation of Opto-Acoustic Tomography for Detection and Diagnostic Differentiation of Thyroid Nodules"
Thyroid Feasibility Study
Feasibility Study for Thyroid Indication
DEVICE: Imagio OA/US
Initial Assessment of Imagio's Ability to Distinguish Between Benign and Malignant Thyroid Nodules., The primary objective of this feasibility study is to provide an initial assessment of Imagio OA's ability to distinguish between benign and malignant thyroid nodules, and when appropriate, between benign and metastatic cervical lymph nodes in subjects., 12-24 months
This is an early R\&D Feasibility study to assess Imagio OA/US's ability to optimize the device algorithm specific to thyroid in order to detect the difference between benign and malignant thyroid nodules
