Silent Breast Cancer A Study of the Disease Prevalence Held by Imaging Guided Biopsies in Autopsy Specimens
The aim of this study is to define silent breast cancer prevalence in both sexes and will be held by biopsies performed in imaging suspicious areas of the breast (ecography and mammography) in cadavers without known breast cancer.
Female Breast Cancer|Male Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Bilateral mastectomy|OTHER: Biopsy
Silent breast cancer prevalence, To define the existing disease that did not caused death in both sexes, 2 years
Silent breast cancer prevalent molecular profile, To identify those molecular subgroups of the disease that remain silent, 2 years
Cadavers of both sexes are going to be submitted to bilateral mastectomy. The specimens are going to be examined by palpation, ecography and mammography and all areas with (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) BI-RADS classification \>= 3 are going to be biopsied.

Biopsy specimens are going to be processed by the pathology department and cancers are going to be identified and classified by their molecular type.

The investigators intend to know which is the disease reservoir in various ages.
