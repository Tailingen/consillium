Docetaxel and Oxaliplatin Combination With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer
1. Goals

   * The primary goal of this phase II trial is to:

   evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC as first-line therapy

   Secondary goals are to:evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination, investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this population
2. Design

The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial according to the two stage testing design by Simon.22
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin
Response rate, 2years
Treatment-related toxicities, Number and proportion of patients with adverse events according to the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.0) as a measure of treatment-related toxicities, 2 years|Progression free survival, Both survival curves will be calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and median value will be determined according to the survival curves.

The median PFS and OS will be used for measure., 2 years|Overall survival, Both survival curves will be calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and median value will be determined according to the survival curves.

The median PFS and OS will be used for measure., 2 years
