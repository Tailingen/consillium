The safety analysis set consists of all participants treated with any dose of KITE-222., First infusion date of KITE-222 up to 30 days|60 Day All-cause Mortality Rate, The mortality rate is calculated by number of deaths, regardless of cause, within 60 days from the KITE-222 infusion date divided by the total number of participants included in the safety analysis set. The safety analysis set consists of all participants treated with any dose of KITE-222., First infusion date of KITE-222 up to 60 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Peak Plasma Concentration of KITE-222 CAR T Cells in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory (r/r) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treated with KITE-222, PK will be assessed at enrollment (before start of leukapheresis) and Day 0 (predose) and on Days 3, 7, 10, 14 \& 21, Week 4, post-treatment follow-up (Week 6, Months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, \& 24 and at relapse for participants without allo-SCT or within 1 week before conditioning chemotherapy and Day -1 of allo-SCT, Months 1, 3, 6,12 \& 24 and at relapse for participants with allo-SCT).
