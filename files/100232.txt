CCI-779 and EKB-569 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of CCI-779 and EKB-569 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. EKB-569 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth. Giving CCI-779 together with EKB-569 may kill more tumor cells.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: pelitinib|DRUG: temsirolimus
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients, Up to 28 days|Number and severity of all adverse events per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v3.0, Frequency distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses., Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment
Best response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Time from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence, assessed up to 3 years|Time until any treatment related toxicity, Up to 3 years|Time until treatment related grade 3+ toxicity, Up to 3 years|Time until hematologic nadirs (white blood cells [WBC], absolute neutrophil count [ANC], platelets), Up to 3 years|Time to progression, Up to 3 years|Time to treatment failure, Time from registration to documentation of progression, unacceptable toxicity, or refusal to continue participation by the patient, assessed up to 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of CCI-779 and EKB-569 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

Group I: Patients receive oral EKB-569 on days 1-28 and oral CCI-779 on days 1-7 and 15-21.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of EKB-569 and CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Group II: Patients receive oral EKB-569 at the MTD on days 4-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of all subsequent courses and CCI-779 at the MTD on days 1-3 and 15-17.

Group III: Patients receive EKB-569 at the MTD as in group I and oral CCI-779 at the MTD on days 7-9 and 19-21 of course 1 and days 1-3 and 15-17 of all subsequent courses.

In all groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-42 patients (18-30 for group I, 6 for group II, and 6 for group III) will be accrued for this study within 1.35-1.75 years.
