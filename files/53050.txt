Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in the Treatment of Non-Anaplastic Non-Medullary Thyroid Cancer
The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to find out what effect, good and/or bad, external beam radiation therapy, has on the patient and their thyroid cancer where surgery is not an option or where despite surgery, the disease is still present.
Thyroid Cancer
RADIATION: IMRT|DEVICE: DWI MRI|DRUG: Doxorubicin|OTHER: Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImP)
Percentage of Participants With Local-regional Progression-free Survival, 2-year cumulative incidence of locoregional progression/failure with death as a competing risk will be defined as infield progression if included in the RT field and meets one of the following criteria: 25% increase in tumor volume, new lesions, and/or 25% increase in metabolic tumor volume or total lesion glycolysis., 2 years
Overall Survival, 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-related Toxicities, During radiation, adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-Version 4.0 Physician-reported acute grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicities, regardless of attribution., 2 years|Rate of Late Dysphagia, Grade 2 or higher late toxicity rate. During radiation, adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-Version 4.0, 2 years|Rate of Late Xerostomia/Dry Mouth, Rate of late xerostomia/dry mouth. During radiation, adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-Version 4.0, 2 years|Number of Participants With Significant Functional Difference in Dysphagia at 12 Months Compared to Baseline, Comparison of significant functional differences 12 months after treatment assessed using standard Modified Barium Swallow Study, 12 months
