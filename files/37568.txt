Comparison of Microwave Ablation With Breast Conserving Surgery for Breast Tumor
The investigators will perform this study to prospectively compare the clinical outcome after percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) and breast conserving surgery of benign and malignant breast lesion under ultrasound (US) guidance.
Breast Tumor|Microwave Ablation|Breast Conserving Surgery
PROCEDURE: microwave ablation|PROCEDURE: breast conserving surgery
overall survival：Defined as the length of time from the beginning of treatment to death or the last follow-up (if no death), Defined as the length of time from the beginning of treatment to death or the last follow-up (if no death), 5 years|cosmetic satisfaction：Patients are rated whether they are satisfied with the surgical scars（bad / moderate /good / very good）, Patients are rated whether they are satisfied with the surgical scars（bad / moderate /good / very good）, 3 years
local tumor progress：Defined as the proportion of patients with active tumor at the edge of the treatment ：Defined as the proportion of patients with active tumor at the edge of the treatment, Defined as the proportion of patients with active tumor at the edge of the treatment area during follow-up after the tumor was completely treated, 5 years|metastasis：Defined as the proportion of cases with metastasis from the beginning of the study to the end of the study or the death of the patient, Defined as the proportion of cases with metastasis from the beginning of the study to the end of the study or the death of the patient, 5 years|complication：Defined as numbers of participants with side effect and major complications to the end of the study or the death of the patient, Defined as numbers of participants with side effect and major complications to the end of the study or the death of the patient, 5 years
A total of more than 300 patients diagnosed with breast tumor in multiple centers will be recruited in this study and underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA and breast conserving surgery treatment. Information for each patient includes demographics; longest diameters of tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type; location of tumor according to whether adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla. Ablation variables including session, puncture, time, and power; complete ablation, complications; reduction in volume, palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying outcomes,recurrence,survival will be compared and analyzed.
