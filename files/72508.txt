Sub-therapeutic GnRH- Antagonist Treatment to Rectify LH Pulsatility in Lean Women With PCOS.
The clinical study using a sub-therapeutic dose of a GnRH antagonist to reduce overactive LH pulsatility in women with PCOS. With the intervention and lowered LH action we anticipate to decrease androgen levels in women with PCOS. The aim to show for the first time that low-dose GnRH-antagonists can lower LH pulsatility by 20-30% and decrease androgen levels without blunting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and thereby the reproductive functions.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Ganirelix|DRUG: Ganirelix
Serum LH level, The degree of gonadotropin suppression will be determined by calculating the percent inhibition from the pre-antagonist period \[(mean PRE - nadir)/mean PRE\] x 100, where nadir hormone levels will be calculated using a moving average., every 10 minutes for 8 hours
Variation in LH secretion amplitude before and after Ganirelix* injection (area under the curve), at the beginning and at the end of the 8 hours|Variation in androgen production, defined by the difference between the measurement at H8 and the measurement at H0 (4 hours before injection) of total testosterone and androstenedione., at 4 hours after injection|change in FSH levels, defined as the difference between the measurement at H8 and the measurement at H0 (4 hours prior to injection) of FSH, at 4 hours post-injection|change in estradiol levels, defined as the difference between the measurement at H8 and the measurement at H0 (4 hours prior to injection) of estradiol, at 4 hours post-injection|change in AMH levels, defined as the difference between the measurement at H8 and the measurement at H0 (4 hours prior to injection) of AMH., at 4 hours post-injection
