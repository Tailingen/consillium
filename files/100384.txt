PROstaTE Cancer Treatment and Obesity in Zoladex-Astrazeneca Treated Patients
The reports on relationship of obesity and biochemical or clinical recurrence of prostate cancer are controversial. Several reports have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of biochemical or clinical failure after radical prostatectomy. Other prospective studies have shown no adverse effect of obesity on long-term outcomes after prostatectomy. Limited reports are available on the impact of obesity on prostate cancer progression after radiotherapy. Primary: to assess percentage recurrence rate among normal weight and overweight or obese prostate cancer patients treated by adjuvant Zoladex therapy. Secondary: to determine the Quality of Life differences among normal and overweight or obese prostate cancer patients by a Quality of Life questionnaire
