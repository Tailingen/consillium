A Study Comparing AT-101 in Combination With Docetaxel and Prednisone Versus Docetaxel and Prednisone in Men With Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC)
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational Phase 2 study to evaluate and compare oral AT-101 in combination with docetaxel and prednisone versus docetaxel and prednisone plus placebo in the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer, who have received hormonal therapy but not chemotherapy.
