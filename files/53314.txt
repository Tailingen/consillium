Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Brain Tumors
This study examines cerebrospinal biomarkers in patients with brain tumors. A biomarker is a measurable indicator of the severity or presence of your disease state. Collecting and storing samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with brain tumors to study in the laboratory may help doctors develop new strategies to better diagnose, monitor, and treat brain tumors.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|OTHER: Electronic Health Record Review|OTHER: Survey Administration
Collection cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples that can provide a resource to the research community for biomarker discovery, Up to study completion
Feasibility of serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, Up to study completion
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples that can provide a resource to the research community for biomarker discovery in patients with gliomas.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the feasibility of serial CSF sampling from patients with brain tumors for longitudinal evaluation of tumor biomarkers.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of CSF samples via lumbar puncture at least 2 times. Patients may undergo additional collection of additional CSF samples if they choose.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
