Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Solely For Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
This study is a research and development initiative established to explore the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for managing organ motion of the liver in cancer patients planning procedures for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
Primary Liver Cancer|Metastatic Liver Cancer From Any Cancer Site
Measure average motion trajectories, During MRI approx 1 hour|Image quality, as measured by image rating, Image quality will be measured on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the best., During MRI approx 1 hour|Image quality, as measured by tumor volume, During MRI approx 1 hour|Image quality, as measured by tumor-to-live contrast to noise ratio, During MRI approx 1 hour|Planning target volume (PTV), PTV is defined as PTV=internal target volume (ITV) + safety margin (M), During MRI approx 1 hour
There is a potential role to systematically implement MRI to establish appropriate workflow of the implementation for tumor motion management in liver SBRT. Compared to CT, MRI has many significant advantages for radiotherapy planning, including superior tumor and soft-tissue contrast, flexible imaging orientation, freedom from radiation exposure and real-time imaging. MRI solely based liver SBRT will allow for more precise delineation of target volume, less uncertainties in treatment planning, better motion management, and potentially better treatment outcome
