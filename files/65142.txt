Allogenic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High Risk CD33+ AML/MDS/JMML
The addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in combination with Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide followed by AlloSCT in patients with high risk CD33+ AML/JMML/MDS will be safe and well tolerated.

This study will attempt to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the immune therapy (gemtuzumab) when given in combination with the myeloablative (high dose) drugs used in this study for allogeneic stem cell transplant. (Part A)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin|DRUG: Busulfan|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Thymoglobulin|DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil|DRUG: Methotrexate
Maximal tolerated dose or tolerable dose of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (anti-CD33 immunotoxin) therapy combined with Busulfan/ Cyclophosphamide in the conditioning regimen prior to AlloSCT in patients with high risk CD33+ AML/JMML/MDS, 1 year
Changes, if applicable, of minimal residual disease (cytogenetics, FISH, RT-PCR) in patients with high risk CD33+ AML/JMML/MDS after AlloSCT., 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease free survival (DFS), (if applicable), following GO, Bu/CY and AlloSCT in patients with high risk CD33+ AML/JMML/MDS., 1 year|Quality of life before and after GO, Bu/CY conditioning and AlloSCT in patients with high risk CD33+ AML/JMML/MDS, 1 year
Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (CMA-676) is a chemotherapeutic agent consisting of recombinant humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated with calicheamicin, a highly potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic. The antibody portion of Gemtuzumab binds specifically to the CD33 antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed on the surface of leukemia blasts, normal and leukemic myeloid colony-forming cells, including leukemic clonogenic precursors, but excluding pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and nonhematopoietic cells. This results in formation of the complex that is internalized, upon which calicheamicin derivative is released with in the lysosomes of the myeloid cell. The free calicheamicin derivative then binds to the DNA, resulting in DNA double strand breaks and consequential cell death.
