Validation Study CARES
This study aims to validate the CARES, a needs assessment instrument which can be used to inventorize cancer patients biopsychosocial distress and care needs.

* QUANTITATIVE PART OF THE STUDY: Patients need to fill in a questionnaire package containing questions about social-demographic and medical data, the CARES and convergent measures: Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Social Support List (SSL), Maudsley Marital Questionnaire (MMQ), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality Of Life Core 30 (EORTC-QOL-C30), Distress Thermometer (DT) and a Care Needs Questionnaire. One week after the first questionnaire package participants have to fill in the CARES a second time and answer some questions to evaluate the feasibility of the CARES.
* QUALITATIVE PART OF THE STUDY: Participants from the quantitative part of the study and other (ex-) cancer patients who not have to fulfill the criteria of age and cancer stage can participate in a focus group interview. In these focus groups the content validity and preferences on psychosocial screening in care are discussed.
