Prostatectomy is the treatment of choice for prostate cancer. The robot-assisted prostatectomy is becoming the most popular surgical method for prostate cancer. The small incision after robot-assisted prostatectomy is thought to reduce the postoperative pain. There is few investigations for the strategy to reduce the postoperative pain of robot-assisted prostatectomy.

The intrathecal morphine injection is known to reduce postoperative pain for surgeries like hepatectomy, myomectomy and open prostatectomy. This method, however, is not yet studied for the robot-assisted prostatectomy. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal morphine for the patients undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy.
