A Phase I/II Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of Oral HP518 in mCRPC Patients
The overall objective of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety, PK,and anti-tumor activity of daily oral dosing with HP518,selecting the RP2D of HP518 based on assessments of patients with progressive mCRPC in dose-escalation phase
