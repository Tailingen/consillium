Characterizing the Genomic Landscape of Prostate Cancer in Native American Populations (NAT-Geno)
The purpose of this study is to analyze tumor tissue samples from patients of Native American identity with prostate cancer. By examining these samples, researchers hope to understand how different genes in your tumor can influence treatment decisions, how your cancer progresses and the outcome of your cancer.

Difference in the genomic profiles of Prostate Cancer, Comprehensively characterize the genomic profile of prostate cancer in Native American patients compared to Caucasian patients. Genetic testing will be conducted using Caris Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS)., 1-3 years
Comparison of Genomic Profiles, The study compares the Native American population with a reference Caucasian cohort to characterize molecular disparities and evaluate their clinical significance., 1-3 years
This study aims to establish a comprehensive database of Native American (NA) patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC), focusing on an in-depth characterization of the genomic landscape. Archived tumor tissue collected at screening and peripheral blood samples obtained within the first year of enrollment will serve as the basis for comprehensive molecular analyses. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) will be performed to characterize and delineate the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of the study cohort. The study will initially enroll participants at the Stephenson Cancer Center, with planned expansion to additional sites across Oklahoma and, subsequently, to other institutions across the United States. Oversight will be maintained by the Tribal Institutional Review Board and an independent Community Advisory Board to ensure cultural appropriateness, transparency, and sustained community engagement throughout the research process. The overarching objective is to generate insights that will inform the development of personalized treatment strategies in the future.
