A Clinical Study of Hetrombopag Olamine Tablets for Thrombocytopenia Induced by Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Cancer
This study now plans to explore the efficacy and safety of hetrombopag in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in advanced breast cancer, so as to further guide the clinical application of hetrombopag in chemotherapy-induced platelets.

Comparison of response rates to platelet-raising therapy in two chemotherapy cycles, Definition of response: 1. No chemotherapy regimen adjustment due to thrombocytopenia (such as chemotherapy delay ≥ 5 days, and/or chemotherapy dose reduction ≥ 20%, chemotherapy discontinuation, etc.; 2. No platelet-raising rescue therapy; 3. No Grade 4 myelosuppression; 4. Grade 3 myelosuppression for a duration of ≤ 1 week), 30day±3day after the last administration of Hetrombopag Olamine Tablets

Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications, the need for platelet transfusions, and limits the dose of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of certain malignancies. Thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) has a therapeutic effect on chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT). As an innovative TPO-RA drug, hetrombopag has a more optimized molecular structure and reduced liver and kidney toxicity. A registrational Phase III clinical study in CIT patients is ongoing. This study now plans to explore the efficacy and safety of hetrombopag in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in advanced breast cancer, so as to further guide the clinical application of hetrombopag in chemotherapy-induced platelets.
