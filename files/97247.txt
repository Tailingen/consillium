Real-time Ultrasound Guidance for Thoracic Epidural Blocks
Various modalities have been proposed for real-time confirmation of loss of resistance (LOR) for thoracic epidural blocks. With real-time ultrasound (US) guidance, the anesthesiologist attempts to visualize the sonographic advancement of the epidural needle and penetration of the epidural space (as detected by LOR)

This observational study is set out to confirm the reliability of real-time ultrasound guidance as an adjunct to LOR for thoracic epidural blocks.

PROCEDURE: Real-time ultrasound guidance for thoracic epidural catheter placement.
Percentage of successful epidural blocks after US-guided insertion of epidural catheters, After fifteen minutes of local anesthetic administration (4- mL dose of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5 Î¼g/mL ), an investigator will apply ice to the T1 to L4 dermatomes bilaterally. The criterion standard for success will be the presence of an epidural block, defined as a block to ice in at least 2 dermatomes bilaterally. If operators could not advance the catheter past the needle tip after 2 attempts despite a 180-degree rotation of the bevel between the first and second attempts, epidural blocks will be considered failures., 15 minutes after the local anesthetic injection through the epidural catheter
Number of blocked dermatomes, Number of blocked dermatomes after injection of local anesthetics through the epidural catheter., 15 minutes after the local anesthetic injection through the epidural catheter|Localization of blocked dermatomes, Localization of blocked dermatomes after injection of local anesthetics through the epidural catheter., 15 minutes after the local anesthetic injection through the epidural catheter|Image time, Needed time (minutes and seconds) to obtain an adequate image of the interlaminar space, Up to 30 minutes after skin disinfection|Needle time, Needed time (minutes and seconds) to insert the Tuohy needle tip in the interlaminar space and confirm a loss of resistance, Up to 30 minutes after skin disinfection|Catheter installation time, Elapsed time (minutes and seconds) from loss of resistance acquisition until the catheter is secured, Up to 30 minutes after skin disinfection|Block performance time, Time (minutes and seconds) between skin disinfection and once the catheter is secured in place., Up to 30 minutes after skin disinfection|Epidural block-related complications, Incidence of adverse events related to epidural block or local anesthetic injection (i.e. paresthesia, accidental dural puncture, intravascular or subarachnoid position of catheters, intravascular, subarachnoid or subdural injection, local anesthetic systemic toxicity), Up to 30 minutes after skin disinfection
