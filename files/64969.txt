A Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 9-valent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine ([9vHPV]; V503) Administered to 9- to 15-Year-Old Japanese Girls (V503-008).
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V503 in Japanese girls between the ages of 9 and 15 and will determine whether V503 induces an acceptable immune response to all human papillomavirus (HPV) strains contained in the vaccine. The success criterion for the primary analysis requires that point estimates for seroconversion rate be greater than 90% for all 9 HPV types.
Papillomavirus Infections
BIOLOGICAL: V503
Percentage of Participants Who Seroconvert to Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine, Serum antibody titers for HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were determined 4 weeks post-vaccination 3 using competitive luminex immunoassay (cLIA). The serostatus cutoffs (milli Merck U/mL) for HPV types were as follows: HPV Type 6: ≥30, HPV Type 11: ≥16; HPV Type 16: ≥20, HPV Type 18: ≥24, HPV Type 31: ≥10, HPV Type 33: ≥8, HPV Type 45: ≥8, HPV Type 52: ≥8, and HPV Type 58: ≥8., 4 weeks post-vaccination 3 (Month 7)|Percentage of Participants With an Injection-site Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the vaccine. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. AEs such as redness, swelling, and pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection site were recorded., up to 5 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With a Non-Injection Site (Systemic) AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the vaccine. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. Systemic AEs were those not categorized as injection-site AEs., up to 15 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With a Vaccine-related AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the vaccine. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. Adverse experience that is judged by the Investigator to be "definitely related," "probably related," or "possibly related" to the study drug is defined as a vaccine-related AE., up to 15 days after any vaccination
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) for Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine, Serum antibody titers for HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were determined 4 weeks post-vaccination 3 using cLIA. Titers are reported in milli Merck Units/mL., 4 weeks post-vaccination 3 (Month 7)
