A Clinical Study of Intratumoral MVR-C5252 (C5252) in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma
This is a Phase 1 open label, first in human study of C5252 monotherapy designed to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intratumoral (IT) injection of C5252 in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM).

Evaluate the safety and tolerability of C5252, Number of participants in dose escalating cohorts with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and/or changes in clinical laboratory abnormalities., Up to 28 days from C5252 injection|Characterize Dose Limiting Toxicities, Incidence of DLTs, Up to 28 days from C5252 injection|Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the RD of C5252, Incidence of DLTs, Up to 28 days from C5252 injection
Evaluate the PK of C5252, Measure anti-PD-1 antibody concentration in blood using Anti-PD-1 antibody ELISA test and IL-12 concentration in blood using IL-12p70 ELISA test., Up to 2 years from C5252 injection|Evaluate the viral shedding of C5252, Measure viral shedding of C5252 after intratumoral injection in saliva, nasopharyngeal mucus, and urine using qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test., Up to 2 years from C5252 injection|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have had a partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) to intervention, based on Investigator Assessment for Neuro-oncology (RANO)., Up to 2 years from C5252 injection|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from Day 1 to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first per RANO., Up to 2 years from C5252 injection|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause., Up to 2 years from C5252 injection
Evaluate blood cytokines, Measure blood cytokines using MSD V-Plex Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay test., Up to 28 days from C5252 injection|Evaluate lymphocyte profiling, Conduct lymphocyte profiling using PBMC Flow cytometry test., Up to 28 days from C5252 injection
This is a Phase 1 open label, first in human study of C5252 monotherapy designed to determine the safety and tolerability of a single IT injection of C5252 in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM. The Part 1 portion of the study is a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of C5252. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately 36 evaluable participants enrolled. Once the recommended dose (RD) is identified from Part 1, Part 2 Dose Expansion will enroll up to 15 additional participants to further assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a single IT injection of C5252 monotherapy.
