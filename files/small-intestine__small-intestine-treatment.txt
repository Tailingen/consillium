Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from small intestine cancer in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 13,920.
Deaths: 2,060.
Small intestine cancer types include adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and lymphoma. Small intestine cancer accounts for 3.8% of all digestive system malignancies.[

]
Follow-Up and Survivorship
As in
other gastrointestinal malignancies, the predominant modality of treatment is
surgery when resection is possible, and cure relates to the ability to
completely resect the cancer.
Neuroendocrine tumors of the small intestine are covered
in another summary as a separate cancer entity. For more information, see
Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment
.

Cellular Classification of Small Intestine Cancer
The following tumors occur in the small intestine:
Adenocarcinoma (most cases).
Lymphoma (uncommon),  which is  usually of the non-Hodgkin type. For more information, see
Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
,
Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
, and
Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
.
Sarcoma (most commonly leiomyosarcoma and more rarely angiosarcoma or
liposarcoma).
Neuroendocrine tumors. For more information, see
Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors
Treatment
.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors. For more information, see
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment
.
Approximately 25% to 50% of the primary malignant tumors in the small intestine are adenocarcinomas, and most occur in the duodenum.[
1
] Small intestine carcinomas may occur synchronously or metachronously at
multiple sites.
Leiomyosarcomas occur most often in the ileum.
About 20% of malignant lesions of the small intestine are neuroendocrine tumors,
which occur more frequently in the ileum than in the duodenum or jejunum and
may be multiple.
It is uncommon to find malignant lymphoma as a solitary small intestine lesion.

Stage Information for Small Intestine Cancer
In This Section
AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The treatment sections of this summary are organized according to
histopathological type rather than stage.
AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis)
classification to define small intestine cancer. This staging classification applies only to adenocarcinomas arising in the nonampullary duodenum and small intestine. Nonadenocarcinomas arising in the small intestine should have a TNM assigned but are not assigned a stage classification.[

For T3 tumors, the nonperitonealized perimuscular tissue is, for the jejunum and ileum, part of the mesentery and, for the duodenum in areas where serosa is lacking, part of the interface with the pancreas.

Primary tumor cannot be assessed.

Tumor invades the lamina propria or submucosa.

Tumor invades the lamina propria.

Tumor invades the submucosa.
T2
Tumor invades the muscularis propria.

T4
Tumor perforates the visceral peritoneum or directly invades other organs or structures (e.g., other loops of small intestine, mesentery of adjacent loops of bowel, and abdominal wall by way of serosa; for duodenum only, invasion of pancreas or bile duct).

Treatment of Small Intestine Adenocarcinoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Treatment options:
For resectable primary disease:
Radical surgical resection.[

,
2
]
For unresectable primary disease:
Surgical bypass of obstructing lesion.
Palliative radiation therapy.
Clinical trials evaluating methods to improve local control, such as the
use of radiation therapy with radiosensitizers with or without systemic
chemotherapy.
For unresectable metastatic disease:
Clinical trials evaluating the value of new anticancer drugs and
biological therapy (phase I and phase II studies).
Current Clinical Trials
Use our
advanced clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria.
General information
about clinical trials is also available.

Current Clinical Trials
Treatment options:
For metastatic adenocarcinoma or leiomyosarcoma:
No standard effective chemotherapy exists for patients with recurrent metastatic
adenocarcinoma or leiomyosarcoma of the small intestine.  These patients
should consider enrolling in phase I or II clinical trials evaluating new
anticancer drugs or biological therapy.
For locally recurrent disease:
Surgery.
Palliative radiation therapy.
Palliative chemotherapy.
Clinical trials evaluating ways of improving local control, such as the use
of radiation therapy with radiosensitizers with or without systemic
chemotherapy.

About This PDQ Summary
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of small intestine cancer. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.
Reviewers and Updates
This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Small Intestine Cancer Treatment are:
Amit Chowdhry, MD, PhD (University of Rochester Medical Center)
Leon Pappas, MD, PhD (Massachusetts General Hospital)
Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's
Email Us
. Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.
Levels of Evidence
Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board uses a
formal evidence ranking system
in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
