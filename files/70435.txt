Microbiome in Immunotherapy naÃ¯ve NSCLC Patients Receiving PD-1/L1 Blockade (MIP_NSCLC)
This phase IV study is hoping to determine if examining the microbiome in non-small cell lung cancer, immunotherapy naive participants can predict the effectiveness of immunotherapy treatment as well as determine ahead of time adverse events and their severity. In addition, the investigator will look into microbiome changing modifiers.
NSCLC Stage IV|NSCLC, Recurrent
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Microbiome
Microbiome difference between patients with and without AEs>=grade 3, Adverse events (AEs) will be graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Microbiome difference between responders vs. nonresponders, Treatment response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Correlation of microbiome to tumor tissue PD-L1 expression, PD-L1 expression is per standard of care using IHC, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Correlation of microbiome to diet, Customized Diet Survey, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
