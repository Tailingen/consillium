Improving Response to Chemotherapy by Adding Physical Exercise in the Neoadjuvant Setting of Breast Cancer Patients
One of the recommended treatments for breast cancer is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT), however, only 20% of the patients subject to this therapy present pathologic complete response (pCR). If exercise-induced tumour size reductions observed in preclinical studies translates to humans, physical training could emerge as a way of increasing rates of pCR to NCT, which would be a valuable clinical achievement. The present randomized controlled trial primary aim is to assess the impact of a physical exercise intervention the NCT efficacy. Following a parallel-arm design, 86 women with primary BC will be allocated 1:1 to a NCT + exercise (experimental) or NCT alone (control) group. The primary outcome is the rate of pCR in each group. Secondary outcomes include treatment tolerability and compliance, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, ki67, immune, inflammatory, matricellular and myogenic markers, physical fitness, accelerometry, quality of life and body composition.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise
Pathologic Complete Response, Pathological response as the primary outcome will be assessed by a blinded pathologist from the tumour surgical specimens after the breast surgery (post-intervention) and will be defined as complete, partial or no response. Besides pathological complete response (defined as ypT0/ypN0), groups will be compared as those with response (complete or partial) versus those with no response. The residual cancer burden which quantifies residual disease after NAC (post-intervention) will also be assessed., Post-intervention / Post-treatment.
