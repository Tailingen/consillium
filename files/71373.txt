Biomarkers for Angiogenesis in Renal Cell Carcinoma and Neuro-endocrine Tumours.
The primary objective of this study is to analyse the concentration dopamine and serotonin in thrombocytes of patients with renal cell carcinoma and neuro-endocrine tumours compared to the concentrations of these catecholamines in healthy volunteers. The concentration dopamine and serotonin in thrombocytes with and without medication will also be evaluated.
