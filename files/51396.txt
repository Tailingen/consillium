Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy Utilising Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring
The SPARK trial is testing the use of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring in prostate cancer patients being treated with Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy. The researchers expect this trial to result in better targeted prostate cancer patient outcomes with lower toxicity. The potential application of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring to other tumour sites will pave the way for additional trials with Australasian radiation oncology leading the world.

Accumulated patient dose distributions will be determined via paired controls by comparing the measured treatment accuracy and dose with KIM and those that would have been delivered in the absence of KIM, up to 36 months
Patient treatment outcomes determined by assessing Biochemical-clinical failure (BCF), up to a maximum of 36 months.|Patient treatment outcomes determined by assessing acute and late toxicity grade 3 or higher (using CTCAE version 4), Weekly during treatment, then two weeks, six weeks and 6 months post treatment|Patient treatment outcomes determined by assessing patient-reported outcomes, 12 and 24 months after treatment|The patient's perception of KIM will be quantified using an adapted SAT-RAR survey, an instrument that has previously been used to assess patient perceptions on technological innovations in radiotherapy and respiratory gating., up to 36 months|Targeting accuracy through measuring the final geometric accuracy with and without the KIM gating procedure, up to 36 months|Radiation therapists feedback on KIM will be quantified using a survey which will obtain specific information about the impact of the KIM system and SPARK on education, patient workflow, clinical impact and user confidence, up to 36 months
Most linear accelerators used to treat cancer patients today are equipped with fixed X-ray imagers which are typically used to take images of a tumour before a patient receives radiotherapy. A new technology, known as Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring has recently emerged which allows images of a tumour to be taken in real-time while the treatment is occurring. The advantage of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring is that it enables strategies such as patient shifting or beam shifting during treatment which could potentially improve the accuracy of the treatment and reduce the patient's side effects. In addition, due to the accuracy of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring in targeting tumours, the number of treatment sessions this group of patients will require will be reduced to five as opposed to the 40 sessions required using more conventional treatment methods.
