Clinical Study On Acute Radiotherapy-Induced Oral Mucositis In Patients With Locally Advanced Head And Neck Tumors
To explore a more efficient and scientific clinical treatment plan for acute radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis(RIOM/RTOM).it is hoped that the drug combination can more effectively improve the cure rate of acute RIOM,reduce the degree of oral mucosal injury and utilization rate of analgesic drugs,and reduce the occurrence of severe acute RIOM. Almost all patients with head and neck will have RIOM because of receiving radiation therapy.Studies have shown that the incidence of severe acute RIOM accounted for about 34% to 56%.There is no specific drug when acute RIOM is often accompanied by varying degrees of pain and infection in the mouth.Severe RIOM seriously affects ingestion through the mouth and doesn't conducive to the treatment and prognosis of tumor diseases. To further explore the efficiency and advantages of the combined application of Jeksung and anti-radiation spray in the treatment of acute RIOM at all levels,and provide more data support for relevant clinical treatment.Explore whether the Jeksung with combination of anti-radiation spray can effectively delay the occurrence of acute RIOM and delay the course of the disease.It will be expected to improve the quality of life of cancer patients ,reduce the occurrence of adverse events due during radiotherapy.
