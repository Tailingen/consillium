Study of ZG0895.HCl in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of ZG0895.HCl, and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ZG0895.HCl.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ZG0895 Hydrochloride for Injection
The incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as any of the following adverse events (AE) occurring from the first dose of Day 1 to Day 21, unless the investigator deems that the AE is clearly related to the disease progress or definitely due to an external cause. Delayed DLTs are adverse events that meet the criteria of DLTs that occur after Cycle 1. All AEs will be graded according to the US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), except for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Up to Day 21|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ZG0895.HCl, During the dose-escalation stage, if there is a first occurrence that â‰¥ 2 participants in a dose group experience DLT, then the dose level will be considered to be an intolerable dose, and the previous lower dose will be considered to be the MTD. The MTD group should have at least 6 evaluable participants., Up to Day 21|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), Up to 3 Years|Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Up to 3 Years
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator, Up to 3 Years
