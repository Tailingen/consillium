PDR001 + Panobinostat for Melanoma and NSCLC
The purpose of this research study is to find the dose of the study drug PDR001 that, when given in combination with the drug Panobinostat, results in the best outcomes for metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Melanoma|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: PDR001|DRUG: Panobinostat
To assess the safety and tolerability of PDR001 in combination with panobinostat in determining a recommended Phase II dose, The recommended Phase 2 dose will be determined by using a 3 + 3 design with 1 dose escalation and 2 dose deescalation cohorts. Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events, including serious adverse events, the monitoring of hematology, chemistry, ECG and the regular monitoring of vital signs, thyroid function, pregnancy and physical exam including weight and performance status., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) using CTCAE, Version 5.0, All adverse events (AEs) will be considered in DLT assessment unless the event is clearly unrelated to trial treatment. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 will be used., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time between the first dose of study therapy and the earliest date of progression or death (participants who have neither progressed nor dies will be censored at the most recent last-known-alive date)., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is calculated from time when study therapy begins to death from any cause., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, OS is defined as the time between the first dose of study therapy and death (participants who have not died will be censored at the most recent last-known-alive date)., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years
This is an open label, non-randomized Phase Ib study combining PDR001 with HDAC inhibitor Panobinostat in patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC who have failed prior Anti PD1 or PD-L1 therapy.

The primary purpose of this study is to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of Panobinostat in combination with PDR001. Standard 3+3 design will be used for dose escalation or de-escalation. Depending upon tolerability and dosing, the total number of participants may vary from 9-24. Initially patients will start from dose level '0' and there will be 1 dose escalation level '1' and two de-escalation levels ('-1' and '-2'). The maximum number in each dose level will be 6.
