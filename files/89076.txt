Developing Objective Fatigue Indicators in Colorectal Cancer Survivors.
The aims of this four-year study are to

1. Explore exercise behavior, exercise barriers, and identify the significant factors for exercise behavior in colorectal cancer survivors.
2. Explore the relationships among fatigue, muscle strength, and metabolomics and further examine the possible biomarkers from muscle strength and metabolomics for fatigue.
3. Develop a clinical guidelines of home-based fatigue management and exercise program and test its effect on decreasing fatigue for patients with colorectal cancer after surgery in Taiwan.
