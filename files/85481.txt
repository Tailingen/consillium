A Study of IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx), a B-Cell Immunotherapy, in Adults with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
An Open Label, Multi-Center, Dose Escalation/Expansion, Phase 1/1b Study of IMU 201 (PD1-Vaxx), a B-Cell Immunotherapy as monotherapy or in combination with atezolizumab with or without chemotherapy, in Adults with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (IMPrinter).

Safety and tolerability of IMU-201 graded per terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.00 (Dose Escalation), Safety and Tolerability Measures include: Frequency of adverse events (AEs) graded per terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.00., Baseline to Day 29|Identify Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) with safety/tolerability graded per terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.00 and Immuogenicity (Dose Escalation)., Safety and Tolerability Measures: Adverse events (AEs); dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) graded per terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.00. Immunogenicity data for IMU-201 includes PD-1 specific antibody (IgG) titers., Baseline to Day 43|Overall response rate (ORR) (Dose Expansion), Efficacy of IMU-201 will be evaluated by overall response rate at OBD of IMU-201 measured as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete or partial response., Baseline to documented progressive disease (Approximately 15 months)
Overall response rate (ORR) (Dose Escalation), Efficacy of IMU-201 will be evaluated by overall response rate at OBD of IMU-201 measured as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete or partial response., Baseline to documented progressive disease (Approximately 15 Months)|Progression free survival (PFS) (Dose Escalation/Expansion), Efficacy of IMU-201 will be evaluated by progression free survival at OBD of IMU-201., Baseline to documented progressive disease or death due to any cause (Approximately 15 Months)|Overall survival (OS) (Dose Escalation/Expansion), Efficacy of IMU-201 will be evaluated by overall survival at OBD of IMU-201., Baseline to death from any cause (Approximately 15 Months)|Duration of response (DOR) (Dose Escalation/Expansion), Efficacy of IMU-201 will be evaluated by duration of response at OBD of IMU-201., From date of earliest CR or PR until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause (Approximately 15 Months)
Exploratory Outcome: Humoral immunogenicity of IMU-201 (Dose Escalation/Expansion), Humoral immunogenicity evaluated by PD-1 specific antibodies (IgG, IgM)., Baseline to documented progressive disease (Approximately 15 Months)|Exploratory Outcome: Cellular immunogenicity of IMU-201 (Dose Escalation/Expansion), Cellular immunogenicity evaluated by vaccine-specific cytokine levels as well as analysis of regulatory and effector T and B cells., Baseline to documented progressive disease (Approximately 15 Months)
Investigational Medicinal Product, IMU-201, consists of drug substance, APi2568, which is a B-cell epitope (amino acids 92-110 from PD-1) linked to a promiscuous T-cell epitope (amino acid residues 288-302 from measles virus fusion protein) via a 4-amino acid linker (Gly-Pro-Ser-Leu), and combined with Water for Injection (WFI) forms the drug product, IMU-201, which becomes PD1-Vaxx when emulsified with excipient Montanide ISA 720 VG.

It is hypothesized that a polyclonal induced B-cell antibody response will be more effective or as effective with improved safety over current monoclonal antibody therapy.

This phase 1/1b study is an open-label dose escalation/dose expansion study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx). Phase 1 monotherapy dose-escalation of IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx), will enroll approximately 9-18 patients and establish the optimal monotherapy biological dose (mBOD). Once established, the dose cohort will be expanded to enroll additional 10 patients at the mBOD dose level. Phase 1b, a combination dose-escalation of IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx) with atezolizumab and with or without chemotherapy, will enroll approximately 18-36 patients and establish the optimal combotherapy biological dose (cBOD). Once established, the dose cohort will be expanded to enroll additional 30 patients at the cBOD dose level.
