Disease Control Rate (DCR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) is a set of published rules that define when cancer patients improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable") or worsen ("progression") during treatments.

Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as the percentage of participants with Disease Control best overall response (complete response, partial response or stable disease)and Objective Response Rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of participants with best overall Objective Response (complete response or partial response)., Imaging every 8 weeks|The Number of Participants With Best Overall Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) is a set of published rules that define when cancer patients improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable") or worsen ("progression") during treatments.
