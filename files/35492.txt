A Study of LDE255 in Combination With Azacitidine for High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients
This study is a phase Ib add-on study of the combination of LDE255 to azacitidine in patients without marrow response after at least 6 cycles of azacitidine.
MDS
DRUG: Azacitidine and LDE255
Safety of the combination assessed by evaluation of hematological and non-hematological toxicities at day 28 of cycle 1, 1 month
Clinical efficacy assessed by total percentage of responses, including all patients achieving CR, PR, marrow CR or hematologic improvement, evaluated according to IWG 2006 criteria after 6 treatment cycles, 6 months
Overall survival, Overall survival measured from the date of enrollment to death or the date of last contact, 3 years
Dose escalation of LDE255 will be performed over time using a rolling 6 design to determine the safety of the combination with azacitidine. The starting dose will be 400 mg. Azacitidine will be continued at maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Evaluation will be based on cycle 1 toxicity profile. Once MTD will be determined, 20 additional patients will be treated at recommended dose.
