An International Randomized Study to Compare SPIES Versus WLI
This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the efficacy between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Subjects in the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES assisted TURB, whereas subjects in the control arm (Arm B) will receive treatment with WLI assisted TURB only. Baseline characteristics will be recorded, as well as short and long-term follow up.
Bladder Cancer
DEVICE: SPIES+WLI assisted TURB|DEVICE: WLI assisted TURB
To compare the recurrence rate of tumor at 12 months following SPIES assisted TURB (Arm A) with White Light Imaging only assisted TURB (Arm B), 1 year
1. To assess the recurrence rate of tumor at short and long term follow up (3 months and 3 years) after SPIES or WLI assisted TURB in patients with NMIBC., 3 years|2. To assess the peri-operative morbidity (30 days) between SPIES and WLI assisted TURB by comparing the proportion of adverse events and using the Clavien-Dindo score., 3 years
This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the recurrence rates of cancer between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Randomization is stratified by tumor multiplicity (single or multiple), tumor status (primary or recurrent) and macroscopic findings (papillary or flat, where CIS is scored as flat lesion). Patients randomized into the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES and WLI assisted TURB, whereas the patients in the control arm (Arm B) will undergo WLI only assisted TURB. WLI is chosen as control, since it is considered the gold standard for detecting bladder tumors. Short and long term follow up will be recorded in order to evaluate the health gains for patients over a longer period. Perioperative (30 days) complications will be compared between the two treatment arms to evaluate the safety of SPIES.
