Vitamin D3 for Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Arthralgias
The primary purpose is to determine if high dose vitamin D3 reduces the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms associated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in women with early stage breast cancer and low serum vitamin D levels.

Number of Participants With Worsening of Musculoskeletal Symptoms (MS), Worsening of Musculoskeletal Symptoms (MS) is defined as any one of the following three events: (a) an increase by at least 0.25 in the Health Assessment Questionnaire II (HAQ II, a measure of disability from joint pain) score, (b) an increase in patient reported severity of joint and/or muscle pain, or (c) discontinuation from trial prior to 24 weeks specifically because of problems with musculoskeletal symptoms., Change from Baseline to 24 Weeks
The primary hypothesis is that high dose vitamin D3 plus standard dose vitamin D3 prevents the worsening of musculoskeletal symptoms when compared to a standard dose vitamin D3 treatment. This protocol will examine the relationship between vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and various quality of life measures in women being treated with letrozole as standard care for early stage breast cancer. All subjects received letrozole and a standard dose of vitamin D3 (600 IU daily). Randomization was between high dose vitamin D3 (30,000 IU once per week) vs. a blinded, matched placebo,
