A Trial of ASP7487 (OSI-906) in Combination With Bortezomib for the Treatment of Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized study. Patients will receive ASP7487 (OSI-906) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Phase 1 involves dose escalation of the combination, whereas Phase 2 involves the expansion of ASP7487 (OSI-906) combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone at the MTD to establish the ORR. This trial will accrue patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM - a disease state for which bortezomib is approved to treat by the FDA and Health Canada. The combination of ASP7487 (OSI-906) with bortezomib is supported by pre-clinical work in MM in which the combination with an IGF1-R inhibitor enhances anti-tumor activity of bortezomib.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ASP7487, Velcade, Dexamethasone
Maximum Tolerated Dose of the Combination of ASP7487 (OSI-906) With Velcade and Dexamethasone, * Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASP7487 (OSI-906) administered in combination with the recommended dose and schedule of bortezomib and dexamethasone;
* Phase 2: To evaluate the antitumor activity of ASP7487 (OSI-906) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone at the MTD established from the Phase 1 component., 45 months
The Phase 1 portion of the study will determine the MTD and DLTs of bortezomib administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle combined with ASP7487 (OSI-906) dosed twice daily orally continuously. The combination of ASP7487 (OSI-906) with bortezomib has not previously been tested. The active agent bortezomib will be used during Cycle 1 - 8 at the recommended treatment dose of 1.3 mg/m2 days 1, 4, 8 and 11 and Cycles 9+ on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 5-week cycle and ASP7487 (OSI-906) will be dose escalated form 75 mg to 150mg utilizing 3+3 design
