A Study to Evaluate Pre-operative HYPOfractionated Radiation Therapy in Aged (≥ 70 Years Old) or "Fragile" (≥ 65 Years) Patients With Limb or Trunk Soft Tissue SARComa.
This is a phase II, multicenter, non-randomized study.

The main objective is to evaluate the treatment with hypofractionated radiation therapy in neo-adjuvant situations on wound healing in a population of aged patients (≥ 70 years old) or ≥ 65 years of age defined as "fragile" and treated for soft tissue sarcoma.

A maximum of 48 evaluable patients will be included in this study. The patients will receive an hypofractionated radiation therapy prior to conservative surgery.

Each patient will be followed for up to 3 years after the end of complete treatment (radiotherapy + surgery).
