BREAST-10: Three-weekly Versus Weekly First-line Chemotherapy for Metastatic or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
Some chemotherapies, including docetaxel, are better tolerated and just as effective when giving the dose weekly rather than on an every three week basis. The purpose of this study is to compare 2 schedules of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel for the effects on quality of life. Standard every three week chemotherapy will be compared with weekly chemotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.

quality of life, during first 6 weeks of chemotherapy
Response rate, After 12 and 24 weeks of chemotherapy|Toxicity, every 3 weeks|overall survival, 2 years
Patients with locally advanced breast cancer and patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received an anthracycline will be treated with docetaxel and epirubicin.

Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have already received anthracyclines will be treated with docetaxel and capecitabine.

All patients will be randomized to receive their treatment either on an every three week schedule, or on a weekly schedule.
