ENGAGED 2 Study: Experiences With Mammography Screening and Breast Density 2
This trial will test a decision support web based intervention for women at increased risk for breast cancer due to breast density and other risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, history of prior breast biopsies), and to consider MRI and/or chemoprevention to manage their breast cancer risk.
Breast Density|Breast Cancer Female
BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care Arm|BEHAVIORAL: Personalized Web Intervention Arm
Number of Participants Taking Chemoprevention at 12 Months, Number of Participants who initiated chemoprevention is measured as receipt of any prescription for tamoxifen or raloxifene, based on health plan pharmacy data at any time from consent through 12 months., 12 months
Distress Related to Cancer Risk, Distress was measured with the item, "Please choose the number (from 0-10) that best describes how much distress you have been experiencing related to your cancer risk in the past week including today, from 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress).", 6 weeks and 12 months|Number of Participants Receiving Breast MRI, Number of participants receiving breast MRI was assessed using EHR data on receipt of breast imaging within network or claims data from outside imaging facilities., 12 months
Along with better-known risk factors such as family history having dense breasts is one of the strongest breast cancer risk factors. Extremely dense breast tissue affects about 10% of women, with an additional third having heterogeneously dense breasts. Women in these categories have 3-6 times the risk of breast cancer as compared to women with least density. Although breast density is measured on routine screening mammograms, it is not typically communicated to patients. This is changing as a result of legal mandates and approaches need to be tested to effectively integrate this clinical information in care. Therefore,we have developed an intervention to support decision making about cancer risk management (MRI and chemoprevention) for women at clinically elevated risk using a web-based intervention that will evaluate the efficacy of a web based intervention with personalized risk information communication versus usual care.
