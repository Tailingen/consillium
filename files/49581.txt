IV Plerixafor With Mitoxantrone Etoposide and Cytarabine for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
In this phase I extension study, the investigators seek to test the safety of both higher doses of plerixafor as well as intravenous dosing to maximize inhibition of the target, CXCR4.

In this study, we are seeking to target the leukemia microenvironment to overcome disease resistance. We hypothesize that by disrupting the interaction of leukemic blasts with the bone marrow microenvironment, we may sensitize leukemic blasts to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In current formulations, the volume of plerixafor required to administer doses higher than 240 mcg/kg may result in significant discomfort with repeated daily injections. In this phase I extension study, we seek to test the safety of both higher doses of plerixafor as well as intravenous dosing to maximize inhibition of the target, CXCR4.
