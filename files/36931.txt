Identification of Specific Molecular Signatures in Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Rhabdomyosarcoma Through Spatial Proteome Analysis Using Mass Spectrometry
This non-interventional study aims to develop spatial proteomics for analyzing small FFPE tumor samples in rhabdomyosarcoma. It will identify molecular signatures linked to tumor regions, subtypes, survival, and treatment resistance, using pre-existing samples and data.

Spatial Proteomic Profiling of Tumor Samples, Evaluate the ability to obtain distinct proteomic profiles from at least 75% of tumor samples analyzed, with a minimum of two distinct profiles identified per sample., 12 months (study duration)
This is a non-interventional, monocentric, retrospective cohort study aimed at developing a spatial proteomics analysis method for small tumor samples (FFPE) to precisely characterize proteins at the tissue level in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Using mass spectrometry, the study will identify molecular signatures associated with different tumor regions, histological subtypes, patient survival, and treatment resistance. The goal is to identify potential protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Data from clinical samples will be analyzed to find biomarkers correlated with survival and resistance to treatment. No patient intervention is required, as the study uses pre-existing biological samples and clinical data.
