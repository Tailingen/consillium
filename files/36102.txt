This is a randomized, parallel arms, open-label, multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIS793 with and without spartalizumab in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in participants with first-line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).

The study started with a Safety Run-in to assess the safety and tolerability of NIS793 in combination with spartalizumab and standard of care (SOC) gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Doses defined for each study treatment, as part of this quadruplet were administered in the Randomized part in the quadruplet/triplet/doublet-based treatment arms.

The Randomized part opened after the Safety Run-in had completed. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms:

* Arm 1: NIS793 with spartalizumab and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel
* Arm 2: NIS793 with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel
* Arm 3: gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel
