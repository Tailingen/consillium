Anakinra for the Prevention of Cytokine Release Syndrome and Neurotoxicity in Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Receiving CD19-Targeted CAR-T Cell Therapy
This phase II trial studies how well anakinra works in decreasing the occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and damage to the nerves (neurotoxicity) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who are receiving CD-19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy. CAR-T cell therapy may be complicated by two potentially life-threatening side effects: CRS and neurotoxicity. Anakinra is a drug typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but may also help in preventing CAR-T cell-related cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive anakinra intravenously (IV) \[previously subcutaneously (SC) for some patients\] over 10-30 minutes daily on days 0-13 and lisocabtagene maraleucel via infusion on day 0. Patients should also undergo at screening an x-ray, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) or CT, bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and biopsy (if clinically indicated), and lumbar puncture (if clinically indicated), and at follow-up as clinically indicated. Patients also undergo blood sample collection on study.

After completion of lisocabtagene maraleucel infusion, patients are followed up periodically for up to 90 days.
