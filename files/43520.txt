CFI-402257, a Potent and Selective TTK Inhibitor, in Solid Tumors and With Fulvestrant in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational drug called CFI-402257 alone in advanced solid tumors and in combination with Fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer patients.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Breast Cancer
DRUG: CFI-402257|DRUG: Fulvestrant
To assess the incidence of adverse events of CFI-402257 as a single agent and at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The number of subjects who experience an adverse event that was possibly related to study drug as assessed by CTCAE v 5.0., 48 months|To assess the incidence of adverse events of CFI-402257 in combination with fulvestrant and at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The number of subjects who experience an adverse event that was possibly related to study drug as assessed by CTCAE v 5.0., 48 months
Assessment of objective response rates, Objective response rate will be summarized by dose cohort and overall using the percent of patients in each tumor response category., 48 months|Assessment of objective response rates of the combination, Objective response rate will be summarized overall for advanced breast cancer patients, 48 months|Assessment of the pharmacokinetic profile of CFI-402257 through AUC, Area under the plasma concentration (AUC) versus time curve from time 0 to time of least measurable concentration tabulated by dose group., 48 months|Assessment of the pharmacokinetic profile of CFI-402257 in combination with fulvestrant through AUC, Area under the plasma concentration (AUC) versus time curve from time 0 to time of least measurable concentration tabulated by dose group., 48 months|To evaluate the effect of CFI-402257 treatment on changes in variant allele function, Changes in variant allele function will be measured by looking at circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid compared to baseline, 48 months
This study will be evaluating the safety and tolerability of CFI-402257 in subjects with advanced solid tumors and in advanced breast cancer. The study is designed to build on encouraging data from another study and to obtain further safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data of CFI-402257.
