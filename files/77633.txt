Study of Blood, Tumor and Adjacent Normal Tissue Samples From Chinese Smoking Induced Lung Cancer Patients
This is an epidemiological,multicenter study of genomic and expression profiles of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC.Two hundred and fifty NSCLC patients who fulfill the criteria are to be recruited by investigational sites.Approximately 100 of them will be from retrospectively collected samples with detailed clinical and 2-year follow-up information after surgeries.The demographics,cancer/adjacent normal tissue and matched blood sample will be collected after the patient had provided informed consent.All tissue samples will be analyzed for somatic mutations by exome deep sequencing,mRNA expression profiling by RNA sequencing and chromosome copy number variation by SNP array at the designated laboratories.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
whole genome copy number variation in NSCLC patients, To indentify and characterize somatic mutations in coding region (exome) in NSCLC patients through next generation sequencing of the tumor and blood samples.To identify and characterize whole genome copy number variation in NSCLC patients by using the standard SNP array(Affymetrix SNP 6.0).To indentify and characterize the transcriptome of tumor versus adjacent normal tissues by using RNA sequencing., 2 years
Establish more effective therapy for lung cancer treatment in the future, To identify the changes in molecular pathways and biomarker related to smoking induced lung cancer to help establish more effective therapy for lung cancer treatment in the future., 2 years
The 2-year follow-up information of all enrolled patients will be collected every 6 months.
