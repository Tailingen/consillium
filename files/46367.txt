Antithymocyte Globulin and Cyclosporine in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of intensive immuno-suppression with ATG + CSA versus best supportive care in patients with transfusion dependent low and intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: ATG + CSA|BEHAVIORAL: Supportive care
Best response rate (CR + PR), 6 months
Response rate at month 3, time to response, quality and duration of response, and proportions of relapse/progression in responders, 2 and 5 years after first response|Overall survival, 2 and 5 years|Leukemia-free survival, 2 and 5 years|Transformation-free survival, 2 and 5 years
This trial will answer the question whether immuno-suppression improves hematopoesis and reduces transfusion requirements analogous to patients with aplastic anemia as the short-term outcome, and whether immuno-suppression accelerates leukemic transformation and influences survival as the long-term outcome.

Primary endpoint: best response (CR + PR) rate at month 6
