Open-label, Single Center, Single-arm, Phase 2 Study of Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients With Stage 1 cT1b-T1cN0M0 Triple Negative Breast Cancer
To look at the effectiveness of the combination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in participants with stage 1 cT1b-T1cN0M0 Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
Stage 1 cT1b-T1cN0M0|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective To estimate the rate of pCR in patients with cT1b and T1cN0M0 TNBC after neoadjuvant therapy with 4 cycles of Pembrolizumab + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel.

Secondary Objective To assess the safety and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in participants receiving an anthracycline-de-escalated regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel and pembrolizumab by recording the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events.

Exploratory Objectives

1. To estimate the invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), and overall survival (OS) in participants with cT1b-T1cN0 TNBC that receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the setting of an anthracycline de-escalation study.
2. To explore if there is a molecular signature associated with response or lack of response to therapy.
3. To evaluate patient reported outcomes of participants receiving this de-escalated regimen.
