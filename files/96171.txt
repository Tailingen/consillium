A Study of MFA-370 in Patients with Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
This is a multi-center study of MFA-370 in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MFA-370, i.e.a combination of two approved pharmaceuticals today used within other indications. The combination was developed after the finding that a multidiseased man with e.g. muscle-invasive bladder cancer also was treated for his recent parasitic infection resulted in that the parasitic infection together with the cancer got a complete remission. After extensive experimental complementing studies a combination treatment called MFA-370 was developed supporting the rationale for this treatment.

This is the first clinical trial where the combination product MFA-370 is evaluated as anti-cancer treatment. Up to 50 patients will participate.

MFA-370 is taken orally once daily for up to 24 weeks. If the treatment is of clinical benefit for the patient, as assessed by the investigator, the treatment period can be prolonged to up to 2 years.

The patients will be monitored for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, tumor response by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 and survival.
