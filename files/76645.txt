Radiotherapy + Chemoimmunotherapy Followed by Surgery in Patients With Limited Metastatic Gastric or GEJ Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy followed by surgery for the primary and metastatic lesions in patients with limited metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The main questions it aims to answer are: 1) If the multimodal treatment which includes anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and local therapies will improve the survival of this group of patients. 2) If the multimodal treatment which includes anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and local therapies can be performed safely in this group of patients.

Participants will receive short course hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) for the primary lesion, HFRT or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for metastatic lesions, combined with systemic chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. For patients with HER2-positive cancer (defined as IHC 3+ or 2+/ISH+), trastuzumab is used along with chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody. Then, surgical resections of primary and metastatic lesions are performed as much as possible. For patients who need a widely invasive surgical approach or are inoperable, local ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MVA) can be alternatives. For patients undergoing surgical resections, postoperative treatment includes chemotherapy, which is determined by the researcher, and PD-1 antibody, which will be maintained until one year after surgery.

Overall survival (OS), The time from enrollment to death due to any reason., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 5 years follow-up.
No evidence of disease (NED) rate, Rate of no evidence of disease for one year, Assessed 1 year after treatment|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to preoperative multimodal therapy. ORR will be evaluated using RESIST1.1 by CT/MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 5 years follow-up.|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from enrollment to disease progression or death from any cause., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 5 years follow-up.|Toxicities, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events (TrAEs) reported between the first dose and 28 days after the last dose of study therapy as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 28 days after the last dose of study therapy|Surgical morbidity, Surgery-related adverse events (SRAEs) refer to complications which happen during or one month after surgery. Severe complications after surgery will be documented and classified by Clavien-Dindo classification, such as abdominal or GI tract bleeding, anastomotic fistula, pancreatic fistula of grade B or above, and incision complications (infection, bleeding, rupture)., During or one month after surgery|Surgical mortality, Death from any cause within 30 days of the date of surgery will be considered a surgical mortality death., During or one month after surgery
