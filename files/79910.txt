Immunomonitoring of Breast Cancer Patients During Systemic Treatment
This study aims to constitute a most complete biological collection for patients treated for localized or metastatic breast cancer (in different cohorts depending on the type of systemic treatment received), in order to describe the basal immune response of patients treated for a breast cancer according to the stage of the disease, but above all to study how the different systemic treatments used in the management of breast cancer modulate this immune response.
