Evaluating the Benefits of Personalized Traditional Chinese Medicine in Postoperative Treatment for Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This study aims to explore the role of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) based on syndrome differentiation in reducing chemotherapy side effects, lowering the risk of metastasis and recurrence, and improving survival rates in postoperative colorectal cancer patients through a prospective, single-arm interventional clinical trial.
Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer|Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy
DRUG: Adjuvant Chemotherapy Combined with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Supportive Therapy
The incidence of grade III/IV adverse events, According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, adverse events (AEs) are graded on a scale from 1 to 5 based on severity:

* Grade I: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; no intervention required.
* Grade II: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs).
* Grade III: Severe; medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADLs.
* Grade IV: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention required.
* Grade V: Death related to adverse event., From the beginning of the first chemotherapy to three months after the end of the course of chemotherapy
3-year Disease-Free Survival, 3-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) refers to the percentage of patients who remain free from any signs or symptoms of cancer recurrence or progression for three years after treatment., 3 years post-treatment|3-year Overall Survival, 3-year Overall Survival (OS) refers to the percentage of patients who are still alive three years after the start of treatment, regardless of whether the cancer has recurred or progressed., 3 years post-treatment|Completion rate of adjuvant chemotherapy, The completion rate of adjuvant chemotherapy is defined as the percentage of patients who successfully complete the full chemotherapy regimen within 6 months post-surgery, in accordance with the CSCO 2023 guidelines for colorectal cancer, From the beginning of the first chemotherapy to the end of the course of chemotherapy, up to 6 months.|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30) is a widely used tool for assessing the quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials. Each subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 is scored on a range from 0 to 100. Score Interpretation: Higher Scores:

For functional scales (e.g., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social functioning): Higher scores indicate a better quality of life. For symptom scales (e.g., fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting): Higher scores indicate worse symptoms or problems.

The global health status/QoL scale: Higher scores indicate a better overall quality of life., From the beginning of the first chemotherapy to three months after the end of the course of chemotherapy|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Colorectal Cancer Module （EORTC QLQ-CR29）, The EORTC QLQ-CR29 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Colorectal Cancer Module) is a supplementary tool to the EORTC QLQ-C30, specifically designed to assess the quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer. Similar to the EORTC QLQ-C30, each item or subscale in the EORTC QLQ-CR29 is scored on a scale of 0 to 100.

Score Interpretation: Higher Scores: For functional scales (e.g., body image, sexual functioning): Higher scores reflect better functioning and, thus, a better quality of life. For symptom scales (e.g., bowel symptoms, urinary symptoms, blood/mucus in stool): Higher scores indicate worse symptoms, reflecting a worse outcome., From the beginning of the first chemotherapy to three months after the end of the course of chemotherapy
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 1.9 million new cases and nearly 935,000 deaths reported in 2020. In China, colorectal cancer ranks third in new cases for both men and women, while it ranks fifth in cancer-related deaths among men and second among women. It has become a global public health issue and a major threat to people's health. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for colon cancer and can potentially cure the tumor. More than 50% of colon cancer patients are diagnosed at locally advanced stages (stage II and III). Even after curative surgery, about 50% of these patients experience tumor recurrence due to undetectable micrometastases that persist post-surgery. Most of these patients require adjuvant chemotherapy to eliminate micrometastases and improve cure rates. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy can eradicate hidden micrometastases and prolong survival in colorectal cancer patients. Large clinical trials have shown that adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the recurrence rate by 41% and overall mortality by 33%. Thus, surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard treatment approach to cure colon cancer.

However, about 25% of stage III colorectal cancer patients still relapse despite adjuvant chemotherapy, indicating that not all patients benefit from it. Additionally, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy can cause numerous side effects. The IDEA study reported that grade 3 or higher chemotherapy-related toxicities occurred in 20% of patients receiving 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy and 36.9% of patients receiving 6 months. These side effects include mucositis, vomiting, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, hair loss, hand-foot syndrome (pain, redness, and peeling of the skin on the palms and soles), neurotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. The incidence and severity of these side effects vary depending on the specific drugs and administration methods, and some side effects, such as oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy, can persist long-term, significantly affecting patients' quality of life.

Thus, both healthcare providers and patients are seeking additional therapies to reduce toxicity and improve the efficacy of standard treatment. In real-world practice, many colorectal cancer patients have received Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as part of their postoperative care, and TCM plays a significant role in colorectal cancer prevention and treatment.

In TCM, colorectal cancer is classified under conditions such as "zang du" (organ toxin), "chang ji" (intestinal accumulation), and "ji ju" (mass accumulation), primarily caused by irregular diet, emotional imbalance, and deficiency of vital energy (qi). Although the disease originates in the intestines, it is closely related to the spleen, stomach, liver, and kidneys. Early-stage disease is dominated by damp-heat and toxin stagnation, while later stages are characterized by a deficiency of vital energy with excess pathogenic factors, typically involving spleen and kidney yang deficiency, qi and blood deficiency, or liver and kidney yin deficiency. A deficiency in vital energy and yin-yang imbalance are key factors in the development of colorectal cancer. Damp-heat accumulation in the intestines leads to stagnation of qi, toxin formation, and eventual mass formation, which is a core mechanism of disease development.

This study aims to investigate the role of adding TCM during and after surgery and chemotherapy to enhance the clinical efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy, reduce the occurrence of adverse effects, prevent metastasis and recurrence, and ultimately improve survival rates.
