Improving Pre-operative Systemic Therapy for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Amplified Breast Cancer
This is a phase 2 study evaluating medical treatment before surgery in HER2-amplified early breast cancer patients. Patients receive chemotherapy with HER2-targeted antibodies and are randomised to receive the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab or not.

The 32-item MSAS scale includes occurrence, frequency, severity, and distress associated with each symptom using four- and five-point rating scales. Symptom burden is calculated as the average of frequency, severity and distress of each symptom. Higher scores indicates higher symptom burden., At baseline, after cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days), after cycle 7 (each cycle is 21 days), 2 months, 1 year and 5 years after surgery
The primary aim is to investigate whether the rate of pCR, after optimal neoadjuvant anti-HER2 based systemic therapy, can be increased by addition of atezolizumab.

Secondary aims are to assess safety and tolerability of this treatment combination, and to identify therapy predictive factors for the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus-minus atezolizumab with a backbone of chemotherapy, using modern molecular biological investigational procedures with analyses by repeated biopsies from an intra-patient longitudinal study design.
