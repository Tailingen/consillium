Feasibility And Efficacy Of An iPad-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation Program In Brain Tumor Patients
This pilot clinical trial studies how well an iPad-based cognitive rehabilitation program works in improving quality of life in patients with grade II-III glioma. An iPad-based cognitive rehabilitation program may help to increase patients cognitive function and quality of life, and may provide doctors with valuable information for optimizing care of patients with brain tumors.
Glioma
BEHAVIORAL: Device: iPad
Number of subjects who complete the intervention, Subjects who complete all of the intervention exercises (approximately 36 hours of intervention)., At 3 months after start of training|Patient-reported ease of use, Questionnaire based measure of ease of use as a measure of feasibility., At 3 months after start of training|Patient-reported user satisfaction, Questionnaire based measure of user satisfaction as a measure of feasibility., At 3 months after start of training|Change in attention, Evaluation of visual attention on the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test. The attention score ranges from 0 to 10 (10 = best performance), At baseline, 3 months past training start, 9 months past training start|Change in working memory, Evaluation of working memory using the NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test. Higher scores on each of these indicate higher levels of working memory., At baseline, 3 months past training start, 9 months past training start|Change in Quality of Life, Measurement of general quality of life (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), a multi-item questionnaire. Higher ratings suggest higher QOL., At baseline, 3 months past training start, 9 months past training start
Improvement on neurocognitive testing, Improvement on neurocognitive testing as measured by the NIH Toolbox assessment after the intervention., At baseline, 3 months past training start, 9 months past training start|Subjective assessment of cognitive symptoms will be assessed, Subjective assessment of cognitive symptoms using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) questionnaire, At baseline, 3 months past training start, 9 months past training start
