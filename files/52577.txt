MRCP Diagnoses EHCC Better When Combined DWI
Researching the diagnostic significance of Biliary Tract Neoplasm under combining DWI sequence with MRCP versus MRCP only separately.
Biliary Tract Neoplasm|Cholangiocarcinoma
DEVICE: 3T MRI
EHCC performance on DWI, ADC map and MRCP, Two experienced professors of radiology observed and analyzed the images separately. If there were discrepancies, the two professors came to an agreement by consensus., at the end of the study
ADC, SNR, CNR and SIR for EHCC lesion under different b values, The ADC value of EHCC in DWI under various b values was measured, and the SNR, the CNR and the SIR in DWI were calculated. The formula for calculating the ADC value was: ADC = \[ln (S1 /S2)\]/ (b2 -b1) , (S and b represent signal intensity and b value, 1 and 2 represent low and high, respectively)., at the end of the study
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of diffusion weighted imaging(DWI) combined with MRCP of 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of suspected malignant bile duct diseases. People with suspected Biliary Tract Neoplasm based on clinical symptoms (such as jaundice and thinness with unknown reasons) and CA-199 value raises are included.Diagnosis divided into two steps: the first oneï¼Œonly provide conventional MR sequences and MRCP images to make a diagnosis; the second step,provide the DWI images additionally, combining the image data before to make a diagnosis. Hypothesis is that DWI sequence should be regularly added into MRCP examination for improving diagnosis rate of Biliary Tract Neoplasm.
