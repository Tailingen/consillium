Olaptesed With Pembrolizumab and Nanoliposomal Irinotecan or Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel in MSS Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to provide a go/no-go decision for a randomized expansion study by assessing the disease control rate (DCR) at 6 weeks for the combination of olaptesed pegol on top of pembrolizumab and (Arm 1) nanoliposomal irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin or (Arm 2) gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, to assess safety and tolerability and time-to-event endpoints.
