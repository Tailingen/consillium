Evaluation of Salivary RNA in Subjects Scheduled for Surgery for a Gynecologic Pathology
GynRAN is an international, multicentre, transversal, diagnostic and non-interventional study carried out in gynecology-obstetrics/gynecological oncology departments that aims to identify a diagnostic signature for gynecological pathologies by analyzing of coding and non-coding RNA contained in patients saliva.

The study population consists of patients with clinically symptomatic females with one or more of the gynecological pathologies (endometriosis, adenomyosis, ovarian cysts, fibroids, ovarian/cervical/uterine cancer) and asymptomatic females.

The patients concerned by the study will be managed without modification of the care pathway, nor modification of the therapeutic indications, nor modification of the diagnostic or follow-up examinations necessary according to the context, which are carried out according to the local recommendations.
