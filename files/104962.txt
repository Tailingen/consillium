A Study For Patients With EGFRm (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutant) Lung Cancer
Phase 1 - open label, multi-center, non-randomized, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics dose escalation study of PF-06459988 as a single agent in patients with advance EGFRm NSCLC (del 19, L858R, +/- T790M). The resulting PF-06459988 dose selected from the phase 1 portion will undergo a series of sub-studies to fully characterize the impact of food, antacid and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers. The PK studies are in addition to the MTD expansion and will be completed prior to the initiation of Phase 2. Phase 2 is an open label, multi-center single-arm study of PF-06459988 for the assessment of antitumor activity in patients with advanced EGFRm (del 19 or L858R) NSCLC with T790M.
Advanced EGFRm (Del 19 or L858R +/- T790M) NSCLC
DRUG: PF-06459988
Number of participants with Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) (phase 1), The target probability of DLT at MTD will be 30%, up to 21 days|Number of Participants With Objective Response (phase 2), Number of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. PR are those as noted in the RECIST Criteria: Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions, Time from first dose of study drug to objective response of CR or PR up to 24 months
Number of Participants With Objective Response for those patients with measurable disease (phase 1), Number of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. PR are those PR are those as noted in the RECIST Criteria: Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions, time from first dose of study drug until objective response of CR or PR up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Phase 2, The period from study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact., time from first dose of study drug until Disease Progression or death (whichever first) up to 24 months
