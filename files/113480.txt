Evaluation of Polychemotherapy With XELOXIRI-3 in Elderly or Frail Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Current standard of care for patients with metastatic Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC) is chemotherapy, preferential regimen being FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). Due to more hematologic (neutropenia) and gastrointestinal toxicities, FOLFIRINOX is only administered in fit patients (age \< 75 years, ECOG Performance status 0-1, and bilirubin \< 1.5 ULN).

However, elderly or frail patients represent more than half of patients with PDAC and are treated with gemcitabine monochemotherapy. Maintaining more than one drug (polychemotherapy) may improve survival and quality of life in this population.

ALIX is a non-comparative randomized 2:1 phase II study. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of the polychemotherapy with XELOXIRI-3 versus gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy in elderly or frail patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC.
