Electrochemotherapy For The Treatment Of Breast Cancer That Has Spread to the Skin
Electroporation combined with chemotherapy (ECT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for breast cancer that has spread to skin. In routine clinical practise, ECT is offered to patients when all other treatment options have been exhausted. This study tests the hypothesis that early treatment with ECT may result in improved local control of skin metastases, improved quality of life and reduced health care costs. Patients are randomised to either ECT given as early as possible in the course of the disease or delaying ECT for at least 6 months.
