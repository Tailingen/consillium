Study to Determine the Efficacy of Uproleselan (GMI-1271) in Combination With Chemotherapy to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study will evaluate the efficacy of uproleselan (GMI-1271), a specific E-selectin antagonist, in combination with chemotherapy to treat relapsed/refractory AML, compared to chemotherapy alone. The safety of uproleselan when given with chemotherapy will also be investigated in patients with relapsed/refractory AML
