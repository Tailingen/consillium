Study of EC0225 for the Treatment of Refractory or Metastatic Tumors
This is a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of EC0225 in patients with refractory or metastatic tumors who have exhausted standard therapeutic options.
Cancer
DRUG: EC0225, for Injection (Folic acid desacetylvinblastine hydrazide conjugate)|DRUG: 99mTC-EC20 (Folic acid-technetium 99m conjugate)
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Dose escalation to the highest dose that can be safely administered to produce acceptable, manageable and reversible toxicity in no more than 0 or 1 of 6 patients
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, Obtained during the first cycle of therapy on Days 1 and 3|Anti-tumor activity, Initial dose of study therapy to disease progression|Uptake of 99mTc-Ec20 in tumors and normal tissues, 1-2 hours post-administration of 99mTc-EC20|Safety and tolerability, Initiation of study therapy through 30 day post last dose of study therapy
This is a Phase 1, dose escalation study of EC0225 administered by intravenous bolus (IV) during weeks 1 and 3 of a 4-week cycle to patients with refractory or metastatic cancer who have exhausted standard therapeutic options. EC0225 is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cells via a folate vitamin receptor. Experimental evidence shows that the target receptor is over-expressed in many human cancers. There are no previous human studies of EC0225; however, lab research (research in test tubes or animals) using EC0225 has shown activity against tumors in animals. This activity in animal models suggests that EC0225 may be useful as chemotherapy against human cancers. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of EC0225 given by intravenous bolus. The efficacy of treatment will also be measured.
