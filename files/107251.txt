In This Study, a Retrospective Analysis Was Conducted to Explore the Risk Factors for Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenal Surgery (PD) to Achieve TO, and a Nomogram Prediction Model Was Further Established to Promote the Standardization and Standardization of PD Surgical Quality Evaluation.
This study is committed TO exploring the risk factors affecting patients receiving pancreaticoduodenal surgery (PD) to achieve TO by retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients receiving PD surgery in Changzhou Second People Hospital from January 2016 to December 2024, and further establishing a nomogram prediction model. In order to promote the standardization and standardization of PD surgical quality assessment.

Achieve TO as the main ending, We expected TO collect 280 PD surgery patients, 262 cases have been collected, of which 158 cases achieved TO as the main outcome, the TO rate is 60.31%., from January 2016 to August 2024
As we all know, pancreaticoduodenectomy (whipple) involving multiple organ reconstruction for pancreatic cancer is known as the \&#34;surgical ceiling\&#34;, but because of its high postoperative complication rate and poor prognosis, a standardized surgical quality assessment system covering the whole perioperative period is urgently needed. The concept of the textbook ending was born.it first appeared in a 2013 study by Kolfschoten et al for colorectal cancer, in which textbook outcomes were evaluated in an all or none ,manner against six independent expected outcome measures: There were no deaths in hospital or within 30 days after surgery, radical resection, no re-intervention, no stomy, no serious postoperative complications, and no prolonged hospital stay. That is, when patients meet the above six indicators at the same time, they are defined as achieving a textbook outcome .In our study, the textbook outcome is the primary outcome, and the reverse is the secondary outcome.This study is committed TO exploring the risk factors affecting patients receiving pancreaticoduodenal surgery (PD) to achieve TO by retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients receiving PD surgery in Changzhou Second People Hospital from January 2016 to December 2024, and further establishing a nomogram prediction model. In order to promote the standardization and standardization of PD surgical quality assessment.
