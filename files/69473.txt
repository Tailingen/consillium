Chiauranib in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Ovarian Cancer
This clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of chiauranib added to chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory ovarian cancer, in the meantime, explore the pharmacokinetics characteristic after the combined treatment.
