Quality of life questionnaires, To compare the quality of life and patient-reported outcomes of the salvage chemotherapy arm with those of the standard regimen, from date of randomization through study completion, an average of 3 years|Perceptions of the patient-doctor relationship in patients offered bevacizumab/debulking surgery/PARPi, Measure of patient-doctor relationship: The Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire measures patient perceptions of the patient-doctor relationship. Participants rate the level of helpfulness, time, trust, understanding, dedication, agreement, availability, contentment, and accessibility of their healthcare provider. All nine items are rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (Not at all appropriate) to 5 (totally appropriate). Mean scores are calculated, and higher scores indicate a better perceived doctor-patient relationship., From 4-8 weeks after a decision on bevacizumab (approx. at randomization date) through end of follow-up (2-3 years after inclusion, depending on debulking surgery)|Satisfaction with decision-making process in patients offered bevacizumab/debulking surgery/PARPi, Measure of satisfaction with care: One self-generated item developed on the basis of the literature will ask patients in general how they would rate the care they received for their ovarian cancer treatment during the past three months, using a five-point scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). A higher score reflects a higher satisfaction with their care., From 4-8 weeks after a decision on bevacizumab (approx. at randomization date) through end of follow-up (2-3 years after inclusion, depending on debulking surgery)|Satisfaction with decision-making process in patients offered bevacizumab/debulking surgery/PARPi, Measure of decision satisfaction: The Satisfaction with Decision scale measures a patient's level of satisfaction with healthcare decisions.

A 10-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much so) will gauge perceptions of feeling hopeful, peaceful, grateful, comforted, connected, and content over the past week, presented as single-word descriptors. Mean scores will be calculated for each subscale, and a mean across all items will be derived to reflect overall emotional wellbeing. Higher scores indicate higher levels of emotional wellbeing., From 4-8 weeks after a decision on bevacizumab (approx. at randomization date) through end of follow-up (2-3 years after inclusion, depending on debulking surgery)|Treatment beliefs in patients offered bevacizumab/PARPi, Measure of treatment beliefs: For patients prescribed PARP inhibitors and/or bevacizumab, four items will be presented to measure treatment beliefs in relation to these treatments. These items are adapted from a Treatment Beliefs Questionnaire originally developed for patients with low back pain, which has been adapted for the current setting with permission. This self-report scale consists of four items assessing perceptions of credibility, effectiveness, concerns, and individual fit of treatment, which are rated on a five-point scale from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. Higher scores for each item indicate more positive beliefs about the treatment (with responses on the 'concerns' item being reverse scored)., From 4-8 weeks after a decision on bevacizumab (approx. at randomization date) through end of follow-up (2-3 years after inclusion, depending on debulking surgery)|Self-reported adherence to PARPi in patients offered PARPi, Measure of treatment (PARPi) adherence: For patients prescribed PARP inhibitors, a three-item scale will be used to measure adherence to PARPi and bevacizumab. Patients will be asked about the number of days in which they missed at least one dose of the treatment (answered numerically), the frequency with which they took their medication in the way they were supposed to over the previous 30 days (rated on a 6-point scale from never to always), and their rating of how 'good a job' they did at taking their medication in the way recommended over the previous 30 days (rated on a 6-point scale from very poor to excellent). Responses will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale for analyses, with 0 representing the worst adherence and 100 the best.

SALVOVAR is a pragmatic open-label multicenter randomized phase III trial (ratio 1:1) comparing the efficacy of the salvage weekly dose-dense regimen with those of the continuation of the same standard regimen as given during neo-adjuvant period. The randomization will be stratified on the main clinical prognostic factors assumed to impact the efficacy of the assessed arms and the overall survival:

1. Bevacizumab: planned administration: Yes, vs No
2. BRCA mutation: planned administration: Yes, vs No/Unknown
3. KELIMTM strate within unfavorable KELIM subgroup: very unfavorable \< 0.7, vs moderately unfavorable \[0.7-1.0\[

The trial will be pragmatic, as it aims at confirming the superiority of the adjusted chemotherapy compared to the continuation of the standard chemotherapy in routine clinical practice, in a population of ovarian cancer patients close to the real-life clinical activity with few selection criteria.
