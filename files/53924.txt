Carboxyamidotriazole and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Refractory Lymphomas
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carboxyamidotriazole and paclitaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or refractory lymphomas.

DRUG: carboxyamidotriazole|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with carboxyamidotriazole in patients with advanced solid tumors or refractory lymphomas.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicities of this regimen in these patients.
* Identify diseases for which this combination appears active.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) daily with paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 8 and every 3 weeks thereafter. Course 1 is 28 days and all other subsequent courses are 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment.

Sequential dose escalation of CAI is followed by sequential dose escalation of paclitaxel. Dose escalation in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
