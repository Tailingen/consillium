Measuring the Density of Iodine in Lipiodol Depositions: Detecting an Invisible Residual Tumor After Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
ABSTRACT Objective: To detect presence of a residual tumor in patients of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with Lipiodol based conventional trans arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) using density measurements on follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans Study Design: Prospective observational interventional study Place and Duration of Study: Interventional Radiology department of Armed Forces Institute of Radiology and Imaging (AFIRI) from April 2023-March 2024 Methodology: 96 patients undergoing conventional TACE were included in the study and followed up for residual tumor or tumor free status assessment using density measurement for iodine depositions using CT scan analysis and compared with gold standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Primary variables measured were comparison of enhancement scores between those with a residual tumor versus tumor free as well as the volume of iodine depositions in the arterial and venous phase between both groups. Sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan in assessing tumor diagnosis was compared with the gold standard digital subtraction angiography.
