A multicenter, open-label, phase Ⅲ randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab in combination with chemotherapy and low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) as first-line treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive Stage
DRUG: Adebrelimab|DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: low dose radiotherapy
Progression free survival, Refers to the time from the start of randomization until tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug, and every 12 weeks after 48 weeks, up to approximately 24 months
overall survival, Refers to the time from the start of randomization until death from any cause., From date of randomization to the time when the subject died from any cause, up to approximately 24 months|Disease control rate, Proportion of all randomised subjects whose best overall response (BOR) was rated as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., Every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug, and every 12 weeks after 48 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|overall response rate, Refers to the proportion of patients who have achieved a pre-defined tumor volume reduction (CR/PR) and maintained the minimum time frame required by the accepted response evaluation criteria (such as solid tumor RECIST Version 1.1)., Every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of study drug, and every 12 weeks (±7 days) after 48 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|Duration of response, Defined as the period from the date the tumor remission was first recorded to the date the disease progression was first recorded or the date of death from any cause., Every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug, and every 12 weeks after 48 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|Post-progression survival, From date of progression to the time when the subject died from any cause, From date of progression to the time when the subject died from any cause, up to approximately 24 months|adverse events, The incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAEv5.0), Baseline up to approximately 36 months|Serious adverse events, The incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAEv5.0), Baseline up to approximately 36 months
A multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy andsafety of adbelizumab in combination with chemotherapy and low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) as a first-line treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). At least 202 participants will be enrolled in this study.
