Gemcitabine With or Without Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without oxaliplatin in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: oxaliplatin
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with prolonged infusion gemcitabine with vs without oxaliplatin vs standard infusion gemcitabine.
* Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare the objective response in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the patterns of failure and progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the reported frequency of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism among patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the changes in quality of life, including improved symptom control and/or additional side effects of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and disease stage (locally advanced vs metastatic). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

* Arm I (standard treatment): Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by 1 week of rest for course 1 only. In all subsequent courses, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, with courses repeating every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 150 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on day 1 and oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 8 and 16 weeks.

Patients are followed for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 789 patients (263 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
