Molecular-Guided Therapy for Childhood Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (ability to be done) of experimental technologies to determine a tumor's molecular makeup. This technology includes a genomic report based on DNA exomes and RNA sequencing that will be used to discover new ways to understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with cancer in the future.

DEVICE: Guided Therapy
Days to Treatment Will be Used in Order to Determine Feasibility of Using Tumor Samples to Assess Genomic Sequencing Using Predictive Modeling to Make Real-time Treatment Decisions for Children With Relapsed/Refractory Cancers., The definition of feasibility is: Enrollment onto study, genomic profile, analysis and report generation completed, tumor board held with treatment decision, treatment review completed, start of treatment, and completion of 1 cycle of therapy., 2 years
Number of Participants With an Unexpected Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, To determine the safety of allowing a molecular tumor board to determine individualized treatment plans, Adverse Events were collected starting with the date of the first dose of study drug until 30 days after last dose of study drug, ongoing related adverse events were continued to be followed until resolution, on average of 4 years.|Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants by the Presence of Radiologically Assessable Disease by Cross-sectional CT or MRI Imaging and/or by MIBG or PET Scans., To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on Overall response rate (ORR) using RESIST criteria. The assessment of response will include the initial measurable targets and will be performed after cycle 2, then after every other cycle. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI imaging and/or by MIBG or PET scans: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease, At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements for measurable lesions, Stable Disease, Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to qualify for PD from study entry. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Followed until off therapy, generally 4 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Interval Will be Measured by Days and Compared to the PFS of Previous Chemotherapy Regimens Since Relapse for Each Patient., Time to progression (PFS), defined as the period from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met taking as reference the screening measurements. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements for measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment (nadir), and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions or appearance of positive bone marrow., From date of start of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 4 years
