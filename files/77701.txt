Sequence of Vessel Interruption and Circulating Tumor Cells in Surgical Lung Cancer
This study aims to define the impact of the sequence of vessel interruption on change in CTC and CTC clusters density in the tumor-draining pulmonary vein between the period before surgical manipulation and before tumor-draining vein interruption.
Circulating Tumor Cell|Lung Cancer|Surgery
PROCEDURE: Vein interruption before any other surgical manipulation|PROCEDURE: Arteries interruption before vein interruption
Changes in CTC density, Changes in CTC count in 7.5 ml of blood sampled from the tumor-draining vein between the period before surgical manipulation (first sample) and before tumor-draining vein interruption (second sample)., Within 96 hours after surgery|Changes in CTC clusters density, Changes in CTC clusters (or CTC micro-emboli defined as â‰¥3 contiguous CTC) count in 7.5 ml of blood sampled from the tumor-draining vein between the period before surgical manipulation (first sample) and before tumor-draining vein interruption (second sample)., Within 96 hours after surgery
Disease free survival, Disease free survival 2 years and 5 years after surgery and recurrence site (local or distant metastasis)., 2 years and 5 years after surgery|Overall survival, Overall survival 2 years and 5 years after surgery., 2 years and 5 years after surgery
