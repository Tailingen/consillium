Pharmacokinetic Trial of Decitabine (Dacogen) Administered as a 3-hour Infusion to Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of decitabine administered to patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Leukemia
DRUG: Decitabine (Dacogen)
Average Total Body Clearance (Calculated From Rate and Concentration), 3-hour IV infusion, every 8 hours for three consecutive days. Average Total Body Clearance was measured post first dose (Day 1), fourth dose (Day 2), and seventh dose (Day 3)., Day 1, Day 2, Day 3|Cmax (Maximum Plasma Concentration), 3-hour IV infusion, every 8 hours for three consecutive days. Cmax was measured post first dose (Day 1), fourth dose (Day 2), and seventh dose (Day 3)., Day 1, Day 2, Day 3|Tmax (Time at Which Cmax First Observed), 3-hour IV infusion, every 8 hours for three consecutive days. Tmax was measured post first dose (Day 1), fourth dose (Day 2), and seventh dose (Day 3)., Day 1, Day 2, Day 3|AUC (0-∞) - Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve Extrapolated to Infinity, 3-hour IV infusion, every 8 hours for three consecutive days. AUC (0-∞) was measured post first dose (Day 1), fourth dose (Day 2), and seventh dose (Day 3)., Day 1, Day 2, day 3
