Influences of Propofol and Sevoflurane Anesthesia in Brain Tumor
In the preoperative waiting area, the patients are randomly assigned and divided into two groups according to the allocation sequence table (corresponding to 1:1 randomization) generated by the computer. The propofol group was both induced and maintained at an effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2.0-4.0 mcg/mL by a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system. The sevoflurane group was maintained via sevoflurane vaporizer between 1% and 3% (target minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7-1.3). The following patient data were recorded, the type of anesthesia, sex, age at the time of surgery, preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score and functional capacity, the postoperative complications within 30 days (according Clavien-Dindo classification), American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA) physical status scores, tumor size, intraoperative blood loss/transfusion, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, total opioid (remifentanil/fentanyl/ propofol) use, postoperative radiation therapy, postoperative chemotherapy, postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the presence of disease progression, and 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year overall survival and Karnofsky performance status score were recorded.

The presence of disease progression, cancer recurrence after the surgery, From the date of surgery until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months"|Karnofsky performance status score, to access patients' functional impairment, Baseline (before the day of surgery)|Postoperative complications within 30 days, according to Clavien-Dindo classification, The period from the day of surgery until postoperative 30 days
During the operation, the dose of anesthetic drugs (propofol/ fentanyl /remifentanil and sevoflurane/ cisatracurium/ rocuronium) are adjusted to maintain the mean arterial pressure and heartbeat fluctuations within 20% of the baseline value and Entropy (or BIS) value at 40-60in both groups. The following patient data were recorded, the type of anesthesia, sex, age at the time of surgery, preoperative Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score and functional capacity, the postoperative complications within 30 days (according Clavien-Dindo classification), ASA physical status scores, tumor size, intraoperative blood loss/transfusion, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, total opioid (remifentanil/ fentanyl/ propofol) use, postoperative radiation therapy, postoperative chemotherapy, postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the presence of disease progression, and 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year overall survival and Karnofsky performance status score were recorded.
