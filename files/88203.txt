A Study Investigating the Outcomes and Safety of Atezolizumab Under Real-World Conditions in Patients Treated in Routine Clinical Practice
This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multi-centre, multiple cohort prospective study, with retrospective collection of prior medical/treatment history data from medical records, designed to assess the real-world outcomes and safety of atezolizumab for indications in the existing label in the real world setting of routine clinical practice.
Urothelial Carcinoma|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Small Cell Lung Cancer|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Overall Survival (OS), Time from index date until date of death from any cause. Index date is the date of administration of the first ever dose of atezolizumab for each patient., Index date up to approximately 6 years|OS at 2 Years, Percentage of participants alive 2 years after initiation of atezolizumab treatment., After index date up to 2 years
Time to Loss of Clinical Benefit (TTLCB), Time from the index date to loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the treating physician., Index date up to approximately 6 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from index date to death or disease progression (PD)., Index date up to approximately 6 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of participants who have a best overall response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). BOR for each participant is the best response achieved after the index date prior to initiation of any subsequent treatment., After index date up to approximately 6 years|Time to Response, Time from index date to first objective tumor response, CR or PR., Index date up to approximately 6 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Time from first documentation of CR or PR (whichever occurs first) after index until death or PD., Index date up to approximately 6 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of participants who have achieved CR, PR and stable disease at least 12 weeks after the index date., From 12 weeks after index date up to approximately 6 years|Duration of DCR, Time from first documentation of CR, PR or stable disease (whichever occurs first) after index until death or PD., After index date up to approximately 6 years|EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire Score, EQ-5D-5L during and after atezolizumab treatment will be used to assess HRQoL. Scale is from 1-5 (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems)., Index date or after ICF signature, & approx. at 6, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment; then at approx. 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, & every 12 months thereafter until end of study (study planned duration up to approximately 6 years)|Number of Paricipants with Disease Stage TNM and IUCC, At index date (Index date is the date of administration of the first ever dose of atezolizumab for each patient.)|Number of Participants at Each Level of Karnofsky or ECOG Performance Status, At index date (Index date is the date of administration of the first ever dose of atezolizumab for each patient.|Total Number of Infusions of Atezolizuamb, Treatment period until discontinuation (up to approximately 6 years)|Duration of Treatment With Atezolizumab, Index date until date of treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 6 years)|Time to initiation of the first subsequent cancer-related therapy, Up to approximately 6 years|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events, Up to approximately 6 years|Number of Lines of Prior and Subsequent Cancer-Related Therapies, Up to approximately 6 years
The study will be split into separate cohorts based on the approved indications for atezolizumab treatment, excluding cisplatin ineligible participants receiving atezolizumab as first line of therapy (LOT1) for locally advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer (locally advanced/metastatic UC). The study may be amended for inclusion of new cohorts as these are approved in the participating countries. Participants will be included into each cohort based on their indication for receiving atezolizumab.
