SGM-101 in Colorectal Lung Metastases
Near-infrared fluorescence-guided oncologic surgery (FGOS) with the use of a tumor specific tracer (SGM-101) developed by Surgimab can provide valuable intra-operative information about tumor location and extensiveness. SGM-101 already proven to be safe and valuable in colorectal cancer.

This study aims to prove feasibility for colorectal lung metastases.
