PTCy + Sirolimus/VIC-1911 as GVHD Prophylaxis in Myeloablative PBSC Transplantation
This is a single-arm, phase I/II, study of PTCy/sirolimus plus VIC-1911 to prevent GVHD and relapse after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT).

DRUG: VIC- 1911
Determine the optimal dose of VIC-1911 when given in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy in adult patients undergoing myeloablative stem cell transplantation., The optimal dose will be identified using the EffTox design. The proportion of patients with an average CD4+, pH3ser10+ T cell of \<54%. The minimum desired biologic efficacy is 65% of patients by day 21 (+/- 3 days) with \<30% of patients experiencing a DLT., 21 days post treatment|Confirm safety and obtain an estimate of long-term efficacy as measured by aGVHD assessed (Phase II), Assessment for aGVHD, Day 100|Relapsed assessment (Phase II), Assessment to determine if patient has relapse, 12 months
Analyze markers of mTOR and IL-2 activity cells, Determine the frequency of CD4+, pS6+ \[marker of mTOR activity\] and CD4+, pSTAT5+ \[marker of IL-2 activity\] cells, Pre-condition, before Day 1 (Day 0)|Analyze markers of mTOR and IL-2 activity cells, Determine the frequency of CD4+, pS6+ \[marker of mTOR activity\] and CD4+, pSTAT5+ \[marker of IL-2 activity\] cells, Day 21|Analyze markers of mTOR and IL-2 activity cells, Determine the frequency of CD4+, pS6+ \[marker of mTOR activity\] and CD4+, pSTAT5+ \[marker of IL-2 activity\] cells, Day 100|To determine the cumulative incidences of acute GVHD, Assessment of aGVHD, Day 100|To determine the cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD, Assessment of cGVHD, 12 months|Compare Graft-Versus-Host Disease-Free (GRFS) to the standard PTCY plus tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil regimen from MT2015-29, GRFS defined as grade III-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppression, relapse, or death by 1 year, 12 months|Compare duration of initial transplant hospitalization to patients age 18+ who received treatment on MT2015-29, Comparison hospitalization days with another trial's data (MT2015-29), 12 months|To measure Quality of life, Use quality of life questionnaire to measure patients' quality of life., Through day 100|To analyze the frequency of CMV reactivation and disease, Through day 180
Determination of the optimal dose during the Phase I trial is based on Dose Limiting Toxicity for safety and reduction of CD4+, pH3ser10+ T cells (phosphorylated histone 3 serine 10 is a biomarker of Aurora kinase A activity) for efficacy. Phase II will be powered to improve grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease and relapse after alloHCT, compared to historical estimates at the University of Minnesota.

Patients will receive myeloablative conditioning (MAC) with total body irradiation (TBI) followed by infusion of HLA-matched related or unrelated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on day 0. Cyclophosphamide will be administered on days +3 and +4. Sirolimus targeting 8-12ng/ml will begin on day +5 until day +365. VIC-1911 will be administered as 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg orally BID from day +5 to day +45 according to the rules of our phase I study. The lowest biologically active and safe dose of VIC-1911 will be identified as the recommended phase II dose.
