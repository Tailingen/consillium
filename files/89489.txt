Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Pembrolizumab With Other Investigational Agents in Participants With High Risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MK-3475-057/KEYNOTE-057)
In this study, participants with high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy and who are considered ineligible for or have refused to undergo radical cystectomy, will receive pembrolizumab therapy or pembrolizumab in combination with other investigational agents. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a clinically meaningful response.

Cohort A: Complete Response (CR) Rate of High-Risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), The CR rate of high-risk NMIBC is defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population whose tumors are in response to treatment and who are then free of high-risk NMIBC or worse per central pathology and radiology review., Up to approximately 6 months|Cohort B: 12-month Disease-Free Survival (DFS) Rate of High-Risk NMIBC, DFS of high-risk NMIBC is defined as the time from the first dose to the first occurrence of high-risk NMIBC or worse per central pathology and radiology review. The 12-month DFS rate is the percentage of participants remaining free from high-risk NMIBC or worse at 12 months., Up to approximately 12 months|Cohort A and B: Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to approximately 27 months|Cohort A and B: Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to approximately 24 months
Cohort A: CR Rate of Any Disease, The CR rate of any disease is defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population whose tumors are in response to treatment and who are then free of any disease or worse per central pathology and radiology review., Up to approximately 6 months|Cohort A: CR Rate of High-Risk NMIBC in Programmed Cell Death 1 (PDL-1) Positive Participants, The CR of high-risk NMIBC is defined as the proportion of PDL-1 positive participants in the analysis population whose tumors are in response to treatment and who are then free of high-risk NMIBC or worse per central pathology and radiology review., Up to approximately 6 months|Cohort A: Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR until the recurrence of disease or worse per clinical pathology and radiology review., Up to approximately 60 months|Cohort A and B: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose to progression to worsening of grade or stage or death or to muscle invasive or metastatic disease or death per central urology, pathology, and radiology review., Up to approximately 60 months|Cohort A and B: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first dose to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 60 months|Cohort B: DFS Rate of Any Disease, DFS of any disease is defined as the time from the first dose to the first occurrence of any disease or worse per central pathology and radiology review. The DFS rate is the percentage of participants remaining free of any disease or worse., Up to approximately 60 months|Cohort B: 12-month DFS Rate of Any Disease, DFS of any disease is defined as the time from the first dose to the first occurrence of any disease or worse per central pathology and radiology review. The 12-month DFS rate of any disease is the percentage of participants remaining free of any disease or worse at 12 months., Up to approximately 12 months|Cohort B: 12-month DFS Rate of High-Risk NMIBC in PDL-1 Positive Participants, DFS of high-risk NMIBC is defined as the time from the first dose to the first occurrence of high-risk NMIBC or worse per central pathology and radiology review. The 12-month DFS rate is the percentage of participants remaining free from high-risk NMIBC or worse at 12 months. The 12-month DFS rate of high-risk NMIBC in PDL-1 positive participants will be reported., Up to approximately 12 months
