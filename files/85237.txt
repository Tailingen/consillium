KTP Laser vs Pulsed Dye Laser for Port-Wine Stains
To compare the efficacy and safety of 532nm KTP laser and 585 nm pulsed dye laser for treating port-wine stains.
Port-Wine Stain
DEVICE: KTP|DEVICE: PDL
Erythema, assessment scale 1 - 7 (normal skin - dark purple) evaluated by physician and blinded investigator, at follow-up visit 6 weeks after last treatment session|area reduction, measurement using photo documentation, at follow-up visit 6 weeks after last treatment session
patient satisfaction, assessment scale 1 - 6 (very - not at all) evaluated by subjects, at follow-up visit 6 weeks after last treatment session
Nevus flammeus is a vascular, primarily capillary malformation visible from birth on. In rare cases, it may also affect venous and/or arterial vascular systems of the skin or other organs \[1\]. It occurs in 0.3%-0.5% of the population \[1\], i.e. in about 3-4 out of 1000 newborns, and is thus the most frequent vascular malformation in children. The cause is a permanent dilatation of the capillary vessels, which is caused by a lack of sympathetic nerve fibers or a lower density of the same.

First-line therapy of port-wine stains consists of laser treatment with the long-pulsed dye laser \[2\] with a wavelength of 595nm. Treatment must be performed at least 10 times at intervals of about 8 weeks and leads to lightening and reduction of lesions. In recent years, problems have often arisen in care of port-wine stain patients because dye lasers often failed due to the instability of technology, resulting in treatment delays. Novel long-pulsed KTP lasers may be a sufficient alternative to pulsed dye lasers in treatment of port-wine stains.
