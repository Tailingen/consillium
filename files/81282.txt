iDentification and vAlidation Model of Liquid biopsY Based cfDNA Methylation and pRotEin biomArKers for Pancreatic Cancer (DAYBREAK Study)
DAYBREAK is a prospective, multi-omics, observational study aimed at early detecting pancreatic cancer by combined assays for biomarkers of cfDNA methylation, serum protein markers, blood miRNA markers and others, in which of 450 participants will be enrolled. The development and validation of the model will be conducted in participants with early stage cancers and benign disease through a two-stage approach. The sensitivity and specificity of the model in pancreatic cancer early detection will be evaluated.
