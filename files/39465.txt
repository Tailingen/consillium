Early Detection of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Treatment Responses Using Multiple Magnetic Resonance Modalities
The purpose of this study is to determine whether dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) and high diffusion weighting MRI may be used to distinguish between favorable and unfavorable responses to therapy of glioblastoma multiforme. Imaging data will be correlated with histopathologic findings and clinical responses to radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.
