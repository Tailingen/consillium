Prediction of Dysplasia Within Sessile Serrated Polyps Using Endoscopic Imaging; a Prospective Observational Study
Study of endoscopic imaging in the detection of dysplasia within serrated colonic lesions \>= 8mm in size
Sessile Serrated Adenoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Endoscopic imaging
Dysplasia, Presence of dysplasia within sessile serrated polyps (SSP) using endoscopic imaging and congruence with histopathology, at the initial procedure when the sessile serrated polyp (SSP) is analysed by the endoscopist compared with when the SSP is analysed at histopathology less than one week later. no ongoing determination
Sessile serrated polyp, Determination of a specific polyp as an sessile serrated polyp (SSP), at the initial procedure compared with histopathology within 1 week. no ongoing determination
Observational study Structured endoscopic imaging protocol devised Applied prospectively to sequential SSP \>= 8mm detected in a tertiary endoscopic resection cohort Review of specimens by blinded specialist pathologists Review of incongruent cases by endoscopists and pathologists
