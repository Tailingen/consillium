Prospective Monitoring of Subjects With Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer Using 18FDCFPyL
Background:

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. The disease recurs in up to 50,000 men each year after their early-stage disease was treated; however, at this stage, imaging scans are often unable to find the disease in the body. In this natural history study, researchers want to find out if a new radiotracer (18F-DCFPyL) injected before positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can help identify sites in the body with cancer.

Objective:

To learn more about how 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans detect change over time in men with recurrent prostate cancer.

Eligibility:

Men aged 18 and older with prostate cancer that returned after treatment.

Design:

Participants will be screened with blood tests. They will also have a bone scan and a computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Participants will have an initial study visit. They will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will have a PET/CT scan with 18F-DCFPyL. The radiotracer will be injected into a vein; this will take about 20 seconds. The PET/CT scan will be done 1 to 2 hours later. Participants will lie still on a scanner table while a machine captures images of their body. The scan will take 45 minutes.

Participants will return for blood tests every 3 months.

Participants will return for additional scans with 18F-DCFPyL on this schedule:

Once a year if their previous scan was negative for prostate cancer.

Every 6 months if their previous scan was positive for prostate cancer.

Participants may be in the study up to 5 years.
Prostate Cancer|Biochemically Recurrent
DRUG: 18F-DCFpyL
Observation of 18F-DCFPyL lesions in BRPC, Initial 18F-DCFPyL imaging, every 6 months (+/- 8 weeks) for participants positive on imaging, and every 12 months (+/- 12 weeks) for participants negative on imaging until 5 years., baseline through 5 years
Progression on 18F-DCFPyL, Initial 18F-DCFPyL imaging, every 6 months (+/- 8 weeks) for participants positive on imaging, and every 12 months (+/- 12 weeks) for participants negative on imaging until 5 years., baseline through 5 years|Evaluate PSA doubling in association with 18F-DCFPyL changes, PSA test every 3 months (+/- 4 weeks) until 5 years., baseline through 5 years
Background:

* Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men.
* About 25,000 to 50,000 men each year develop a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive radiation or surgery for early-stage disease but have negative findings on computed tomography (CT) and Tc99 bone scan (standard imaging in prostate cancer).
* The recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging provides an opportunity to locate micrometastatic lesions in patients with recurrent disease.
* It is unknown how these lesions (or prostate cancer) evolve over time in men with positive findings on 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging.

Objective:

-To observe participants with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer for 5 years to understand the evolution of 18F-DCFPyL PET lesions in this population.

Eligibility:

* History of primary treatment for prostate cancer (either surgery or radiation).
* PSA \>= 0.50, and testosterone \>100.
* Age \>=18 years.
* No evidence of metastatic soft tissue disease on CT scan (or MRI), or bone lesions on bone scan.
* No androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), no systemic therapy within the 6 months before the study intervention, and no prostatectomy within 1 year before the study intervention.

Design:

* Eligible participants will have clinical evaluations and imaging studies. Participants with negative findings on initial/following 18F-DCFPyL scan(s) will be invited approximately every year (+/-12 weeks) for follow-up imaging studies (including 18F-DCFPyL PET scans). Participants with positive findings on initial/following 18F-DCFPyL scan(s) will be invited approximately every 6 months (+/-8 weeks) for repeat scans, not to exceed 2 scans per year.
* After the initial evaluation, participants will be invited to NIH approximately every 3 months (+/- 4 weeks) for PSA testing.
