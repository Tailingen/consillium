Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Adeno-IFN Gamma in Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoma
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a four-month dosing period of intra-lesional injection of TG1042 in patients with relapsing CBCL.

Patients will receive intra-tumoral injections of an adenoviral vector construct containing the human interferon gamma gene (TG1042), in an attempt to enhance immune responses with anti-tumor activity. This local administration induces tumour cell killing at the injected tumour sites.
