A Study of OMP-305B83 in Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an experimental drug, OMP-305B83, when given in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX. OMP-305B83 is a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Based on preclinical studies, it is believed that OMP-305B83 may block the growth of cancer stem cells and may also impair the productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread.

The study is sponsored by OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, which is referred to as OncoMed or the Sponsor.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: OMP-305B83|DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: FOLFOX
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) will be determined in patients treated with OMP-305B83 in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX, Subjects will be treated and observed for DLT through the end of the first cycle (Days 0-28).
Safety of OMP-305B83 in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX will be assessed by adverse event monitoring, physical exams, vital signs, clinical laboratory testing, ECGs, echocardiograms, anti-OMP-305B83 testing, and subject interview on an ongoing basis., Through study completion, an average of 8 months|Immunogenicity (in terms of formation of anti-drug antibod(ies) against OMP-305B83 in percentage of subjects) of OMP-305B83 in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX, Through study completion, an average of 8 months|Response Rate assessed by RECIST criteria 1.1, At 56 day intervals while on treatment, through study completion, an average of 8 months|Response Rate assessed by tumor marker CEA, At 28 day intervals while on treatment, through study completion, an average of 8 months|Progression Free Survival, Up to 5 years
This is an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study of OMP-305B83 plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of OMP-305B83 in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients will be followed for survival for up to 5 years. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase.
