A Study of RC48-ADC in Subjects With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RC48-ADC for injection in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with HER2 overexpression or HER2 mutation.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: RC48
Objective Response Rate （ORR）, Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 15 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents., 15 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 15 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is the length of time that a tumor continues to respond to treatment without the cancer growing or spreading., 15 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival, or OS, measures how long patients, who undergo a certain treatment regimen., 24 months
Adverse events (AEs), The drug safety was assessed by investigator(s) according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03., Up to 2 years
