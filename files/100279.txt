Phase 1 Study of BAFF CAR-T Cells (LMY-920) for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Therapy with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells has demonstrated activity against refractory lymphoma, however not all tumors respond or remain in response to CD19 targeted CAR-T cells. We posit that CAR-T cells expressing BAFF (BAFF CAR-T cells) can become another strategy to treat refractory lymphoma, even after relapse following cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) targeting CAR-T treatment.

This phase 1 study will evaluate safe dose and provide initial signal of the activity of BAFF CAR-T cells against relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma using a single lymphodepletion regimen and using a BAFF CAR-T cell manufacturing process.

LMY-920 is an autologous CAR-T cell therapy consisting of autologous cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) positive and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) positive human T cells that are genetically engineered using the non-viral transposon system to express the BAFF-ligand CAR-T that target BAFF receptor family members to eliminate malignant B cells.

BAFF receptor family includes B-cell activating factor receptor (BR3), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI). These receptors are present on non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The goal of LMY-920-001 phase 1 study is to find recommended phase 2 dose of LMY-920 for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
