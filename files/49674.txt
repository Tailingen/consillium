New York esophageal antigen-1 (NY-ESO-1) and LAGE-1a antigens are tumor-associated proteins that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using adoptively transferred T cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective responses. Letetresgene autoleucel (lete-cel, GSK3377794) is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell receptor engineered T cells. This is a master protocol investigating T-cell therapies. It will initially consist of a core protocol with two independent substudies investigating Letetresgene autoleucel in previously untreated (1L) Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A\*02+ participants with NY-ESO-1+ advanced (metastatic or unresectable) synovial sarcoma (SS) or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) (Substudy 1) and Letetresgene autoleucel as second line or higher (2L+) treatment in HLA-A\*02+ participants with NY-ESO-1+ advanced (metastatic or unresectable) SS or MRCLS who have progressed following treatment with anthracycline based chemotherapy (Substudy 2).
