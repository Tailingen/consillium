Study on the Safety and Efficacy of BST06 Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study is an exploratory clinical trial initiated by an open, single arm researcher to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of BST06 injection in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in subjects. This study plans to apply Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design, with at least 2 and up to 8 DLT assessable subjects in each dose group, who must complete a 28 day DLT assessment period. The study plan includes 2 dose groups: 5x10 \^ 9 and 3x10 \^ 10 BST06 cells
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Group A|BIOLOGICAL: Group B
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as the following adverse events related to the investigational drug(definitely related, likely related,possibly related) that occur within 28 days after administration of BST08 (using CTCAE 5.0 or CRS grading criteria): (1) hematological toxicity; (2) Grade 3 non hematological toxicity lasting for more than 7 days, or â‰¥ Grade4 non hematological toxicity, regardless of duration, but excluding the following situations; (3)Cytokine Release Syndrome(CRS), From the infusion (Day 0) to Day 28|Maximum ToleratedDose(MTD), The highest dose of DLT observed in subjects with less than 2/6 (at least 6 subjects in this experimental group received BST08 administration and completed DLT observation), From the infusion (Day 0) to Day 28
Main purpose:

Evaluate the safety and tolerability of BST06 injection in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in subjects.

Secondary purpose:

1. Evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of BST06 injection in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in subjects:
2. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of BST06 injection.

Exploratory purpose:

Explore the Pharmacodynamics (PD) characteristics of BST06 injection.
