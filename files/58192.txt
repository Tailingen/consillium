Safety and Performance of REGENERA Breast Implant in Women Affected by Malignant Breast Lesion Treated by Lumpectomy
The goals of this clinical trial are:

* demonstrate the safety of REGENERA breast implant in patients undergoing lumpectomy of malignant breast lesions
* demonstrate the safety and performance of REGENERA in terms of investigator's satisfaction, potential interference with current standard-of-care imaging techniques and occurrence of device-related serious adverse events.
