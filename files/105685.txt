Effectiveness of Low Dose Aspirin in Decreasing the Chance Getting Stomach and Intestine Cancer
In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about the effect of Aspirin taken as low dose (75 - 300 mg) in preventing stomach, colorectal and esophagus cancer. The researchers were interested in the effect by duration of aspirin use and the effect on the time since aspirin intake has been stopped in preventing stomach, colorectal and esophagus cancer. In addition, the study also looked into the time patients survived after being diagnosed (survival rate) with cancer and number of cancer patients who died (case fatality rate). The study was based on an electronic database managed by the Health Authority in Hong Kong containing anonymized clinical information of patients living in Hong Kong.
