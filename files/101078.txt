A Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Cios Spin and the Ion Endoluminal System for Pulmonary Nodule Biopsy
The overall objective of this study is to evaluate procedure characteristics of pulmonary nodule biopsies using the integrated version of Cios Spin and the Ion Endoluminal System.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Ion Endoluminal System and Cios Spin
Diagnostic yield, Defined as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the total number of nodules (or subjects) biopsied, Intra-procedure through the 13 month follow up period|Sensitivity for malignancy, Defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives for malignancy, Intra-procedure through the 13 month follow up period|Rate of tool in nodule, Tool in nodule is defined as any portion of the needle visualized within the target in all 3 axes (must be confirmed with 3D imaging), Intra-procedure
Total radiation dose, Radiation dose from biopsy procedure, measured by the dose area product (DAP), defined as the product of dose and beam area (Gy cm\^2), Intra-procedure|Time to achieve tool in nodule, Defined as the time the Ion catheter crosses the endotracheal tube (ETT) to the time tool in nodule is confirmed with 3D imaging, Intra-procedure
This study is a post-market, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study of subjects undergoing a pulmonary nodule biopsy using the Ion Endoluminal System in conjunction with the Cios Spin. The aim of the study is to evaluate the integrated version of the two systems. The primary outcomes of the study are focused on evaluating the procedure characteristics of the pulmonary nodule biopsy procedure, including diagnostic yield, sensitivity for malignancy, and rate of tool in nodule.
