Correlation Between SFRP1 and Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma
In summary, our study demonstrated the methylation sites of SFRP1 gene promoter in patients with colorectal cancer and adenoma and found SFRP1_16_17_18 CpG site was good performance as a diagnostic marker of colorectal cancer.
Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma
OTHER: no intervention
effectiveness of methylation markers from stool samples, assess the effectiveness of methylation markers from stool samples in colon cancer patients, colorectal adenoma patients, compared with normal volunteers, 3 years
assess the capacities of RF model in screening potential clinical biomarkers., 3 years
