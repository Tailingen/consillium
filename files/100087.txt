Nivolumab and Epacadostat With Platinum Doublet Chemotherapy Versus Platinum Doublet Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab plus epacadostat in combination with platinum chemotherapy compared with platinum chemotherapy alone, in participants with treatment-naïve Stage 4 or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
