Cadonilimab Plus Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for PD-L1 Negative NSCLC
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitor (Cadonilimab) combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for PD-L1 negative advanced non small cell lung cancer patients. And also explore the potential biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitor for advanced non small cell lung cancer.
NSCLC
DRUG: Cadonilimab
1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate, The 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate refers to the proportion of patients who are alive and without disease progression one year after starting treatment., 1 year
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival measures the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease without it progressing., up to 60 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival measures the length of time from the start of treatment until death from any cause, indicating the effectiveness of the treatment in prolonging patients' lives., up to 100 months|objective response rate, Objective response rate represents the proportion of patients showing a predefined level of tumor shrinkage or disappearance in response to treatment., up to 24 months|duration of response, Duration of response refers to the length of time during which a patient's tumor remains in remission or shows a positive response to treatment., up to 24 months
LungCadX is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, investigator initiated, phase Ⅱ study. Patients received cadonilimab (10 mg/kg, IV, every 3 weeks) plus platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin \[area under the curve (AUC) 5 mg/mL per min, IV\] and paclitaxel \[175 mg/m2, IV\] for squamous NSCLC, or carboplatin \[AUC 5 mg/mL per min, IV\] and pemetrexed \[500 mg/m2, IV\] for non-squamous NSCLC) for up to four cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with cadonilimab for squamous NSCLC, and intravenous cadonilimab plus pemetrexed for non-squamous NSCLC. The primary endpoint was 12-month PFS rate by investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, ORR，DoR，DCR, and the safety. Exploratory objective was to assess blood/tumor/urine/faeces tissue for potential biomarkers study. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and graded according to the CTCAE v5.0.
