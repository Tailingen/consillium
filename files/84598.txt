Safety Study of Imexon Plus Docetaxel in Lung, Breast or Prostate Cancer Patients
Protocol AMP-010 is a Phase 1b study of imexon plus docetaxel for patients with previously treated breast cancer, previously treated lung cancer or hormone refractory prostate cancer. Docetaxel is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a second line therapy for these cancers. The imexon is administered on days 1-5 and the docetaxel on day 1 of every 3 week cycle. The objective of the protocol is to determine the highest dose of imexon which can be given with a full dose of docetaxel, and to provide information to enable the design of a future study focused on one or more specific cancer types.
