A Comprehensive Prospective Assessment of the Physical and Biological Effects of Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (UTUC)
There are many controversies and limitations in the management of Upper Tract Urothelial cancer. A prospective registry is set up for patients in our hospital, aim to have a comprehensive prospective assessment of the physical and biological effects of Upper Tract Urothelial cancer in our patients

Although Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC) is relatively uncommon, the incidence rate is increasing. There are many controversies and limitations in the management of Upper Tract Urothelial cancer.

In this study, investigators would like to establish a local registry for upper tract urothelial cancer to facilitate the collection of clinical information and outcomes of upper tract urothelial cancer management, and to collect blood, urine and tumour tissue samples to investigate for new diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Hopefully, our registry can provide information regarding the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment outcomes of upper tract urothelial cancer in Hong Kong.
