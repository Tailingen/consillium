Accuracy of FNAC in Diagnosis of Thyroid Nodules
Detection of degree of accuracy of FNAC in diagnosis of thyroid nodules
Thyroid Nodule
OTHER: observe results of FNAC
Incidence of true positive results of FNAC after thyroidectomy, Accuracy of FNAC in thyroid nodules compared to surgical specimen histopathological examination, 12 days|Percentage of malignant thyroid nodules not observed by FNAC, Percentage of malignant thyroid nodules that FNAC fails to detect, 12 days|Incidence of false negative results by FNAC, False negative that diagnosed by FNAC not malignant but proved malignancy after surgical excision, 12 days|Percentage of total number of true results of FNAC to the total number of cases, Accuracy of FNAC, 12 days
Accuracy in diagnosis in any case is required, and this is beneficial to the patient and the physician, and with the development that currently exists and the trend to use less invasive techniques, accuracy of FNAC should be studied well.1.Thyroid nodules are common and the principal method of diagnosis is fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).2. Can investigators depend on FNAC alone in diagnosis of thyroid nodule in the future?!3. In this study, investigators will compare the results of (FNAC) versus (Biopsy) in diagnosis of thyroid nodule in AUH , to detect the degree of accuracy of FNAC.4. FNAC is a simple, safe, cost-effective and accurate diagnostic tool for the initial screening of patients with thyroid nodules.5. Background Routine application of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has decreased unnecessary referral of thyroid nodules for surgical treatment and has also increased the cancer rates found in surgery materials. Success of thyroid FNAC depends on skilled aspiration, skilled cytological interpretation and rational analysis of cytological and clinical data. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy rates of thyroid FNAC results obtained in our hospital.6. The FNAC is a sensitive, specific, and accurate initial diagnostic test for the preoperative evaluation of patients with thyroid swellings in our setting as well. The correlation of cytological and histopathological diagnoses is an important quality assurance method, as it allows cytopathologists to calculate their false-positive and false negative results.7
