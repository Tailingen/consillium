Safety and Immune Response to a Multi-component Immune Based Therapy (MKC1106-PP) for Patients With Advanced Cancer.
The present clinical trial is a dose comparison of a multi-component active immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune reaction to specific tumor associated antigens which are highly expressed on a large number of solid cancers.

To determine the immunologic response to the treatment with MKC1106-PP regimen and 2) to determine the safety and adverse event profile of MKC1106-PP, Every 6 Weeks
to determine the blood plasmid levels by PCR analysis, Every 6 Weeks|measure cytokine levels, Every 6 Weeks|to describe any objective tumor responses to the treatment with MKC1106-PP, Every 6 Weeks
The majority of tumors are ignored by the immune system and it was thought for a long time that tumor antigens did not exist. However, recently a number of tumor antigens have been described. These antigens reside on cancer cells and can be recognized by specific T-cells which can ultimately attack and destroy the tumor.
