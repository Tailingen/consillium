Stereotactic Body Radiation and Monoclonal Antibody to OX40 (MEDI6469) in Breast Cancer Patients With Metastatic Lesions
This study will test the investigational antibody, MEDI6469 (anti-OX40), in combination with stereotactic body radiation in breast cancer patients that have liver or lung metastases and have received systemic therapy and have progressive disease. The investigators hypothesize that SBRT directed at metastatic breast cancer lesions will result in a systemic anti-tumor immune system response. This amplified and directed immune response could result in anti-tumor responses.

Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of radiation administered in combination with anti-OX40 in patients with metastatic breast cancer., A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any greater than or equal to grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except hypothyroidism or vitiligo) that in the opinion of the investigator is considered at least possibly related to treatment. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities that take longer than 10 days to resolve will be considered DLTs. Patients will have 8 clinic visits over 36 days to identify toxicities., From Day 1 to Day 36
Estimate the response rate of combined modality treatment in both irradiated and non-irradiated tumors., Patients will have CT scans for tumor measurements at Day 36. Patients achieving a radiographic response, or are stable, will be followed monthly with physical exam and laboratory studies with CT (or other imaging as deemed appropriate) scans obtained every 3 months (± 2 weeks) for up to 24 months and then ever 6 months (± 2 weeks) for up to 4 years., Day 36
Determine the influence of anti-OX40 and radiation on circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells., Patients will provide 9 blood samples over 36 days to measure the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells., Screening to Day 36
Patients will receive one of three different doses of SBRT depending on which cohort they are in. The doses are:

Cohort 1: 15 Gy (central tumors 10 Gy); Cohort 2: 20 Gy (central tumors 15 Gy); Cohort 3: 20 Gy x 2 (central tumors 15 Gy x 2).

In addition, all patients will receive three doses of MEDI6469. MEDI6469 is administered at 0.4 mg/kg IV over 60 minutes using in-line filter on Days 1, 3, and 5.
