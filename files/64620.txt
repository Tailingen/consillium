SHR - A1811 Versus Chemotherapy for Platinum-resistant Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This study is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter phase III clinical trial.

It is planned to enroll 300 subjects with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with HER2 expression. The randomization will be stratified according to the following factors: 1) HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression status (HER2 IHC 1+ versus HER2 IHC 2+/3+); 2) whether the subject has previously received vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) inhibitors such as bevacizumab (yes versus no).

Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the experimental treatment group (SHR - A1811) or the control treatment group (chemotherapy chosen by the investigator, namely liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, topotecan, or gemcitabine).
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: SHR-A1811|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival, Progression - Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by the Independent Radiological Review Committee (IRC) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). It is defined as the time from the randomization date of the subject to the first date of documented radiological tumor progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 5 Years after treatment.
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the randomization date to death due to any cause in subjects., 5 Years after treatment.|Objective Response Rate (ORR):, Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). For responses categorized as CR or PR, confirmation is required through a subsequent evaluation performed no less than 4 weeks (â‰¥28 days) after the initial assessment., 5 Years after treatment.|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined as the time from the first date a subject is assessed as having a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to the first date of either Progressive Disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 5 Years after treatment.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., 5 Years after treatment.|Response Rate (RR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with an overall response assessed as either a response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or a response according to the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA - 125 criteria., 5 Years after treatment.|CA - 125 Response Rate (CA - 125 RR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with a response evaluated according to the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA - 125 criteria., 5 Years after treatment.
