Study of PM060184 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PM060184.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: PM060184
MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and RD (recommended dose) of PM060184., To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM060184 administered on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle intravenously (i.v.) over 10 minutes to patients with advanced solid tumors., From treatment onset to end of treatment
To determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients who have advanced solid tumors., The complete plasma concentration-time profiles of PM06184 will be analyzed by standard non-compartmental methods.The percent of PM060184 total dose excreted unchanged into the urine over the collection interval will be calculated from the urine samples., Blood samples will be collected up to 48 hours after the first infusion. At the RD, 24-h urine collection samples and 15 additional blood samples up to 48 hours after the second infusion of the first cycle.|Antitumor activity, Antitumor activity will be measured according to the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) version 1.1 or by evaluation of tumor markers, Every six weeks while on treatment. Patients who discontinued treatment without disease progression will be followed every three months until disease progression, other antitumor therapy, death or until the end-of-study date, whichever occurs first.
This trial intends to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose, to evaluate the safety and tolerability, to determine the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate the antitumor activity of PM060184 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
