Blood Draw Validation for Ciprofloxacin Pharmacokinetic Research in Pediatric Cancer Patients
To validate blood draws via a central venous catheter (Port A Cath Â®) for pharmacokinetic studies of ciprofloxacin in patients under treatment for childhood cancer.
Childhood Cancer|Neutropenia
OTHER: Ciprofloxacin administration
Correlation between ciprofloxacin concentration drawn via Port a Cath (PAC) versus capillary/venous punction, 1 hour
The concentration of cipro will be determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Unbound concentration will be determined by adjusting the pH of the plasma samples to physiological pH (7.4) in a CO2 incubator, followed by ultrafiltration and extraction of ciprofloxacin from the ultrafiltrate (as described above) prior to injection onto the HPLC system.
