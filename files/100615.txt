Effect of Mirabegron on Promoting Brown Adipose Tissue Activation
In previous preclinical studies, our group found that Mirabegron, a clinical drug, could activate brown adipose tissue and inhibit tumor growth in tumour-bearing mice.Investigators look forward to further evaluating the effect of Mirabegron-mediated brown adipose tissue activation, so as to provide new drug applications for clinical cancer prevention and treatment
