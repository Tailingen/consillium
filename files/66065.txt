Physical Activity Levels and Functional Improvement in Breast Cancer Survivors
The main objective of our project is to describe what characteristics (e.g., age, current physical activity level) women present when starting the exercise program are potentially associated with an improvement in functional abilities measured with different tests such as the distance you can cover while walking for six minutes.

The main research objective is to investigate the relationship between baseline physical activity and improvement in physical function, quantified using changes in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) results over the course of the 12-week program. An association is hypothesized to exist between the two variables even when adjusted for weeks into treatment. The goal of the 6MWT is to cover as much distance as possible in six minutes, using as many breaks s necessary. The test is often performed using a 20-meter hallway but requires no specific equipment. A recent study reported that the result of the 6MWT could be used as a measure of the major components of global health in women with breast cancer, making its use in our research especially relevant. Aside from physical functions, baseline characteristics will also be used to determine what characteristics, if any, are associated with health and psychosocial outcomes such as quality of life, social connectedness/support, and mental well-being. The data collected is certain to fill a gap in the literature, and will therefore be likely published in an important journal in the field.
