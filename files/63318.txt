Nivolumab With Ipilimumab in Subjects With Neuroendocrine Tumors
This is a single arm open-label design study looking at Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in patients with Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors. Patients will be dosed Nivolumab 240mg IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W) and Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV over 30 minutes every 6 weeks (Q6W). One cycle will include 3 doses of Nivolumab and 1 dose of Ipilimumab. The objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate of combination Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Durability of response, and progression free survival (PFS) will also be described.

Subjects with progressive, non-functional advanced or metastatic thoracic, GI or pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have few treatment options. The only FDA approved treatment regimen offers little response potential. In currently unpublished data with inhibitory immune checkpoint agents, patients with NET have shown promising clinical benefit. This therapy offers a novel approach to potentially provide long term benefit, but must be further explored. The safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab is characterized by immune-related toxicities, such as diarrhea, rash, pneumonitis, liver toxicity, and endocrinopathies (Nivolumab, Ipilimumab Investigator's Brochures). The frequencies and intensities of these events in the combination are variable and depend on the specific doses and schedule used. In the dosing schedules selected, these events were mostly low grade and manageable with the use of corticosteroids. Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy has shown improved efficacy over either agent alone in melanoma. Rationale for Single Arm Design This study will use a single arm open-label design. The objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate of combination nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Durability of response, and PFS will also be described.
