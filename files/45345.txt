Lung Cancer
OTHER: biologic sample preservation procedure
Establishment of a central lung cancer specimen repository to serve as a resource for current and future scientific studies, From date of study activation to consolidation of specimen banks|Correlation of clinicopathologic information in the Southwest Oncology Group clinical data base with results of studies using the repository, From date of study activation to consolidation of specimen banks|Test of new hypotheses with the specimens in the repository, From date of study activation to consolidation of specimen banks
OBJECTIVES:

* Establish a central lung cancer specimen repository to serve as a resource for current and future scientific studies.
* Correlate clinicopathologic information in the Southwest Oncology Group clinical data base with results of studies using the repository.
* Test new hypotheses with the specimens in the repository.

OUTLINE: Peripheral blood, sputum, and biopsy specimens are collected from patients. Tissue samples are frozen and stored in a lung cancer specimen repository for later use in correlative studies.
