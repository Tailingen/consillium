A Study of Prevalence of HER3 Expression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
There is currently a lack of published HER3 expression prevalence data among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The estimation of HER3 expression prevalence in this population using archival tissue samples and the assessment of associated patient characteristics in real world (RW) data will ultimately inform clinical strategy and increase awareness among health care providers (HCPs) and the greater medical community to improve patient care.

HER3 Expression Prevalence Estimate for the NSCLC Population, Overall, The overall HER3 expression prevalence estimate will be reported., 6 months|HER3 Expression Prevalence Estimate for the NSCLC Population, by Subgroup, HER3 expression prevalence estimate will be reported by subgroup, including age, gender, smoking status, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status, AGA status, ethnicity, and location of biopsy., 6 months|HER3 Expression Prevalence Estimate for the NSCLC Population Before and After Treatment, by Patient Subpopulation, HER3 expression prevalence estimate before and after treatment will be reported by patient subpopulation (EGFRm NSCLC previously treated with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI, ALK+ NSCLC, NSCLC harboring a KRAS p.G12C mutation or EGFR exon 20 insertion)., 6 months
The purpose of this study is to use archival tissue samples and RW data to generate HER3 expression prevalence data within the NSCLC population and by patient characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, histology, smoking status, age, prior treatment, etc.).

The primary objective of the study will analyze and assess archival tissue specimens and associated RW data to:

* Increase the understanding of HER3 expression in NSCLC among HCPs and the medical community
* Generate evidence to support future clinical strategies in this area
