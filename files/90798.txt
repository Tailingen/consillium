(1)The efficacy of the regimen is evaluated by objective remission rate, disease control rate, progress free survival, duration of remission, overall survival, time to progression.

Safety is monitored by vital signs, blood routine test, liver function, kidney function and electrolytes level, ECG, and cardiac ultrasonography.

All the data is documented by CRF form, and carefully preserved.
