Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Anti-CDH17 CAR-T Cell Therapy in Patients with CDH17-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of anti-CDH17 CAR-T cells in patients with CDH17-positive advanced solid tumors.
CDH17-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cells infusion
Incidence of adverse events(AE) after infusion, The frequency, severity, and laboratory findings of all adverse events/serious adverse events are included.Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome are graded by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria., within 52 weeks post-infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., within 52 weeks post-infusion|Concentration of CAR-T cells, Concentration of CAR-T cells measured by Flow cytometry after CAR-T infusion, Days 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35 and weeks 6, 12, 18, 26, 34, 42, 52 after infusion|Progression-free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival(PFS) refers to the time from cell reinfusion to the first assessment of tumor progression or death from any cause., within 52 weeks post-infusion|Overall survival(OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the time the patient received an infusion of CAR-T cells until death (from any cause)., within 52 weeks post-infusion
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of anti-CDH17 CAR-T cells in patients with CDH17-positive advanced solid tumors.A leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture Anti-CDH17 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells. Prior to Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cells infusion subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. After infusion, the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy was evaluated by investigators.
