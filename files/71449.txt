Evaluation of New Diagnostic Tool Using Fluorescence to Detect High-grade Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia
This study is a single-center propsective clinical trial to assess the ability of fluorescence techniques to mark high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias including high-grade vulvar squamous intraepithelial lesions and differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias following 3 hours Metvixia application.

Evaluation of the success of the photodynamic diagnosis, Percentage of patients for whom the procedure successfully demonstrated high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias in fluorescence confirmed by biopsy.

A patient will be considered successful if the presence or absence of fluorescence is consistent with the anatomo-pathological result, that means if her sample in the fluorescent area is positive in pathology and her sample in the non-fluorescent area is negative in anatomo-pathology.

For a patient with no fluorescent labeling, the pathological results of her two samples must be negative for the patient to be considered successful. For a patient where the entire area fluoresces, the anatomo-pathological result of her two samples must be positive for the patient to be considered successful., 14 days (+/- 4 days) after the photodiagnosis
Sensitivity of the photodynamic diagnosis, The sensitivity will correspond to the number of fluorescent zones among the positive zones in anatomopathology., 14 days (+/- 4 days) after the photodiagnosis|Specifity of the photodynamic diagnosis, The specificity will correspond to the number of non-fluorescent zones among the negative zones in anatomo-pathology., 14 days (+/- 4 days) after the photodiagnosis|Intensity of flurescence evaluation, The fluorescence intensity will be measured by the signal to noise ratio, also called SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) on photographie, The day of the photo analysis with a specific software|Tolerance evaluation, The tolerance of the application will be assessed by the number of grade 3 to 5 toxicity. The toxicity will be evaluated using the CTCAE v5 scale (Common Terminology for Adverse Events). The different grade on this scale is 1 to 5 (1 correspond to a asymptomatic or mild symptome, 2 to moderate toxicity, 3 to severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening toxicity, 4 to life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated and 5 to the death related to the toxicity., At inclusion, after applying the cream for 3 hours, before and immediately after the blue light exposition and at and the final study visite (14 days +/- 4 after the photodiagnosis)|Pain Evaluation, Pain will be assessed using a numerical scale from 0 to 10 (0 corresponds to no pain and 10 to maximum pain), At inclusion, 1 hour after Metvixia application, before and immediately after the blue light exposition and at and the final study visite (14 days +/- 4 after the inclusion)
This study is a single-center propsective clinical trial to assess the ability of fluorescence techniques to mark high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias including high-grade vulvar squamous intraepithelial lesions and differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias following 3 hours Metvixia application.
