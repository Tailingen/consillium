Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Months, PFS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of objective disease progression (as per RECIST) or the date of death (from any cause) in the absence of objective disease progression. The median PFS in months is presented here., Tumour assessments as per RECIST were performed at baseline and then every 42 days ± 7 days from randomization until data cut off (14th April 2008).
Median Overall Survival (OS) in Months at OS Data Cut Off (14th June 2010), Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive. Median Overall Survival in months is presented here., Following the PFS DCO on 14th April 2008 information on survival status was collected every 8 weeks.|Objective Tumour Response Rate According to RECIST, Number of participants with an objective response.
