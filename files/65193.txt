Neoadjuvant Treatment With Regorafenib and Capecitabine Combined With Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Despite treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer relapses are frequent. Several attempts to improve these results with therapy intensification have shown modest effect on disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Recent studies with addition of sorafenib and cediranib revealed promising effect on tumor response with acceptable toxicity. Regorafenib is a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with a broad mechanism of action. Therefore this trial investigates if similar results can be achieved as with sorafenib or cediranib.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), In the dose escalation part the dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) is observed during and up to 4 weeks after the last administration of RCT., up to 4 weeks after the last administration of RCT|Pathological near complete or complete tumor response (npCR or pCR), In the dose escalation part the pathological near complete or complete tumor response (npCR or pCR) is specified., up to 2 months after end of treatment
Quality of the mesorectal excision including details of the circumferential resection margin (CRM)/surface, Quality of the mesorectal excision including details of the circumferential resection margin (CRM)/surface according to Nagtegaal., up to 2 months after end of treatment|Sphincter preservation, Sphincter preservation is defined as preservation of the rectal sphincter or part of it., up to 2 months after end of treatment|Pathological response, Dworak tumor regression grading (TRG) system., up to 2 months after end of treatment|Circumferential resection margin (CRM) status, Negative (clear) circumferential margins are defined by an invasion front which is at a \> 1mm distance from the lateral resection margin; circumferential resection margins of ≤ 1 mm are considered positive (involved).

CRM negative (clear) ≤ 1mm and CRM positive (involved) ≤ 1mm., up to 2 months after end of treatment|Downstaging of primary tumor and/or lymph nodes (comparison between mrT/N and ypT/N), Downstaging of primary tumor and/or lymph nodes (comparison between mrT/N and ypT/N), up to 2 months after end of treatment|Postoperative complications, Surgical complications within 8 weeks after surgery. A surgical local complication is defined as either:

* insufficiency of anastomosis
* fistula
* severe local infection requiring antibiotics
* bladder dysfunction
* erectile dysfunction
* additional interventions / operation needed (e.g. drainage of hematoma/abscess), within 8 weeks after surgery

The objective of the dose escalation part is to determinate safety, tolerability and the recommended dose. The objective of the expansion cohort is to assess the efficacy and to further characterize safety and tolerability of the therapy.
