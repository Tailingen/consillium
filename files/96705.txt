A BRIDGING STUDY OF PF-06439535 (CN) PLUS PACLITAXEL-CARBOPLATIN VERSUS BEVACIZUMAB PLUS PACLITAXEL-CARBOPLATIN IN NSCLC
The current study will compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of PF-06439535 (CN) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizumab sourced from the European Union (bevacizumab-EU) with paclitaxel and carboplatin in Chinese participants with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in the first-line treatment setting.
Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC
DRUG: PF-06439535 (CN)|DRUG: Bevacizumab-EU|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response, Objective response referred to complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 19 of the study in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 which was subsequently confirmed by Week 25. A participant achieved CR if both target and non-target lesions achieved CR, no new lesions; achieved PR if target lesions achieved CR or PR, non-target lesions were assessed as non-CR/non-PD (non-progressive disease), indeterminate or missing, and no new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions, normal nodes (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: \>= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target lesions, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels and all lymph nodes must be normal in size; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits., From Week 1 to Week 25 (25 Weeks)
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in Treatment Period, TEAE was defined as any adverse event that occurs after the beginning of the investigational product or any pre-existing adverse event (AE) that worsens after the beginning of the investigational product. Serious adverse events (SAE) were assessed by the investigator. Severity of AE was graded based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03: Grade 3-SEVERE AE; Grade 4-LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5-DEATH RELATED TO AE., From Day 1 to end of Cycle 8; 1 Cycle = 21 Days|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA), ADA have been evaluated in studies with bevacizumab in cancer patient populations. A sensitive and specific immunoassay for detecting ADA in human serum was used to analyze the ADA samples (blood samples for assessment of ADA collected at specified timepoints)., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 5, and before the last administration of the investigational product (up to Cycle 14 Day 1); 1 Cycle = 21 Days|Number of Participants With NAb, Blood samples for assessment of ADA and NAb were collected at specified time point. Samples that were determined positive for ADA were further characterized for NAb using a single validated NAb assay., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 5, and before the last administration of the investigational product (up to Cycle 14 Day 1); 1 Cycle = 21 Days|Trough and Apparent Peak PF-06439535 (CN) and Bevacizumab (EU) Concentrations, The drug concentrations were determined using serum samples collected at the time points specified., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 5, and before the last administration of the investigational product (up to Cycle 14 Day 1); 2.5 hours after initiation of bevacizumab infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 5; 1 Cycle = 21 Days|Number of Participants With TEAEs in Extension Period, Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any adverse event that occurs after the beginning of the investigational product or any pre-existing adverse event that worsens after the beginning of the investigational product. Serious adverse events were assessed by the investigator. Severity of AE was graded based on NCI CTCAE version 4.03: Grade 3-SEVERE AE; Grade 4-LIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5-DEATH RELATED TO AE., Cycle 9 Day 1 up to End of Treatment (up to Cycle 14 Day 21); 1 Cycle = 21 Days
