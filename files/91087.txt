Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab Plus Sorafenib for the Third-line Treatment in Metastatic Renal Cancer Patients
There is no standard treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma that was previously treated with VEGF targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors.So investigators conducted a randomized, open-label, multi-center phase II study to compare bevacizumab plus sorafenib versus sorafenib for the third-line treatment of patients with Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Sorafenib
progress-free survival,PFS, Time from enrollment to the dates of disease progression,death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported between date of first patient enrollment until 31 December 2017 cut of date, 2 years
overall survival,OS, Time from enrollment to the dates of death from any cause or last follow up reported between date of first patient enrollment until 31 December 2017 cut of date, 3 years|Safety: adverse events, adverse events, 1 years
Therapies targeting VEGF and mTOR signalling pathways represent standard first-line and second-line treatment options for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. There is no standard treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma that was previously treated with VEGF targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors.To the best of the investigators knowledge, GOLD study is the first phase 3 trial in the third-line setting after both VEGF-inhibitor and mTOR-inhibitor drugs.From this study,Sorafenib may be option for the third-line treatment.The Best trial demonstrated that Bevacizumab/sorafenib had best efficacy in advance renal cancer canrcinoma and the VEGF/VEGFR co-inhibition strategy may warrant further investigation possibly with more selective VEGFR inhibitors.So investigators conducted a randomized, open-label, multi-center phase II study to compare bevacizumab plus sorafenib versus sorafenib for the third-line treatment of patients with Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
