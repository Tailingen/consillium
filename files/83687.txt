Dalpiciclib Plus Fulvestrant With Pyrotinib in Hormone Receptor-positive, HER2-low Advanced Breast Cancer That Progressed on Previous CDK4/6i Plus AI Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine if the triplet combination of dalpiciclib, fulvestrant, and pyrotinib is safe and effective in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-low locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer following treatment with an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib abemaciclib or ribociclib).

The study will employ a Bayesian Optimal Phase II (BOP2) design which explicitly controls the type I error rate, thereby bridging the gap between Bayesian designs and frequentist designs, and has favorable operating characteristics with higher power and lower risk of incorrectly terminating the trial than some existing Bayesian phase II designs.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dalpiciclib|DRUG: Pyrotinib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., From start date to date of first documentation of progression or death (assessed up to 12 months)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Evaluation of disease will be made according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1) in patients with measurable disease. As this study will enroll patients with measureable and un-measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1, ORR will only be assessed in evaluable patients. Response rates will be estimated as the proportion of enrolled patients who achieve complete or partial response rate., From start date to date of first documentation of progression or death (assessed up to 12 months)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or with stable disease (SD) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1 or Non-Complete Response or Non-Progressive Disease (NCRNPD) during first 24 weeks of first dose. CR=disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, SD=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progressive disease (PD), PD=at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all target lesions., From start date to date of first documentation of progression or death (assessed up to 12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is the time from date of first treatment to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the last date of contact., From start date to date of death (assessed up to 24 months)|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs; All Causalities), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Severity will be graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5.0., From the signing of the informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of study medication up to 14 months
