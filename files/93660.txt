Haploidentical NK Cell Infusion in Malignant Melanoma
We hypothesized that haploidentical NK cells kill tumor cells more efficiently than autologous NK cells, based on the missing-self hypothesis. Therefore, we performed this study to investigate the role of haploidentical NK cell therapy in patients with refractory or relapsed malignant melanoma.

Human NK cells recognize and kill transformed cells in a MHC-unrestricted fashion, suggesting the role of cancer immunotherapy. However, autologous NK cells showed the lack of significant clinical effects, because they are inhibited by self MHC class I molecules, based on the missing-self hypothesis. Contrarily, haploidentical NK cells with KIR-ligand incompatibility can mediate graft-versus-leukemia effect and protect patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) from graft-versus-host disease. In addition, adoptive transfer of haploidentical NK cells following high-intensity conditioning induced complete remission (26%) in poor-prognosis AML patients. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the role of adoptive NK cell therapy in patients with refractory or relapsed malignant melanoma using CD3+ depleting CliniMACSÂ® system.
