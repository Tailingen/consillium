Arsenic Trioxide and Radiation Therapy in Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Gliomas
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for patients with glioma. Drugs such as arsenic trioxide may also make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining arsenic trioxide with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining arsenic trioxide with radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed gliomas.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: arsenic trioxide|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Maximum tolerated dose as assessed by NCI CTCAE v. 3.0 following study completion|Safety as assessed by NCI CTCAE v. 3.0 following study completion
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered with radiotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma, or intrinsic pontine glioma.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide (ATO).

Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Patients concurrently receive ATO IV over 1 hour, 1-5 times weekly, for approximately 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ATO until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 2 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-36 months.
