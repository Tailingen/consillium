A Study of ARRY-520 and Bortezomib Plus Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) or plasma cell leukemia (PCL) will receive investigational study drug ARRY-520 and bortezomib, with or without dexamethasone, with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.

This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients will receive increasing doses of study drug (2 dosing schedules will be evaluated) in combination with (1) bortezomib with G-CSF support or (2) bortezomib and dexamethasone with G-CSF support, in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 45 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Active, not recruiting).

In the second part of this study, patients will receive the best dose(s) and schedule(s) of study drug, in combination with bortezomib ± dexamethasone + G-CSF, determined from the first part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects the combination causes and what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 42 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Active, not recruiting).
