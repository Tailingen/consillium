There is no effective chemotherapy regimen for recurrent glioblastoma. The antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab has high objective response rate and rapid onset, but the duration of efficacy needs to be improved.The objective response rate of PD-1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy is low and the onset of the effect is slow, but the effective patients have a long duration of efficacy.The combined treatment of PD-1 monoclonal antibody and bevacizumab may learn from each other to improve the effective rate, shorten the onset time and prolong the duration of efficacy.Studies have shown that bevacizumab can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in a variety of cancers, including melanoma, kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and liver cancer.However, previous studies have shown limited efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.

In this study, the combination therapy was optimized by introducing induction phase therapy, which is expected to further improve the efficacy. In our previous exploratory treatment of patients with severe recurrent glioblastoma after multiple treatments, the initial efficacy was considerable.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab \[a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor\] combined with bevacizumab for adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
