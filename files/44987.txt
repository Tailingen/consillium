Bevacizumab Combined With Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for 1 to 10 Brain Metastases From NSCLC
This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Bevacizumab combined with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy(FSRT) in patients with 1 to 10 brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer by assessing the treatment response, perilesional edema, neurological symptoms and quality of life.

This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Bevacizumab combined with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy(FSRT) in patients with 1 to 10 brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer by assessing the treatment response, neurological symptoms and quality of life.

Patients will receive Bevacizumab(7.5mg/kg, q3w, i.v.) before and after FSRT(40Gy in 10 fractions or 30Gy in 5 fractions) to the brain metastases. The primary endpoint was intra-cranial progression-free survival (IPFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QOL) scores, and toxicities.
