A Clinical Trial of TQB3909 Tablets in Combination With Azacitidine for the Treatment of Myeloid Malignancies
This is an open, multi-center clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TQB3909 tablets in combination with azacitidine in subjects with myeloid malignancies.
Myeloid Malignancy
DRUG: TQB3909 Tablets + Azacitidine
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), abnormal laboratory parameters, Any adverse medical event that occurred from the time the subject signed the informed consent until 28 days after the last dose/start of the new antitumor therapy (whichever occurs first), Up to 24 weeks|Complete Remission + Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CR+CRh) Rate, Complete Remission + Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CR+CRh) Rate, Up to 4 weeks
Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects with best response as Complete Remission (CR), Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi), Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLFS), or Partial Remission (PR), Up to 4 weeks|Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects with best response as CR, Morphological Complete Remission (mCR), or PR, Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Complete Remission + Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CR+CRi) Rate, Proportion of subjects with best response as CR+CRi. CRi refers to meeting all CR criteria except for residual neutrophil count decrease (ANC \< 1.0 × 109/L) or platelet count decrease (PLT \< 100 × 109/L)., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Complete Remission + Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CR+CRh) Rate, Proportion of subjects with best response as CR, Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Complete Remission (CR) Rate, Proportion of subjects with best response as CR, Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Duration of Remission (DOR), For all subjects with best response as CR, CRi, MLFS, or PR, the time from the first date of achieving remission to the first recorded date of disease progression, relapse, or death (whichever occurs first)., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Duration of CR + CRh (DOCR+CRh), For all subjects with best response as CR or CRh, the time from the first date of achieving CR or CRh to the first recorded date of relapse or death (whichever occurs first)., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Duration of Complete Remission (DOCR), For all subjects with best response as CR, the time from the first date of achieving CR to the first recorded date of relapse or death (whichever occurs first)., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Time to First Complete Remission (TTCR), For all subjects with best response as CR or CRh, the time from the first date of medication to the first date of CR or CRh., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Time to First Complete Remission (TTCR), For subjects with best response as CR, the time from the first date of medication to the first date of CR., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Event-Free Survival (EFS), Defined as the duration from the first dose of medication to treatment failure, relapse after CR or CRi, or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first). Treatment failure is defined as not achieving CR or CRi at any assessment time during treatment. Subjects with treatment failure will be considered to have an EFS event on the first day after the first dose. For subjects with CR or CRi, the event time will be the time of disease relapse or death (whichever occurs first)., Up to 4 weeks|Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Overall Survival (OS), The time from the first dose of medication to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 60 weeks|Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Hematologic Improvement (HI) Rate, Proportion of subjects meeting Hematologic Improvement (HI) criteria, including Hematologic Improvement - Erythrocyte (HI-E), Hematologic Improvement - Platelet (HI-P), and Hematologic Improvement - Neutrophil (HI-N)., Up to 4 weeks|Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Transfusion Independence Rate, The proportion of subjects who did not require transfusions for at least 56 days after baseline, relative to the number of baseline transfusion-dependent and transfusion-independent subjects., Up to 8 weeks
