Observational Study of Iris Tumors
This is an observational study using OCT angiography to assist with tumor characterization in melanotic and amelanotic iris lesions. OCT angiography data from healthy eyes will be compared to eyes with various types of iris tumors.
Iris Tumor
Tumor Thickness in Benign vs Malignant Iris Lesions, OCT/OCTA will be used to compare tumor thickness measurements against the conventional Ultrasonic Biomicroscopy (UBM) device. Tumor thickness will be measured in millimeters, and growth of 0.5 mm or greater will be used to differentiate malignant from benign lesions., 6 months
Tumor Area in Benign vs Malignant Iris Lesions, Tumor area will be measured by OCT/OCTA in mm2 and compared against conventional UBM measurements., 6 months|Tumor Volume in Benign vs Malignant Iris Lesions, Tumor volume will be measured by OCT/OCTA in mm3 and compared against conventional UBM measurements., 6 months|Effect of Radiation Treatment on Tumor and Surrounding Ocular Structures, Vessel density and tortuosity will both be measured in % occupied by flow pixels on OCT/OCTA., 6 months after treatment
