Evaluation of Effect of CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System on Human Esophageal Epithelium
Assess Cryoablation (CryoBalloon Ablation cryotherapy) for treatment of Dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus, Esophageal Squamous Dysplasia and early Esophageal Cancer. The cryoablation treatment will be offered as an alternative to standard ablation therapies such as Radiofrequency Ablation, Argon Plasma Coagulation and carbon dioxide Cryotherapy).
Barrett's Esophagus|Esophageal Squamous Dysplasia|Esophageal Cancer
DEVICE: CryoBalloon
Histological evaluation of treatment zone(s) for dysplasia, evaluate histopathology of esophageal tissue for Barrett's dysplasia after cryoablation, 60 months|Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events (pain and dysphagia), evaluate by patient questionnaire for change from baseline in pain on the 11 point scale (0-10) from baseline to post treatment and incidence of dysphagia (using a standardized dysphagia scoring system 0-4) collected over treatment period., 60 months
Histological evaluation of treatment zone for intestinal metaplasia (BE patients), evaluate histopathology of esophageal tissue for Barrett's esophagus (intestinal metaplasia) after cryoablation, 60 months
Cryoablation (cryotherapy) is an established type of mucosal ablation for treatment of various conditions in the GI tract, including Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility and performance of cryoablation system (the C2 Focal Cryoablation Device in patients with BE and esophageal squamous dysplasia who need ablation therapy for clinical standard care. The new cryoablation treatment will be offered as an alternative to standard ablation therapies already in place (radiofrequency ablation, carbon dioxide cryotherapy).
