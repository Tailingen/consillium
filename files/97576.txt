Clinical Study of Breast Conserving Surgery Combined With Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Early Breast Cancer
A Single-center, open, prospective studyï¼Œfor analyzing the local recurrence rate, the incidence of incision complications and the aesthetic effect of intraoperative radiotherapy in early breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery.
Breast Cancer|HER2-negative Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: radiotherapy
LRFS, There was no local recurrence survival, At least 5 years
This is a single-center, open, prospective study. A total of 620 breast cancer patients meeting the exclusion criteria were included and assigned to the IORT group and the WBI group according to the patients' wishes. The IORT group received intraoperative radiotherapy with a regimen of 50-KF-x 20Gy/1f, and the WBI group received whole milk external irradiation with a regimen of 50Gy/25f. If the postoperative paraffin pathology of patients in the IORT group indicated positive axillary lymph nodes, the radiologist should determine whether to irradiate the whole milk and lymph nodes in the drainage area. If the postoperative pathology of patients in the WBI group indicated the need for chemotherapy, radiotherapy was initiated within 6 weeks after the end of chemotherapy, allowing both endocrine therapy and radiotherapy to be performed simultaneously. The clinical standard treatment regimen (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, etc.) was developed based on postoperative pathological and immunohistochemical reports.
