CAR-T CD19/CD20 for Patients With Advanced CD19/CD20+ B Cell Line Recurrent or Refractory Hematological Malignancies
This is a clinical study of CD19 / CD20 CAR-T cell infusion in the treatment of relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies in CD19 / CD20 positive B cell lines.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell infusion targeting CD19/CD20 in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD19 / CD20 positive B cell line hematological malignancies.

CD19 and CD20 are two proteins expressed in normal B cells and various B cell-derived hematological malignancies, including non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). CD19 and CD20 are restricted to the surface of B cells. They are not expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, nor in other tissue cells. They exist in all stages of B cell development and differentiation. They are not lost from the cell surface until B cells differentiate into plasma cells. Clinical studies have found that CD19 and CD20 are excellent targets for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies.The purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 / CD20 positive B cell line hematological malignancies.
