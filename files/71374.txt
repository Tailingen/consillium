Trial of Devimistat in Combination With Modified FOLFIRINOX in Patients With Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
This protocol will enroll patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer to receive modified FOLFIRINOX plus devimistat. Patients will be enrolled with 1:1 randomization between Dose Escalation Cohort and Cohort A until required 20 patients have been enrolled on Cohort A following which randomization will end and patients will be enrolled without randomization to Dose Escalation Cohort and then subsequently to Cohort B.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Devimistat|DRUG: Modified FOLFIRINOX
Number of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity during the first 15 days of devimistat in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX in the dose escalation cohort, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined based on dose limiting toxicity, 15 days post the start of combination therapy|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) of devimistat plus modified FOLFIRINOX across all cohorts, The PFS will be defined as time from date of initial treatment to date of radiological or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study treatment), or death from any cause on study treatment, whichever comes first. Follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease evaluation., up to 42 months after enrollment
Number of subjects with reported adverse events and reportable serious events, To assess the safety and toxicity of the drug combination by reported adverse events and reportable serious events are defined by the study protocol (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0)., up to 25 months after enrollment|Overall Response Rate (ORR) of devimistat plus modified FOLFIRINOX, ORR will be determined as per the RECISTv1.1 criteria, up to 42 months after enrollment|Overall Survival (OS) of devimistat plus modified FOLFIRINOX, OS will be defined from the date of initial treatment to either date of death or censoring., up to 42 months after enrollment|Overall Survival (OS) of devimistat plus modified FOLFIRINOX based on gender, OS will be defined from the date of initial treatment to either date of death or censoring., up to 42 months after enrollment|Duration of response (DoR) of devimistat plus modified FOLFIRINOX, DoR will be measured from the start date of the best response achieved until the date of relapse (i.e., progression). Continuing responders will be right-censored as of the most recent date on which their response status had been assessed. DoR applies to only the patients who achieve either a complete response or a partial response., up to 42 months after enrollment|To assess pharmacokinetics (Cmax) of devimistat, The PK parameters of devimistat (and its metabolites, if appropriate), including but not limited to peak plasma concentration (Cmax) versus time curve from time 0 to t (AUC0-t), up to 42 months after enrollment|To assess pharmacokinetics (AUCinf) of devimistat, The PK parameters of devimistat (and its metabolites, if appropriate), including but not limited to area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf), up to 42 months after enrollment|To assess pharmacokinetics (t1/2) of devimistat, The PK parameters of devimistat (and its metabolites, if appropriate), including but not limited to elimination half-life (t1/2), up to 42 months after enrollment|To assess pharmacokinetics (tmax) of devimistat, The PK parameters of devimistat (and its metabolites, if appropriate), including but not limited to time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (tmax), up to 42 months after enrollment|To assess pharmacokinetics (CL) of devimistat, The PK parameters of devimistat (and its metabolites, if appropriate), including but not limited to clearance (CL), up to 42 months after enrollment|To assess pharmacokinetics (Vd) of devimistat, The PK parameters of devimistat (and its metabolites, if appropriate), including but not limited to volume of distribution (Vd), up to 42 months after enrollment|To determine the median Progression Free Survival (PFS) of devimistat plus modified FOLFIRINOX based on gender, The PFS will be defined as time from date of initial treatment to date of radiological or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study treatment), or death from any cause on study treatment, whichever comes first. Follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease evaluation., up to 42 months after enrollment
