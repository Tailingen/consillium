Efficacy and Safety of Immunotherapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Uncommon Histological Type
This study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced uncommon pathological types of lung cancer whether or not it is accompanied by a driver mutationin the real world. Through retrospective collection of clinical data of patients with uncommon pathological types of lung cancer.The patients who are treated with immunosuppressive agents are screened out, and they are divided into immune combination therapy or immune monotherapy, and further evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy between the two.
Uncommon Pathological Types of Lung Cancer

This is a research project involving patients in Medical Oncology Department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University. Retrospective study of 40 patients with advanced uncommon pathological types of lung cancer and observe the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitor regimen in the real world. The patients who are treated with immunosuppressive agents are screened out, and they are divided into immune combination therapy or immune monotherapy, and further evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy between the two. Statistical analysis is used to compare the differences between the two treatments, so that patients can better choose treatment strategies.
