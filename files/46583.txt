Bright Light on Fatigue in Women Being Treated for Breast Cancer
This proposed study will examine feasibility and implement therapeutic bright light that is tailored to the individual's circadian typology to estimate its therapeutic effects on sleep/wake patterns and fatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
