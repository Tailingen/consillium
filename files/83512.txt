Objective response rate(ORR)(mRECIST), ORR is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on mRECIST, Up to approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST, Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of randomization or first dosing date to death due to any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Maximum observed concentration [Cmax], To evaluate the Cmax of Combination regimen ., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Time to Cmax [Tmax], To evaluate the Tmax of Combination regimen ., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Minimum observed concentration [Cmin], To evaluate the Cmin of Combination regimen ., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Area under the concentration-time curve [AUC0-last], To evaluate the AUC0-last of Combination regimen ., Up to 30 days after last treatment|AUC to the end of the dosing period(AUC0-tau), To evaluate the AUC0-tau of Combination regimen ., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), To evaluate the t1/2 of Combination regimen ., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), To evaluate the incidence of ADA to PM8002, Up to 30 days after last treatment
The study is divided into two parts. The first part is a phase Ib, single-arm study, which is planned to enroll 3-28 subjects.

The second part is a phase II randomized, parallel-controlled, four-arm, open-label study, which is planned to enroll approximately 120 subjects.
