Assessment Of Bladder Tumors Stage And Grade By Outpatient Flexible Cystoscopy Performed By Urology Resident
This will be a prospective trial comparing the perspective gross morphological of bladder tumor assessment done by outpatient flexible cystoscopy performed by resident, inpatient rigid cystoscopy done by senior staff and their prediction of the degree of invasion of bladder tumor plus the prediction of the grade compared with the standard pathological result.

Also, assessment of the patient reported outcomes after both flexible and rigid cystoscopy will be done.

In the long run of the study, the prognostic gross morphology with recurrence, progression and cancer specific survival will be assessed.
