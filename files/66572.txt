Pilot Study of Bisphosphonate Therapy (Zoledronic Acid) in Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma (UAB 0901)
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the response rate of single agent zoledronic acid using a composite of criteria including the EORTC modified RECIST criteria and the EORTC tumor response criteria for 18F-FDG PET scans.
Mesothelioma
DRUG: Zometa
Tumor Response Rate Following Zoledronic Acid (Zometa), The modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 2004) will be used for target lesions and assessed by CT scans. Complete Response (CR) is the disappearance of target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is greater than or equal to 30% reduction in the total tumor measurement; Stable Disease (SD) is the absence of response or progression; and Progressive Disease (PD) is a 20% increase in the total tumor measurement over nadir value or the appearance of new lesions., Baseline up to 28 months or until progressive disease or death
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the number of days from the day the subject started treatment to the day the subject experienced evidence of disease progression, as determined by radiological or clinical progression., Baseline up to 28 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the number of days from the day the subject started treatment to the day the subject experienced death or lost to follow-up., Baseline up to 28 months
This pilot study will examine the effect of bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in patients with malignant mesothelioma. Evaluation will be limited to patients with standard (CT scans) and functional instruments (FDG PET Scans) of tumor assessment after the administration of standard doses of zoledronic acid (4 mg IV every 3 weeks). We will also explore the biologic effect of zoledronic acid in patients using new serum markers as well as several blood level markers.
