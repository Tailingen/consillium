A Phase 1/2 Study of Inlexisertib (DCC-3116) in Patients With RAS/MAPK Pathway Mutant Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open label, first in human (FIH) study of inlexisertib as monotherapy, and in combination with trametinib, binimetinib, or sotorasib in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with RAS/MAPK pathway mutation. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase, and an expansion phase.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: Inlexisertib|DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Binimetinib|DRUG: Sotorasib
Incidence of Adverse Events, Identify the observed adverse events, serious adverse events associated with inlexisertib as monotherapy and in combination with trametinib, binimetinib, or sotorasib., Approximately 24 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (Escalation Phase), Identify the dose-limiting toxicities for each dose level tested and determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended Phase 2 doses of inlexisertib as monotherapy and in combination with trametinib, binimetinib, or sotorasib., Approximately 18 months|Objective response rate (ORR) (Expansion Phase), Proportion of participants who achieve CR or PR per RECIST v1.1., Approximately 24 months
Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time interval from the time that the measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the progressive disease is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) at the specified time point per RECIST v1.1., Approximately 24 months|Time to response, Time to response is defined as the time from initiation of treatment until the first assessment demonstrating CR or PR per RECIST v1.1., Approximately 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from initiation of treatment until documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 24 months|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Measure the maximum observed concentration of inlexisertib (single-agent and combinations)., Predose and up to 12 hours postdose|Time to maximum observed concentration (Tmax), Measure the time to maximum plasma concentration of inlexisertib (single-agent and combinations)., Predose and up to 12 hours postdose|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin), Measure the minimum observed concentration of inlexisertib (single-agent and combinations)., Predose and up to 12 hours postdose|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Measure the AUC of inlexisertib (single-agent and combinations)., Predose and up to 12 hours postdose
