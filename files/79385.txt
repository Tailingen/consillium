Retrospective Study on the Use of Immunotherapy in Patients With MSI-H Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
An increasing number of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are able to receive 3 or more lines of therapy. In this setting, can be recognize treatments such as regorafenib (an oral multikinase inhibitor), trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102), an antineoplastic nucleoside analogue, and antibodies anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with RAS wild-type tumors (if no prior exposure to antibodies). Maintaining quality of life is an essential goal for third- and later-line treatments for patients.

The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, were approved in the US by the FDA in 2017, and the combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab (anti CTLA-4) was recently approved by the FDA in 2018, all in the second and later-line setting for patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair mCRC whose disease has progressed despite treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. At present, these agents are not approved in Europe for mCRC patients with MSI-H. Clinical trial results and scientific data supported evidence that immunotherapies provide benefit but are limited to the small proportion (\< 5%) of patients with MSI-H tumors, in whom they are highly effective. Therefore, patients with MSI-H disease should be referred as expeditiously as possible to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The aim the study is to retrospectively collect data of patients treated with immunotherapy in the context of real clinical practice, in order to describe the real impact in terms of clinical outcomes and tolerability of treatment in common clinical practice.
