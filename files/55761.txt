This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase II study.
Resectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Penpulimab+Cisplatin/Carboplatin+Pemetrexed/Paclitaxel/Gemcitabine/Docetaxel|DRUG: Penpulimab+Anlotinib+Cisplatin/Carboplatin+Pemetrexed/Paclitaxel/Gemcitabine/Docetaxel|DRUG: Penpulimab+Anlotinib
Major pathological response (MPR), About 3-6 weeks following completion of surgery.
Objective response rate (ORR), Within 7 days before surgery.|1 year Event-Free Survival rate, Up to 5 Years from randomization|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Up to 5 years from randomization.|Overall survival (OS), Up to 5 years from randomization.|Incidence of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs), Up to 5 Years from randomization
This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase II study assessing the efficacy and safety of penpulimab plus chemotherapy or penpulimab plus anlotinib or penpulimab plus chemotherapy and anlotinib as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment in patients with resectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either penpulimab (200mg, iv, Q3W) plus chemotherapy (platinum based chemotherapy) or penpulimab (200mg, iv, Q3W) plus anlotinib (12mg, po, day 1-14, Q3W) or penpulimab (200mg, iv, Q3W) plus chemotherapy (platinum based chemotherapy) and anlotinib (12mg, po, day 1-14, Q3W) in a 1:1:1 ratio.
