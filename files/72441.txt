A Prospective Pilot Study for the Evaluation of 18F- Fluciclovine PET/MRI in Radio-recurrent Prostate Cancer (RRPC-PET/MRI Study)
To perform both PET scans and MRIs in the same setting using a simultaneous PET/MRI scanner.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Nodule
RADIATION: 18F-fluciclovine
To assess the diagnostic performance of 18F- Fluciclovine pelvic PET/MRI to that of pelvic mpMRI, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

--To compare the diagnostic performance of 18F- Fluciclovine pelvic PET/MRI to that of pelvic mpMRI and to determine whether 18F- Fluciclovine pelvic PET/MRI is more accurate than a pelvic mpMRI in detecting pelvic RRPC in men with biochemical recurrence with histopathology as reference standard.

Secondary Objective:

--To study inter-reader reliability of 18F- Fluciclovine pelvic PET/MRI and pelvic mpMRI among the readers.

Exploratory Objective:

--To study correlation between SUVmax and ADCmean in the pelvic RRPC.
