Intraoperative Ultrasonographic Localization of Pulmonary Nodules in VATS
This study is conducted to explore the feasibility and value of Intraoperative ultrasonographic localization of pulmonary nodules in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
Ultrasonography
PROCEDURE: localization group
The accuracy rate of localization, The accuracy rate of localization will be evaluated using gray scale mode and elastography mode using pathology as a reference., one year
Correlation of lesion size and localization, Whether lesion size affects localization will be explored in the study., one year|Correlation of distance between the lesion and pleura and localization, Whether distance between the lesion and pleura affects localization will be explored., one year|Time of localization, The time of intraoperative ultrasonographic localization will be recorded., one week
The study is designed as a single center prospective trial. The participating center is Department of Ultrasound, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. The study is expected to enroll 200 patients. The feasibility and value of Intraoperative ultrasonographic localization of pulmonary nodules in VATS will be explored. The accuracy rate of localization will be evaluated using gray scale mode and elastography mode. Intraoperative ultrasonographic localization will be performed using an ultrasound system (HI VISON Ascendus), which is equipped with a 5-10MHz mechanical probe (EUP-OL531).
