Phase I Clinical Study of Oral TG02 Capsule in the Treatment of Recurrent / Progressive High-grade Glioma Patients
The aim of the study was to explore the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of oral administration of TG02 capsules twice a week for 4 weeks.
High-grade Gliomas
DRUG: TG02 capsules oral administration, BIW in every 28d|DRUG: TG02 capsules oral administration, BIW in every 28d|DRUG: TG02 capsules oral administration, BIW in every 28d
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Adverse events of level 3 or above related to the study drug occurring within 28 days after the first dose as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 28 days after first dose|Maximal tolerable dose(MTD), DLT occurs in less than 1/6 subjects, this lower dose is defined as MTD., 28 days after first dose
Overall response rate（ORR）, proportion of patients whose best overall response during their participation in the study is either CR or PR. The best overall response is the best response recorded from first dose until disease progression., 12 months
c-myc expression in tumor tissue, the relationship between c-myc expression in tumor tissue with the tumor response, 12 months
Using the traditional 3 +3 design, 150 mg as the initial dose and 50 mg as the increasing interval of up to 250 mg, and oral administration on the 1st, 4th, 8th, 11th, 15th, 18th, 22nd and 25th day of each 28-day cycle. Phase I clinical study to evaluate the tolerance and pharmacokinetic parameters of oral TG02 capsules.
