Electroporation and Immunotherapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The trial is designed as an investigator initiated prospective phase 2 study in patients with metastatic pMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) to determine the safety and efficacy of calcium electroporation (CaEP) performed concurrently with irreversible electroporation (IRE) followed by a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab).
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: Irreversible electroporation|DEVICE: Calcium electroporation|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
The incidence rate of adverse events according to CTCAE v. 4.0, Safety of electroporation and immunotherapy according to CTCAE v. 4.0, up to 1 month after end of treatment
Tumor response by CT, Based on CT chest/abdomen scans according to RECIST version 1.1, Baseline compared to 2, 5, 8, 11 months after start of treatment|Tumor response by ultrasound, Based on contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) utilizing the standardized and quantitative method Dynamic CEUS (DCEUS), Baseline compared to 2 months after start of treatment|Progression free survival, From start of treatment until unequivocal disease progression, assessed up to 5 years|Overall survival, From start of treatment until unequivocal disease progression, assessed up to 5 years
immune infiltration by CD3, CD4, and CD8 staining, immune-related treatment-induced changes, Baseline compared to 17 days and 2 months after start of treatment|immune infiltration by PD-1 and PD-L1 staining, immune-related treatment-induced changes, Baseline compared to 17 days and 2 months after start of treatment
The investigators hypothesize that Ca-EP targeting the primary CRC tumor combined with IRE targeting a metastasis will be a promising, safe two target approach to ensure sufficient immune response both locally and systemic to potentiate the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with pMMR metastatic CRC.
