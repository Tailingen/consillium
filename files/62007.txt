TOPS for African American Breast Cancer Survivors
For women diagnosed with breast cancer, dietary, weight loss, and physical activity have been linked with clinically significant weight loss; decreased risk of death; reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence; fewer cardiovascular events; and improved physical function. The objectives of these aims are to a) determine if the TOPS materials and format are possible and accepted by overweight and obese African American breast cancer survivors; b) gather data for sample size calculations for a larger future study.

To meet these aims, we will collect data to see if participants enjoyed the TOPS program and suggestions for changes to the program to make it fit their needs. Other methods will measure recruitment, retention, and weight change.

Aim 1: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a national, low-cost, community-based, peer-led, weight loss program (Take Off Pounds Sensibly, TOPS) for overweight and obese African American breast cancer survivors in the local chapter of a national African American breast cancer support group (Sisters Network Triangle North Carolina, SNTNC).

Aim 2: Assess the weight change of overweight and obese African American breast cancer survivors after 6 months in the TOPS program to gather data for sample size calculations for a future RCT (randomized controlled trial).
