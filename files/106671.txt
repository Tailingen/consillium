This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for LMP1 positive infectious diseases and hematological malignancies. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products. 144 patients will be enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
