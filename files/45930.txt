Folic Acid in Preventing Colorectal Polyps in Patients With Previous Colorectal Polyps
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain substances to keep cancer from forming. The use of folic acid may prevent colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well folic acid works compared with a placebo in preventing colorectal polyps in patients who have had previous colorectal polyps.
Adenoma of Large Intestine
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Folic acid|OTHER: Placebo
Recurrent colorectal adenoma, May 1996-March 2004
recurrent adenoma by location, size, stage, number,, May1996-March 2004
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine if folic acid supplementation lowers the adenoma recurrence rate.

Secondary

* Determine the number of adenomas per patient and the size and histology of the adenoma.
* Assess the interaction between folic acid and alcohol, methionine, and aspirin intake.
* Assess the interaction between folic acid and pretrial and midtrial folate levels.
* Assess other complementary biomarkers such as DNA methylation and blood folate level as risk factors for polyp recurrence.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral folic acid once daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. At least 1 year after beginning treatment, patients are sent a blood collection kit in order to measure plasma vitamin B12 levels, to measure folate to assess compliance.
