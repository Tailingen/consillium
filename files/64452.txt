Role of Race in Nutritional Approach in Men on ADT
There is a well-documented association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and cardiovascular morbidity. A majority of men on ADT gain weight contributing to an increase in cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and cardiovascular morbidity. Dietary intervention combined with exercise have shown success in reducing weight/fat mass and improving cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). There is little data on whether African American men would respond to diet and exercise interventions differently from non-Hispanic white men. We will conduct a pilot, controlled two-phase intervention study stratified by race to investigate the following objectives:

1. Compare effect of a hypocaloric, anti-inflammatory diet on changes in fat mass between African- American vs non-Hispanic white men with metastatic prostate cancer on ADT therapy.
2. Compare effect of a hypocaloric, anti-inflammatory diet on changes in cardiovascular risk factors (body weight, lean body mass, waist-to-height ratio, blood pressure, lipids and HbA1C) and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and cytokines) between African-American vs non-Hispanic white men with metastatic prostate cancer on ADT therapy.
3. Compare effect of a hypocaloric, anti-inflammatory diet on changes in cancer-related fatigue and quality of life between African-American vs non-Hispanic white men with metastatic prostate cancer on ADT therapy.

We will enroll 35 African American and 35 non-Hispanic white men with prostate cancer undergoing ADT therapy. In phase 1, after baseline assessment, men will consume their habitual diet and continue their habitual activity level for 3 months. During phase 2, participants will be instructed to consume a hypocaloric (-500 kcal), anti- inflammatory diet and walk for 1 hour on 3 days per week for 3 months. At baseline, after phase 1 and 2 primary outcome (fat mass) and secondary outcomes (CVRF and inflammatory markers) and tertiary outcomes (cancer-related fatigue and quality of life) will be determined.
Prostate Cancer Metastatic Disease
BEHAVIORAL: Hypocaloric anti-inflammatory diet
Fat mass, Bioelectric impedance measurement will provide information about body composition including percent body fat, fat mass, lean body mass, total body water and basal metabolic rate using the portable BIA310e (Biodynamics Corp.). BIA is based on the principle that the flow of an electrical current through an object can be used to determine the object's physical properties., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|Waist circumference, Waist circumference will be measured with a tape measure in standing position horizontally, just above the hip bone, without compressing the skin., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months
Blood lipids and lipoproteins (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol), Blood lipids and lipoproteins will be analyzed spectrophotometrically using reagent from Pointe Scientific (Canton, MI, USA)., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|HbA1c, HbA1c will be analyzed spectrophotometrically using reagent from Pointe Scientific (Canton, MI, USA)., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|Total testosterone, Total testosterone will be analyzed spectrophotometrically using reagent from Pointe Scientific (Canton, MI, USA)., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|Inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-1b, TNFa), Concentrations of hs-CRP and cytokines will be quantified using the MagPix® analyzer (Luminex, Austin TX) with MILLIPLEX MAP Human CVD Panel 3 kit (hs-CRP) and Milliplex Human Cytokine/Chemokine MAGNETIC BEAD kit (IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα,) from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA) at the Center for Human Nutrition Biomarker Laboratory., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|Serum free fatty acids, Serum free fatty acids will be measured using an enzymatic colorimetric assay according to manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI)., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|Diet and physical activity, Participants in both groups will be instructed to use the weekly checklist for logging intake, physical activity and sleep habits. Subjects will be encouraged to track dietary intake as often as possible and mandated to complete 3-day dietary record 2 times every 4 weeks. Activity/exercise and sleep time will be monitored by the provided weekly checklist and ASA-24 at baseline, month 3, and month 6., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months
Cancer-related fatigue, Participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about cancer-related fatigue., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months|Quality of life, Participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about quality of life., At baseline, 3 months and 6 months
