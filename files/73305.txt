A Study of SGN-MesoC2 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This clinical trial is studying advanced solid tumors. Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.

Patients in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Patients must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.

This clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08052666/SGN-MesoC2. PF-08052666/SGN-MesoC2 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.

This study will have 3 parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08052666/SGN-MesoC2 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08052666/SGN-MesoC2 is safe and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.
