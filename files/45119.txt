Testosterone in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients
Purpose

To determine efficacy and safety of Testosterone in male patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and fatigue receiving targeted therapy or checkpoint inhibitors.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma

Fatigue is a frequent symptom of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and most common adverse event of targeted and immunotherapy.

In Phase 3 pivotal studies, 56% (9%, grade 3-4), 54% (11%, grade 3), 37% (10%, grade 3-4) and 20% (2%, grade 3) of patients had fatigue during the therapy of cabozantinib, sunitinib, axitinib or pazopanib, respectively. 59% (14%, grade 3) and 31% (5%, grade 3) of patients treated with lenvatinib/everolimus and everolimus had fatigue in registrational trials. Finally, 33% (2%, grade 3-4) of patients that received nivolumab had fatigue in CheckMate 025 study.

Testosterone may help to relieve fatigue associated with the use of tyrosine kinase, mTOR or checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, testosterone could impact on poor prognostic factors of RCC (anemia, ECOG performance status, serum calcium). This will be first clinical trial which evaluates safety and efficacy of Testosterone in RCC patients.
