Feasibility Study of Modified Atkins Ketogenic Diet in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Malignant Glioma
The purpose of this research study is to see if people can produce ketones in their blood with the modified Atkins diet. Modified Atkins diet is a diet that produces ketones in your blood by restricting carbohydrates to \<20 grams per day. Ketones are substances that are produced in the blood when fat is being broken down. Ketones may help radiation work better and may starve your tumor because it is thought that some brain tumors can not use ketones to grow and can only use sugar or glucose to grow.

OTHER: Modified Atkins Ketogenic Diet
Number of Participants With Ketosis, Ketosis measured by serum beta-hydroxybuterate. Ketosis is defined as having serum beta-hydroxybuterate (BHB) at \> 0.05 mM. Participants' BHB levels were assessed at 6 weeks after starting the study. The number of participants who had BHB at \> 0.05 mM were considered to have entered into ketosis. 9 of 9 participants met this criteria., 6 weeks
Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the percentage of patients without progression at 6 months. Progression will be evaluated via Radiographic Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria: \>5 mm increase in maximal diameter, as well as â‰¥ 25% increase in the sum of the products of the progressing., 6 months|Assessment of Survival, 2 years
