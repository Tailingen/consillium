Robotic Assisted Major Lung Resection in Elderly Patients
The study is a retrospective observational study. The study is designed to be multicentric and it will analyze medical records from selected patients that underwent major lung resection using DaVinci surgical platform performed in the participating centers.

There are no risks for the patients, as this is a retrospective data collection.

The perioperative complications, the investigators will measure the perioperative complications of robotic lung resection in patients with 80 or more than 80 years (very elderly patients) compared to those with less than 80 years. Complications will be categorized according to the Clavien-Dindo scale., from the surgery at 30-90 days after|spirometry tests, the investigators will measure the pre-operative respiratory function (Forced expiratory volume (FEV) , forced vital capacity (FVC)), in the two groups ., from hospitalizzation to the discharge date at maximum one week|Postoperative hospital stay, the investigators will measure the post-operative hospital stay in days in the two groups., from hospitalizzation to the discharge date at maximum one week
The investigators will recruit all patients who underwent major lung resection (segmentectomy, lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy using a robotic system) from May 2015 to December 2022.

Patients are divided into two groups: older than 80 years (case- very elderly patients) and younger than 80 years (control- elderly).

the aim: Minimally invasive techniques such as robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) can potentially reduce surgical trauma and therefore prove particularly beneficial for elderly patients.
