Study of TAK-700 in Combination With Docetaxel and Prednisone in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study of TAK-700 in combination with docetaxel and prednisone that will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination and will allow estimation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Phase 2: Time to PSA Progression, Time to PSA progression was defined as (date of PSA progression) - (date of first dose of drug) + 1, where PSA progression was defined as: For participants whose PSA concentrations never declined before the end of Cycle 4 of treatment: a) \>=25% increase over the baseline level and an increase in absolute PSA concentration \>=2 ng/mL; For participants who initially experienced a PSA decline: a) \>=25% increase in PSA above the nadir concentration and an increase in absolute PSA concentration \>=2 ng/mL., Baseline until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to approximately 25.4 months)|Phase 2: Time to Radiographic Disease Progression, Time to Radiographic Disease Progression was defined as (date of Radiographic Disease progression) - (date of first dose of drug) + 1. Radiographic disease progression is defined as the presence of progressive disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1) criteria and/or bone scan progression determined according to second Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) bone scan criteria., Baseline until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to approximately 25.4 months)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Objective Measurable Disease Response, Percentage of participants with objective measurable disease response based assessment of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease or PD according to RECIST (Version 1.1). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to less than (\<)10 millimeter (mm). A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters of non-lymph node lesions and of the short diameter(s) or short axis of lymph nodes., Baseline until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to approximately 25.4 months)|Phase 2: Change From Baseline in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), Baseline is defined as the last scheduled observed measurement prior to the first dose of drug., Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, Cycle 9 Day 1, Cycle 13 Day 1, Cycle 17 Day 1, Cycle 21 Day 1, End of treatment (approximately up to Cycle 48), Last assessment (30 days after last dose of study drug, approximately up to 1038 days)
