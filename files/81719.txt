Avoiding Low-value Treatments in Older Women With Early-stage Breast Cancer: Piloting a Patient Decision Aid
The aim of this study is to learn whether participants find a patient guide to breast cancer treatment decisions acceptable and appropriate for use.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Breast cancer decision aid
Acceptability of Intervention (AIM) Survey, AIM is a validated, 4-item survey with all items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (Completely Disagree \[1\] - Completely Agree \[5\]), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported., 1 week after receiving decision aid|Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), IAM is a validated, 4-item survey with all items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (Completely Disagree \[1\] - Completely Agree \[5\]), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported., 1 week after receiving decision aid|Engagement with the patient decision aid, To determine feasibility, participants will be asked whether they engaged with the patient decision aid (1=thoroughly, 2=somewhat or 3=not at all), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported., 1 week after receiving decision aid
Satisfaction with decision (SWD), The SWD survey will be administered by telephone between 60- and 120-days following surgery. SWD is a validated, 6-item survey with all items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (Completely Disagree \[1\] - Completely Agree \[5\]), scored as a mean. The median score across all participants will be reported., up to 120-days following surgery|Treatment choice, The research team will access participants electronic medical records to determine the number of participants who underwent SLNB, radiation treatment, both or neither after surgery. This will be reported in 4 categories: Only SLNB, Only Radiation, Both or Neither., 90 days after surgery
This study seeks to adapt and pilot test de-implementation strategies targeting low-value breast cancer treatments which have persisted despite national recommendations. Breast cancer is an ideal setting in which to study de-implementation given it is common, well-studied, typically presents at an early-stage, and care is provided primarily in a community setting.
