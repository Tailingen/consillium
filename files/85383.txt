Revealing Information Genuinely & Honestly Across Time - Communication Preferences Visit
The purpose of this research study is to obtain insights and feedback from patients and parents about a new approach to support conversations about how cancer may affect one's future life and quality of life (i.e., prognostic communication). This study involves creating a personalized approach to discussing prognosis.

Primary Objectives

* To evaluate the feasibility of implementing the RIGHTimeCPV intervention among pediatric oncology patients, caregivers, and clinicians (referred to herein as "shareholders").
* To assess the acceptability of the intervention across the shareholder groups.

Secondary Objectives

* To explore the potential impact of the RIGHTimeCPV intervention on communication quality, concordance in prognostic understanding, and therapeutic alliance between patients/families and multidisciplinary clinicians.
* To explore whether the practice of eliciting, sharing, and honoring individualized communication preferences is sustained by clinicians after participation in the RIGHTimeCPV intervention.

Feasibility of implementing the RIGHTimeCPV intervention, Quantitative findings of feasibility will be assessed using the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM). The FIM measure includes four itemized responses that are scored from one to five, such that one represents the lowest possible mean score and five the highest possible mean score. Feasibility is standardly considered to be achieved with a mean score ≥3 for this measure. Higher scores indicate greater perceived feasibility of the intervention., Between Day 1-30 after a Disease Reevaluation Visit (DRV) [participant specific] and again 6 months after the final DRV during study exit interviews [participant specific|Acceptability of implementing the RIGHTimeCPV intervention, Quantitative findings of acceptability will be assessed using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM). The AIM measure includes four itemized responses that are scored from one to five, such that one represents the lowest possible mean score and five the highest possible mean score. Acceptability is standardly considered to be achieved with a mean score ≥3 for this measure.

Potential impact of the RIGHTimeCPV intervention on communication quality, concordance in prognostic understanding, and therapeutic alliance between patients/families and multidisciplinary clinicians, This outcome will be assessed through generation of qualitative thematic findings. Specifically, qualitative data gathered from audio-recorded encounters at the Communication Preferences Visit (CPV) and DRV timepoints, as well as post-intervention interviews, will undergo rapid qualitative analysis and reflexive thematic analysis to explore participating patient, caregiver, and clinician impressions of the intervention's impact on communication quality, prognostic understanding, and therapeutic alliance between patients/caregivers and multidisciplinary clinicians., Between Day 1-30 after the CPV timepoint [participant specific], between Day 1-30 after the DRV timepoint [participant specific], and 6 months after the final DRV during study exit interviews [participant specific|Whether the practice of eliciting, sharing, and honoring individualized communication preferences is sustained by clinicians after participation in the RIGHTimeCPV intervention, Through analysis of the final post-intervention interview, the investigators will generate thematic findings related to participant perspectives on the intervention's impact on individual attitudes and behaviors and whether the practice of eliciting, sharing, and honoring individualized communication preferences was sustained by clinicians after participation in the RIGHTimeCPV intervention., 6 months after the final DRV during study exit interviews [participant specific
An estimated range of 52-85 total participants across all subject cohorts at St. Jude and participating affiliate sites, including 12-15 pediatric oncologists, 2-3 family units per participating oncologist (with an emphasis on dyadic recruitment within a given family unit, but also may include independent patients, independent caregivers, or a patient and multiple caregivers; estimated 15-25 patients and 15-25 parents), and 10-20 'communication preferences companions' (CPCs).

The RIGHTimeCPV intervention centers eliciting, sharing, and integrating individualized patient/parent preferences for prognostic communication into routine clinical practice through collaboration between multidisciplinary clinicians on the care team.

The intervention comprises five parts: 1) patient/parent identifies and selects a CPC; 2) CPC reviews intervention materials and conversation guide with the research team; 3) CPC and patient/parent meet for a CPV visit, and CPC documents patient/parent preferences in a templated form; 4) CPC and oncologist discuss the CPV form; 5) oncologist, patient/parent, and CPC attend next disease re-evaluation visit together.

Data will be collected at the following timepoints: 1) study enrollment (routine demographic information collected from each participant); 2) CPV 'conversation guide' training with CPC and research staff (audio-recorded encounter); 3) CPV with patient/parent and CPC (audio-recorded encounter); 4) during the period after a CPV and before the next disease re-evaluation encounter (brief survey and semi-structured interview for patients/parents and oncologists); 5) CPC-oncologist discussion to review the CPV form (email or audio-recorded encounter); 6) disease re-evaluation visit with patient/parent, oncologist, and CPC (audio-recorded encounter); 7) post-intervention interview (brief surveys for patients/parents and oncologists and semi-structured interviews for all participants); and 8) post-intervention interview six months after the final DRV (semi-structured interviews for all participants).
