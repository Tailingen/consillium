Study of Pemetrexed for Second-Line Pancreas Cancer
This study is for patients with pancreatic cancer that has grown and/or spread after having previously received the standard chemotherapy drug called gemcitabine.

In this study a drug called pemetrexed is being tested. This drug is approved by the FDA for use in lung cancer and mesothelioma. The purpose of this study is to see if pemetrexed keeps pancreas cancer that has grown and/or spread after gemcitabine from growing. Subjects will receive pemetrexed IV once every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable side effects occur.
Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed
Progression-free Survival, Number of days from first dose of study treatment until the date of progression, as measured by worsening disease (new site of disease, or increase in existing disease) or death., 6 months after last patient enrolled
Objective Response, Evaluation of tumor extent by CT scans, according to RECIST criteria (a 20% decrease in the sum of the longest unidimensional measurements of existing disease), version 1.0, Within two months of the completion of the last dose of chemotherapy|CA 19-9 Response, CA 19-9 was evaluatd every three weeks, before the next study treatment. Approximately 30% of patients are not expected to have detectable CA 19-9, based on Lews-Y antigen. CA 19-9 response is defined as more than 50% decrease from baseline., Within two months of the last dose of chemotherapy|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Toxicity by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event Version 3.0, 30 days after last dose of study drug
This is an open label Phase II trial using pemetrexed as second-line treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer progressing within six months of prior gemcitabine-based therapy. Subjects will receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
