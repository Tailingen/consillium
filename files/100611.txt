Arsenic Trioxide TACE and Intravenous Administration in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether compared with arsenic trioxide TACE alone, arsenic trioxide TACE and intravenous administration could further prolong the overall survival.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DEVICE: Arsenic trioxide TACE|DRUG: Arsenic trioxide intravenous infusion|DRUG: lipiodol|DRUG: NaCl solution
Time to Progression, Time to progression in our study is defined as the time from a patient's enrollment to the time for disease progression (according to Recist1.1)., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.
Overall Survival, Overall survival in our study is defined as the time from a patient's enrollment to the time for death., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.|Quality of Life, Quality of life is assessed according to the FACT-Hep questionnaire., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.|Safety, Safety of our treatment plan will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events（CTCAE） 3.0, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.
Extrahepatic Metastasis Rate, Extrahepatic metastasis rate is defined as the proportion of the extrahepatic metastasis for patients who were absent of extrahepatic metastasis at enrollment., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.|Recurrence Rate, Recurrence rate is defined as the proportion of the recurrence in the patients., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether compared with arsenic trioxide TACE alone, arsenic trioxide TACE and intravenous administration could further prolong the overall survival.
