A Pilot Study of Tumor-Derived Exosomes as Diagnostic and Prognostic Markers in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a pilot study evaluating the use of tumor derived exosomes as a marker for response to therapy in women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer. Tumor derived exosome analysis may be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biosignature in breast cancer, which could prove to be a tool for earlier diagnosis, more effective treatments, and improved markers of response in order to increase survival rates.
Breast Neoplasms
To characterize protein surface markers and RNA profiles in tumor derived exosomes from breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Compare tumor derived exosomes at baseline, monthly during chemotherapy, at the completion of chemotherapy treatment, and after surgery to determine residual cancer burden. Tumor derived exosome expression will be correlated with both clinical and pathologic response., up to 2 years from start of study
