The Pancreas Interception Center (PIC) for Early Detection, Prevention, and Novel Therapeutics
The long-term goal of our PIC is to develop effective strategies that can be applied clinically at the point-of-care to prevent, intercept, or detect PDAC at an early stage, thereby reducing PDAC burden and saving lives.

OTHER: Data collection
Database creation, A centralized, real-time, queryable and secure database will be developed that will integrate data on Moffitt patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), pancreatic cystic lesions (benign, pre-cancerous and malignant), or an inherited PDAC susceptibility., 24 months
