Efficacy and Safety of Pola-RCHP-X Vs Pola-RCHP in Untreated DLBCL
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of genotype-guided targeted agents in combination with polatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (Pola RCHP-X) versus Pola RCHP in Chinese patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Polatuzumab vedotin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Decitabine
Progression-free survival（by IRC）, PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse using the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first; as determined by the investigator, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier (up to 24 months)
Progression-free survival（by the investigator）, PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse using the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first; as determined by the investigator, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier (up to 24 months)|Event-free survival, defined as the time from date of randomization to the earliest occurrence of any of the following:

Disease progression/relapse as determined by the investigator and IRC (separately) Death due to any cause The primary efficacy reason determined by the investigator, other than disease progression/relapse, that leads to initiation of NALT If biopsy is obtained after treatment completion and is positive for residual disease regardless of whether NALT is initiated or not, up to approximately 24 months|Complete response rate, CR rate at the end of treatment by FDG-PET defined as the proportion of participants with CR at the end of treatment according to the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria; as determined by the investigator and IRC (separately), End of treatment visit (6-8 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6 [Cycle length=21 days]|Objective response rate, ORR at treatment completion or discontinuation defined as the proportion of participants with partial response (PR) or CR at the end of treatment according to the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria; as determined by the investigator and IRC(separately), End of treatment visit (6-8 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6 [Cycle length=21 days]|Overall survival, OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., From enrollment to study completion, a maximum of 3 years
