Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Breast Cancer That is Metastatic or Cannot be Treated With Surgery
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating women who have breast cancer that is metastatic or cannot be treated with surgery.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: fluorouracil
To determine the response rate to this combination after two to four courses of Docetaxel (Taxotere) And 5-Fluorouracil, 28 weeks
To evaluate toxicities of Docetaxel (Taxotere) And 5-Fluorouracil, 28 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate in women with locally unresectable or metastatic breast cancer treated with docetaxel, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as second or third-line chemotherapy.
* Evaluate the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and leucovorin calcium IV over 1 hour followed by fluorouracil IV over 5 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 44 months.
