A Study of Duvelisib in Participants With Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This was a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib as a monotherapy in participants with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) (follicular lymphoma \[FL\], marginal zone lymphoma, or small lymphocytic lymphoma) that was refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT).
Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Duvelisib
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the total percentage of participants who had a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), was evaluated locally (investigator's assessment) according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. ORR is reported with a 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval., Every 8-16 weeks while on treatment with duvelisib for up to 72 months
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A TEAE was defined as any adverse event that emerged or worsened in the period from the first dose of study treatment to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Every 2-8 weeks for up to 73 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the first documentation of response to either progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, was evaluated locally (investigator's assessment) according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., Every 8-16 weeks for up to 72 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of either Investigator-assessed PD or death resulting from any cause, was evaluated locally (investigator's assessment) according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., Every 8-16 weeks for up to 72 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of death, was evaluated locally (investigator's assessment) according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., Every 16 weeks for up to 72 months|Plasma Concentration of Duvelisib and IPI-656, The serum concentration of duvelisib and its main metabolite, IPI-656, are reported for Day 15 of Cycle 1 (C1D15) and Day 1 of Cycle 2 (C2D1) and Day 1 of Cycle 3 (C3D1). Results are reported in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL)., Every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (C1D15: predose, 1 and 4 hours post dose; C2D1 and C3D1: anytime during study visit)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of response, was evaluated by an independent, third-party panel of radiologists and oncologists (Independent Review Committee \[IRC\]) according to the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., First dose to first documentation of complete or partial response (up to 6 months)
This was an open-label, single-arm safety and efficacy study of duvelisib administered orally to participants who had been diagnosed with iNHL whose disease was refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or RIT.

Approximately 120 participants received 25 milligrams of duvelisib twice daily over the course of 28-day treatment cycles for up to 13 cycles.

After completing 13 treatment cycles of duvelisib, participants continued to receive additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, to receive additional cycles of duvelisib beyond 13 cycles, participants must have had evidence of response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) or stable disease according to the International Working Group criteria by the end of Cycle 13.
