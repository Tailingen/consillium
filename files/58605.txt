Phase II Study of Whole or Partial Parotid Sparing Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy in Patients With Head and Neck Cancers
Phase II and III studies have demonstrated IMRT to be safe and standard practice for head and neck cancers treated with radiotherapy. This study will be an extension to an earlier, in-house, trial to allow continued recording of toxicities and outcomes in patients receiving IMRT for head and neck cancers. This study will allow us to examine radiobiological modelling for normal tissue complication probability and in particular, determining the dose threshold for parotid glands. Our primary objective is to assess the potential effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in reducing xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients and determining threshold dose for whole parotid gland and superficial lobes of parotid glands
