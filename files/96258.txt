Radiotherapy or Observation of Liver Metastases in Small Cell Lung Cancer
The aim of this randomized study is to investigate local tumor control,survival outcomes and complications on patients of liver metastasis in small cell lung cancer.
Radiotherapy; Complications
RADIATION: Radiotherpy will be performed to thoracic and liver metastasis after chemotherapy.
Intrahepatic progression -free survial(Intrahepatic-PFS), Intrahepatic progression -free survial is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression of hepatic metastasis., UP to 5years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause., UP to 5years
Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death,whichever occurs first., UP to 5years|Adverse events(toxicities), The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE 4.0) will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., UP to 5years
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a kind of disease with high degree of malignancy and poor prognosis.Based on the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy, the treatment of primary lesions and whole brain radiotherapy can bring survival benefits to patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.Patients with liver metastasis have a worse prognosis than those with other organ metastases.Local radiotherapy for patients with liver metastasis may have a better prognosis.However, clinical data of the safety and efficacy of whole liver radiotherapy for liver metastasis are still lacking.The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of liver metastatic radiotherapy in small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
