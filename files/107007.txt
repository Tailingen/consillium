Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel-loaded TPM for Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
A first-in-human, unblinded, phase I trial of Paclitaxel-loaded tumor penetrating microparticles (TPM) in peritoneal carcinomatosis patients who are not eligible for standard-of-care therapeutic interventions.
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: Paclitaxel-loaded tumor penetrating microparticles
Assess safety of intraperitoneal Paclitaxel-loaded Tumor Penetrating Microparticles (TPM), The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by system organ class and/or preferred term, type of adverse event, severity (based on NCI CTCAE v5.0 grades), and relation to study treatment using the safety population., 12 Weeks|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal Paclitaxel-loaded Tumor Penetrating Microparticles (TPM), Dose escalation will proceed using an accelerated titration design (ATD). Subjects will be observed for 4 weeks after the first course of TPM treatment for any potential dose limiting toxicities (DLT). The MTD is defined as the highest dose level for which at most 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT., 4 Weeks
Assess potential therapeutic efficacy of intraperitoneal Paclitaxel-loaded Tumor Penetrating Microparticles (TPM), Tumor response will be measured by RECIST v1.1 to determine potential effective doses of intraperitoneal Paclitaxel-loaded TPM., 12 Weeks|Measure area-under-drug concentration-time curve of Paclitaxel and tumor penetrating microparticles (TPM) in blood and peritoneal fluid, Paclitaxel-loaded TPM pharmacokinetics will be described using summary statistics, such as mean and range, and graphical displays., 8 Weeks|Measure maximum drug concentration of Paclitaxel and tumor penetrating microparticles (TPM) in blood and peritoneal fluid, Paclitaxel-loaded TPM pharmacokinetics will be described using summary statistics, such as mean and range, and graphical displays., 8 Weeks|Assess whether Paclitaxel-loaded Tumor Penetrating Microparticles (TPM) induce immune response in the peritoneal cavity, The presence or absence of T cell infiltration in peritoneal cavity., 8 Weeks|Assess whether intra-abdominal pressure is location-dependent, Intra-abdominal hydrostatic pressures at various intraperitoneal locations will be measured at the time of laparoscopy, Day 1 on study
This is a first in human study of Paclitaxel-loaded TPM, suspended in 0.5 L of 0.1% polysorbate 80 in normal saline instilled into the peritoneal cavity.

An enrolled patient will (a) undergo laparoscopy during which time the hydrostatic pressures at different locations within the peritoneal cavity are measured, pretreatment tumors are biopsied and peritoneal catheter is placed, (b) receive intraperitoneal TPM during index hospital stay, and (c) followed-up to evaluate treatment-related toxicity and response. The pharmacokinetics of TPM and paclitaxel in peritoneal fluid and systemic blood samples will be measured. Second dose of TPM is given in clinic if no disease progression or significant AEs.

This is a dose escalation study. Dose escalation will proceed using an accelerated titration design (ATD) with intra-patient dose escalation.

In the event either:

* 1 patient exhibits DLT during the first course of treatment or
* 2 patients exhibit grade 2 study drug-related (attribution of probable or definite) toxicity during the first course of treatment.

The design switches to a standard 3+3 design at the dose that triggered the switch-two additional patients are accrued at this dose level. Decisions on when and how to escalate if the design switches to a 3+3 are described in the protocol section 6.3
