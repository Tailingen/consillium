Exploring Accessible Beauty for Individuals With Upper Extremity Deficits
The purpose of this study is to investigate the accessibility of beauty products for individuals with upper extremity disabilities. By examining various factors such as packaging design, product applicators, and ease of use, this research aims to identify barriers faced by individuals with upper extremity disabilities or visual deficits when using beauty products. The study seeks to provide insights and recommendations for improving the accessibility of beauty products, ultimately promoting inclusivity and enhancing the overall beauty experience for individuals with disabilities.

Likert Scale, It is a validated self-reported instrument to assess packaging of the makeup. A few questions will focus on shape of the cap, length of the wand, shape of the doe foot, finish of the components, how it affects grip, and weight of the component/applicator. Possible scores range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)., Complete on Day 7|Likert Scale, It is a validated self-reported instrument to assess packaging of the makeup.

Individuals with upper extremity disabilities face unique challenges when it comes to using beauty products. These disabilities can include conditions such as limb loss, limited mobility, or dexterity impairments, which can significantly impact their ability to engage in self-care and beauty routines. The accessibility of beauty products is crucial to ensure that individuals with upper extremity disabilities have equal opportunities to participate in activities that promote self-expression and confidence.

Research in the field of accessible design has highlighted the importance of inclusive product development across various industries, including cosmetics and personal care. However, limited attention has been given specifically to beauty products and their usability for individuals with upper extremity disabilities.

To address this gap, studies are being conducted to assess the accessibility of beauty products and identify potential barriers and solutions. These studies typically examine factors such as packaging design, ergonomics of product applicators, ease of grip, and maneuverability. By understanding the specific challenges faced by individuals with upper extremity disabilities, researchers can propose modifications and design considerations that enhance accessibility.
