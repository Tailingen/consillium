Single High-dose Brachytherapy for Giant Osteosarcoma Masses
This study is a prospective, single-arm, phase II, single-center study. Patients with locally unresectable giant osteosarcoma masses who meet the criteria are enrolled in the experimental group, and all patients receive a single dose of 10Gy of implantable brachytherapy. Record treatment-related acute events during and after treatment. Follow up on survival and local control after treatment ends, marking the end of the trial treatment.

Screening period: Local MRI or CT examination, blood routine and coagulation function test.

Selected treatment period: All enrolled patients received one dose of close range interstitial radiotherapy with a radiation dose of 10 Gy. The number of insertion needles depends on the size and location of the tumor. The instrument used for radiotherapy is the Medda high-dose rate brachytherapy machine, and the radiation source is 192 iridium. Record treatment related acute events such as bleeding during the treatment period.

Follow up: Follow up with local MRI or CT at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the end of radiotherapy treatment to evaluate the treatment effect; Simultaneously follow up with patients for survival and treatment related adverse reactions, such as dermatitis, infections, etc.
