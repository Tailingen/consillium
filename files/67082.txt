Cilengitide, Temozolomide, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma and Unmethylated Gene Promoter Status
CORE is a Phase 2 clinical trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma in subjects with an unmethylated O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter in the tumor tissue.

The MGMT gene promoter is a section of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that acts as a controlling element in the expression of MGMT. Methylation of the MGMT gene promoter has been found to appear to be a predictive marker for benefit from temozolomide (TMZ) treatment.

In a safety run-in period in dedicated study centers, the safety and tolerability of Cilengitide given as an intense treatment in combination with the first part of standard therapy will be assessed. Thereafter the trial will investigate the overall survival and progression-free survival in subjects receiving two different regimens of Cilengitide in combination with standard treatment versus standard treatment alone.

Overall Survival (OS) Time, The OS time is defined as the time (in months) from randomization to death or last day known to be alive. Participants without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whatever is earlier., Time from randomization to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant randomized, that is, Jun 2009 until cut-off date, (07 Feb 2013)
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time - Investigator and Independent Read, The PFS time is defined as the duration from randomization to either first observation of progressive disease (PD) or occurrence of death due to any cause. Investigator read is the assessment of all imaging by the treating physician at the local trial site. Independent Read is the assessment of all imaging centrally by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)., Time from randomization to disease progression, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first participant randomized, that is, Jun 2009 until cut-off date, (07 Feb 2013)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), The Cmax for cilengitide was calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) and Terminal Elimination Half-Life (t1/2), The Tmax and t1/2 for cilengitide were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC [0-infinity]) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC [0-24]), The AUC (0-infinity) and AUC (0-24) for cilengitide were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Plasma Concentration at Pre-dose (Cpre) and Plasma Concentration at End of Infusion (CT), The Cpre and CT for cilengitide were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Apparent Terminal Rate Constant, The apparent terminal rate constant for cilengitide was calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Mean Residence Time From Time 0 to Infinity (MRT [0-infinity]), The MRT (0-infinity) for cilengitide was calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Plasma Clearance (CL), The CL for cilengitide was calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Apparent Volume of Distribution During the Terminal Phase (Vz) and Apparent Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss), The Vz (after single dose) and Vss (after repeated doses) for cilengitide were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using the computer program WinNonlin, Version 6.2. Cilengitide plasma concentrations were determined after dosing on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 5 (repeated doses) of Week 1., Days 1 and 5 of Week 1|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs, Treatment-Related AEs, Treatment-Related Serious AEs, AEs Leading to Death, Treatment-Related AEs Leading to Death, AEs of Grade 3 or 4 and Treatment-Related AEs of Grade 3 or 4, An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs are the events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study treatment. A Serious AE is an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-related AEs are the AEs which are suspected to be reasonably related to the study treatment (cilengitide, or radiotherapy, or temozolomide) as per investigator assessment. The severity of AEs was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTCAE) (Version 3.0): Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life threatening or disabling. Note: Death (Grade 5) was regarded as an outcome., Time from first dose up to 28 days after last dose of study treatment, reported between day of first participant randomized, that is, Jun 2009 until cut-off date (07 Feb 2013)|Number of Participants With AEs Belonging to Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQs) Thromboembolic Events and Hemorrhage With NCI-CTC Toxicity Grade 3 or 4, Thromboembolic events (standardized MedDRA query \[SMQ\]) Grade 3 or 4 AEs encompassed hemiparesis and cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. Thromboembolic events (SMQ) of any grade and of Grade 3 or 4 were generally more frequent in the Cilengitide + Temozolomide/Radiotherapy group than in the Temozolomide/Radiotherapy group but were still in the expected range of this patient population The severity of AEs was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTCAE) (version 3.0): Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life threatening or disabling.
