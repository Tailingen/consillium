Study of Crenolanib for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced GIST With the D842-related Mutations and Deletions in the PDGFRA Gene
This Phase II study is designed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and pharmacokinetics of crenolanib (CP-868,596) in patients with D842-related mutant metastatic GIST.
D842-related Mutant GIST
DRUG: Crenolanib besylate (CP-868,596-26), Dose: 140mg BID
The primary end-point is overall response rate, To determine the response rate of patients with advanced D842V mutant GIST, when treated with Crenolanib (CP-868,596). Response will primarily be determined by RECIST criteria, 1.5 years

Crenolanib (CP-868,596) is an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of PDGFR receptor tyrosine kinase with IC50s of 0.4 ng/mL and 0.8 ng/mL for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, respectively.

In preclinical models of cell lines with the D842V mutation in the PDGFRA gene, crenolanib (CP-868,596) blocked phosphorylation of PDGFRα at nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that it may provide a clinical benefit to patients with D842V mutant GIST.

In addition, crenolanib was also active in inhibiting phosphorylation of cell lines with two point mutations (double mutants) PDGFRA V561D + D842V and PDGFRA T674I + D842V.
