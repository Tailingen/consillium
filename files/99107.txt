Prognostic Impact of Programmed Death Ligand-1 Expression in Advanced Endometrial Cancer
The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of PD-L1 expression in stage III-IV ECs and to investigate its correlation impact with progression-free survival (PFS), and clinicopathological features including microsatellite instability and quantified stromal and intraepithelial tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes (TILs)
