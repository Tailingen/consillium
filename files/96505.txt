Artificial Intelligence Prediction Tool in Thymic Epithelial Tumors
Thymic epithelial tumors are rare neoplasms in the anterior mediastinum. The cornerstone of the treatment is surgical resection. Administration of postoperative radiotherapy is usually indicated in patients with more extensive local disease, incomplete resection and/or more aggressive subtypes, defined by the WHO histopathological classification.

In this classification thymoma types A, AB, B1, B2, B3, and thymic carcinoma are distinguished. Studies have shown large discordances between pathologists in subtyping these tumors. Moreover, the WHO classification alone does not accurately predict the risk of recurrence, as within subtypes patients have divergent prognoses.

The investigators will develop AI models using digital pathology and relevant clinical variables to improve the accuracy of histopathological classification of thymic epithelial tumors, and to better predict the risk of recurrence.

In this multicentric and international project three existing databases will be used from Rotterdam, Maastricht and Lyon. For all models one database will be used to build AI models, and the other two for external validation.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop AI models that support the pathologist in correctly subtyping thymic epithelial tumors, in order to prevent patients from under- or overtreatment with adjuvant radiotherapy.

WP1 - Databases/Data Pre-processing, The EMC-dataset includes 179 TET-patients classified by experienced TET-pathologists. Cases with good agreement between pathologists will be used for training AI-models. Evaluation includes digitized pathology slides assessed by an international expert-panel. The MUMC-database (137 patients) and CHUL-database (181 patients) provide additional data, including clinical variables. Relevant factors include age, gender, tumor volume, stage, completeness of resection, autoimmune disorders, and treatment details., M1-M18
WP2 - Deep Learning-Model for TET Classification and Recurrence Prediction, This outcome aims to create an AI-framework with two principal goals. First, investigate TET-subtypes using four different models emphasizing cell type, morphological structures, and a combination. Second, classify patients based on recurrence outcome within 5 years. An ablation study will be conducted with state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers (ResNet, Inception)., M6-M32
WP3: Clinical Evaluation, AI-models 1-3 will be built and validated on the EMC-database, while AI-model 4 will be built on the MUMC+-database and validated on both. Model performance will be assessed using sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive value. Decision analysis curves will quantify the clinical benefit, identifying patient groups with the largest utility., M6-M36
