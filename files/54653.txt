Value of Pleural Lavage Cytology in Resectable Esophageal Carcinoma Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Projects 2005, ECTOP-2005)
Disease recurrence and metastasis are common after curative treatment for patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, it is important to identify the risk factors to predict disease recurrence and metastasis. Pleural lavage cytology (PLC) is reported to be associated with disease recurrence and patient survival in lung cancer, but the value is unclear in esophageal cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of PLC in esophageal cancer patient in terms of frequencies, association with patient survival, and efficacy of postoperative treatment.
Esophageal Cancer
OTHER: pleural lavage
number of patients who had positive pleural lavage cytology, Frequency of positive pleural lavage cytology in resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, July 2022 to July 2023
Time period from date of surgery to the date of death, value of pleural lavage cytology in predict patient survival, July 2022 to July 2026
Pleural lavage cytology will be performed before esophageal resection, and after resection, respectively. Frequency of positive pleural lavage cytology will be determined, and the value of pleural lavage cytology for patients with resectable esophageal cancer will be studied.
