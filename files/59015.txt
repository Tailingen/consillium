CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for HCC Targeting GPC3
The purpose of this study is to preliminarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell immunotherapy for GPC3 positive hepatocellular carcinoma.
GPC3 Positive Hepatocellular Carcinoma|CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T cell immunotherapy
Radiological assessment, Radiological assessment of the therapeutic effect by systemic or local computed Tomography(CT) or positron emission tomography scan., 3 months
The safety of CAR-T cell immunotherapy (adverse events), After CAR-T cell infusion,we will observe the potential adverse events related to the T-cell infusion such as high fever,jaundice, kidney failure and so on., 4 weeks|Peripheral blood tumor markers, tested regularly to reflect the role of the Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cell in the removal of residual tumor cells., 3 months|CAR-T cell testing, The level of CAR-T cells will be tested regularly by Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Detecting System(qPCR) or Flow cytometry to evaluate the proliferation in vivo and long-term survival., 3 months
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant receptor with both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic malignancies and solid malignant tumors.This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen receptor targeting glypican-3(GPC3) antigen.After CAR-T cell infusion,At periodic intervals, the investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.Through this study,the investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with GPC3 positive malignant glioma patients.
