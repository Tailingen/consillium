Individualization of Nutritive Sensory Support Of Radiation Therapy
Nutritional deficiency and subsequent weight loss in patients with head and neck cancer is a common problem and a negative predictor of treatment outcomes and mortality, as well as quality of life. Nutritional support for patients is a prerequisite for the successful management of cancer patients. Sensory changes can be side effects of chemotherapy or ionizing radiation, which damages sensory receptors in the area of radiation, disrupts the function of the salivary glands, leading to hyposalivation and a decrease in taste. Individual choice of nutrition based on sensory sensations can significantly improve the quality of life of patients and ensure timely correction of their eating behavior.
