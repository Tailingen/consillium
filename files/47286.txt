Lenalidomide in Subject With Low and Intermediate-1 Risk MDS and Without Chromosome 5 Abnormality.
The goal of the present study is to assess, through a randomized phase II trial, the efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide with or without Epoetin beta in transfusion-dependent, ESA-resistant, IPSS low and intermediate-1 risk MDS patients without chromosome 5 abnormality.

Patients will receive either Lenalidomide alone or Lenalidomide and Epoetin beta for 4 months. Responders will be eligible for maintenance treatment with cycles identical to the first cycles, until relapse occurs or until unacceptable toxicity.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Epoetin beta
Comparing the efficacy of Lenalidomide alone to Lenalidomide with Epoetin beta in transfusion-dependent ESA-resistant, Primary outcome is a complete or partial response defined by the IWG 2006 criteria observed after 4 months of treatment. Comparison in the rate of response between the two groups will be performed with Chi-square test or if necessary Fisher exact test.

Same analyzes will be performed with the IWG 2000 response definition ., After 4 months of treatment
will be to assess the safety of Lenalidomide and of its combination with Epoetin beta, * Safety of Lenalidomide and of its combination with Epoetin beta: adverse events (type, frequency, severity) and relationship of adverse events to study drug
* % of major HI-E and minor HI-E after 4 courses according to IWG 2000 criteria
* Erythroid response duration
* Time to response
* Time to progression according to IPSS
* RBC transfusion independence
* Prognostic factors of response
* Survival
* Quality of life, After 2 months of treatment
This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, Phase II study.

Patients will be treated either with arm A or B

* Arm A: Lenalidomide 10 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days for 4 courses.
* Arm B: Lenalidomide 10 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days for 4 courses combined with weekly subcutaneous injections of Epoetin beta (60,000 Units/w).

Evaluation of response at the end of 4 months according to IWG 2006 and IWG 2000 criteria.

Maintenance: responders will continue to follow the corresponding treatment arm until relapse occurs; non responders at Evaluation of response at the end of 4 months according to IWG 2006 and IWG 2000 criteria.

in arm A will be considered in failure of treatment and the introduction of Epoetin beta is at the discretion of the physician.

The patients will be followed every 3 months for 12 months
