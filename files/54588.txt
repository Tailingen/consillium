An Open-label Study Examining the Effect of tomivosertib (eFT508) in Patients with Advanced Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
DRUG: eFT508
Anti-tumor Response as Defined by a Patient Achieving Either of the Following Outcomes:, * A ≥50% PSA decline from baseline at any time point after therapy and maintained for ≥4 weeks
* Objective response according to iRECIST 1.1, 52 weeks
PSA Progression-free Survival From Start of Study Therapy Until the Date PSA Progression is First Observed., PSA progression is defined as a ≥25% increase in PSA from nadir or baseline (and by ≥2 ng/mL) and requires confirmation ≥3 weeks later., 52 weeks
This Phase 2 study examines the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of tomivosertib (eFT508) in advanced CRPC patients who have documented PSA progression on treatment with apalutamide and/or abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and for whom no suitable curative therapy exists.
