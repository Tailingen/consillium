De-escalation Protocols in Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of image guided de-escalation protocols in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). So the investigators studied whether toxicities reducing treatment with omitted concurrent chemotherapy after good response to induction chemotherapy would maintain survival outcomes while improving tolerability for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
