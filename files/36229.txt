Amgen 386 for Recurrent Glioblastoma
Primary Objectives

Cohort A -- monotherapy:

To determine the efficacy of AMG 386 in participants with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6)

Cohort B - combination therapy:

Phase I To determine the maximum tolerated dose of AMG 386 in combination with bevacizumab given at 10mg/kg every 2 weeks in participants with recurrent glioblastoma.

Phase II To determine the efficacy of AMG 386 plus bevacizumab in participants with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6).

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate radiographic response in both cohort populations. To evaluate overall survival in both cohort populations. To assess time-to-progression in both cohort populations. To investigate the safety profile in both cohort populations.

Exploratory Objectives:

To evaluate expression of factors associated with tumor angiogenesis using a multiples cytokine assay among participants undergoing therapy with AMG 386 with response to therapy and development of resistance.

This is an open-label Phase I/II study of AMG 386 monotherapy and AMG 386 in combination with bevacizumab. Two cohorts will accrue and will be assessed sequentially. Each cohort will enroll participants with recurrent GBM. Cohort A will assess recurrent GBM participants who receive AMG 386 monotherapy at 30 g/kg every week. (Cohort A initially accrued at a dose of 15mg/kg, but this was increased to 30 mg/kg every week following an amendment). Cohort B will assess recurrent GBM participants who receive weekly AMG 386 plus bi-weekly bevacizumab (10mg/kg). Cohort B will start with a Phase I component to determine the MTD of AMG 386 that is safe when used in combination with bevacizumab. AMG 386 is administered intravenously, and, when used in combination with intravenous bevacizumab, will be administered first.

Patients will be required to come to the clinic weekly for study drug administration.

For study purposes, a cycle of therapy will be 4 weeks. Treatment will continue until either evidence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.

The estimated rate of accrual is 60 participants per year. The estimated date of accrual completion is 1.5 years from study initiation. The estimated date of study completion will be approximately 12 months from enrollment of the last study participant.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Amgen 386|DRUG: Bevacizumab
6-Month Progression-Free Survival (PFS6) [Cohort A and Cohort B], PFS6 is the proportion of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 6-months from study entry. Progressive disease was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (Wen et al JCO 2010). RANO criteria has 5 potential categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive disease (PD) and Unknown status. CR: disappearance of all enhancing lesions, stable or improved non-enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PR: \>= 50% decrease in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, no progression of non-measurable disease, stable or improved non- enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PD: \> 25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition. SD: d, 6 months|AMG 386 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [Cohort B Phase I], The MTD of weekly AMG 386 intravenously (IV) in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle is determined by the number of participants who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached but the highest dose received may be the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)., Participants were assessed weekly while on study; the observation period for MTD evaluation was the first 28 days of study treatment.|AMG 386 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Cohort B Phase I], A DLT is defined as an adverse event that (a) is related to the AMG 386 and/or bevacizumab with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite, and (b) occurs during and/or begins during the first 28 days of the study treatment, and (c) meets any of the following criteria: \>= grade 3 thrombocytopenia; grade 4 neutropenia lasting \> 7 days; grade 4 anemia lasting \> 7 days despite transfusion or growth factors; febrile neutropenia if ANC\<0.5x10\^9/L; clinically significant grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity despite maximal medical therapy lasting \> 7 days, with the exception of grade 3 proteinuria which was considered a DLT if lasting \> 14 days; grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity resulting in study drug discontinuation; grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity; \>= grade 1 new CNS hemorrhage; \>= grade 2 non-CNS hemorrhage., Participants were assessed weekly while on study; the observation period for DLT evaluation was the first 28 days of study treatment.
Best Radiographic Response [Cohort A and Cohort B], Radiographic response was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (Wen et al JCO 2010) with 5 potential categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive disease (PD) and Unknown status. CR: disappearance of all enhancing lesions, stable or improved non-enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PR: \>= 50% decrease in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, no progression of non-measurable disease, stable or improved non- enhancing lesions, and stable or improved clinically. PD: \> 25% increase in sum of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, significant increase of non-enhancing lesions, any new lesions, clear clinical deterioration, failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition. SD: does not qualify for CR, PR or PD, stable non-enhancing lesions, and stable clinically., Disease was assessed radiographically for response every 8 weeks.|Overall Survival (OS) [Cohort A and Cohort B], OS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive., Participants were followed long-term for survival every 3 to 4 months from the end of treatment until death or lost to follow-up. On Cohort A and B participants were followed up to 554 days and 442 days.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) [Cohort A and Cohort B], PFS based on Kaplan-Meier is defined as the time from study entry to the earliest documentation of disease progression or death. Progressive disease was established based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (Wen et al JCO 2010)., Disease was assessed radiographically to document clinical progression every cycle on treatment and post-treatment every 8 weeks. On Cohort A and B participants were followed for progression up to 36 days and 166 days.
