Phase I/IIa Study of AZD5335 as Monotherapy and Combination Therapy in Participants With Solid Tumors
This research is designed to determine if experimental treatment with Antibody-drug conjugate, AZD5335, alone, or in combination with anti-cancer agents is safe, tolerable, and has anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced tumors

Participants who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST v1.1 assessment, From time of first dose of AZD5335 or AZD5305 until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression).(approx 2 years)|Overall Survival (OS), The time until death due to any cause., From time of first dose of AZD5335 or AZD5305 until death due to any cause.(approx 2 years)|Module 1: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335: Area Under the concentration-time curve(AUC), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335(approximately 12 weeks)|Module 1: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335: Maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug, From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 1: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335: Time to maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (T-max), Time to maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug, From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 1: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335: Clearance, A pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma from which the study drug is completely removed per unit time., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 1: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335: Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), Terminal elimination half life., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 (approximately 12 weeks)|Immunogenicity of AZD5335, The number and percentage of participants who develop ADAs., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5535.(approx 2 years)|Module 1: To investigate baseline and on treatment changes in target expression., The clinical activity by baseline and on-treatment changes in tumor target expression., Baseline and predicted intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335(approx 2 years)|Module 2: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335 and AZD5305 when given in combination., The plasma concentrations of AZD5335, total antibody, and total unconjugated payload., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 and AZD5305.(approx 12 weeks)|Module 2, 3, and 4: Area Under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 2, 3, and 4: Maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug, At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 2, 3, and 4: Time to maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (T-max), Time to maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug, At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 2, 3, and 4: Clearance, A pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma from which the study drug is completely removed per unit time., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 2, 3, and 4: Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), Terminal elimination half life., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 (approximately 12 weeks)|Module 3: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335 and bevaczizumab when given in combination., The plasma concentrations of AZD5335, total antibody, and total unconjugated payload., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 and bevacizumab.(approx 12 weeks)|Module 4: Pharmacokinetics of AZD5335 and carboplatin (+/- bevacizumab) when given in combination., The plasma concentrations of AZD5335, total antibody, and total unconjugated payload., From the first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of AZD5335 and carboplatin (+/- bevacizumab).(approx 12 weeks)
