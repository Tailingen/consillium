Docetaxel Versus Intercalated Erlotinib-docetaxel in Patients With Relapsed EGFR Wild Type, ALK Negative Non Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of docetaxel monotherapy and the combination of docetaxel intercalated erlotinib in patients with relapsed EGFR wild type, ALK negative non squamous cell carcinoma.
Carcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Erlotinib
progression free survival, from the date of randomization to the first date of progression of disease or of death from any cause up to 24 months after last treatment administration
quantitative and qualitative adverse events, Adverse events will be graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.03, from the date of randomization until resolution or stabilization of the event and up to 30 days after the last study medication/treatment|response rates, Every six weeks from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause up to 24 months after last treatment administration|duration of response, from the date of the first objective status assessment of a complete or partial response to the first date of progression of disease or death from any cause up to 24 months after last treatment administration|overall survival, Evaluation of overall survival (OS), from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause up to 24 months after last treatment administration
Erlotinib dose level variance in blood, Therefore in patients on erlotinib every 6 weeks through dose levels in blood will be determined, Every six weeks from randomisation up until last treatment administration (up until 48 weeks)
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of docetaxel monotherapy and the combination of docetaxel intercalated erlotinib in patients with relapsed EGFR wild type, ALK negative non squamous cell carcinoma.

As pemetrexed is standard first line treatment, the combination of erlotinib docetaxel in non-squamous NSCLC should be investigated as second line treatment. Also the question has to be answered whether the combination outperforms monotherapy treatments.

After stratification for ECOG-performance status (0-1), response to prior treatment (CR, PR, SD versus PD), treatment free interval after platinum based therapy (\<6 months versus \>6 months) and maintenance, patients will be centrally randomized to receive either docetaxel (arm A) or docetaxel plus erlotinib (arm B).
