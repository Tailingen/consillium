Epoetin Alfa in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (EPO-CAN-20)
The general objective of this study is to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) of selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the lung. The specific objective is to evaluate the effect of treatment with epoetin alfa (recombinant human erythropoietin) on anemia related QoL and anemia in non-small cell lung cancer patients with advanced stage disease and underlying anemia of malignancy.
