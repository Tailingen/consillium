Educational Intervention in Increasing Knowledge About Prostate Cancer in High-Risk Neighborhoods
This clinical trial studies how well an educational intervention works in increasing knowledge about prostate cancer in high-risk neighborhoods. Learning about prostate cancer and the pros and cons of screening for prostate cancer may increase knowledge about prostate cancer while decreasing anxiety and concerns about prostate cancer screening.
Prostate
OTHER: Educational Intervention
Themes identified by focus group transcripts, Focus group transcripts will be analyzed by iterative rounds of coding by at least two members of the research team. Specific themes and trends will be identified within each transcript and discussed by the research team until final consensus is reached. Themes will be identified as topics that consistently occur across transcripts, as well as similarities and differences between transcripts., Up to 4 years|Change in prostate cancer knowledge as measured by a 17-item scale, Descriptive analyses will be used including t-test, frequency tables, nonparametric tests, correlations, regression models. Linear and generalized linear mixed models having random intercepts corresponding to neighborhood will be applied., Baseline to up to 4 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To identify neighborhoods with disproportionately high rates of advanced prostate cancer and describe patient- and neighborhood-level risk factors associated with the high-risk neighborhoods.

II. To develop, using a mixed methods approach, a targeted educational intervention about prostate cancer for men who live in high risk neighborhoods.

III. To test the impact of the targeted intervention on levels of knowledge, anxiety, and informed decision making about prostate cancer (PCa) screening.

IV. To observe the rates of PCa screening in the intervention and control groups.
