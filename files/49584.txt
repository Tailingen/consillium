Arsenic Trioxide for Structural p53 Mutations
TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer, but these mutations remain therapeutically non-actionable. Previous study reported arsenic trioxide could rescue structural p53 mutations, endowing p53 mutations with thermostability and transcriptional activity. Under Vivo and Vitro experiments, arsenic trioxide could reactivate mutated p53 to inhibit tumor. This trial aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide in refractory cancer patients with structural p53 mutations.
