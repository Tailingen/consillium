Anatomical-Clinical Base of Adenocarcinoma Pancreatic
BACAP-2 is a prospective biobank dedicated to the pancreatic adenocarcinoma including clinical data and biological samples from tumor. The aim is to enrich the previous propective collection BACAP in order to support future research projects.

Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth cause of death by cancer in Western countries. In over 90% of cases, it is due to an adenocarcinoma. The only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer remains the surgical exeresis. This one can only be suggested as a curative treatment in only 10 to 15% of cases. Besides, prevention or screening is difficult to set up due to the absence of clearly identified risk factors or groups and to the absence of useful markers for the diagnosis in clinical practice.

The research efforts in this area must face a double challenge: saving time while improving the diagnosis period and strengthen the therapeutic equipment. It is important to identify and characterise the new molecular markers applicable for a better diagnosis and/or treatment (especially the response factors to chemotherapy).

The present project aims to enrich with fresh tumor tissue and somatic genetic analysis the existing propective collection BACAP in order to support support future research projects on:

* the development of new diagnostic tools,
* understanding the development of tumors of the pancreas
* the development of new therapeutic targets
* understanding the response to chemotherapy...
