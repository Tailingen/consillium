Pilot Study to Evaluate if Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) Can Predict Treatment Response in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Patients Receiving Combined Chemotherapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI).
To find out if contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be used to determine if patients receiving combined ICI therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are responding to treatment earlier than standard of care MR or CT.
