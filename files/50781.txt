A Phase I Additional Study of Anlotinib on Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics
A Phase I Additional Study of Anlotinib on Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics.To further study the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Anlotinib in the human body, recommend a reasonable regimen for subsequent research.
Cancer
DRUG: Anlotinib
Pharmacokinetics of Anlotinib (in whole blood):Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax), Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax),Cmax in ng/mL.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H4/H8/H11/H24/H48/H72/H120/H168/H240（H means Hour）.In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D18/Before the next cycle（D means Day）., up to 18 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of Anlotinib (in whole blood):Peak time（Tmax）, Peak time（Tmax）,Tmax in h.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H4/H8/H11/H24/H48/H72/H120/H168/H240(H means hour).In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D18/Before the next cycle(D means Day)., up to 18 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of Anlotinib (in whole blood):Half life（t1/2）, Half life（t1/2）,t1/2 in h.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H4/H8/H11/H24/H48/H72/H120/H168/H240(H mans Hour).In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D18/Before the next cycle(D means Day)., up to 18 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of Anlotinib (in whole blood):Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC in ng.h/mL.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H4/H8/H11/H24/H48/H72/H120/H168/H240(H means Hour).In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D18/Before the next cycle(D means Day)., up to 18 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of Anlotinib (in whole blood):Clearance（CL）, Clearance（CL）,CL in L/h.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H4/H8/H11/H24/H48/H72/H120/H168/H240(H means Hour).In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D18/Before the next cycle(D means Day)., up to 18 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Cumulative excretion of Anlotinib (in urine), up to 10 Days(endpoint when the two consecutive time points of cumulative excretion <1%)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD(Disease progression) (up to 24 months)
