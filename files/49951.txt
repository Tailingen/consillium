OBJECTIVES:

* Describe the socio-demographic context of college students in an urban Midwestern setting.
* Assess knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer in these participants.
* Assess the population's perception of HPV risk.
* Assess the prevalence of risk behaviors that may place this population at risk for HPV.
* Identify the best predictors of HPV knowledge and cervical cancer knowledge.
* Assess vaccine knowledge and acceptance in these participants.

OUTLINE: Participants complete the Young Adult Survey online documenting demographic data; sexual history (i.e., whether they ever had sex, age of first sexual encounter, number of life time partners, condom use, sexually transmitted diseases \[STDs\], and pregnancy history); cigarette use; current and past drug use; knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer; past history of Pap tests and STD screenings; attitudes towards HPV testing; vaccine knowledge and acceptability; sources of information about HPV; source of information about cervical cancer; identification of common STDs; perceived risk of acquiring STDs; perceived risk of acquiring HPV; social support; and religion.
