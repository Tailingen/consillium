Comparing Standard of Care Biopsy System to a Novel Biopsy Needle System by Computational Pathologic Analysis
Prostate biopsy is the definitive examination to establish the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but up to 40% of these biopsies overestimate or underestimate the severity of the disease. A novel biopsy needle system captures substantially more tissue than standard of care needles, but it is important to assess the retrieval of tissue for pathologic analyses. This study will compare quality and quantity of tissue retrieved by both systems. Further, tissue will be analyzed using computational pathology algorithms for atypical small acinar proliferation and Gleason scores in terms of tissue area, tissue length, and tissue tortuosity.
Prostate Cancer Screening
DEVICE: Novel needle biopsy catheter (test)
Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation, Presence of suspicious prostate gland cells that appear cancerous but are not definitive enough to diagnose cancer, From enrollment to end of treatment at 1 day|Gleason Score, Pathologist scores the biopsy sample for the percentage of samples with a Gleason score of 7, 8, 9 or 10., From enrollment to end of treatment at 1 day|Tissue area and length, The amount of tissue retrieved by either biopsy systems-- area and length-- will be measured using computational pathology and compared, From treatment to end of pathology review at 2 days|Tissue toruosity, Tortuosity will be ranked from Tier 1 (high quality) to Tier 4 (low quality) using the computational pathology algorithm., From treatment to end of pathology review at 2 days
Standard Pathology versus Computational Pathology Results, Tissue samples will be analyzed by standard pathology techniques and computational pathology and differences in values of diagnosis, Gleason score, percent tumor volume, presence of cribiform glands, and perineural invasion compared, From treatment to end of pathology review at 2 days
Prostate tissue captured in needle biopsy procedures are used to diagnose prostate cancer, but current biopsy systems (standard of care control device) have been shown to underperform when compared to a new novel needle biopsy system (test device). The objectives of the study are to (1) compare tissue quality between test and control devices; (2) compare diagnostic ambiguity between the two devices; and (3) compare tissue area, length, and tortuosity from the samples with a computational pathology algorithm. Tissue analyses will be completed by pathologists blinded to the biopsy system used.
