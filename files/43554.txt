Ultrahypofractionated, Adaptive Radiation Therapy of Prostate Cancer
In this prospective, multi-center cohort study, the tolerability and quality of life during ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) of early stage prostate cancer is surveyed at several institutions in Germany. Radiotherapy is delivered by an online-adaptive RT device (Varian Ethos), which is able to correct daily variations in anatomy and to adjust the irradiation plan accordingly. A digital patient questionnaire is used to asses quality of life longitudinally. Quality of life (QoL) and toxicity profiles will be correlated with planning parameters and compared to retrospective cohorts of patients who underwent normofractionated RT or moderately hypofractionated RT, respectively.
