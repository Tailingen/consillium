GVAX Pancreas Vaccine (With CY) and CRS-207 With or Without Nivolumab
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects with previously treated metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with cyclophosphamide (CY)/nivolumab/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by nivolumab/CRS-207 (Arm A) to subjects treated with CY/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by CRS-207 (Arm B).
Previously Treated Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
BIOLOGICAL: CRS-207|BIOLOGICAL: CRS-207|DRUG: nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: GVAX|DRUG: CY
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from date of randomization until death or end of followup (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis)., 2 years and 7 months
Number of Patients Experiencing a Grade 3 or Above Treatment-related Toxicity, When calculating the incidence of AEs, each AE (as defined by NCI CTCAE v4.03) will be counted only once for a given subject., 2 years and 7 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients, PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 2 years and 7 months|Immune-related Progression-free Survival (irPFS) by IRRC in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients, irPFS is defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to disease progression (PD or relapse from CR as assessed using irRC RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per irRC criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline or \<20% increase in tumor burden compared to nadir., 2 years and 7 months|Time to Progression (TTP) by RECIST 1.1 in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of documented disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Individuals are censored at the date of the last radiological assessment that occurs prior to any of the following: death, switch to another anti-cancer therapy, or end of follow-up. Individuals without follow-up or baseline measurements are censored at 1 day. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 2 years and 7 months|Number of Participants With Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) as Defined by RECIST 1.1 in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients, Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, PR is defined as =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions and CR is the disappearance of all target lesions., 2 years and 7 months|Tumor Marker Kinetics (CA 19-9) in Patients With Baseline Abnormal Levels as Measured by Number of Participants With Stable or Responding CA19-9 Concentration, Number of participants with stable or responding (\<50% increase of serum CA19-9 concentration) at 120 days., 120 days
