Independent Predictors Analysis and Model Construction of Cavitary Central Lung Cancer
This study is a retrospective, multicenter clinical study. The main goal is to identify the risk factors for cavity formation in central-type lung cancer lesions, and to construct a prediction model for cavity formation in central-type lung cancer lesions based on the above risk factors.
