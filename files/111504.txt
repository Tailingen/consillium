CNS and Extracranial Tumor Tissues, CSF, and Blood From Patients With Melanoma Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to collect and bank samples of blood and tissues (such as brain tissue or lymph nodes), as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that bathes and cushions the spinal cord. The investigator will analyze DNA biomarkers in the samples. The investigator hopes that by studying the biomarkers, he can develop tests in the future that can detect central nervous system (CNS) metastasis in blood samples before they show up on x-ray and develop medicines that can specifically target CNS metastasis.

PROCEDURE: Craniotomy scheduled|PROCEDURE: Collection for non-craniotomy
Collection of blood, tumor tissue samples and adjacent uninvolved tissue and Cerebrospinal Fluid, Collection of these samples to help determine: if CNS melanoma metastases are similar to primary cutaneous melanomas, and assist in efforts to develop biomarkers that predict development of CNS melanoma metastases from the cutaneous primary lesion; or if CNS melanoma metastases are similar to extracranial metastases, and assist in efforts to develop effective systemic therapies for extracranial MM that also take into account the molecular profile of CNS melanoma metastases would more likely have an impact upon development of CNS melanoma metastases., 2 years
Among the different sites to which melanoma can spread, the Central Nervous System (CNS) has the highest chance of developing metastases. Prognosis for metastatic melanoma involving the CNS is worse than that of CNS metastases from other cancers. Therefore, it is felt that early identification of this condition, even before it is found on x-ray (either MRI or CT scan), would be beneficial so that patients can undergo treatment earlier.

The investigator hypothesizes that the tumor cell genetics, expressed proteins, and/or signaling pathways of melanoma brain metastases may exhibit features that distinguish melanoma brain metastases. The investigator further hypothesizes that melanoma brain metastases may be associated with changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, where protein fragments expressed by melanoma brain metastases may be shed that cannot be found in normal CNS tissues, extracranial metastases (MEM) or at the same levels in the peripheral blood.
