A Study of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin With or Without Sintilimab as First-line Therapy for Patients With Advanced Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy based of cisplatin with sintilimab as first-line therapy for patients with advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.
Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sintilimab|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Compare Progression Free Survival (PFS) between Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin + Sintilimab Regimen and Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin Regimen using RECIST 1.1., PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was determined based on investigator assessment using response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., approximately 24 months|Compare objective response rate(ORR) between Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin + Sintilimab Regimen and Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin Regimen using RECIST 1.1., ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed objective tumor response, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria., approximately 24 months
Compare Overall Survival (OS) between Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin + Sintilimab Regimen and Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin Regimen., Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for participants who were not reported as dead at the time of analysis was censored at the date when they were last known to be alive., approximately 24 months|Compare Disease Control Rate (DCR) between Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin + Sintilimab Regimen and Chemoradiotherapy Based of Cisplatin Regimen using RECIST 1.1., DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD)., approximately 24 months
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy based of cisplatin with sintilimab as first-line therapy for patients with advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.
