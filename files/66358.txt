Spinal Analgesia for Colonic Resection Using an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Program
This is a blinded randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing laparoscopic colon surgery. The aim of this study is to assess whether spinal analgesia with a mixture of bupivacaine and morphine provides better pain relief than systemic morphine in a group of patients undergoing colonic resection and using the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program.

Twenty patients will receive spinal analgesia and twenty patients will receive only Patient Control Analgesia (PCA).
