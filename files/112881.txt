177Lu-PSMA-Iï¼†T PSMA Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 177 Lu -labeled PSMA ligand(PSMA-Iï¼†T) in the treatment of mCRPC in Asianethics.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 177 Lu-PSMA-I&T
PSA, Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels was used as the main marker of efficacy evaluation, and the changes of PSA level were divided into decrease \> 50%, 30% \~ 50% and \< 30%., 2 months
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 2 months after the injection and scanning of patients will be followed and assessed, 2 months
Prostate specific membrane antigen(PSMA) targeted therapy brings new hope to the patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we reported the safety and efficacy of 177 Lu -labeled PSMA ligand(PSMA-Iï¼†T) in the treatment of mCRPC in Asianethics.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in older men with recent data .PSMA is a type II transmembrane glycoproteinï¼Œoverexpressed up to 100 to 1000 times higher than normal prostate cells in prostate cancer cells and is correlated with higher-grade cancers, metastatic disease and hormone refractory disease. Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA (LuPSMA) is a novel and highly targeted systemic RLT for progressive mCRPC. Upon binding of LuPSMA to the cell membrane, endocytosis is triggered, concentrating the tumouricidal effects of the radioisotope activity internally within malignant cells.

This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial. Patients will receive PRLT Treatment. The follow-up period was followed up to assess safety and effectiveness.
