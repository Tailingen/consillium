IMM2520, a PD-L1 and CD47 Bispecific Antibody in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics profile, efficacy and immunogenicity of IMM2520 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Plasma Concentration observed in patients with IMM2520 dosed, 48 weeks of treatment cycles|time to maximum concentration (Tmax), time to maximum concentration observed in patients with IMM2520 dosed, 48 weeks of treatment cycles|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), To evaluate the immunogenicity of IMM2520 in patients with malignancies, 48 weeks of treatment cycles
IMM2520 is administered via intravenous infusion once week of cycle 1- 12 (4 weeks per cycle).

The accelerated titration method and the traditional "3+3" method will be adopted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in dose-escalation phase.

Once the RP2D is determined, Simon's two-stage design will be used to explore for each specific tumor cohort.adenocarcinoma/esophageal cancer, urothelial cancer, and/or others.
