Treatment Pause Versus Treatment Continuation in IMDC Good or Intermediate Risk With Only One Adverse Prognostic Factor in mRCC Patients With an Objective Response at 12 Months of Treatment With PD1/ PDL1 ICIs + VEGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of treatment pause versus treatment continuation in good or intermediate risk with only one adverse prognostic factor as per IMDC mRCC patients with a confirmed objective response between the end of the 11th month to th end of the 13th month of treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 ICI plus VEGFR-TKI.

Tolerance and quality of life of treatment pause with PD-1/PD-L1 ICI + VEGFR-TKI compared to treatment continuation will be reported. In France, its impact on healthcare resource utilization will also be assessed.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma|Good or Only One Adverse Prognostic Factor Intermediate Risk Per IMDC Score
DRUG: Combination PD-1/PD-L1 ICI + VEGFR-TKI|OTHER: Treatment pause
Proportion of participants without progression, Disease progression at up to 12 months after randomisation will be based on a blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with tumor assessment performed every 12 weeks during study participation, Up to 12 months after randomisation
Overall safety profile and tolerability event, Proportion of participants who experience an adverse event or serious adverse event and mean number of adverse events or serious adverse events up to 12 months after randomisation, Up to 12 months after randomisation|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of death due to any cause, From randomisation until 2 years of follow-up|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between date of randomisation and the first date of the documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From randomisation until 2 years of follow-up|Mean change in quality of life, Measured by the NCCN functional assessment of cancer therapy-kidney symptom index (FKSI-19). The NCCN FKSI-19 is a 19-item scale that measures tumor specific health-related quality of life in kidney cancer participants. A higher score indicates fewer symptoms, Up to 12 months after randomisation|Quality-adjusted survival, The quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) is a simultaneous assessment of time without toxicity or disease progression, which essentially examines the trade-off between AEs and treatment benefits, Up to 12 months after randomisation|Anxiety and depression, Mean scores in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at up to 12 months after randomisation, Up to 12 months after randomisation|Site and distribution of the sites of progression: known lesions, new lesion(s) or both, From randomisation until 2 years of follow-up|Distribution of treatment modality after progression, Proportion of participants treated after progression with surveillance, focal treatment or general treatment, From randomisation until 2 years of follow-up|Percentage of patients with status SD or in objective response at 6 months after restarting PD-1/PD-L1 ICI + VEGFR-TKI, From randomisation until 2 years of follow-up|Healthcare resource utilisation, Costs of care will be estimated in the perspective of the French Healthcare System over a 12-month times horizon. Conventional tariffs of hospitalizations will be used to calculate costs, Up to 12 months after randomisation
Although multiple combinations therapies in particular PD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs) in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) are approved and have improved patient's outcomes with mRCC, they are maintained until disease progression and treatment pause after an objective response has not been fully explored \[5-7\]. The good-risk population is characterised by prolonged survival therefore a treatment pause in this population could impact the quality of life, safety and total cost of care, without impacting outcome. As well, intermediate risk population group is heterogeneous, while the one's with only one adverse prognostic factor seems to be closed to the outcome of good risk population \[11-15\]. As the purpose of the study is to target patients with an objective response, there is already a selection of patients with a better outcome.

Patient will be randomised after 11 to 13 months of treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 ICI plus VEGFR-TKI (treatment pause versus treatment continuation) and follow every 3 months for a period of 12 months following by 12 additional months for survival follow-up.
