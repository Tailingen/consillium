Paclitaxel, Carboplatin Plus Bevacizumab in Pretreated, Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab combination, administered biweekly, in patients with pretreated, advanced non small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Overall Response Rate, Objective responses confirmed by CT or MRI (on 3rd and 6th cycle)
Toxicity profile, Toxicity assessment of each chemotherapy cycle|Time to Tumor Progression, 1-year|Overall Survival, 1 year
The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the 1st line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provided a survival benefit. There are patients with NSCLC who have not received bevacizumab and have relapsed after 1st and/or 2nd line therapy. The evaluation of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in such patients is justified. The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, administered every two weeks, has a favorable toxicity profile. This study will evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to a biweekly regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin as 2nd or 3rd line therapy for NSCLC
