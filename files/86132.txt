Compare the Efficacy and Safety of QL0605 Injections at Different Timepoints
The goal of this real-world study is to compare the efficacy and safety of QL0605 administered 24 hours and 48 hours after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia
DRUG: QL0605(PEG-rhG-CSF)|DRUG: QL0605(PEG-rhG-CSF)
The incidence of febrile neutropenia for chemotherapy cycle 1., Febrile neutropenia is defined as single temperature: ≥38.3 °C orally（axillary 38.1°C） or ≥38.0 °C（axillary 37.8°C） over 2h; and neutropenia: \<500 neutrophils/mcL., 21 days (Cycle 1 of chemotherapy treatment)
Patients with stage invasive breast cancer who were scheduled to receive at least 2 cycles of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TAC/TC/TCbH regimen were eligible for this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive QL0605 24 hours (24h group) or 48 hours (48h group) after the end of each cycle of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the incidence rate of FN for cycle 1. The secondary endpoints included the incidence rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia, chemotherapy dose reduction and chemotherapy delay due to neutropenia, antibiotic administration, the pain (bone, muscle, or joint), ect.
