Therapeutic Effect Of Luteolin Natural Extract Versus Its Nanoparticles On Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Line
In vitro study to examine whether luteolin and nano-luteolin exert an inhibitory effect on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line by inducing apoptosis, and to assess if nano-luteolin has more efficient apoptotic activity than luteolin on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line.
Tongue Neoplasms|Carcinoma
DRUG: luteolin|DRUG: nano-luteolin
gene expression of Caspase 3 to detect apoptosis, fold-changes, 6 hours
cell viability, micromolar, 6 hours
This study is conducted to examine whether luteolin and nano-luteolin exert an inhibitory effect on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line by inducing apoptosis, and to assess if nano-luteolin has more efficient apoptotic activity than luteolin on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line. The primary outcome is apoptosis, while the secondary outcome is cell viability.
