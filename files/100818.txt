Immunogenicity and Safety of a Commercially Available Vaccine Co-administered With GSK HPV Vaccine (580299)
Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the necessary cause of cervical cancer. The current Phase 3b study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a commercially available vaccine co-administered with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' HPV vaccine GSK580299 in healthy female subjects.
