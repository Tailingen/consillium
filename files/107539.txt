Support for People Undergoing Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy adversely affects quality of life in cancer patients. Both stress management training and exercise training have been shown to improve quality of life. These two types of training have not been directly compared for chemotherapy patients.

This study seeks to evaluate the separate and combined effects of stress management training and exercise training on quality of life during chemotherapy treatment. Participants receive either a home-based, self-administered program in 1 of 3 types (stress management, exercise, or stress management + exercise) or usual care (reading materials). It is hypothesized that the combined program (stress management + exercise) will be significantly associated with better quality of life than the usual care group, the exercise only group, and the stress management only group. All participants are assessed at 3 timepoints: before they begin chemotherapy, 6 weeks after their first chemotherapy infusion, and 12 weeks after their first infusion.
