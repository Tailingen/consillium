Efficacy and Safety of JMT101 Combined With Afatinib (or Osimertinib) in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a Phase Ib, open label, multi-center study of to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JMT101 combined with EGFR-TKIs (Afatinib or Osimertinib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.

The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JMT101 combined with EGFR-TKIs (afatinib or osimertinib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.

This study consists of two parts (Stage I and Stage II). Stage I was a dose escalation study, and Stage II was a dose expansion study.
