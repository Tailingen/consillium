Metabolomic and Epigenetic Profiling of Bodyfluids From Lung and Brain Cancer Receiving Radiation Therapy
This research trial studies metabolomic and other molecular profiling to identify predictive biomarkers for radiation toxicity and survival in patients with lung or brain cancers receiving radiation therapy. Studying samples of blood, urine, and tissue from patients with lung or brain cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer and predict which patients are at higher risk for developing radiation side effects and how well patients will respond to radiation treatment.

Potential predictive biomarkers for the development of radiation pneumonitis for lung cancer patients, For each biomarker, linear mixed model (with group and time interaction and repeated measurement for each patient over time) on the log-transformed expression level will be used to detect if it is differentially expressed after controlling for the effects of the co-variates (such as age, disease status, and treatment details)., Baseline|Potential predictive biomarkers for the development of radiation necrosis for brain cancer patients, For each biomarker, linear mixed model (with group and time interaction and repeated measurement for each patient over time) on the log-transformed expression level will be used to detect if it is differentially expressed after controlling for the effects of the co-variates (such as age, disease status, and treatment details)., Baseline

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer associated with the development of radiation pneumonitis.

II. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine and blood profiles of patients undergoing radiation therapy for brain cancer associated with the development of radiation necrosis.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Metabolomic and epigenetic urine, blood, and tissue profiles of patients undergoing radiation therapy for lung and brain cancer associated with survival.

OUTLINE:

Collected blood, urine, and tissue samples are analyzed for biomarkers via metabolomic and epigenetic profiling using mass spectrometry, array, and sequencing-based technology.
