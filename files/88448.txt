Reinforcement of Rectal Anastomosis-RORA
The anastomotic leaks are multivariable in its origin. The incidence varies among different centers between 4% and as high as 25%. The impact of leakage in a rectal anastomosis can be devastating for the patient and very costly for the health care system.

Prolonged hospital stay (LOS), invasive treatment and intensive care are the consequences.

The future of colorectal surgery will increasingly include older patients with increased preoperative morbidity and probably even higher risk for anastomotic leaks. which makes it suitable for reinforcing a rectal anastomosis. The goal is to shift the clinical leaks spectrum into a subclinical and therefore self-healing one.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: The rectal anastomosis will be reinforced with HemoPatch.|DEVICE: Hemopatch
Evidence of clinical anastomotic leak( elevated C reactive protein and white blood corpuscles, fever, nausea). Suspicion of a leak will be investigated with a Ct scan., 10 days
The rationale is to explore if the procedure of reinforcement with HemoPatch and bringing more mechanical strength over an extended area around the anastomosis thus lowers the incidence of clinical anastomotic leaks.

The characteristics of HemoPatch, with its structural properties such as flexibility and tissue adhesion are suitable for this purpose.
