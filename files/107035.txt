A Study of Axl Inhibitor FC084CSA in Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of Axl inhibitor FC084CSA in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors who have failed standard anti-cancer treatment.
Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
DRUG: FC084CSA tablets
Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose is defined at which no more than 1 of 3 evaluable participants has had a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to NCI CTCAE V5.0 criteria and determination by Investigator and Data and Safety Monitoring Committee., Approximately 12 months|Determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is based upon the review of all available data including safety, pharmacokinetic, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and MTD., Approximately 12 months|Determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Determine the DLT of FC084CSA, 24 days after first dose|Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and SAEs, To investigate the safety characteristics of FC084CSA, Approximately 12 months
