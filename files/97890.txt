A Study of Sintilimab or Placebo in Combination With Chemotherapy as Second-line Treatment for Patients With Stage IV Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Wild-type EGFR After Failure With Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy.
This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab or placebo in combination with chemotherapy as second-line treatment for patients with stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type EGFR after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Treatment may continue as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression.
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Placebo
Compare Overall Survival (OS) between sintilimab +chemotherapy and placebo + chemotherapy., To compare the efficacy of the combination of sintilimab and chemotherapy versus placebo and chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) in patients with stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type EGFR after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for participants who were not reported as dead at the time of analysis was censored at the date when they were last known to be alive., approximately 24 months
Compare objective response rate between sintilimab +chemotherapy and placebo + chemotherapy., ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed objective tumor response, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria., approximately 24 months|Compare Progression Free Survival (PFS) between sintilimab +chemotherapy and placebo + chemotherapy using RECIST 1.1., PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was determined based on investigator assessment using response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., approximately 24 months|Compare duration of response between sintilimab +chemotherapy and placebo + chemotherapy., DOR was defined as the duration from the first tumor assessment that supports the participant's objective response (CR or PR, whichever is first recorded) to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., approximately 24 months|Number of Participants who Experience Treatment Related Adverse Events (AEs)., All Adverse Events and Serious Adverse events will be collected and collated according to grade and frequency. AEs graded using CTCAE (Version 4.0) criteria., approximately 24 months
