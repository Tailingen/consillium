This is a randomized multicentre open label phase II study of the PDL1 inhibitor Durvalumab following SBRT in patients with T1-2N0M0 NSCLC. It will enroll 106 patients aiming at a minimum of 5 subjects per site. The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion with performance status, gender and T-stage as stratification factors. Patients with peripheral lung tumors will receive SBRT usually between 3 and 4 fractions. The group randomized to immunotherapy will then receive Durvalumab, given with a fixed dose of 1500 mg i.v. every fourth week during 12 months. Both arms will be assessed according to the same follow-up schedule with radiology every third month.
