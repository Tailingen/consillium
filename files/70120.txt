Indocyanine Green Tracer Using in Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer
This study aims to explore the value of indocyanine green (ICG) in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for early gastric cancer.The patients with early gastric adenocarcinoma (cT1, N-/+, M0) will be studied.
Early Gastric Cancer|Indocyanine Green|Lymph Node Dissection
DRUG: Indocyanine Green
False negative rate, The number of positive lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes, One month after surgery
True positive rate, The number of positive lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes, One month after surgery|False positive rate, The number of negative lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes, One month after surgery|True negative rate, The number of negative lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes, One month after surgery|Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, One month after surgery|Lymph node noncompliance rate, Lymph node noncompliance was defined as the absence of lymph nodes that should have been excised from more than 1 lymph node station. Major lymph node noncompliance was defined as more than 2 intended lymph node stations that were not removed., One month after surgery|Number of Metastasis Lymph Nodes, Number of Metastasis Lymph Nodes, One month after surgery|Metastasis rate of lymph node, Metastasis rate of lymph node, One month after surgery|Morbidity and mortality rates, This is for the early postoperative complication and mortality, which defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery., One month after surgery|3-year overall survival rate, 3-year overall survival rate, 36 months|3-year disease free survival rate, 3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type., 36 months|Intraoperative morbidity rates, The intraoperative postoperative morbidity rates are defined as the rates of event observed within operation., 1 day|Time to first ambulation, Time to first ambulation in hours is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first flatus, Time to first flatus in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first liquid diet, Time to first liquid diet in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first soft diet, Time to first soft diet in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Duration of postoperative hospital stay, Duration of postoperative hospital stay in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|The variation of white blood cell count, The values of white blood cell count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The variation of hemoglobin, The values of hemoglobin in gram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The variation of C-reactive protein, The variation of C-reactive protein, Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will receiving injection of indocyanine greenat 8 points around the primary tumor with gastroscope 1 day before surgery. During the operation, laparoscopic gastrectomy and perigastric lymph node dissection were performed under ICG imaging equipment. After the surgical specimens were isolated, under the fluorescent illumination of the ICG imaging equipment, the lymph nodes that showed fluorescence and the lymph nodes that did not show fluorescence were collected from each LN station.
