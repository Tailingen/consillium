Follow-up After Metastasectomy in Patients With Kidney Cancer
This phase II trial studies the follow-up after metastasectomy in patients with kidney cancer. Following up patients' health condition after metastasectomy may help doctors to learn if the surgical removal of the primary tumor or the parts of the cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is a good method for treating patients who have kidney cancer.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
OTHER: Follow-Up Care|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Binary indicator that the patient is alive with no evidence of disease progression (either progression or relapse) post surgery, Assessed using a logistic regression model., 24 weeks
Progression free survival (PFS), Up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), Will be analyzed by Kaplan Meier plots and appropriate regression analyses using the vector of intervention indicators (ZD, ZE, ZI) as covariates, with the model determined by preliminary goodness-of-fit analyses., Up to 5 years|Disease free survival (DFS), Will be analyzed by Kaplan Meier plots and appropriate regression analyses using the vector of intervention indicators (ZD, ZE, ZI) as covariates, with the model determined by preliminary goodness-of-fit analyses., Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the 24-week progression free/relapse free survival rate in patients undergoing metastasectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS), relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing metastasectomy.

II. To evaluate tissue determinants predictive for resectability, PFS and OS in patients undergoing metastasectomy.

OUTLINE:

After metastasectomy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.
