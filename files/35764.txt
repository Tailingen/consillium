Holmium Versus Bipolar en Bloc Transurethral Resection of Urothelium Tumor of the Urinary Bladder
En bloc resection of bladder tumors (ERBT) may improve staging quality and perioperative morbidity and influence tumour recurrence
Urinary Bladder Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Holmium versus Bipolar en bloc transurethral resection
number of participant with Conversion to the TURBT, conversion from the enbloc way of resection to the standard trans-urethral resection of bladder tumors, intraoperative finding
Operative time, calculation of operative time in minutes, intraoperative finding|Presence of detrusor muscle in resected sample, presence of muscle layer in the pathological specimen (Yes/No), one day after surgery during pathological evaluation|Resected specimen's edge, tumor free margin (Yes/No), one day after surgery during pathological evaluation|intraoperative complication: bladder perforation, (Yes/No) bladder perforation, intraoperative|Incidence of obturator reflex, (Yes/No) energy induced obturator reflex, intraoperative|hematuria, (Yes/No), postoperative complication up to 2 weeks|Post-operative catheterization time in hours, time till catheter removal in days, postoperative complication up to 2 weeks|Postoperative irrigation time in hours, hours for the need of postoperative irrigation, postoperative in hours maximum 1 day|Recurrence rate of tumors according to time interval, recurrence of tumor in the follow up cystoscopy, 1 year|Recurrence rate of tumors according to tumor location, recurrence of tumor in the follow up cystoscopy in the same site or in different site, 1 year
Modern laser technology has led to new alternatives to conventional TURBT (cTURBT). The advocates of ERBT have three goals: to improve resection quality, lower perioperative complication rates, and decrease recurrence rates at resection sites. The present study is the first to compare the results of laser and electric en bloc resection of bladder cancer with respect to the aforementioned goals.

the investigators aim to compare the clinical outcome in the form of safety and efficacy between Holmium and bipolar transurethral en bloc resection of urinary bladder tumors.
