Intraprostatic MAXimal Simultaneous Boost
This trial uses a type of radiotherapy called intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which is able to deliver the radiation to the prostate while delivering less dose to the surrounding normal organs compared with standard 3D conformal radiotherapy presently used at the BCCA. This trial will use RapidArc IMRT, which is a new way of delivering IMRT, where the radiation dose is delivered in a single rotation of the radiotherapy machine around the patient. This new method of delivering IMRT has been shown to be at least as good as conventional IMRT at delivering the dose, and takes less time to do so.

The aim of this study is to deliver a higher radiation dose to the prostate gland than the standard treatment while not increasing dose to the normal organs. In this way, it is hoped that the likelihood of the cancer coming back will be reduced without causing an increase in side-effects.
