Androgen Deprivation Therapy Prior to Prostatectomy for Patients with Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer
Degarelix is an approved drug that is used to treat prostate cancer by lowering testosterone levels in the body.

Degarelix is commonly given with radiation for prostate cancer, but less frequently with surgery since there has been no proven benefit with this approach.

The investigators do not expect the patient to benefit directly from treatment with degarelix since their prostate will be removed shortly after the drug is given. Instead, the investigators hope to learn about how degarelix and other treatment that lowers your testosterone effects prostate cancer cells and use this information to develop better treatments in the future.

To assess between the time to determine the time of the maximal change in prostate cancer cell proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis rates (cleaved caspase-3), The primary endpoint is the change in the rate of proliferation (Ki-67) and the rate of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), as evaluated by IHC in anatomically matched tumor foci from the pre-treatment diagnostic biopsy and the RP specimen. The levels in pre-treatment biopsy serve as the baseline. Ki-67 is a widely accepted nuclear marker for cell proliferation. Cleaved caspase-3 has been shown to be a reliable marker of apoptosis and correlate with results from other apoptosis markers such as cleaved PARP-1 and TUNEL assay., 2 years
To explore the association between PTEN status and maximal changes in prostate cancer proliferation and apoptosis rates in patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy, The secondary endpoint is PTEN status by IHC in the diagnostic biopsy and RP specimens. PTEN status will be determined by an IHC method that has been validated using control prostate cell lines and tissues at MSKCC. The PTEN status will be reported in binary fashion as "retained" (diffuse moderate immunoreactivity retained in benign glands as well as adenocarcinoma on 100X magnification) or "null" (complete loss of nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in tumor cells while expression is retained in surrounding stroma., 2 years|To explore the association between PI3K pathway (pAKT and pS6) and prostate cancer proliferation and apoptosis rates after treatment with androgen deprivation therapy in relation to other markers of prostate cancer (ERG, AR and NCOA2)., Additional exploratory endpoints include IHC staining for markers of PI3K pathway (pAKT and pS6) as well as other markers of prostate cancer (ERG, AR and NCOA2) in the diagnostic biopsy and RP specimens. Some of these markers have been validated at MSKCC (pS6, ERG), while others (AR, pAKT, NCOA2) are currently being validated and standardized for the study using appropriate cell line and tissue controls. A general semiquantitative scoring method will be used for these markers., 2 years|To discover novel biomarkers and correlates of response, through expression profiling of prostate cancer after three time intervals of androgen deprivation therapy and correlate with PTEN and ERG status, proliferation rate, apoptotic rate, and histologic response, 2 years
