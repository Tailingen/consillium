HLX301 (TIGIT×PDL1 Bispecific) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase 1/2, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, dose expansion, and clinical expansion study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of HLX301 administered as a single-agent by IV infusion every 2 weeks to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies, who have failed or are intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available. This study has three parts: phase 1a dose escalation, phase 1b dose expansion, and phase 2 clinical expansion.

• Disease control rate (DCR) defined as achieving the complete response, partial response, or stable disease as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, 2 years|Phase 2: Disease control rate (DCR) defined as achieving the complete response, partial response, or stable disease as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, 2 years|Phase 2: Duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented ORR to disease progression, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, 2 years
Phase 1a: The pharmacokinetic parameters of HLX301: Peak concentration (Cmax, Cmax,ss), 2 years|Phase 1a: The pharmacokinetic parameters of HLX301: Time to peak (Tmax, Tmax,ss), 2 years|Phase 1a: The pharmacokinetic parameters of HLX301: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-inf, AUC0-t, AUCss), 2 years|Phase 1a: The pharmacokinetic parameters of HLX301: Elimination half-life (t1/2), 2 years|Phase 1a: The pharmacokinetic parameters of HLX301: Clearance (CL, CLss), 2 years|Phase 1a: The pharmacokinetic parameters of HLX301: Volume of distribution (Vz, Vss), 2 years|Phase 1a: The pharmacodynamic profiles of HLX301 as determined by receptor occupancy of HLX301 on circulating T cells, 2 years|Phase 1a: The incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) of HLX301, 2 years|Phase 1b: The preliminary efficacy as determined by ORR, 2 years|Phase 1b: The preliminary efficacy as determined by DCR, 2 years|Phase 1b: The preliminary efficacy as determined by DOR, 2 years|Phase 2: The safety profile, assessing incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, 2 years|Phase 2: To investigate the correlation between PD-L1 expression levels and anti-tumor activity of HLX301 in patients with NSCLC, GC/EJC, HNSCC and UC, 2 years
Exploratory biomarkers: To evaluate the correlation between biomarker expression levels in baseline tumor samples using IHC staining (including, not limited to, CD8, CD4, Ki67, CD56, PD-1, TIGIT, FoxP3, CD209, PD-L1(CPS and TPS)) and tumor response, 2 years|Exploratory biomarkers, To evaluate CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells and T regulatory cells, as well as expression levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD25, FoxP3, Ki67, CCR7, PD-L1, TIGIT, CD226 and CD45RA on these cells, in serial blood samples using FACS analysis, 2 years
Up to 150 patients will be included in this study. Up to 30 DLT evaluable patients will be enrolled in phase 1a (dose escalation), 40 per-protocol treated patients in phase 1b (dose expansion), and 80 per-protocol treated patients in phase 2.

Phase 1a uses the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, to investigate the safety and determine the MTD of HLX301. BOIN design combines rule-based and model-based design, allowing for flexibility of dose escalation and de-escalation, and high patient enrollment in doses closest to the target toxicity rate (pre-defined as 30% in this study). This study will also evaluate safety profiles at different dose levels, PK parameters, pharmacodynamic markers, immunogenicity, and the preliminary efficacy of the drug.

Following dose escalation and determination of the MTD, additional patients with NSCLC will be enrolled in phase 1b dose expansion to further evaluate PK and pharmacodynamic characteristics, and preliminary efficacy in order to determine the RP2D.

The phase 2 clinical expansion will include patients with various cancer types, including:

20 per-protocol treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 20 per-protocol treated patients with gastric/esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (GC/EGJ) 20 per-protocol treated patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 20 per-protocol treated patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC)
