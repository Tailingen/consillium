Study of Liposomal Annamycin for the Treatment of Subjects with Soft-Tissue Sarcomas (STS) with Pulmonary Metastases
This is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study that in Phase 1b will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and safety of L-Annamycin and in Phase 2 will explore the efficacy of L- Annamycin as a single agent for the treatment of subjects with STS with lung metastases for which chemotherapy is considered appropriate.
Sarcoma,Soft Tissue|Pulmonary Metastasis
DRUG: Liposomal Annamycin (L-Annamycin)
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Number of patients with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at each dose evaluated, 21 days
Efficacy of L-Annamycin, Determine preliminary efficacy of L-Annamycin as per revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1), At the end of every other treatment cycle ( each cycle is 21 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of L-Annamycin, Determine pharmacokinetics of L-Annamycin and its metabolite, annamycinol as measured by AUC, Cycle 1 Day 1 ( each cycle is 21 days)
