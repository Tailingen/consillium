A Phase 2 Study of T-DXd in Patients With Selected HER2 Expressing Tumors
This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for the treatment of selected HER2-expressing tumors.

This study will consist of Part 1 which includes 7 cohorts of: urothelial bladder cancer, biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and rare tumors; and Part 2 which includes 5 cohorts A to E of: A) any tumor type that is HER2 IHC 3+ (excluding breast, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), B) any tumor type that is HER2 IHC 2+/ISH+ (excluding breast, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer), C) HER2 IHC 2+ or 1+ endometrial cancer, D) HER2 IHC 2+ or 1+ ovarian cancer, and E) HER2 IHC 2+ or 1+ cervical cancer.

Study hypothesis: Trastuzumab deruxtecan will show meaningful clinical activity and a favorable risk benefit profile in selected HER2-expressing solid tumors.
Part 1: Bladder, Biliary Tract, Cervical, Endometrial, Ovarian, Pancreatic Cancer, Rare Tumors, Any Tumor Type Excluding Breast, Gastric, Colorectal Cancer|Part 2: HER2 Expressing/Amplified Solid Tumors Excluding Breast, Gastric, Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1 is the percentage of patients with Complete Response or Partial Response that is subsequently confirmed., An average of approximately 6 months
Duration of response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death., An average of approximately 6 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is the percentage of subjects who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)., An average of approximately 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is the time from date of first dose of study treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death., An average of approximately 6 months|Proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months and 12 months, The proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 6 and 12 months (Kaplan-Meier estimates)., Up to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from date of first dose of study treatment until death due to any cause., An average of approximately 14 months|Proportion of patients alive at 6 and 12 months, The proportion of patients alive at 6 and 12 months (Kaplan-Meier estimates)., Up to 12 months|Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Occurrence of AEs and SAEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0., An average of approximately 8 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed by serum concentration of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody and MAAA-1181, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody and MAAA-1181a, An average of approximately 8 months|The immunogenicity of T-DXd assessed by the presence of ADAs for T-DXd, Individual participant data and descriptive statistics will be provided for data at each time point., An average of approximately 6 months
