A Clinical Trial Investigating the Safety, Tolerability, and Therapeutic Effects of BNT113 in Combination With Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab Alone for Patients With a Form of Head and Neck Cancer Positive for Human Papilloma Virus 16 and Expressing the Protein PD-L1
An open-label, controlled, multi-site, interventional, 2-arm, Phase II/III trial of BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab vs pembrolizumab monotherapy as first line treatment in patients with unresectable recurrent or metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC expressing programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) with combined positive score (CPS) ≥1.

This trial has two parts.

Part A, is an initial non-randomized Safety Run-In Phase to confirm the safety and tolerability at the selected dose range level of BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab.

Part B, is a randomized part to generate pivotal efficacy and safety data of BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first line setting in patients with unresectable recurrent or metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC expressing PD-L1 with CPS ≥1. Patients included in the Safety Run-In Phase of the trial (Part A) will not be randomized to Part B and will continue on-trial treatment (BNT113 plus pembrolizumab) within Part A.

For Part B, an optional pre-screening phase is available for all patients where patients' tumor samples may be submitted for central HPV16 DNA and central PD-L1 expression testing prior to screening into the main trial.

Patients will be treated with BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab or with pembrolizumab monotherapy for approximately up to 24 months.

BIOLOGICAL: BNT113|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Part A - Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) - BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab, TEAE assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) including Grade ≥3, serious, and fatal TEAEs, by relationship., up to 27 months|Part B - Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., up to 48 months|Part B - Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization to the first objective tumor progression (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \[RECIST 1.1\] assessed by the blinded independent central review \[BICR\]), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 48 months
Part A and B - Overall response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of patients in whom a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR and investigator) is observed as best overall response., up to 48 months|Part A and B - Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from first objective response (CR or PR per RECIST 1.1) to first occurrence of objective tumor progression (progressive disease \[PD\] per RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. In Part A, assessment will be done by both BICR and investigator; in Part B, only by BICR., up to 48 months|Part A - Disease control rate (DCR), DCR defined as the proportion of patients in whom a CR or PR or stable disease (SD) (per RECIST 1.1, assessed at least 6 weeks after first dose by BICR and investigator) is observed as best overall response., up to 48 months|Part B - Progression free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization to the first objective tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1 by investigator's assessment) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 48 months|Part B - PFS rate at 6 months, Defined as the proportion of patients without objective tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR and investigator) or death from any cause, from randomization until 6 months after randomization|Part B - PFS rate at 12 months, Defined as the proportion of patients without objective tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR and investigator) or death from any cause., from randomization until 12 months after randomization|Part B - Occurrence of TEAEs - BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy, TEAEs assessed according to CTCAE v5.0 including Grade ≥3, serious, and fatal TEAEs by relationship., up to 27 months|Part B - Occurrence of dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation of trial treatments due to TEAEs, BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy., up to 27 months
