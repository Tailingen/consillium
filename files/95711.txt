Study of XL114 in Subjects With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical antitumor activity of XL114 administered alone orally to subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The objectives of the study also include determining the recommended dose (RD) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL114.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)|Activated B-Cell Type Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL)|Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
DRUG: XL114
Dose-Escalation Stage: Recommended Dose (RD) and/or Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for XL114, To determine the RD and/or MTD of XL114 administered orally in subjects with NHL, 4-6 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate preliminary efficacy of XL114 by estimating the ORR based on lymphoma-specific response criteria as assessed by the Investigator, 4-6 months
Safety of XL114, as evaluated by Adverse Events (AEs), To evaluate the safety of XL114 through the evaluation of incidence and severity of treatment emergent nonserious adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)at each dose level and their relationship to study drug treatment., 4-6 months|Tolerability of XL114, as evaluated by Dose Intensity, Dose Modifications, and Study Discontinuation due to AEs, To evaluate the tolerability of XL114 through the evaluation of dose intensity, dose modifications and study treatment discontinuation due to AEs related to XL114., 4-6 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), To evaluate the Tmax of XL114., 4-6 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the Cmax of XL114., 4-6 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve Over the Last 24-hour Dosing Interval (AUC 0-24), To evaluate the AUC 0-24 of XL114., 4-6 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Terminal Half-Life, To evaluate the terminal half-life of XL114., 4-6 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Apparent Clearance (CL/F), To evaluate the CL/F of XL114., 4-6 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Antitumor Activity of XL114 (Objective Response Rate [ORR]), To evaluate the antitumor activity of XL114 as measured by ORR based on lymphoma-specific response criteria as assessed by a Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC) for selected cohorts., 4-6 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Antitumor Activity of XL114 (Duration of Response [DOR]), To evaluate the antitumor activity of XL114 as measured by DOR based on lymphoma-specific response criteria as assessed by the Investigator or by a Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC) for selected cohorts., 4-6 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Antitumor Activity of XL114 (Progression Free Survival [PFS]), To evaluate the antitumor activity of XL114 as measured by PFS based on lymphoma-specific response criteria as assessed by the Investigator or by a Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC) for selected cohorts., 4-6 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Overall Survival (OS) of XL114, To evaluate duration of overall survival (OS), 4-6 months
