GRN163L is a telomerase template antagonist with in vitro and in vivo activity in a variety of tumor model systems. Telomerase is an enzyme that is active primarily in tumor cells and is crucial for the indefinite growth of tumor cells. Inhibition of telomerase may result in antineoplastic effects.
