Tomosynthesis in Screening Mammography
Tomosynthesis is a new digital mammographic tool which can be performed at the same time as routine screening mammography. It creates CT-like slices through the breast, minimizing the tissue overlap. Tomosynthesis has the potential to improve screening mammography outcomes by increasing cancer detection rates, decreasing false negative rates and false positive rates. This trial will help determine if tomosynthesis is useful in a screening setting.
Breast Density >25%
PROCEDURE: 2D Mammogram|PROCEDURE: Tomosynthesis
Interpretation Time of Scan, Within 1 month of receiving scan
Recall Rates, 6 month intervals for 2 years after initial scan|Discomfort Scale, Immediately after the subject receives scan
We will evaluate the effect of tomosynthesis mammography outcomes in a screening setting. We will collect data on interpretation time, recall rates, cancer detection rates, and interval cancer rates in dense breasts(â‰¥ 50% glandular density). If the interpretation time is less than 4X a routine read, and the recall rates have dropped \< 30% of initial values, we will then conduct a study with larger numbers to better evaluate cancer detection rates and interval cancer rates.
