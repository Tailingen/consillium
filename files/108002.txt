ctHPVDNA in HPV Positive Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx
This study is a prospective phase II trial, designed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of adjuvant treatment deintensification guided by ctHPVDNA levels for patients with HPV+OPSCC who undergo transoral surgery and neck dissection.

Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), commonly known as throat cancer or tonsil cancer, has seen a dramatic rise in incidence over the last twenty years due to the increased incidence of human papillomavirus-positive (HPV) infection and \* malignancy within the oropharynx.

The prevailing treatment philosophy within head and neck oncology is that deintensifying treatment could still provide equivalent oncologic outcomes, while further lowering toxicity profiles and improving functional outcomes to minimize the morbidity incurred by patients.

The next frontier in the treatment of HPV+ OPSCC, then, is the potential use of ctHPVDNA in the treatment personalization. Patients could be stratified into risk categories based on their ctHPVDNA levels, and in turn, receive a tailored treatment intensity accordingly.

The goal of this research study is to see if de-intensifying (stopping or scaling back) treatment still provides the same, or perhaps even better, results when compared to standard treatment when using your ctHPVDNA test results as a guide for your treatment.
