A Study of Evorpacept (ALX148) With Venetoclax and Azacitidine for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (ASPEN-05)
This Phase 1/2 clinical study will evaluate evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|AML, Adult
DRUG: evorpacept|DRUG: venetoclax|DRUG: azacitidine
Phase 1: Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Number of participants with a DLT, Up to 28 days|Phase 2: Composite complete remission rate (CRc), Number of participants achieving a complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 criteria, Approximately 6 months
The Phase 1 will consist of a dose escalation of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine. The Phase 2 will evaluate the efficacy of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for patients with AML. While intended to be a Phase 1/2 clinical study, the study never moved forward to Phase 2.
