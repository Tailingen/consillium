Hodgkin Lymphoma Molecular Profiling and Clinical Outcomes in U.S. Community Oncology Practices
The purpose of this study is to gather data on patients diagnosed with and treated for classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL). It aims to closely observe how treatment for cHL is rendered, as well as assess the outcome of those treatment options and their impact on quality of life. Additional analyses will also attempt to identify prognostic or predictive biomarkers
Hodgkin's Disease
Composite of Treatment Patterns, What are the treatment patterns of therapies used to treat cHL (ie, incorporation of novel chemotherapy or non-chemotherapy to upfront therapy, chemotherapy/radiation and/or transplant sparring patterns, incorporation of immune checkpoint agents or other investigational therapies), Up to five years|Overall Survival (OS), Up to five years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Up to five years|Duration of Response, Up to five years|Percentage of patients who achieve complete response, Up to 5 years|Percentage of patients who achieve partial response, Up to 5 years
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), Up to five years|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym), Up to five years|Drivers of Treatment Choice, What are drivers of choice (eg. lack of response, safety, cost or other barriers to care) for:

treatment decisions across and between drug classes, changes and/or discontinuation in treatment, determinants of transplant eligibility/in-eligibility?, Up to five years|Healthcare resource utilization measured by imputed costs, Up to five years|Grade of AE, Up to 5 years
