Real World Efficacy, Safety of Nanoliposomal Irinotecan With Fluorouracil and Folinic Acid in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer After Previous Gemcitabine-based Therapy
The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy (primary endpoint: overall survival), safety (secondary endpoint) and the medico-economic impact (secondary endpoint) of nanoliposomal irinotecan combined with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid in clinical practice
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Metastatic
Overall survival, Up to 3 years
Response rate to treatment, Initial staging at the time of diagnosis is based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Duration of treatment is calculated from the day of nal-IRI initiation to the day of disease progression, switch to other treatment regimens or when the patient is lost to follow-up.

Tumor response is assessed by abdominal CT or MRI, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) and CA19-9., Every 3 months up to 3 years|Progression-free survival, Every 3 months up to 3 years|Cost evaluation, number of vials per patient, Every 3 months up to 3 years
Nanoliposomal irinotecan combined with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid was shown to be effective after gemcitabine-based treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the phase III NAPOLI-1 randomized trial.

Nanoliposomal irinotecan is authorized in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV), as it has shown an improvement in overall survival (median +1.9 months, HR = 0.67) compared to 5-FU/LV alone, without degradation of quality-of-life scales.

However, patients included in clinical trials regularly differ from patients in routine practice, and a real-life study is fundamental in this poor prognosis situation where quality of life preservation is paramount
