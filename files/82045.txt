Safety of Expanded Haploidentical Natural Killer Cells for Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to estimate the safety of ex vivo expanded haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells for patients with leukemia.
Leukemia, Acute Myeloid|Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic
BIOLOGICAL: Expanded Haploidentical Natural Killer cells|DRUG: IL-2
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events will be graded according to the CTCAE v4.0, 1 months
Days of persistence of adoptively-transferred haploidentical NK cells, Analysis of donor chimerism at +2, 6, 10, 14, 21, 28 days after NK infusion., 1 months|Occurrence of disease response, Analysis of blast cells content in bone marrow by cytomorphology or detection of MRD level by flow/PCR before and after immunotherapy., 1 months post infusion|Median time to leukocytes and platelets recovery, Days of platelets (\>50x10\^9/L) and leukocytes (\>1x10\^9/L) recovery., 2 months post infusion|Number of T, B, NK, activated T and NK cells after immunotherapy, Analysis of T, B, NK, activated T and NK cells numbers (cells/microL) at +2, 6, 10, 14, 21, 28 days after NK infusion., 1 months post infusion
Immunotherapy with natural killer (NK) cells may improve the results of treatment for patients with cancer. However, for better efficiency high doses of NK cells are required. For this purpose, NK cells were expanded in the presence of feeder K562 cells gene-modified for expression 4-1BBL and membrane bound IL-21. In the result of expansion, large number of activated NK cells are obtained.

Protocol of immunotherapy includes conditioning (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide or any other protocol of chemotherapy) followed by expanded NK cells intravenous infusion. To sustain proliferation of donor NK cells in vivo patients receive 6 doses of Il-2 every second day. 10 patients will be enrolled in phase I to test different doses of NK cells: 20, 50, 70, 100 and \>100 x 10\^6/kg.
