ELEMENT-MDS: A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Luspatercept in Participants With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Anemia Not Receiving Blood Transfusions
The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Luspatercept vs epoetin alfa in the treatment of anemia in adults due to IPSS-R very low, low, intermediate-risk MDS in ESA-naïve participants who are non-transfusion dependent (NTD).
