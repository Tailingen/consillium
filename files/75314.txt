A Study of ION251 Administered to Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ION251 in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Relapsed Multiple Myeloma|Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ION251
Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which â‰¤ 1 of 3 evaluable participants experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within Cycle 1 and there are 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 evaluable participants in the next higher-dose level experiencing a DLT within Cycle 1. If no dose in the dose-escalation has 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 evaluable participants experiencing a DLT, the highest dose level is considered the MTD, Up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug in Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (PR2D), RP2D is chosen based on the dose response and exposure-response analyses of the pooled clinical PK, PD, safety results, and anti-myeloma activity from both Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug
Safety and Tolerability as Measured by the Incidence of TEAEs, Up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug|Incidence of Abnormal Laboratory Values and Vital Signs, Up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug|Cmax: Maximum Observed Concentration ION251, From Baseline up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug|AUC[0-t]: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve from Hour zero to t of ION251, From Baseline up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug|t1/2: Distribution Half-life of ION251, From Baseline up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug|Trough Concentration of ION251, From Baseline up to 28 days from the last dose of study drug|Urine 0-24 Hour (hr) Excretion of ION251, Up to 12 months from the last dose of study drug
This is a two-part, multi-center first in human study of ION251 in up to 80 participants. Part 1 will use a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme in sequential cohorts to determine the MTD and RP2D during repeated 28-day treatment cycles. MTD will be determined by the number of participants with AEs meeting the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria during Cycle 1. The MTD determined in Part 1 will be used with other variables to inform a RP2D for participants proceeding to Part 2 for further assessments in the safety, tolerability and anti-myeloma activity.
