Phase I Trial HIPEC With Nal-irinotecan
The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of intraperitoneal administration of heated nanoliposomal Irinotecan in cytoreductive surgery (CRS), which is surgery designed to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedures.

Cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy consists of two parts: the first is the surgical removal of all grossly visible deposits of cancer from the abdomen; and the second is application of heated chemotherapy in salt water at the same time as the removal of the visible cancer. HIPEC is an alternative method of delivering chemotherapy. Traditional chemotherapy is injected into a vein, while HIPEC applies chemotherapy drugs warmed up by an FDA-approved machine to 108 degrees Fahrenheit directly into the abdomen during surgery, making it an option for cancers that originated in or have spread to the abdominal cavity. Standard treatment in this manner usually includes Mitomycin C or Cisplatin as its chemotherapy agents. In this study, the investigators will use nanoliposomal irinotecan as the chemotherapy agent. Irinotecan is FDA approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
