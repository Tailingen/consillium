Preferences for Certainty Versus Access When Evaluating New Cancer Drugs. A Discrete Choice Experiment.
To provide timely access to new treatments, some eligible drugs can be approved despite uncertainty surrounding the level of clinical benefit they offer patients.

It is not currently known if (and under which circumstances) people would prefer to wait to access some new drugs in exchange for greater certainty surrounding their clinical benefit.

This study aims to elicit the preferences of people in the US with experience of cancer for wait times and clinical uncertainty of new drugs.

To elicit this information, in a survey format, respondents will be presented with a hypothetical scenario and asked to state their preferences for new treatments, each with different attributes.

OTHER: Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)
Preferences for treatment attributes and trade-offs between attributes., Preferences for different treatment attributes (including clinical uncertainty and wait time), and trade-offs between these, using a study-specific Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) Questionnaire. Preferences are measured on relative utility scale (arbitrary units, no min/max). Utility indicates preference e.g., higher values are more preferred (better)., Through study completion, an average of 4-8 weeks.
