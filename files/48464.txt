Evaluation of 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab for Non-invasive Imaging of EGFR+ Cancers by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
Over-expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) on cells occurs in all aggressive cancers of epithelial origin. Existing tests for monitoring EGFR expression are invasive and not reliable. There needs to be a better way to measure EGFR expression in cancerous tumors to better tailor cancer treatments.

This clinical trial aims to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging cancers that express EGFR using 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography (CT). By non-invasively imaging the status of EGFR, 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab could be used to assist in the identification of patients who are likely to respond to anti-EGFR treatments, including nimotuzumab. The hypothesis is that 89Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab will accumulate to tumors over-expressing EGFR making them visible when imaged with PET/CT. This hypothesis will be tested in this study, along with the optimal imaging time and diagnostic ability.
