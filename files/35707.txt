DPD Guided 5-FU Precision Treatment in Gastro-intestinal Cancer Patients
Rationale:

Fluorouracil (5-FU) are broadly used in chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of cancers. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is a major enzyme in the 5-FU metabolism pathway. Patients with a partial or complete DPD deficiency have a strongly reduced capacity to metabolize 5-FU which may result in severe or life-threatening toxicity when treated with a standard dose of fluoropyrimidines. A partial DPD deficiency is present in 3-5% of the North American and European population. DPD deficiency is most often caused by genetic variants in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD). The four DPYD variants considered most clinically relevant and with statistically significant association with severe toxicity are DPYD\*2A (rs3918290, c.1905+1G\>A, IVS14+1G\>A), c.2846A\>T (rs67376798, D949V), c.1679T\>G (rs55886062, DPYD\*13, I560S), and c.1236G\>A (rs56038477, E412E, in haplotype B3). Prospective testing for DPD deficiency can prevent severe toxicity or mortality. Several methods have been proposed for detection of DPD deficiency, based on either genotyping of DPYD or measurement of the DPD phenotype. However, DPD deficiency is not the only factor associated with variable concentrations of 5-FU. 5-FU displays an exposure-response relationship between systemic exposure and clinical events. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) or pharmacokinetics (PK)-guided dosing of 5-FU is also considered as an alternative to ensure an acceptable exposure of 5-FU. Upfront DPD screening combined with PK guided 5-FU dosing as a tool to personalize treatment has never been studied before. In this study, we aim to investigate the PK of 5-FU for the 4 most common DPYD genetic variants, in order to better define a safe starting dose for 5-FU in DPD deficient patients.

Objectives:

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the clearance of 5-FU for the 4 most common DPYD gene variants compared to the clearance of 5-FU in DPYD wild-type patients. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the toxicity incidence and the extent of DPD deficiency as measured by Uracil Loading Test (ULT) for the 4 most common DPYD variants, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of reduced starting dose of 5-FU in patients with DPD deficiency, to demonstrate the ability to achieve a target AUC range, to establish that PK-guided 5-FU dosing decreases the incidence of 5-FU related toxicities, to establish the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the DPYD genotyping test and to optimize the sampling moment of 5-FU in order to minimize patient discomfort related to TDM procedures

Study design:

The study is designed as a single-centre prospective inception cohort study. All patients will be screened for DPD deficiency by DPYD genotyping and separated into two groups; DPYD common variants and control group. Patients with DPYD wild-type but who experience CTC grade 3-4 toxicity will also be included in this study as a toxicity group. Patients will be tested with an oral ULT to identify their DPD phenotype and measured an endogenous U/DHU ratio. Therapeutic drug monitoring will be performed to follow-up patients' 5-FU plasma concentration after start chemotherapy treatment. 5-FU plasma concentrations will be monitored until a steady state AUC of 20-30 mg.h/L is reached or maximum 4 treatment cycles is reached.

Study population:

All gastrointestinal cancer patients aged 18 years and older who are scheduled to receive treatment with fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy.

Treatment:

All patients will be treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen for their respective gastrointestinal cancer. Only 5-FU based regimens will be considered for this study. Patients will receive adjusted 5-FU doses based on their condition, including body surface area, gene activity score or DPD status, and steady state AUC from the previous dose, until their AUC reaches a target range. Patients will continue to receive regular treatment, as long as needed and/or tolerated.

Main study parameters:

The primary outcome of the study is the clearance of 5-FU at steady state (Clss) measured in ml/min. Among cancer patients treated with 5-FU, we will compare the variation in clearance between the four common DPYD variant allele carriers and DPYD wild-type carriers. The secondary study parameters are the incidence of 5-FU related toxicities, U/DHU ratio, DPD phenotype (EM, IM, and PM), 5-FU doses, dosage adjustment and time to reach target AUC (cycle number).
