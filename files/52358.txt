A Randomized, Placebo Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Potential Efficacy of MS-20 in Combination with Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
MS-20 was approved as the first oral cancer adjuvant new drug indicated for ameliorating fatigue and appetite loss associated with cancer chemotherapy via reshaping human gut ecosystem and restoring immunity. MS-20 has also been shown to be anti-PD-1 booster by activating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in mice cancer models, particularly promoting migration of TILs into tumors and increasing the amount of TILs inside tumors. Therefore, this study is designed to explore the potential clinical outcomes, safety and relationship between gut microbiome in NSCLC patients under combination therapy with pembrolizumab and MS-20.
NSCLC Stage IIIB~IV
DRUG: MS-20|DRUG: Placebo
To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with MS-20 combined with pembrolizumab., According to RECIST 1.1, the objective response rate (ORR) assessed by contrast is defined as the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink to a predetermined amount and remain for a period of time, which is the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., 48 weeks
Progression free survival (PFS), According to Solid Tumor Efficacy Evaluation Criteria Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), is defined as the time from the beginning of the treatment period to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any other non-PD cause (whichever occurs first)., 48 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), According to the Solid Tumor Efficacy Evaluation Criteria Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), defined as the proportion of subjects whose optimal overall response was determined to be a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or disease stabilization (SD)., 48 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), Assessed according to the Solid Tumor Efficacy Evaluation Criteria Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), defined as the minimum time from the first observation of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to disease progression (PD) or death for subjects whose best overall response after treatment is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Otherwise, DOR will be the time of the last tumor evaluation., 48 weeks|Safety assessment- incidence of adverse events (TEAEs), Following treatment with the investigational product. According to "The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Fifth Edition Evaluation Form; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0" as a clinical evaluation tool., 48 weeks
To evaluate the effect on the gut microbiota in subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with MS-20 combined with pembrolizumab., To evaluate the effect on the gut microbiota in subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with MS-20 combined with pembrolizumab., 48 weeks|Safety, Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, laboratory tests, monitoring AEs, vital signs, and concomitant medication usage., 48 weeks
