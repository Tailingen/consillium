Study of Safety and Efficacy of LEE011 and Ceritinib in Patients With ALK-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
This was a Phase Ib/II study of the ALK inhibitor ceritinib in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

The purpose of the study was to determine the MTD/RP2D of the LEE011 and ceritinib combination and evaluate whether the combination was safe and had beneficial effects in ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.

This trial did not progress to Phase II. Trial population terminated before reaching Phase II

In Sep-2016, Novartis made a decision not to move into phase ll after the primary objective for this study was met. Because the study never made it to phase ll, the study phase has been changed from a phase l/ll to a phase l.
