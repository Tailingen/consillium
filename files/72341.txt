Phase I Study of Induction Therapy With VELCADE and Vorinostat in Patients With Surgically Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (both good and bad) two medications (VELCADE and Vorinostat) have on patients who have certain types of lung cancer. The study is "dose escalating" meaning that patients will receive different doses of medication depending on when they enter the study. Participation in the study will last approximately 3 months and will include an initial screening visit, a visit once each week for 3 weeks to receive the study medications, and then 2 additional visits around the time of your surgery to remove your lung cancer tumor.
