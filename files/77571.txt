A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen With Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide at Days 1, 4 Every 14 Days With Filgrastim Support Followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Women With Primary Breast Cancer.
TITLE: A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen with Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide at Days 1, 4 Every 14 Days with Filgrastim Support followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Women with Primary Breast Cancer.

PROTOCOL CODE: IRST 174.05

PHASE: II

STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacological, open-label, prospective, not randomized, monocentric trial

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENT:

FEC + filgrastim x 3 cycles q 14-21 days

Day 1 and day 4 = FEC (FLUOROURACIL 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes + EPIRUBICIN 60 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1 hour + CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes).

From day 7 until hematological recovery = Filgrastim 300 microg s.c.

After 21 days from the last FEC cycle = Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1hour (weekly for 8 cycles, at day 1).

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: in the first stage, 11 patients have been planned, with an additional 27 patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment.

OBJECTIVES

Primary objective: this trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability. Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia, nausea/vomit, and bone pain, which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim). Deliverability is measured as the percentage of patients who complete the planned treatment.

Secondary objectives:

* Relapse-free survival: measured from enrollment to the first date between date of documented relapse (or death) or date of last tumor assessment (if no documented relapse), or the date of last tumor assessment before the start of any further antitumor therapy not planned in the protocol.
* Overall survival: measured from enrollment to the date of death of any cause or last follow-up.

CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES: to evaluate retrospectively potential biomarkers of activity and toxicity of this regimen, blood and plasma samples until 15 mL each one will be collected at study entry, before first docetaxel administration and 3-4 weeks after last docetaxel administration. Moreover, a paraffin block or specimens of the primary tumor will be collected for biological studies.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability.

Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia, nausea/vomit, and bone pain, which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim).

A Simon two-stage design has been used with a 60% tolerability rate considered not promising and an 80% tolerability rate as promising, and probability of type I and type II errors has been set to be 0.10.

In the first stage, 11 patients have been planned, with an additional 27 patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment. The regimen would be considered tolerable and worthy of further study if at the end of the trial 27 out 38 patients complete the planned treatment.
Women With Primary Breast Cancer
DRUG: FEC (Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide) + filgrastim + paclitaxel
Tolerability of the treatment, Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia, nausea/vomit, and bone pain, which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim)., 18 months|Toxicity, All patients will be evaluated for toxicity according to NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria. All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment. Safety analysis will be based on the population of all treated (at least one cycle) patients., 18 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression., 18 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to last follow-up visit or death., 18 months|Relapse-free survival, The relapse-free survival is measured from enrollment to the first date between date of documented relapse/progression (or death) or date of last tumor assessment (if no documented progression) or the date of last tumor assessment before the start of any further antitumor therapy not planned in the protocol., 18 months|Kaplan-Meier curves, Time related outcomes (PFS, OS) will be described using Kaplan-Meier curves. 95% Confidence Intervals for median time and for each year of follow-up will be calculated with non-parametric methods., 18 months
