Open-label Study of STA-9090 for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, STA-9090 has on the patient and their breast cancer.

STA-9090 is an experimental drug that works by breaking down cancer proteins. When the cancer proteins are destroyed, the cancer cells die. STA-9090 is an experimental drug that is not yet approved for the treatment of cancer by the United States (FDA) Food and Drug Administration . STA-9090 has been tested in cancer patients in other trials and a safe dose for this drug has been found. We are now interested to see how active this drug is against breast cancer.
