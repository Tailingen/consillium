If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. Neither you nor the study staff will be able to choose which group you will be in:

* If you are in Group 1, you will read a booklet about colorectal cancer screening tests. While reading the booklet, you will also listen to an audio CD that will narrate the booklet.
* If you are in Group 2, you will watch a video with non-moving images about colorectal cancer screening tests on an iPad.
* If you are in Group 3, you will watch a video with animated images about colorectal cancer screening tests on an iPad.

You will complete questionnaires before and after viewing the program that will contain questions about:

* Your age and what language you speak
* Your math and reading comprehension
* Your knowledge of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening
* Your thoughts about colorectal cancer screening
* Your opinions about this study, and
