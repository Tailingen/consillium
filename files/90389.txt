Prostatic Artery Embolization for Obstructive Uropathy Due to Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of prostatic artery embolization of patients with recurrent symptoms secondary to locally advanced prostatic cancer including pelvic pain, bleeding or need for permanent urinary catheter who are unfit for or refuse surgical treatment.

Ability to void spontaneously, The ability to void after removal of the indwelling catheter, 1 months
IPSS, International Prostate Symptom Score, 1, 6 months|QoL, Quality of Life (scale), 1, 6 months|IIEF, International Index of Erectile Function, 1, 6 months|PV, Prostate Volume, 1, 6 months|PVR, Post-void residual, 1, 6 months|Qmax, Peak void flow, 1, 6 months|PSA, Prostate-specific antigen, 1, 24-hours, 6 months
This is a prospective study investigating the safety and efficacy of PAE for patients with prostate cancer who suffers from acute urinary retention, severe LUTS and/or recurrent complications such as haematuria.

Our hypothesis is that PAE will eliminate the need for indwelling catheter and improve IPSS and QoL 12 months post-procedure.

1, and 6 months follow-up.

Main outcome Ability to void after removal of indwelling catheter

Secondary outcomes International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Quality of Life (QoL) International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Prostate volume Peak void flow (Qmax) Post-void residual (PVR) Classify complications according to Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines for reporting Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
