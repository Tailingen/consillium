Pemetrexed Plus Cetuximab in Patients With Recurrent Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Both pemetrexed and cetuximab have single agent activity in NSCLC and non-overlapping toxicity profiles. While 2-drug combination therapy has proven superior to single agent therapy in the first-line setting of NSCLC, no such phase III trials have been reported in the second-line setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of combining these drugs, assessing the toxicity profile, determining the MTD and evaluating the activity of the combination in an expanded phase II setting. If the combination appears to have promising activity, further evaluation of this regimen may be warranted comparing it to single agent pemetrexed or cetuximab alone.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cetuximab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Pemetrexed in Combination With Cetuximab, The primary objective of the phase I portion of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pemetrexed and cetuximab, 12 months|Time To Progression (TTP), The primary objective of the phase II portion is to estimate the time to progression of this combination, evaluated per RECIST criteria where PD= at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, 24 Months

OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

Week 1 (day 1):

* Cetuximab 400mg/m2

Week 2 (Cycle 1, Day 1):

* Cetuximab 250mg/m2 plus premetrexed at the assigned dose level.

Patients will be treated with cetuximab on day 1, 8, 15 of each 21 day cycle.

Patients will be treated with pemetrexed on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles.

Acceptable toxicity and SD, PR or CR: treat up to 6 cycles then continue cetuximab weekly until PD or excess toxicity

Performance status: ECOG 0-2

Life expectancy: At least 12 weeks
