Molecular Subtyping of Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer and Relevent Clinical Significance
To validate the predictive value of transcriptome-based molecular subtyping of extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for the efficacy of programmed death-1(PD-1)/programmed death-ligand1(PD-L1) inhibitor in the first line setting; to explore the differences of immune microenvironment between different SCLC subtypes to reveal the mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance of SCLC
SCLC,Extensive Stage
DRUG: PD-(L)1 antibody immunotherapy
Progression-free survival, From the start of first-line treatment until disease progression or death due to any cause, 2022.4.1-2023.12.31
Overall survival, From the start of first-line treatment until death due to any cause, 2022.4.10-2024.12.31|Objective response rate, The tumor size was calculated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance Imaging scan, the best response was evaluated based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECISTVersion1.1), 2022.4.10-2023.12.31|molecular subtyping and tumor microenvironment biomarkers, The molecular subtyping was carried out based on transcripsome sequencing following the method in published article PMID: 33482121, the tumor microenvironment biomarkers include tumor infiltrated immune cells and specific gene expression evaluated by transcripsome and Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis etc., 2022.4.10-2023.12.31
This retrospective observational study examines the predictive value of transcriptome-based molecular subtyping of extensive stage SCLC for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor efficacy and explores immune microenvironment differences between subtypes to uncover immunotherapy resistance mechanisms. Patients with extensive stage SCLC receiving first-line standard treatment are enrolled, and baseline tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples are collected for transcriptome sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Based on results, patients are classified into four molecular subtypes, and treatment efficacy and safety are recorded. The study compares the efficacy between SCLC subtypes to determine if molecular typing predicts immunotherapy efficacy and investigates immune microenvironment differences between subtypes to uncover resistance mechanisms. Treatment regimens follow first-line extensive stage SCLC guidelines, including cisplatin+etoposide or carboplatin+etoposide and PD-(L)1 inhibitors, with options determined by the supervising physician.
