A Study to Investigate LYL797 in Adults With Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of LYL797, a ROR1-targeted CAR T-cell therapy, in patients with ROR1+ relapsed or refractory triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer/ fallopian tube cancer/ primary peritoneal cancer (Ovarian cancer), or Endometrial cancer. The first part of the study will determine the safe dose for the next part of the study, and will enroll patients with TNBC, NSCLC, Ovarian or Endometrial cancer. The second part of the study will test that dose in additional patients with TNBC, NSCLC, Ovarian or Endometrial cancer.

This Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of LYL797, ROR1- targeted CAR T cells, in adults with relapsed and/or refractory ROR1+ triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Ovarian cancer, or endometrial cancer. The dose-escalation phase includes patients with TNBC, NSCLC, Ovarian, or Endometrial cancer, and will investigate multiple dose levels to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The dose-expansion phase will enroll patients with TNBC, NSCLC, Ovarian, or Endometrial cancer at the RP2D.
