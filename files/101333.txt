Prophylactic Use of PEG-rhG-CSF in Medium-high Risk of FN in Chemotherapy of Breast Cancer
This clinical study is a multiple center, registering and real-world conditional research. The breast cancer patients planning for chemotherapy evaluated with medium-high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) are recruited, receiving the first level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF or the second level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF in at least two cycles of chemotherapy according to real-world clinical judgement and choice by physicians in local cancer center. Comparing real conditional-FN rate, FN-caused hospitalization rate and antibiotic use rate, direct/indirect medical cost.
Febrile Neutropenia
DRUG: PEGCSF first level prophylactic use|DRUG: PEGCSF second level prophylactic use
FN rate, rate of febrile neutropenia during all cycles of chemotherapy, assessment at 1 month after the last cycle chemotherapy complete
rate of 3-4 grade neutropenia, rate of 3-4 grade decrease of ANC, During all cycles of chemotherapy, through study completion, an average of half year|FN-caused hospitalization, rate of FN-caused hospitalization, During all cycles of chemotherapy, through study completion, an average of half year|FN-caused antibiotic use rate, rate of FN-caused antibiotic use, During all cycles of chemotherapy, through study completion, an average of half year|rate of dose reduction, rate of reduction of chemotherapy dose, During all cycles of chemotherapy, through study completion, an average of half year
The breast cancer patients planning for neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy evaluated with medium-high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) according to NCCN and ASCO guideline are recruited, receiving the first level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF or the second level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF according to real-world clinical judgement and choice by physicians in local cancer center for at least two cycles of chemotherapy. The primary outcome is FN rate, the second outcomes are rate of 3-4 grade decrease of ANC, FN-caused hospitalization, FN-caused antibiotic use rate, rate of reduction of chemotherapy dose, delay of chemotherapy, safety and pharmacoeconomics.
