Capivasertib China PK Study
This is an open-label, 2-part Phase I study to assess the PK, safety and tolerability of capivasertib as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in Chinese participants with advanced solid tumours
Advanced Solid Tumours
DRUG: Capivasertib|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 12 hours post-dose (AUC 0-12) of Capivasertib, AUC0-12 is defined as area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours., first dose up to approximately 6 months|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of Capivasertib, Cmax is defined as maximum plasma concentration, first dose up to approximately 6 months|terminal half-life (t1/2) of Capivasertib, t1/2 is defined as terminal half-life, first dose up to approximately 6 months|Accumulation ratio (Rac) of Capivasertib, Rac is defined as accumulation ratio, first dose up to approximately 6 months
Safety and tolerability of drugs by assessment of AEs/SAEs, Graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI CTCAE V5.0), From time of signature of the ICF, through study completion, up to 17 months, and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug
A Phase I study is designed to assess the PK, safety and tolerability of single-dose and multiple-dose capivasertib as monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with paclitaxel (Part B) in approximately 16 Chinese participants with advanced solid tumours and to detect any differences in the PK profile between Chinese and Caucasian participants due to ethnicity. Descriptive summary will be conducted on the PK analysis set and safety analysis set.The evaluation of capivasertib PK data will be based on the PK analysis set.The assessment on safety and tolerability will be based on the safety analysis set.
