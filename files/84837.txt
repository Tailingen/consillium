Use of Sorafenib and/or Regorafenib in Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) Subsequent to Another Systemic First-line Treatment
Researchers already did trials that showed Sorafenib and Regorafenib worked for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (most common liver tumor type).

In this trial, they want to learn more about the same patient group in which Sorafenib or Regorafenib is given after other drugs. Patients participating in this study will be observed until 12 months after the last patient has been enrolled to collect data on how safe the drugs are and how well they are working when used as second line or beyond treatment.
