Seroma and Hematoma Rates: MAXIGESIC IV vs. Ketorolac in Breast Cancer Surgery
The investigators aim to compare the incidence rates of seroma (fluid collection) and hematoma (blood clot) following breast cancer surgery between the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) Ketorolac and MAXIGESIC. The investigators seek to determine the complication rates in patients receiving MAXIGESIC post-surgery, hypothesizing that the higher dosage of ibuprofen in MAXIGESIC compared to Ketorolac will result in lower complication rates.
Breast Cancer|Post-Operative Hematoma|Seroma as Procedural Complication|Post-Op Complication
Postoperative hemovac or JP total drainage amount, Postoperative hemovac or JP total drainage amount, within 3 months|hematoma incidence, hematoma incidence, within 3 months|Seroma incidence, Seroma incidence, within 3 months
Length of hospital stay, Length of hospital stay and re operation rate, within 3 months|Complication, * When hematoma occurs: Whether transfusion is required and whether EB band is applied, check the amount when aspirating (diagnosis criteria color: sanguinous, old bloody \[brownish\], operation (hematoma evacuation)
* When seroma occurs: check the amount when aspirating (diagnosis criteria color: serous, serosanguinous)
* Complication: Whether abscess occurs, within 3 months
