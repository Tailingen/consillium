Factors Associated With Residual Disease In The Central Cone
Cervical conization using the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is the standard treatment for patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Several studies have shown that excising a central cone reduces the rate of positive endocervical margins. The purpose of this study is to identify clinicopathological factors associated with residual disease in the central cone and to develop a predictive model to better determine which patients may require this additional procedure.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
Identify the clinical and pathologic factors associated with residual disease, Whit the variables identified as factors associated with the residual disease develop a predictive model to determine which individuals may require additional procedures in the uterine cervix to ensure negative margins., 1month
This study pretends to create a retrospective database including all patient who underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure by treatment for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and create a a predictive model for top-hat resection in patients with high grade CIN
