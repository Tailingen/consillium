NOX-A12 in Combination With Bendamustine and Rituximab in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOX A12 in combination with a background therapy of bendamustine and rituximab (BR) chemotherapy in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: NOX-A12
Safety and tolerability of NOX A12 alone and in combination with BR., The safety evaluation will be based on the following assessments:

* adverse events
* vital signs
* 12 lead ECGs
* laboratory parameters
* immunogenicity, 30 months|Complete remission (CR) rate, Assessment of the complete remission rate after cycle 3 and 6 will be the primary efficacy endpoint. The 1996 NCI-WG criteria which have been updated in 2008 will be applied., 6 months
Pharmacodynamics of NOX-A12 alone and in combination with BR, The pharmacodynamics evaluation will be based on the following assessments:

* mobilization of peripheral blood CD34+ cells and CLL cells
* plasma concentration of SDF-1/CXCL12, 6 months|Overall response rate (ORR = CR + PR), 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS), 30 months|Pharmacokinetics of NOX-A12 alone and in combination with BR, The pharmacokinetics evaluation will be based on the following assessments:

* plasma concentration of NOX-A12
* 24-hour urine excretion of NOX-A12, 10 time points over 6 months|Event free survival (EFS), 30 months|Time to progression (TTP), 30 months|Duration of response (DOR), 30 months|Overall survival (OS), 30 months
CLL cells express high levels of CXCR4 chemokine receptors, which cause leukemia cell migration and adhesion to stromal cells secreting the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (or stromal-derived-factor 1, SDF-1). NOX A12 is a specific CXCL12 antagonist and may improve BR therapy by disrupting CXCR4-CXCL12 interactions, thereby mobilizing CLL cells from protective tissue microenvironments to the blood. Furthermore, SDF-1 inhibition may alter the activation status of CLL cells, thereby triggering apoptosis or sensitization of CLL cells towards chemotherapy.
