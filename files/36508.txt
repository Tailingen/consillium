Chemotherapy Treatment in Re-occurring Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After Previous Chemotherapy and Surgical Removal of the NSCLC Tumor
The purpose of this study is to help answer:

* Whether pemetrexed, gemcitabine and/or carboplatin can shrink tumor(s) or make tumor(s) disappear in patients with relapsed lung cancer (lung cancer that has come back after surgical removal and chemotherapy), and to determine how long this will last
* Whether pemetrexed, gemcitabine and/or carboplatin can help patients with relapsed lung cancer live longer
Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Objective Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria., baseline to time of response (up to 17.5 months)
Overall Survival, Overall survival is the number of participants who were alive when the trial was terminated., baseline to trial termination (17.5 months)|Time to Progressive Disease, baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 17.5 months)|Duration of Response, time of response to progressive disease (up to 17.5 months)|Time to Treatment Failure, baseline to stopping treatment (up to 17.5 months)
