Doxorubicin With Upfront Dexrazoxane for the Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of this research study is to look at whether giving a drug called dexrazoxane with standard of care doxorubicin affects the progression of the disease. Dexrazoxane is often given at the same time as doxorubicin to help reduce the incidence and severity of disease of the heart muscle (which can be caused by doxorubicin).

In January 2019 Eli Lilly and Company reported that the results of the Phase 3 study of olaratumab (Lartruvo), in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, did not confirm the clinical benefit of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin as compared to doxorubicin alone. Therefore olaratumab is being removed from the front line standard of care regimen. Amendment #9 was made to the protocol to reflect these changes to the standard of care treatment.

Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Arm 1 Only), * PFS is defined as the time from on study to the first occurrence of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* If no event exists, the PFS will be censored at the last follow-up.
* Progressive disease - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Up to 5 years
Cardiac-related Mortality, Death due to cardiovascular while on study (heart failure, myocardial infarction, fatal arrhythmia)., Up to 12 months|Percentage of Patients With Heart Failure or Cardiomyopathy, * Cardiomyopathy is now referred to as cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) by the recent consensus statement of the International Cardio-Oncology Society. Moderate CTRCD is defined as \>10% ejection fraction drop to \<50%. Mild CTRCD is defined as drop in ≥15% ventricular strain or if no ventricular strain, a drop in ejection fraction of ≥50%.
* Heart failure is defined according to the recent Universal Definition and Classification of Heart Failure: A Report of the Heart Failure Society of America, Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese Heart Failure Society and Writing Committee of the Universal Definition of Heart Failure., Up to 12 months|Ability of 3D Echocardiogram to Serve as an Early Marker of Cardiac Dysfunction Compared to 2D Echocardiogram Modified Simpson's Biplane Method of LVEF, * Cardiac dysfunction for this outcome measure is defined as moderate cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) as assessed by 2D Echocardiogram Modified Simpson's Biplane Method of LVEF. Moderate CTRCD is defined as \>10% ejection fraction drop to \<50%.
* 3D echocardiograms were reviewed for evidence of cardiac dysfunction prior to onset of Moderate CTRCD by 2D echocardiogram. Dysfunction on 3D Echo was defined as \>10% ejection fraction drop to \<50%., Baseline and day 1 of each odd numbered cycle (each cycle is 21 days) up to 1 year|Early Detection of Cardiac Dysfunction by 2D Echocardiography Ventricular Strain Compared to 2D Echocardiography Ejection Fraction, * Cardiac dysfunction for this outcome measure is defined as moderate cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) by 2D Echocardiogram Modified Simpson's Biplane Method of LVEF. Moderate CTRCD is defined as \>10% ejection fraction drop to \<50%.
* Patients were assessed for early evidence of dysfunction by strain defined as a relative drop in global longitudinal strain (GLS) by 15% and GLS \> -17%., Baseline and day 1 of each odd numbered cycle (each cycle is 21 days) up to 1 year
