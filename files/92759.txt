Evaluation of TaiHao Breast Ultrasound Diagnosis Software
The BR-USCAD DS Module is a computer-assisted detection and diagnosis software based on a deep learning algorithm. This retrospective, fully-crossed, multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study aims to compare the performances of readers without and with the aid of the Breast Ultrasound Image Reviewed with Assistance of Computer-Assisted Detection and Diagnosis System (BR-USCAD DS) in interpreting breast ultrasound images of lesions.

Comparing the Area Under the LROC Curve, The area under the LROC curve (AUC_LROC) on the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions was computed and compared for Aim 1 (baseline) and Arm 2 (with BU-CAD assistance) studies., 10 weeks
The Reading Time Was Computed and Compared for Aim 1 (Baseline) and Arm 2 (With BU-CAD Assistance) Studies., Each reader's reading time of a case was automatically recorded by the BU-CAD system.

the average reading times of 16 readers with and without outlier reading times were compared between the aided and unaided sessions using the paired t-test., 10 weeks|The Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV Were Computed and Compared for Aim 1 (Baseline) and Arm 2 (With BU-CAD Assistance) Studies., The mean sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 16 readers were calculated and compared between the aided and unaided sessions using McNemar's test., 10 weeks
