Safety and Performance of the Multi-Modal UltraSound Tomography (MUST) Device in Breast Cancer Screening
This is a single-center, pilot study being conducted to evaluate the safety and performance of the investigational device (MUST) in detecting malignant lesions in breast tissue.
Breast Cancer Screening
DEVICE: MUST device
Number of subjects with true positive (malignant) breast lesions confirmed by biopsy, Sensitivity of MUST plus mammography versus mammography alone, 14 days|Number of subjects with false positive (benign) breast lesions confirmed by biopsy, Specificity of MUST plus mammography versus mammography alone, 14 days
Number of true positive and false positive breast lesions categorized by BI-RADS breast density category as determined by the screening mammogram, Assess the sensitivity and specificity by BI-RADS breast density category as determined by the Visit 1 mammogram, for MUST plus mammography vs mammography alone, 14 days|For subjects who undergo biopsy, comparison of MUST results with biopsy results, In the subpopulation of subjects who undergo biopsy, the concordance of MUST with biopsy will be estimated, 60 days|For subjects test positive on mammography (initial BI-RADS score of 0 followed by an additional imaging BI-RADS score of 4 or 5) who undergo biopsy, comparison of MUST and MRI results with biopsy results, In the subpopulation of subjects who test positive on mammography (BI-RADS score of 4 or 5) and have a biopsy, sensitivity and specificity will be assessed and compared between MUST and MRI and biopsy results, 60 days|Number of subjects with true positive and false positive breast lesions at the 6 month follow up (if applicable) and the 12 month follow up phone call., The co-primary endpoint of overall sensitivity and specificity will be reassessed after subjects have had the opportunity to complete the Month 6 MUST re-evaluation visit, if applicable, and again when all subjects have had the opportunity to complete the Month 12 follow-up phone call to identify events of interval cancer for MUST plus mammography as well as MUST alone, 12 months|Listing of adverse events experienced by subjects, Evaluate the safety of the MUST device by evaluating the adverse event profile, 6 months
This is a single-center, prospective, pilot study in which all enrolled subjects will receive the same screening mammography procedures (i.e., 3D mammography plus MUST).

Subjects will have between 1 and 4 clinic visits. The number of visits will be based upon the mammography and MUST findings, and whether additional procedures, such as MRI, biopsy, or a repeat MUST are warranted.
