Phase III Study of Vincristine Sulfate Liposome For Injection In Adults With Naïve Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to determine whether vincristine sulfate liposome could reduce less peripheral neuropathy than vincristine sulfate,and be as effective as vincristine sulfate in adults with Naïve Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate Liposome|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate
Overall response rate(objectives (ORR), ORR=CR+CRi CR(Complete response)

1. No circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, No lymphadenopathy,splenomegaly,skin/gum infiltration/testicular mass/CNS involvement
2. Trilineage hematopoiesis(TLH)and \<5% blast in bone marrow
3. ANC\>1000/microl
4. Platelets\>100,000/microl

CRi(Complete response with incomplete recovery of counts) Recovery of platelets but\<100,000 or ANC is \<1000/microl, up to 35 days|Incidence of General peripheral neuropathy, Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy was evaluated By Total Neuropathy Score clinical Version(TNSc).

If the score of any item of TNSc at anytime after the start of induction chemotherapy is higher than the baseline,it is considered that peripheral neuropathy occurs., A week before enrollment. one,two,three and four weeks after the start of induction chemotherapy
