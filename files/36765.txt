A Study to Assess the Effectiveness and Safety of Irinotecan Liposome Injection, 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin Plus Oxaliplatin in Patients Not Previously Treated for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, Compared to Nab-paclitaxel+Gemcitabine Treatment
The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy and safety of Irinotecan liposome injection in combination with other approved drugs used for cancer therapy, namely 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FU/LV) plus oxaliplatin compared to nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine treatment in improving the overall survival of patients not previously treated for metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
DRUG: Irinotecan Liposomal Injection|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: 5Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Overall Survival (OS), The OS was defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants who did not have a date of death recorded at the time of the final analysis were censored at the last known time that the participant was alive. The median OS was measured using Kaplan-Meier technique., Assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 8 weeks after first dose, end of treatment (EoT) visit, then every 2 months thereafter up to DCO date of 23 July 2022 (maximum of 893 days)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented disease progression using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 as per Investigator assessment or death due to any cause. The median PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier technique., Assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 8 weeks after first dose until EoT visit (maximum of 893 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) characterized as either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST Version 1.1. BOR was defined as the best response as recorded from randomization until documented objective disease progression using RECIST Version 1.1. As per RECIST version 1.1, CR is disappearance of all target lesions; PR is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and overall response = CR + PR. The ORR was calculated using Clopper-Pearson method., Assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 8 weeks after first dose until EoT visit, (maximum of 893 days)
