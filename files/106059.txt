Clinical Validation of a Fractional Administration Device for Holmium-166 SIRT
To investigate the in vivo performance and safety of a novel medical device for the injection of holmium-166 microspheres during radioembolization. The main potential advantage of this device is that it allows for injection of a during treatment determined dose, which is not possible with the current administration tool.

DEVICE: Fractional administration device
Validation of a fractional administration device for holmium radioembolization, The device will be valid if the administered fractions can be quantified on MRI with a maximal deviation of 15%., 3 months after treatment|Safety of a fractional administration device for holmium radioembolization, The safety of the device will be determined by monitoring the (S)AE's and (S)ADE's, 6 months after treatment
Accurate dosimetry based on MRI and SPECT imaging of holmium-166., To perform dosimetry based on MRI and SPECT imaging of holmium-166 and correlate this to tumour response, 6 months after treatment
