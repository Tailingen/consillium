Biomarkers in Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer Treated With Cisplatin and Cetuximab on ECOG-E5397
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer treated with cisplatin and cetuximab on ECOG-E5397.
Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab|DRUG: cisplatin|GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: microarray analysis|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Cetuximab activity as reflected in RR, 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare cetuximab activity, as reflected in response rate (RR), in PTEN-deficient and PTEN-expressing cancers.

Secondary

* Examine RR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in PTEN-deficient and PTEN-expressing cancers, by treatment arm.

OUTLINE: Tissue microarray slides collected earlier from ECOG-E5397 are immunostained with PTEN antibody and analyzed with AQUA.
