Effectiveness of rTMS on Pain and Quality of Life in Patients With Cancer Neuropathic Pain. Clinical Trial.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on pain and quality of life in patients with cancer neuropathic pain.

Although there are currently different therapeutic options for neuropathic pain, most are limited or restricted to pharmacotherapy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a tool recently incorporated into neuroscience in the management of neuropathic cancer pain.

The study will include 10 patients with oncologic neuropathic pain who will receive 20 sessions of rTMS and the effect on pain and quality of life.
Neuropathic Pain
DEVICE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
Effect of Change of 20 rTMS Sessions on Pain, Assessment of pain quantify by Visual analogue scale rated from 0-10, where 0 is the least pain and 10 the worst pain, Day 1 vs Day 20 vs 1st month follow up and vs 3rd month follow up|Effect of Change of 20 rTMS Sessions on Pain and Functionality, Assessment of pain severity and functionality quantify by brief pain inventory from 0-10, where 0 is the least pain and 10 the worst pain, Day 1 vs Day 20 vs 1st month follow up and vs 3th month follow up
Effect of Change of 20 rTMS Sessions on Quality of Life, Assessment of Quality of life, measured by Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy (FACT-GOG- NTX 13) (0-100) higher number means a better quality of life, Day 1 vs Day 20 vs 1st month follow up and vs 3rd month follow up
Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a primary lesion or transient dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous system. In cancer, it is generated as a consequence of multiple factors such as: direct compression of nerve structures, post-surgical nerve injuries, and nerve injuries secondary to chemotherapy. At least 3.5 million people around the world suffer from this symptom associated with cancer; Of this population, 38% experience pain in all stages and 80% in advanced stages, negatively impacting quality of life.
