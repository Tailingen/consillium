Celecoxib, Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Celecoxib may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Combining chemotherapy with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib with leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with celecoxib, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin.

Secondary

* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the time of disease control to evaluate progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the salvage surgery rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the duration of chemotherapy-free intervals in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive FOLFOX7 chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease stop treatment. If disease progression occurs during the chemotherapy-free interval, patients receive an additional 6 courses.

Patients with responding disease after receiving at least 6 courses of chemotherapy may undergo surgery. Beginning within 10 weeks after surgery, patients receive simplified LV5FU2 chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1, and oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for at least 12 courses.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during courses 4 and 6, and then every 2 months thereafter.

Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
