A Study of ACR-368 in Ovarian Carcinoma, Endometrial Adenocarcinoma, and Urothelial Carcinoma
This is an open label Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ACR-368 as monotherapy or in combination with ultralow dose gemcitabine in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma based on Acrivon's OncoSignature® test status.
Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer|Endometrial Adenocarcinoma|Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: ACR-368|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: OncoSignature
Arm 1 Monotherapy: Anti-tumor activity of ACR-368 in Ovarian, Endometrial, and Urothelial Cohorts, Assess Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for the number of participants with a partial or complete response., Response will be assessed every 8 weeks from baseline through 2 years or death.|Arm 2 Phase 1b: Adverse Events (AEs) for ACR-368 in combination with ULDG, Safety will be assessed by the incidence of AEs characterized overall and by type, incidence, severity graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, seriousness, and relationship to study treatment., AEs will be assessed from baseline through 2 years or death.|Arm 2 Phase 1b: Determine the RP2D of ULDG, The RP2D will be evaluated by the incidence of DLT events per dose level., AEs will be assessed from first dose of ULDG for 28 days for each subject in a cohort.|Arm 2 Exploratory Phase 2: Anti-tumor activity of ACR-368 plus ULDG in Ovarian, Endometrial and Urothelial Cohorts, Assess Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for the number of participants with a partial or complete response., Response will be assessed every 8 weeks from baseline through 2 years or death.
Arm 1: Number of subjects with confirmed OncoSignature thresholds for enrichment of ACR-368 monotherapy responders, Response data including tumor shrinkage at first imaging and progression by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for the first 12 participants in each tumor type, Baseline to first post treatment imaging at 8 weeks|Arm 1: Adverse Events (AEs) for ACR-368 monotherapy, Safety will be assessed by the incidence of AEs characterized overall and by type, incidence, severity graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, seriousness, and relationship to study treatment., AEs will be assessed from baseline through 2 years or death.|Relative dose intensity of ACR-368, Assess the ratio of cumulative administered dose to the planned dose for first 2 cycles, First dose of ACR-368 in first cycle to dose on day 15 of second cycle of administration.|Arm 1: Limited pharmacokinetic (PK) testing in participants with Ovarian Carcinoma, Cmax will be assessed in the first cycle at baseline, end of infusion, hour 2 and hour 4., Dose of ACR-368 at day 1 and day 15 of first cycle|Arm 2: Limited pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of ACR-368 in combination with ULDG in all participants in Phase 1b, Cmax will be assessed in the first cycle at baseline, end of infusion, hour 2 and hour 4., Dose of ACR-368 at day 1 and day 15 of first cycle|Overall Survival (OS), The time from baseline until date of death., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), The time from initial response until investigator assessed progressive disease for all subjects who achieve a confirmed objective response., Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The time from baseline until second disease progression or death whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years
Participants will be selected for predicted efficacy of ACR-368 using the OncoSignature® Companion Diagnostic test. Participants will be allocated to one of 2 arms based on OncoSignature result:

Arm 1: OncoSignature Positive tumors

Arm 2: OncoSignature Negative

Participants in Arm 1 will receive ACR-368 as monotherapy. Participants in Arm 2 will receive the combination of ACR-368 and ultralow-dose gemcitabine. Participants in both arms will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the trial occurs.
