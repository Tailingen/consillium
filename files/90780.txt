Trial for Treatment of High Risk BC With Two Sequences of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Pembrolizumab
Phase II, randomized, Active-controlled open label trial for treatment of high risk, HR-/HER2- (triple negative) breast cancer, with two sequences of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on a background of pembrolizumab
Early Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab injection
Detect immunologic activation signal and the immunologically defined most suitable patient population for the synergistic interaction between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy backbone, Compare signals of immunological activation or a more favorable immunological context beetween T cell subpopulations and transcriptional changes of T cell populations infiltrating tumors at baseline and C2D1, At the end of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Rate of pCR, Compare the rate of pCR in subjects with locally advanced TNBC with TILs â‰¥ 10% in arm A and arm B at cycle 4, 6 months to one year after subject inclusion|Primary translational endpoint, Quantification of number of T cells per mm2 with different phenotypes using fate bifurcation as defined as the proportion of TILs with the phenotype T-bet(hi) PD1(mid) CD8+., 6 months to one year after subject inclusion
Changes in the immunogenic phenotype, Determine changes in the immunogenic phenotype by longitudinally evaluating RNA-based gene expression signatures (e.g., tumor inflammation signature expression of granzyme A \[GZMA\] and perforin 1 at baseline and at C2D1., 6 months to one year after subject inclusion|Incidence of treatment relatred Adverse events, Describe the safety and tolerability of the combinations of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (either EC/AC or paclitaxel + carboplatin) in the Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant setting throught the CTCAE version 5.0 adverse event evaluation, 6 months to one year after subject inclusion
This is a randomized, open-label, pilot study to evaluate the existence of a differential tumor immunomodulatory profile of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin vs pembrolizumab in combination with EC/AC in patients with triple negative, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) enriched, early breast cancer to allow the optimization of future de-escalation strategies. There will be crossover between treatment arms when moving from the neoadjuvant to adjuvant treatment period for completion of standard chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab.

The chemotherapy regimen included in this study is built upon previous studies of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. The synergistic effect of different chemotherapy backbone and pembrolizumab will be studied as part of a 2-arm study:

Arm 1: (KXCb - PA\[E\]C): Pembrolizumab (K) every 3 weeks (Q3W) + paclitaxel (X) + carboplatin (Cb) once weekly (QW) for 4 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting followed by pembrolizumab + doxorubicin or epirubicin (A or E) + cyclophosphamide (C) for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 6 weeks for 5 cycles (total of 1 year of pembrolizumab) in the adjuvant setting.

Arm 2: (KPA\[E\]C - KXCb): Pembrolizumab + doxorubicin or epirubicin (A or E) + cyclophosphamide (C) for 4 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting followed by pembrolizumab (K) every 3 weeks (Q3W) + paclitaxel (X) + carboplatin (Cb) once weekly (QW) for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 6 weeks for 5 cycles (total of 1 year of pembrolizumab) in the adjuvant setting.

In case of clinical evidence of non-pCR, i.e., biopsy proven residual disease after the neoadjuvant phase, patients can proceed to the crossover part of the adjuvant phase before surgery (i.e., 4 cycles of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab) receiving the remaining administrations of pembrolizumab after surgery.
