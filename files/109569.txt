A Retrospective Analysis: Whether Five Factors Affect PFS in Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
In previous studies, the investigators found that five factors were effective in predicting the probability of locally advanced cervical cancer with para-aortic lymph node metastasis.A retrospective study was conducted to explore the influence of 5 factors on PFS in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer|Radiotherapy
Progression Free Survival（PFS）, Whether there are differences in PFS between the two groups, 3 months
In previous studies, the investigators found that five factors were effective in predicting the probability of locally advanced cervical cancer with para-aortic lymph node metastasis.5 factors included positive iliac lymph nodes, histological type, tumor size, positive pelvic lymph nodes on both sides, and maximum lymph node diameter greater than 1cm. Different factors give different scores.If the score is higher than 3, the probability of retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer is significantly increased, and the prognosis of patients is affected. Patients with locally advanced cervix receiving radical radiotherapy were scored based on 5 factors.Patients with scores greater than or equal to 3 points were compared with patients with scores less than 3 points.
