Hypofractionated Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy With Temozolomide and Bevacizumab for Glioblastoma Multiforme
The purpose of this study is to find out whether Hypofractionated Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (Hypo-IMRT) combining with temozolomide chemotherapy can be safely given with a targeted agent, bevacizumab, and how effective this study treatment will be in controlling your brain tumor.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: RT (Radiation Therapy)
6-month Progression-free Survival, To use 6-month progression-free survival to assess the efficacy of the combination of hypofractionated IMRT delivering 60 Gy over 2 weeks with concurrent bevacizumab and temozolomide followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant bevacizumab and temozolomide., 6 months
Overall Survival, Measured From the Day of Initial Diagnosis (Biopsy or Surgery) to the Time of Death From Any Cause., follow up for life
This is a pilot phase II trial of the combination of concurrent hypofractionated IMRT (60 Gy/2 weeks), temozolomide and bevacizumab followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant bevacizumab and temozolomide in patients with grade IV malignant gliomas (glioblastoma and gliosarcoma). The study will have survival and toxicity endpoints.
