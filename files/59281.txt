A Safety and Tolerability Study of NC410 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This research study is studying a new drug, NC410, as a possible treatment for advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors|Ovarian Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Colo-rectal Cancer
DRUG: NC410
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, From enrollment through up to 90 days after end of treatment, an average of 1 year
Objective Response Rate Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, To assess antitumor activity/efficacy by evaluating objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Approximately 1 year|Duration of Response Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, To assess antitumor activity/efficacy by evaluating duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from the first documented complete response or partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors to the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI: CompleteResponse (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions

., Approximately 1 year|Disease Control Rate Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, To assess antitumor activity/efficacy by evaluating disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of participants in whom a documented complete response, partial response, or stable disease is observed as the best overall response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Approximately 1 year|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of NC410, To evaluate the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of NC410, Days 1, 2, 3 and 8 of Cycles 1 and 5. Each cycle is 14 days in duration.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first dose of NC410 to the first occurrence of documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), asa 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions

., Approximately 1 year|Overall Survival (OS) as Assessed by Time of Death, To evaluate overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the first dose of NC410 to death due to any cause., Approximately 1 year|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of NC410, To evaluate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of NC410., Days 1, 2, 3 and 8 of Cycles 1 and 5. Each cycle is 14 days in duration.|Half-life (t1/2) of NC410, To evaluate the half-life (t1/2) of NC410, Days 1, 2, 3 and 8 of Cycles 1 and 5. Each cycle is 14 days in duration.
