A Study of Adjuvant Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec for Treatment of Intermediate Risk NMIBC Following TURBT
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized trial designed to evaluate the RFS of TURBT followed by cretostimogene grenadenorepvec versus TURBT followed by surveillance for the treatment of participants with IR-NMIBC.

Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), Recurrence free survival (RFS) of cretostimogene after TURBT versus surveillance after TURBT, 51 months
Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) at 12 months and 24 months, Recurrence free survival (RFS) of cretostimogene after TURBT versus surveillance after TURBT at 12 months and 24 months, 51 months (RFS at 12 months) and 63 months (RFS at 24 months)|Incidence of Adverse Events, Safety of cretostimogene following TURBT, 52 months
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to cretostimogene grenadenorepvec after TURBT (Arm A) vs surveillance after TURBT (Arm B).

Participants in Arm A will receive an induction course and then quarterly maintenance courses of cretostimogene through Month 13, if there is no disease recurrence.

Disease status will be assessed using urine cytology, cystoscopy, and directed TURBT/biopsy (if indicated) every 3 months for the first 2 years after randomization and then every 6 months for an additional year or until disease recurrence. CT Urogram/MRU every 12 months.

Participants in Arm B who recur with IR-NMIBC after TURBT and surveillance will be offered treatment with cretostimogene as per the treatment schedule in Arm A.
