Nasal Outcomes Using Saline Irrigations After Endonasal Pituitary Surgery
This is a prospective, single-blinded, multicenter study evaluating the benefit of sinonasal irrigations following endoscopic pituitary surgery. The goal of this study is to create practice changing guidelines with objective data highlighting the importance of irrigations on postoperative outcomes for pituitary surgery.

Difference in mean sinonasal quality of life, Difference in mean sinonasal quality of life between groups as determined by patient reported Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores at 4 weeks. SNOT-22 scoring can be completed during a clinic visit or by phone interview. It is critical that the follow-up times are standardized because symptoms improve with time. A reduction in SNOT-22 composite score is indicative of improvement in symptoms., 12 weeks

This prospective study, coupled with the results of the recent POET study evaluating the role of antibiotics in postoperative outcomes for pituitary surgery, will guide physicians in the optimal management of patients following endoscopic pituitary surgery.

The investigator group has an established record of completing multicenter studies (e.g., POET, TRANSPHER) that have influenced clinical practice guidelines, raised the profile of Barrow in the pituitary and skull base community, and resulted in numerous peer-reviewed publications and awards.
