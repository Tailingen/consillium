Determine MTD, Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Genexol®-PM Plus Carboplatin With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Genexol®-PM plus Carboplatin and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genexol®-PM plus Carboplatin regimen in subjects with advanced ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Genexol-PM 220mg/㎡, Carboplatin 5AUC|DRUG: Genexol-PM 260mg/㎡, Carboplatin 5AUC|DRUG: Genexol-PM 300mg/㎡, Carboplatin 5AUC
Determine the MTD and recommended phase II dose of the combination therapy with Genexol-PM and Carboplatin in subjects with advanced ovarian cancer., until either MTD is achieved or maximum planned dose is tested
Objective Response Rate (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)), about 1 year (until end of trial)|Time to Tumor Progression, about 1 year (until end of trial)|Overall Survival, about 1 year (until end of trial)|Safety profiles, about 1 year (till end of trial)
This is a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of the combination therapy with Genexol®-PM and Carboplatin and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genexol®-PM when administered with Carboplatin in subjects with advanced ovarian cancer after debulking surgery.
