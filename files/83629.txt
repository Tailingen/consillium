Addressing Stigma in Screening and Diagnostic Delay for Cervical Cancer
This study aims to 1) implement a culturally and contextually rooted innovative multifoci, social marketing intervention involving societal focused media campaign elements to break down the barriers and facilitate timely and appropriate screening practices for cervical cancer; 2) measure cervical cancer stigma from a culturally relevant theoretical and conceptual framework; and 3) assess the influence of stigma on hindering seeking the PAP test. Further, this is an international study that will bring together a multi-disciplinary investigatory team, community advocates and State health agencies to deliver a social marketing intervention in Southern California (the Inland Empire region specifically) and Trinidad and Tobago.
Cervical Cancer Screening
Evaluation of the ability of the social media intervention "End Stigma End Fear, End Cervical Cancer" to counter stigma of cervical cancer among disadvantaged women who acknowledge needing a Pap test at pre-intervention baseline, To evaluate the ability of the social media intervention "End Stigma End Fear, End Cervical Cancer" to counter stigma of cervical cancer, by determining whether, among disadvantaged women who acknowledge needing a Pap test at pre-intervention baseline, degree of exposure to the intervention is associated with the following endpoints at 3 months after the intervention is implemented:

1. post-intervention change in stigma score relative to pre-intervention, and
2. Pap testing (scored as 0=made no attempt, 1=made some attempt but did not get tested, 2=obtained Pap test)., 3 months after the intervention is implemented
Assessment of whether change in stigma score is associated with Pap testing., 3 months after the intervention is implemented|Identification of factors associated with exposure to the intervention overall and to its individual components, 3 months after the intervention is implemented|Assessment of whether each component of the intervention is associated with the study endpoints, by testing the 4 components (billboards/posters, newspaper advertisements, health brochures, and radio announcements) rather than the overall exposure score, 3 months after the intervention is implemented
