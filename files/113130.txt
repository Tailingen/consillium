CLamp vs Off Clamp Kidney During Partial Nephrectomy
Prospective, randomized trial comparing surgical, functional and oncological outcomes between clamp and clamp-less robot assisted partial nephrectomy.
Nephrectomy|Kidney Neoplasm|Glomerular Filtration Rate
PROCEDURE: Clamp Robotic partial nephrectomy|PROCEDURE: Clampless Robotic partial nephrectomy
Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) variation, difference between pre and post operative Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), 3-6 months
Feasibility of clampless robotic partial nephrectomy, number of cases shifted from clampless to clamping procedure; time of suture of the renal parenchyma; overall operative time., Duration of the surgical procedure|Morbidity of clampless robotic partial nephrectomy, Estimated blood loss; pre/post operative variation of hemoglobin value; overall complications rate; bleeding complications rate, 90 days|Oncological safety of clampless robotic partial nephrectomy, positive surgical margins rate, 15 days
Prospective, randomized trial comparing surgical, functional and oncological outcomes between clamp and clamp-less robot assisted partial nephrectomy.
