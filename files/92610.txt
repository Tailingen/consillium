HIFU Treatment of Benign Thyroid Nodules
This clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules.
Thyroid Nodule (Benign)
DEVICE: Device: Echopulse (HIFU ablation)
Effectiveness evaluation using treatment effective rate, percentage of patients who achieve treatment success (volume reduction ratio \> 50%) at 12 months after HIFU treatment assessed by ultrasound examination, 12 Months
Symptoms score improvement, Using Visual Analogic Scale between (0-100 mm) to evaluate the improvement of appearance symptoms, compression symptoms and swallowing symptoms and pain.

With 0 being no pain and 100 being the worst pain imaginable, 12 Months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Incidence of local and/or general adverse reactions and other related symptoms at 1, 7 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up after treatment, 12 Months
This clinical trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomized, controlled study of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of benign thyroid nodules. this study will include 240 patients with benign thyroid nodules that meet all ths the inclusion / exclusion criteria and will be randomly divided into two groups at 1: 1 ratio. Patients in the test group will be treated with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), while patients in the control group will be actively observed and followed up by ultrasound examination. The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the test device in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules, and the secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of the test device in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules and the improvement of symptoms assessed by VAS score.
