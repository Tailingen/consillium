Access Study of Trametinib for Subjects With Advanced Unresectable (Stage IIIc) or Distant Metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K Mutation Positive Cutaneous Melanoma
This is a single arm open label, multicenter, non randomized, access study of trametinib for subjects with histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma with a BRAF V600E/K positive mutation that is either advanced unresectable (stage IIIc) or distant metastatic (stage IV). Trametinib may be given as monotherapy or in combination since first line metastatic melanoma as per inclusion criteria. Subjects who received prior BRAF inhibitor may be included if they have not progressed under such treatment or if they have presented limited progression as per eligibility criteria. It is estimated that between 250 and 400 subjects with histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma with a BRAF V600E/K positive mutation that is either advanced unresectable (stage IIIc) or distant metastatic (stage IV) will be enrolled.
