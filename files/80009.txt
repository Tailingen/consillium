Supervised Exercise to Promote Infiltration of NK-cells Into the Tumor
'Supervised exercise to PRomote Infiltration of NK-cells into the Tumor? The objective of this feasibility study is to 1) study trial feasibility in terms of patient enrollment and the percentage of tumor biopsies that can be examined successfully, and 2) generate preliminary data on the potential effects of exercise on immune function assessed in the tumor and in blood.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Supervised exercise
Participatient Rate, Percentage of patient actually enrolled in the study of all patients who will be screened, 6 weeks|Successful Examined Biopsies Rate, Percentage of tumor biopsies that can be examined successfully, 6 weeks
Generate preliminary data, on the potential effects of exercise on immune function (Tumor tissue will be investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess immune cell infiltration into the tumor with a specific focus on NK-cell frequency and phenotype) assessed in the tumor and in blood., 6 weeks
This is a multicenter randomized controlled feasibility trial, in which 20 women with breast cancer scheduled for neoadjuvant 2 or 3 weekly AC-T(H) chemotherapy will be randomized into a combined aerobic and resistance exercise intervention group or a usual care (no exercise) control group, during the first 6 weeks (2 or 3 cycles) of chemotherapy. Patients from the control group will receive care as usual and are requested to maintain their usual daily physical activities. In order to limit contamination (increase of exercise in the control group), non-participation and prevent dropout, the control group will be offered the same 6-week exercise intervention after the tumor biopsy has been taken after 6 weeks.
