Clinical Research on the Treatments on Advanced Malignant Melanoma by Combining in Situ Immunotherapy and Laser Therapy
To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the safety for the treatments on malignant melanoma by combining semiantigen dinitrophenyl (DNP) in situ immunotherapy and laser therapy, and carry out monitoring on related immunological parameters of the patients.

72 patients with stage III (b or c) or stage IV skin (which could not be excised by operations) malignant melanoma were treated by combining simple semiantigen DNP in situ immunotherapy and laser therapy respectively. The changes in peripheral blood CD4+CD25+Treg regulatory T cells (Treg), CD8+T, CD4+ T effector cells, IL-10, TGF-β and other inhibitory cytokines of the patients were detected, the changes in anti-DNP IgG antibody titer was monitored, the relationship between delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and survival was observed, and results of clinical follow-ups were also examined.
