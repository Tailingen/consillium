A Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Clinical Activity of GSK525762 in Subjects With NUT Midline Carcinoma (NMC) and Other Cancers
This study is divided into two parts; Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended dose for Part 2 based on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762 in the following subjects: NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, and MYCN driven solid tumor subjects. Part 2 of the study will explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the recommended dose from Part 1 in cohorts comprised of NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer subjects. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1 and approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. A sub-study will be opened in Part 1 to approximately 10-12 subjects in the United States to investigate the relative bioavailability of the besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free-base tablet at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dosing (RP2D), the effect of high-fat high-calorie meal on the bioavailability of the besylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the dose proportionality of 2 doses of GSK525762 administered as besylate tablet.

This study is divided into two parts; Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended dose for Part 2 based on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762 in the following subjects: NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, and MYCN driven solid tumor subjects. Part 2 of the study will explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the recommended dose from Part 1 in cohorts comprised of NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer subjects. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1 and approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. A sub-study will be opened in Part 1 to approximately 10-12 subjects in the United States to investigate the relative bioavailability of the besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free-base tablet at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dosing (RP2D), the effect of high-fat high-calorie meal on the bioavailability of the besylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the dose proportionality of 2 doses of GSK525762 administered as besylate tablet.
