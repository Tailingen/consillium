Study of Oral LOXO-338 in Patients With Advanced Blood Cancers
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug, LOXO-338, is safe and effective in patients with advanced blood cancer. Patients must have already received standard therapy. The study may last up to approximately 3 years.

DRUG: LOXO-338|DRUG: Pirtobrutinib
Part 1 - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral LOXO-338, Measured by the number of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Part 1 - To determine the effect of LOXO-338 on response rates, Measured by the appropriate disease specified response criteria as appropriate to tumor type, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 2 - To determine the safety and tolerability of LOXO-338 when given in combination with pirtobrutinib, Measured by the number of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Cycle 2 (28 Days)
Part 1 - To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of LOXO-338: Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), PK: AUC of LOXO-338, Predose up to 24 hours postdose|Part 1 - To characterize the PK properties of LOXO-338: Maximum drug concentration (Cmax), PK: Cmax of LOXO-338, Predose up to 24 hours postdose|Part 1 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 based on overall response rate (ORR), ORR, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 1 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 based on progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 1 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 based on time-to-progression (TTP), TTP, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 1 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 based on duration of response (DOR), DOR, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 2 - To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of LOXO-338 in combination with pirtobrutinib: Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), PK: AUC of LOXO-338 alone and in combination with pirtobrutinib, Predose up to 24 hours postdose|Part 2 - To characterize the PK properties of LOXO-338 and in combination with pirtobrutinib: Maximum drug concentration (Cmax), PK: Cmax of LOXO-338 alone and in combination with pirtobrutinib, Predose up to 24 hours postdose|Part 2 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 alone and in combination with pirtobrutinib based on overall response rate (ORR), ORR, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 2 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 alone and in combination with pirtobrutinib based on progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 2 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 alone and in combination with pirtobrutinib based on time-to-progression (TTP), TTP, Estimated up to 2 years|Part 2 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity of LOXO-338 alone and in combination with pirtobrutinib based on duration of response (DOR), DOR, Estimated up to 2 years
This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will evaluate LOXO-338 as monotherapy. If safety and initial evidence of efficacy of LOXO-338 monotherapy are confirmed, part 2 will evaluate the combination of LOXO-338 with the highly selective, noncovalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305).
