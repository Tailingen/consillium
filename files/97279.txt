A Global Study of the PETAL Consortium
The goal of this observational study is to correlate molecular alterations with outcomes including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), response rates for patients with a new diagnosis, primary refractory or relapse, of mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms (TNKL). We hypothesize that machine learning can be leveraged to uncover distinct genetic vulnerabilities that underlie treatment response and resistance for patients with TNKL, thus moving towards personalized treatment solutions.

Estimation of overall survival, Feasibility of Synthetic Intervention of estimating difference in overall survival as measured by the ability to predict overall survival in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy versus prespecified non-chemotherapeutic choice., Up to 4 Years|FACT-Lym, Define overall health-related quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy \[FACT-Lym\] in in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms. 5-point Likert, measures 4 domains including physical, social, emotional, and functional. Ranges from 0-168, with higher scores indicating better quality of life., Up to 4 Years|FACIT-COST, Characterize the association between health-related quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy \[FACT-Lym\] and poverty as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity \[FACIT-COST\] and by the Health Leads Social Needs Screening Toolkit in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms. 5-point Likert with the range of 0-44, with higher scores indicate better financial well-being., Up to 4 Years|HADS, Describe the prevalence of psychological distress as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale \[HADS\] in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms and examine whether psychological distress is associated with disease characteristics. Ranges from 0-21, with higher scores indicating higher distress (anxiety, depression)., Up to 4 Years|IES-R, Describe the prevalence of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised \[IES-R\] in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms and examine whether psychological distress is associated with disease characteristics and measures subjective reaction after a traumatic event. Ranges from 0-88, with higher scores indicating likely presence of PTSD., Up to 4 Years|Household Material Hardship (HMH), Define the prevalence of household material hardship as measured by the Health Leads Social Needs and examine the association between household material hardship and health-related quality of life (FACT-Lym) in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-T cell neoplasms. Measures unmet concrete needs across 5 domains - housing, utility, food, transportation, interpersonal safety. Binary: no (0) or yes (1). Yes, means a positive screen with higher scores indicate greater material hardship., Upto 4 Years|Kessler Psychological Distress Scale - K10, Define the prevalence of psychological distress as measured by the Kessler-10 in subjects with mature T-cell and NK-T cell neoplasms and examine whether psychological distress is associated with disease characteristics. 5-point Likert with the range of 0-24, with higher scores suggesting serious PD (psychological distress) or higher likelihood of diagnosable mental illness., Upto 4 Years
This study is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms, conducted across multiple participating institutions globally. Patients will be enrolled during their initial visit as new patients and will be followed for up to four years through the course of their clinical management. Data for routine demographics, baseline clinical features, including pathology, molecular information related to the tumor, radiology, treatment characteristics and quality of life (QoL) associated with their lymphoma care will be collected over the course of 4 years by clinical research teams at every participating institution. The de-identified data will be securely shared through a password protected REDCap with other participating institutions under data usage agreements of the consortium. Next generation sequencing (NGS) including but not limited to whole exome sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing will be performed on archived lymphoma specimens, mononuclear cells, cfDNA and saliva (when feasible) for a comprehensive molecular characterization of the tumor. Molecular data will be analyzed in correlation with patient outcomes. Advanced deep learning algorithms will be applied to predict responses and survival across lymphoma subtypes, heterogeneous clinical scenarios and various potential therapeutic approaches that the patient has not been exposed to.
