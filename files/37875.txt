Osimertinib With Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in Brain Metastases From EGFR Positive NSCLC
Investigating potential of controlling brain metastases in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC.
NSCLC|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Osimertinib with (SRS), To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of Osimertinib, when administered in combination with SRS in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC with brain metastases., 4 weeks
Number of patients with progression free survival, To assess the six-month intra-cranial and extra-cranial progression-free survival (PFS-6) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC brain metastases treated with Osimertinib and SRS (PFS is defined as the time from clinical registration to intra-or extra-cranial tumor progression or death), 6 months|Length of overall survival, To assess the overall survival (OS) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC Brain Metastases treated with Osimertinib and SRS, 2 years|Difference in outcome vs. standard of care, To compare results of our clinical trial to patients with EGFR positive NSCLC with brain metastases treated with SRS alone (1-10 brain Metastases), 2 years|Intra-cranial and Extra-cranial Overall Response Rate (ORR), To assess Overall response rate (ORR) both intracranial and extracranial, defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the whole body as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by the investigator., 6 months
In patients with EGFR positive NSCLC with 1-10 brain metastases, we are investigating whether we can control the macro brain metastases with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and control the micro metastases with targeted agent Osimertinib and avoid whole brain radiation that could potentially lead to significant cognitive decline.
