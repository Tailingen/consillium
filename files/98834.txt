A Study of HA121-28 Tablets in Patients With Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC)
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the preliminary antineoplastic activity, safety and tolerability of HA121-28 tablets administered orally in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: HA121-28 tablets
Objective remission rate (ORR), assessed approximately every 8 weeks or 12 weeks based on the treatment cycle, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), assessed approximately every 8 weeks or 12 weeks based on the treatment cycle, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months|Duration of response (DOR), assessed approximately every 8 weeks or 12 weeks based on the treatment cycle, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival (OS), assessed approximately every 12 weeks, From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Disease control rate (DCR), assessed approximately every 8 weeks or 12 weeks based on the treatment cycle, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Changes in blood calcitonin, assessed approximately every 8 weeks, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, or date of death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Adverse events incidence, assessed approximately every 4 weeks, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Plasma drug concentration, assessed approximately every 4 weeks, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, wihichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
A total of approximately 30 patients with MTC will be enrolled. The patients will undergo a 3 weeks-on and 1week-off treatment scheme with HA121-28 tablets 450 mg orally once daily in the 28-day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxic reaction, whichever occurs first. During the administration of HA121-28 tablets, vital signs, physical examination, ECOG performance status, hematology and chemistry test, ECG, adverse events and concomitant drugs will be evaluated every four weeks, an additional ECG will be observed two weeks after the first dose, calcitonin and pregnancy test will be performed every 8 weeks. CT for tumor assessment will be performed every 8 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter.
