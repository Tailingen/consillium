Sitting Versus Horizontal Position on Craniotomies
The main objectives of this study are comparison of the incidence of intraoperative air embolism and the extent of blood loss in patients undergoing posterior cranial fossa (PCF) and pineal region (PR) surgeries in sitting and horizontal position. Additionally, the overall treatment outcome, neurological functional outcome, degree of tumor removal, clinical course in the postoperative period, and the patient satisfaction will be compared between the groups.
Craniotomy|Brain Tumor
PROCEDURE: Surgical position
Incidence of intraoperative air embolism, Measured intraoperatively with transesophageal echocardiogram and/or PETCO2 levels, Time of surgery (From surgical wound incision time until wound closure)
Degree of tumor removal, Indicated by surgeon description and/or postoperative imaging, End of surgery (closure) - Postoperative evaluation by surgeon and/or postoperative imaging performed up to 48 hours after end of surgery|Neurological function, Compared sensory-motor function, cranial nerve function and Glasgow scale before and after surgery., End of surgery (closure) - Discharge from the hospital or up to 3 months after end of surgery, whichever came first.|Patient satisfaction, Collected on phone script during follow-up phone call, End of surgery (closure) - 3 months after surgery
This was a prospective observational study to assess the effects of patient positioning during craniotomies on surgical outcomes. Patients were distributed into 2 major groups based on the surgical position: sitting and horizontal. Each group was further divided into subgroups based on the type and location of the lesion. To achieve the study goals, comparison of the 2 approaches in equivalent patient groups was performed, including comparable demographics, diagnoses, topographic location of the lesions, anesthetic approaches, and surgical experience.

The operating surgeons decided patient positioning based on clinical judgment. Type of anesthesia was defined by the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient however, it was maximally standardized for both sites. All the surgeries were performed by neurosurgeons with sufficient experience of sitting craniotomies.
