A Phase 2 Study of Sonodynamic Therapy Using SONALA-001 and Exablate 4000 Type 2.0 in Patients with DIPG
The primary objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) using SONALA-001 and Exablate Type 2.0 device and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) energy in combination with SONALA-001 in subjects with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: SONALA-001 (ALA) and MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound device (MRgFUS)
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SDT in DIPG subjects to generate data that will aid in the design of a larger Phase 2b trial., Safety and tolerability as assessed by the frequency and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), AEs, laboratory and ECG tests, vital signs, weight, physical and neurological exams., Day 1 (SDT Study Treatment Day) to 12 months post-treatment|To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) energy in combination with SONALA-001 (SDT) in subjects with DIPG., MTD and RP2D (determined in consultation with the Safety Review Committee \[SRC\]): The Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) (SONALA-001 and MRgFUS) method will be employed to derive an MTD for the combination drug and device and estimate RP2D. "R Package for Designing Single-Agent and Drug-Combination Dose-Finding Trials Using Bayesian Optimal Interval Designs" will be implemented., Up to 3 weeks post-treatment
Preliminary efficacy, including objective response rate (ORR); Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO); Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (mRANO)., Objective Response Rate (\[ORR\], RAPNO or mRANO Criteria): An estimate of RAPNO-ORR or mRANO-ORR, dependent on the age of the subject, will be derived as the percentage of subjects achieving a complete or partial response (CR, PR) relative to the total sample size in the full analysis set., Day 1 to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first progressive disease or all-cause mortality., Day 1 to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR), The time-to-event under consideration in the analysis of DOR will be time from onset of (RAPNO) response to the time of first progression of disease., Day 1 to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to all-cause mortality., Day 1 to 24 months|To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALA and Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) following intravenous (IV) dosing with SONALA-001., PK for ALA and PpIX through 24 hours post SONALA-001 infusion: PK parameters for IV administered SONALA-001 and for the change in plasma concentration of the active metabolite PpIX will be estimated. Individual plasma concentrations will be listed by subject, summarized descriptively and graphically as warranted by drug dose and energy level. The following PK parameters will be calculated: AUC for plasma concentration vs. time from time 0 to the last measurable time point (AUC0-t), AUC for plasma concentration vs. time from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞), time to maximum drug concentration (Tmax), terminal elimination half-life (t½), clearance, and elimination rate constant., Day 1 to 24 hours post SONALA-001 dosing|To evaluate the mechanical performance of Exablate 4000 Type 2.0 device., Mechanical performance of Exablate 4000 Type 2.0 device: Percentage of SDT treatments in which the Exablate 4000 Type-2 device works as planned and percentage of treatments in which procedure deviations were noted., Day 1 to directly after each SDT treatment
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SDT in the DMG subjects, Safety and tolerability as assessed by the frequency and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), AEs, laboratory and ECG tests, vital signs, weight, physical and neurological exams, Day 1 (SDT Study Treatment Day) to 12 months post-treatment|To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) in the DMG subjects., An estimate of RAPNO-ORR or mRANO-ORR, dependent on the age of the subject, will be derived as the percentage of subjects achieving a complete or partial response (CR, PR) relative to the total sample size in the full analysis set., Day 1 to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) in the DMG subjects., PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first progressive disease or all-cause mortality, Day 1 to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR) in the DMG subjects., The time-to-event under consideration in the analysis of DOR will be time from onset of (RAPNO) response to the time of first progression of disease., Day 1 to 12 months|Overall survival (OS) in the DMG subjects., OS is defined as the time from enrollment to all-cause mortality., Day 1 to 24 months
