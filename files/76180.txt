A Vaccine Trial for Low Grade Gliomas
The study will assess the immunogenicity, safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of the glioma associated antigen (GAA)/tetanus toxoid (TT) peptide vaccine and poly-ICLC in HLA-A2+ children with unresectable low-grade gliomas that have received at least two chemotherapy/biologic regimens. Radiation therapy counts as one biologic regimen, but patients may not have received radiation to the index lesion within 1 year of enrollment.
Low Grade Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: Experimental: HLA-A2 Restricted Glioma Antigen-Peptides with Poly-ICLC
Tumor shrinkage or stable disease, Participants who demonstrate radiological evidence of tumor shrinkage or stable disease without regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) after the initial 8 vaccines will be eligible to receive additional vaccinations beginning week 24 and every 6 weeks thereafter for up to two years., Week 24
Patients will be treated with subcutaneous injections of GAA/TT-vaccines starting on Week 0 and every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 8 cycles or until Off-treatment criteria are met (Section 4.6). I.m. poly-ICLC will be administered (30ug/kg i.m.) immediately following the vaccine. Poly-ICLC should be administered i.m. within 3 cm of the peptide-injection site.

To allow for flexibility with scheduling, the peptide vaccine and Poly-ICLC dose may be given within one week of the date that the vaccine and poly-ICLC administration are due.

Patients will be evaluated for any possible adverse event, regimen limiting toxicity (RLT) as well as clinical/radiological responses by clinical visits and MRI scanning. Follow-up MRIs will be performed (Weeks 6, 15 and 24).
