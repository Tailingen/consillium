A Trial of PledOx + FOLFOX6 Compared to Placebo + FOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The present trial is designed to determine whether pre-treatment with PledOx lowers the frequency and severity of side effects from FOLFOX6 administration in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

The efficacy of PledOx will be assessed when added to FOLFOX6 chemotherapy as first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

This study was performed in multiple parts/phases. Part 1 was an open dose-escalation study with the doses 2, 5 and 10 micromol/kg of calmangafodipir. No study outcomes were planned for this part. In part 2a, participants randomly received either Placebo, 2 or 10 micromol/kg of calmangafodipir. In part 2b, participants randomly received either Placebo, 2 or 5 micromol/kg of calmangafodipir. The overall intent of the study was to compare the effect of antioxidant agent PledOx against placebo in one of three different doses/combinations (2 micromol/kg, 5/10 micromol/kg, 2/5/10 micromol/kg vs. placebo, in the first 8 cycles of FOLFOX6 treatment
Advanced Metastatic (Stage IV) Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: PledOx (2 µmol/kg)|DRUG: PledOx (5 µmol/kg)|DRUG: PledOx (10 µmol/kg)|DRUG: Placebo (0,9% NaCl)
Number of Patients With Neuropathy Grade 2 or Higher (According to the Oxaliplatin Specific Sanofi Scale (OSSS) Criteria Related Paraesthesia/Dysaesthesia), Percentage of patients, over cycle 1 to 8, with neuropathy grade 2 or higher (according to the Oxaliplatin Specific Sanofi Scale (OSSS) criteria related paraesthesiae/dysaesthesiae), Every second week during cycle 1-8, for up to 16 weeks
Globally, nearly 800 000 colorectal cancers are believed to occur annually. Approximately about half of the patients with colorectal cancer develop metastatic disease. These patients are often offered chemotherapy with the FOLFOX6 regimen (FOL = FOLic acid; F = Fluorouracil (5-FU); OX = OXaliplatin) The use of FOLFOX6 is, however, hampered by a high incidence and severity of adverse reactions.

In the current trial patients will receive the antioxidant agent PledOx in one of two different doses, or placebo, in the first 8 cycles of FOLFOX6 treatment.
