A Study of 7MW3711 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
7MW3711 is a antibody-drug conjugate(ADC) drected to a target wildly expressed on solid tumors. This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 study to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of 7MW3711 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

Two parts are included in this study. The part of dose escalation and dose expansion(part 1) will enrolled subjects with advanced solid tumors and is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommend pahse 2 dose(RP2D) of 7MW3711 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

The part of cohort expansion(part 2) will enrolled subejcts with selected advanced solid tumors and is to assess the preliminary efficacy of 7MW3711 in selected advanced solid tumors.
