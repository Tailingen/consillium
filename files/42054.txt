Injection of ex Vivo Amplified G-CSF Mobilised Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation
Hematopoietic reconstitution defined by a neutrophils number \> 500/mm3 at day 7 after injection of ex vivo amplified graft and by a platelets number \> 20000/mm3, at day 15 after the injection of ex vivo amplified graft, without transfusion.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, ex vivo amplified
Hematopoietic reconstitution defined by a neutrophils number > 500/mm3 at day 7 after injection of in vitro amplified graft and by a platelets number > 20000/mm3, at day 15 after the injection of in vitro amplified graft, without transfusion., at day 7 (neutrophils) and day 15 (platelets) after injection of in vitro amplified graft
Immediate Toxicity of the injection of the amplified graft ;, just after the injection of the amplified graft|Quantitative immunological Reconstitution, at day 30, 100, 180, 270, 360 after the injection and then every 6 months|Stability of the hematopoiesis in the long term, at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the graft|Absence of cytogenetics abnormalities not related to the multiple myeloma in the long term., at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the injection
To check that injection of autologous peripheral blood stem cell CD34(+) "amplified ex vivo in the presence of SCF, G-CSF and TPO in HP01 Maco pharma medium culture. ": Allows to obtain a hematopoietic reconstitution:

1. Rapid : 7 days or less after the injection, regarding neutrophils and 15 days or less regarding platelets
2. Complete: numbers neutrophils and platelets respectively higher than 500/mm3 and 20000/mm3 within the times mentioned
3. Stable: no secondary neutropenia or thrombocytopenia during the year following the injection, in the absence of recurence of the myeloma.
