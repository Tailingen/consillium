A Prospective Imaging Study of the Integrated TrueBeam-HyperSight CBCT System
Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are routinely used in radiation treatment delivery workflows to align patients with the treatment beam. Conventional CBCT image quality is sufficient for this task but not good enough for other radiotherapy-related tasks, such as contouring anatomical structures and calculating radiation dose distributions. HyperSight is a new CBCT imaging system manufactured by Varian Medical Systems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the integration of the HyperSight imaging system with Varian's TrueBeam radiotherapy system, a linear accelerator with a C-arm gantry that rotates about the patient to delivery radiation to the target malignancy. HyperSight CBCT images will be acquired prospectively from patients who are receiving radiation treatment. The HyperSight/TrueBeam system will be used for imaging only; patients receive their radiation treatment on cleared devices and no aspect of their treatment is affected by participation in the study. HyperSight images collected during the study will be evaluated for quality and utility and compared to conventional CBCT images as well as fan beam CT images used for treatment planning.

DEVICE: HyperSight imaging
Feasibility of using HyperSight CBCT images for radiation treatment planning., The percentage of images that are of sufficient quality for patient treatment plan generation., 1-9 weeks
OAR delineation, Comparison of organ at risk (OAR) delineation on TrueBeam-HyperSight CBCT images to OAR delineation on conventional CBCT images, as well as on fan beam CT., 1-9 weeks|Image quality - quantitative, Assessed through calculated image metrics., 1-9 weeks|Image quality - qualitative, Assessed through expert observer evaluations of the images for utility in the radiotherapy workflow., 1-9 weeks|Patient anxiety, Assessed through a patient survey using the validated Six-Item State Anxiety Scale derived from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Each of the six items in the survey are assigned a score from 1 to 4 indicating the patient's agreement to a statement such as "I am tense", where 1 represents "Not at all", and 4 represents "Very much so"., 1-9 weeks|Treatment plan quality, Assessed through comparison of dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics extracted from the re-calculation of the patient's treatment plan on the HyperSight CBCT to DVH metrics from the patient's treatment plan originally calculated on the pre-treatment simulation fan-beam CT., 1-9 weeks|Patient clearance, Evaluated by the number of instances where patient positioning and/or custom immobilization devices created for their standard-of-care radiation therapy were incompatible with system geometries of the TrueBeam-HyperSight system during imaging and clearance checks., 1-9 weeks|Timing of image registration, The time required to register a HyperSight CBCT to the patient's reference CT simulation image., 1-9 weeks|Confidence in image registration, Assessed through a user-rated confidence (measured using a three-point scale: low/moderate/high)., 1-9 weeks|Impact of off-axis imaging on Hounsfield Unit accuracy, In images where the center of rotation is shifted, the impact of the off-axis imaging on the HU accuracy will be evaluated by comparing dose-volume histogram metrics between the treatment plan generated on the off-axis HyperSight CBCT and DVH metrics from the patient's treatment plan, calculated on a fan-beam CT that does not have the same limited field of view as the CBCT., 1-9 weeks|Impact of image acquisition time on clinical efficiency, Timing of workflow steps and processes including setup, imaging, alignment, and door-to-door time as compared to standard-of-care imaging processes, and compared to clinical models for hypothetical, generic clinics, using a time-driven, activity-based cost model., 1-9 weeks|Feasibility of obtaining respiratory gated HyperSight CBCT, Assessed through evaluation of internal motion volumes of organs-at-risk and targets, relative to diaphragm and/or vertebral body position, as compared to 4D-CT from standard-of-care simulation imaging., 1-9 weeks
