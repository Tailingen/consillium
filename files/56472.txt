Gemcitabine and Camrelizumab Plus Apatinib Versus Cisplatin in First-line Treatment of RM-NPC
This study aims to explore a new, more effective and tolerable treatment regimen for patients with advanced recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Specifically, we plan to conduct a phase III randomized controlled clinical trial based on the standard treatment of "GP + PD-1 mAb", replacing cisplatin with apatinib to achieve "platinum-free" therapy and reduce toxicity. In addition, we will investigate the efficacy of using apatinib in combination with PD-1 mAb compared to PD-1 mAb monotherapy to further improve treatment outcomes. The ultimate goal is to provide a new and reliable treatment modality for patients with advanced recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and guide clinical practice.
