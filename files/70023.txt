Bristol Bladder Trial
26 patients with invasive primary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder will receive 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of Cabazitaxel and Cisplatin both given intravenously on day 1 of each 3 weekly cycle prior to radical cystectomy, to evaluate the overall response rate and to determine whether this approach warrants further research of a phase II/III study.Participation in 2 sub studies will also be offered to the participants.

1. Contrast Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) scans will be taken at baseline and after cycle 1 and cycle 3.
2. A pilot sub study involving the circulating tumour cell concentration from blood samples taken at baseline, prior to each cycle of chemotherapy and prior to surgery
