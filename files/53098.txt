Phase I/II Study of Taxotere,CDDP and 5-FU(TPF) in Pre-treated Pts With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer.
A phase I/II study is conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) in Pre-treated patients with metastatic esophageal cancer. The usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by response rate, median survival time, and progression free survival.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Taxotere|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Briplatin
Determine the DLT(Dose Limiting Toxicity) and MTD(Maximum Tolerated Dose) in Phase I setting. Determine the clinical response rate with Recommended dose in Phase II setting., 1 year
Determine the clinical response rate of patients in Phase I setting., 1-year|Determine the MST(Median Survival Time) and PFS(Progression Free Survival) in Phase II setting., 2-years
Patients with pre-treated measurable metastatic esophageal cancer were included in this trial. Patients received this combination chemotherapy repeated every 28 days until progression disease. Starting dose (dose level 1) were docetaxel 30 mg/m2 on day 1, fixed dose intravenously cisplatin (15 mg/m2/day) and continuous infusion 5-FU (800 mg/m2/day) on day 1-4. DLT was defined as follows (according to NCI-CTC version 2.0); Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for more than 4days, Grade 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 neutropenia accompanied fever (\>38â„ƒ) , and Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea, appetite loss , general fatigue). Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined when the incidence of critical toxicity exceeds 50% at a certain dose level. Response rate will be calculated according to RECIST criteria.
