Efficacy of G-CSF-Priming in Elderly AML Patients
Aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of intensive induction therapy with Cytarabine, Idarubicin and Etoposide (IdAV) given in parallel with (G-CSF priming) and followed by G-CSF versus the same IdAV chemotherapy only followed by G-CSF (without priming) in elderly patients with de novo AML, secondary AML and advanced MDS. Moreover, the ability to mobilize sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for autologous PBSC transplantation after consolidation therapy with dose-reduced FLAG-Ida chemotherapy followed by G-CSF will be evaluated.
