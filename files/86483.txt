Pancreas Cancer Surveillance Using an Abbreviated MRI
This study aims to establish a prospective cohort of developing pancreas cancer and surveillance MRI protocol. With the focused surveillance protocol, we perform surveillance for pancreas cancer for five years to estimate the risk of pancreas cancer and the clinical feasibility of the surveillance MRI.
Pancreas Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Abbreviated PB MRI|GENETIC: Gene mutation test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Conventional follow-up
Detection of pancreas cancer, number of detected pancreas cancer (resectable \& BRPC only) in surveillance MRI., 1 year after the last surveillance MRI.
Scan time of abbreviated PB MRI for surveillance, table time, in-room time measurement for feasibility, 1 month after the first surveillance MRI.|Estimation of pancreas cancer risk, rate of developing pancreas cancer during the study period, 1 year after the last surveillance MRI.|Detection of pancreas cancer, number of detected pancreas cancer of all stages (resectable, BRPC, LAPC, metastatic) in surveillance MRI., 1 year after the last surveillance MRI.
Comparison of performance of abbreviated PB MRI, comparison of the rates of pancreas cancer detection between abbreviated MRI and conventional follow-up methods (in available cases), 1 year after the last surveillance MRI.|Identification of super-high risk group of developing pancreas cancer, Identification of any common radiologic features and gene mutation in participants in whom pancreas cancer develop during the study period., 1 year after the last surveillance MRI.
