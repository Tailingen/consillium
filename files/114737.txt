Evaluating the Performance of Morphology Index in Surgical Decision-Making for Ovarian Tumors
The present investigation will prospectively evaluate whether serial transvaginal ultrasonography with Morphology Index (MI) can further reduce false positive results by more accurately distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors. If there is no change in the detection of true positive cases, the result will be an increase in the positive predictive value of ovarian cancer screening.
Ovarian Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Abnormal Ovarian Ultrasound
Positive predictive value (PPV) of ovarian cancer screening, Whether the treatment algorithm for patients with abnormal ultrasounds improves the positive predictive value of ultrasounds as ovarian screening tests, thus lowering the false positive rate compared to historical controls., Up to 12 months
Surgical complications, Surgical complications including type, severity, and resolution., Up to 12 months|Compliance to the treatment algorithm, Percentage of required visits that were attended for each individual's treatment algorithm, Up to 12 months
Primary Objective:

To determine if a treatment algorithm using serial transvaginal ultrasound with a tumor morphology index can improve the positive predictive value (PPV) of ovarian cancer screening compared to a historical control from 15% to 25%.

Secondary Objective To measure the compliance for study participants enrolled on the treatment algorithm using serial transvaginal ultrasound with a tumor morphology index.

Exploratory Objective To determine the effectiveness of a treatment algorithm that combines serum biomarkers aloneor in combination with transvaginal ultrasound to reduce the false positive rate of ovarian cancer screening in the subset of women agreeing to biomarker collection.
