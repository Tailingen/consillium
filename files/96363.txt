Healing Touch in Treating Fatigue in Women Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Healing touch therapy may be effective in lessening fatigue in women with breast cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well healing touch works in treating fatigue in women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Depression|Fatigue
PROCEDURE: Bio-field energy therapy|PROCEDURE: fatigue assessment and management|PROCEDURE: psychosocial assessment and care|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|PROCEDURE: therapeutic touch
Fatigue Using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), 9-items with an 11-point rating scale measures intensity of fatigue (3 items, 0 = no fatigue to 10 = fatigue as bad as you can imagine) and interference of fatigue on daily life (6 items, 0 = does not interfere to 10 = completely interferes. Each participant's score is summed with a possible minimum score of 0 and a possible maximum score of 90. A mean score was then determined., 6 weeks
Quality of Life as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Form (FACT-B), 36 items that measure general quality of life (27 items) and specific breast cancer concerns (9 items) on a 5-point rating scale with 0 = not at all to 4 = very much. Minimum (worst quality of life) possible score = 0 and maximum (best quality of life) possible score = 144. Physical and emotional well-being scores were reverse coded and sub scale scores were summed. Median scores for baseline and at 6 weeks were determined, baseline and 6 weeks|Intensity of Anxiety and Depression, Measured on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 14 items on a 4-point scale scored from 0 = not at all (best feeling) to 3 = very often (worst feeling). Scores are summed and range from a minimum of 0 (no anxiety or depression) to 42 (worst anxiety or depression)and a median for each arm is determined at the specified timepoints., baseline and off-radiation at 5 to 7 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the ability to recruit and retain patients with breast cancer receiving curative radiotherapy in a Complementary and Alternative Medicine trial.
* To determine the acceptability of weekly healing touch therapy to patients with breast cancer who receive curative radiotherapy.
* To examine the effect of healing touch on fatigue and quality of life for patients with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy as a component of therapy.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by type of treatment (radiotherapy alone vs chemotherapy completed prior to radiotherapy)

* Arm I:Patients receive healing-touch therapy administered once a week for 45 minutes by a healing-touch therapist for the duration of radiotherapy.
* Arm II: Patients receive sham-therapy administered once a week for 45 minutes by a sham-practitioner (NOT a healing-touch therapist) for the duration of radiotherapy.

Patients complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and a demographic variables form (age, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment) at baseline. Patient fatigue is measured on a weekly basis throughout radiotherapy with completion of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast form (FACT-B) is completed at baseline and the end of radiotherapy. Patients undergo a 20-minute interview at the end of study to determine the acceptability of the intervention.
