A Study to Test Long-term Treatment With Brigimadlin in People With Solid Tumours Who Took Part in a Previous Study With This Medicine
This study is open to adults who participated in a previous clinical study with brigimadlin.

The goal of this study is to find out how well people with solid tumours tolerate long-term treatment with brigimadlin. Brigimadlin is a so-called MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer.

Participants are grouped in cohorts depending on their treatment in the previous study:

* Cohort 1a got brigimadlin and continues treatment with brigimadlin
* Cohort 1b got brigimadlin for 4 or less treatment cycles; each cycle was 3 weeks long
* Cohort 2 received a comparator and gets brigimadlin for the first time

All participants take brigimadlin as tablets once every 3 weeks at the study site. Participants in the Cohorts 1b and 2 visit the sites more frequently. At study visits, doctors check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. At some study visits, doctors also check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

Participants are in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it.
