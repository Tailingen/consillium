A Study of High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer Participants Treated With Radical Prostatectomy and Perioperative Hormonal Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the yearly conditional prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS) probabilities in high-risk localized prostate cancer (HR LPC) participants following radical prostatectomy (RP) and perioperative hormonal therapies (that is, hormonal treatment before RP and / or after RP) over 5 years.
High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer
Yearly Conditional Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression-free Survival (PFS) Probability, PSA PFS probability is defined as probability of being PSA progression free given that participant has yet to experience PSA progression or death from any cause. PSA progression is defined as per the prostate cancer working group 2 (PCWG2) consensus., Up to 5 years
Localized Prostate Cancer (LPC) Stage at Diagnosis, LPC stage at diagnosis will be based on the latest tumor nodes and metastases (TNM) staging system approved by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)., Up to 2.5 years|Time from Diagnosis of LPC to Radical Prostatectomy (RP), Time from diagnosis of LPC to RP will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants who Received Treatments Provided with RP and Following RP, Number of participants who received treatments provided with RP and following RP (including RP and neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy only, RP and adjuvant hormonal therapy only, or RP and both neoadjuvant and adjuvant hormonal therapies) will be reported., Up to 7.5 years|Hormonal Therapy Duration, Hormonal therapy duration is defined as the length of time between the start date of receiving hormonal therapy treatment and the date of receiving last dose., Up to 7.5 years|Yearly Conditional Local or Distant Radiographic PFS Probability, Conditional radiographic PFS probability is defined as the probability of being radiographic progression-free given that participant has yet to experience local or distant radiographic progression., Up to 5 years
