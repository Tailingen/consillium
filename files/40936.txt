Fruquintinib and Raltitrexed Versus Fruquintinib Monotherapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
A randomized, controlled phase II clinical trial of Fruquintinib combined with Raltitrexed versus Fruquintinib monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had failed second-line or above standard chemotherapy
Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Fruquintinib and raltitrexed|DRUG: Fruquintinib
progression free survival (PFS), the time from randomization to tumor progression or death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
overall survival (OS), the time from randomization to death from any cause,whichever came first,, assessed up to 36 months|objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumors shrink to a certain extent and remain constant for a certain period of time, through study completion, an average of 2 year|disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of cases with response to treatment (PR+CR) and disease stability (SD) that can be evaluated, through study completion, an average of 2 year

This study plans to evaluate the clinical benefits of fruquintinib combined with raltitrexed compared with fruquintinib single drug treatment in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have failed second-line or above treatment, in order to explore the rationality of this strategy with chemotherapy + targeted combination therapy and obtain the relevant survival and safety data. A total of 136 patients were planned to be enrolled in this study.
