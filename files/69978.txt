Study to Assess the Effects of GS-3583 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is planned to be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1: Dose Escalation and Part 2: Safety Run-In and Randomized Expansion.

The primary objectives of Part 1 are 1) To characterize the safety and tolerability of GS-3583 as monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors. 2) To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GS-3583 as monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.

The primary objectives of Part 2 is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the RP2D of GS-3583 in combination with zimberelimab (ZIM) and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy in participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Cohort A) or in combination with docetaxel in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Cohort B).
