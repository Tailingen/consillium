Trial of Nelarabine, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in Relapsed T-cell ALL and T-cell LL
Nelarabine has shown significant activity in patients with T-cell malignancies. This study will determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the combination of nelarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with first bone marrow relapse of T-ALL, or first relapse of T-LL.

DRUG: Nelarabine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Filgrastim
To Determine the Presence of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of Nelarabine, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide When Given in Combination to Children With T-ALL and Bone Marrow Relapse or T-LL., Patients will be evaluated based on Dose Level and total courses taken at each dose level and for presence of dose limiting toxicities. Not all patients enrolled at each dose level has been assessed to be evaluable for DLTs. Only those that have met criteria for being evaluable for DLT will be counted in the Overall Number of Participants Analyzed., 6 months
To Determine the Complete Remission Rate After 1 and 2 Courses of This Therapy in Children With T-ALL and Bone Marrow Relapse or T-LL., Patients will be evaluated at each dose level and for assessment of response to treatment. Not all patients enrolled at each dose level has been assessed to be evaluable for response. Only those that have met criteria for being evaluable for response will be counted in the Overall Number of Participants Analyzed., 1-3 months
