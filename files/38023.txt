This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-dose dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor efficacy characteristics of XKDCT 293 (Nectin-4-CAR-T) cell preparation in subjects with Nectin-4-positive advanced breast cancer.

The study will enroll subjects with pathologically confirmed advanced breast cancer, positive Nectin-4 expression, who have previously received standard treatment, failed treatment or cannot tolerate it. Imaging examinations show evaluable tumor lesions.

The study included screening period, PBMC collection, baseline, lymphocyte pre-depletion chemotherapy , rest evaluation, cell transfusion, hospitalization observation period, routine follow-up period, and long-term follow-up period.

The study set up three dose groups, and adopted the classic 3+3 experimental design for dose escalation.

Main purpose:

(1)the safety and tolerability of XKDCT 293 in the treatment of nectin-4-positive advanced breast cancer

Secondary Purpose:

1. the cellular metabolic kinetics and pharmacodynamics of XKDCT 293 in the treatment of nectin-4 -positive advanced breast cancer ;
2. To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of XKDCT 293 cell preparations in patients with advanced Nectin-4-positive breast cancer.
