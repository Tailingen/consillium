Phase 1/2 Safety and Efficacy of PLX3397 in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of study drug PLX3397 at 3 dose levels (800 mg/day, 1000 mg/day, and 1200 mg/day) and explore the efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Additional dose levels beyond 1200 mg/day may be considered based on safety and efficacy observations.

Summary of Best Modified Criteria Response Results, Bridged-to-Transplant (BTT) Participants, and Composite Remission Rates in Patients on Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Expansion, Part 2)., Complete remission (CR): Has bone marrow regenerating normal cells, achieve a morphologic leukemia-free state, Complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp): CR except for incomplete platelet recovery, Complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi): CR except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual neutropenia, Partial response (PR): bone marrow generates normal hematopoietic cells, evidence of peripheral recovery with no or a few regenerating circulating blasts. Decrease of ≥50% of blasts in bone marrow aspirate, total marrow blasts between 5% -25%, Non-response (NR) were assessed using modified International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for AML. Successfully (BTT) patients and successfully BTT patients (CR, CRp, or CRi) are also reported. Successfully BTT is defined as any patient who discontinued PLX3397 treatment specifically for the purpose of undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and who subsequently received the planned transplant., 1 year post dose|Summary of Time-to-Event Endpoints in Patients on Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Expansion, Part 2), Median survival estimates were based on the Kaplan-Meier method. In the event disease progression/relapse or death was not documented prior to study termination, endpoints were censored at the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Duration of remission, duration of complete remission, and disease-free survival, initial response was based on the modified response criteria. Duration of complete remission was defined as the number of days from the date of initial CR, CRp, or CRi response to the date of first documented disease relapse or death, whichever occurred first. Disease-free survival was defined as the number of days from the date of initial CR, CRp, or CRi to the date of documented disease relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 1 year post dose
Number of Participants With On-treatment Best Modified Criteria Response Results of Partial Remission (PR) During Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Expansion, Part 2), Modified International Working Group Response Criteria for Acute Myeloid Leukemia defines Partial Remission (PR) as the following: Partial Remission (PR): Patients must have bone marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells with evidence of peripheral recovery with no (or only a few regenerating) circulating blasts and with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspirate with the total marrow blasts between 5% and 25%. In addition, patients do not need to be Red Blood Cell (RBC) or platelet transfusion independent., 1 year post dose|Number of Participants With On-treatment Best Classic Criteria Response Results During Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Expansion, Part 2), Complete Remission (CR):

Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 109/L (1000/μL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100000/μL); red cell transfusion independent

CR with incomplete recovery (CRi):

All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 x 109/L) or thrombocytopenia

Partial Remission (PR):

All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5-25%; decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 1 year post dose|Number of Participants Reporting an Incidence of Adverse Events During Treatment With PLX3397 (Part 1, Dose Escalation and Part 2, Dose Expansion), 1 year post dose|Number of Participants Reporting an Incidence of Treatment-Related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events During Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Escalation, Part 1 and Dose Expansion, Part 2), Data reported are Treatment-Related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events that are ≥15% Occurrence in all patients., 1 year post dose|Number of Participants Reporting a Treatment Emergent Adverse Events With a CTCAE Grade ≥3 During Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Escalation, Part 1 and Dose Expansion, Part 2), Data reported are Treatment Emergent Adverse Events with a CTCAE Grade ≥3 During Treatment that are ≥10% Occurrence in all patients., 1 year post dose|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormal Chemistry and Hematology Values Reported as Adverse Events (AE) During Treatment With PLX3397 (Dose Escalation, Part 1 and Dose Expansion, Part 2), 1 year post dose
A Summary of Time From Initial Dosing to First and Best Response, Modified Response Criteria in Patient Treated With PLX3397 (Dose Expansion, Part 2), 1 year post dose
Protocol PLX108-05 is a Phase 1/2 open-label, sequential dose escalation (Part 1) followed by cohort expansion (Part 2) design at the recommended phase 2 dose established in Part 1 (i.e. 3,000 mg/day). Treatment with PLX3397 will consist of continuous oral administration in 28-day cycles until unacceptable or dose-limiting toxicity, disease progression or relapse, patient death, Investigator decision, or voluntary withdrawal.
