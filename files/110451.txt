A Study of MRG002 Versus Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Patients With HER2-positive Unresectable Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between MRG002 and investigator selected chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
Advanced or Metastatic Urothelium Cancer
DRUG: MRG002|DRUG: Docetaxel Injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel Injection|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride for Injection|DRUG: Pemetrexed Disodium Injection
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from first documented objective response (CR/PR) to the first onset of tumor progression or death of any nonsurgical cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR, and stable disease (SD)., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR, and SD for â‰¥ 6 months., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the duration from randomization to the first documented objective response (CR/PR)., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|PFS by investigator, PFS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of MRG002: concentration-time curve, Plot of drug concentration changing with time after drug administration., Baseline to 7 days after discontinuation of treatment|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), The proportion of patients with positive ADA results and its titer., Baseline to 7 days after discontinuation of treatment|Neutralizing antibody (NAb), The proportion of patients with positive NAb results and its titer., Baseline to 7 days after discontinuation of treatment
This study aims to enroll 290 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment of MRG002 or investigator selected chemotherapy in a 1:1 ratio. The efficacy of MRG002 will be assessed by patient's OS, PFS and other indicators as compared to investigator selected chemotherapy. Additionally, this study will assess the pharmacokinetic profile, immunogenicity, safety, tolerability, and treatment compliance of MRG002.
