A Phase III Trial Evaluating Fruquintinib Efficacy and Safety in 3+ Line Colorectal Cancer Patients ï¼ˆFRESCO)
Fruquintinib administered at 5mg once daily(QD) in 4 weeks treatment cycle (three weeks on and one week off) was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging preliminary clinical antitumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in phase Ib and phase 2 study. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib in the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC who have progressed after second line or above standard chemotherapy
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: fruquintinib|DRUG: placebo
overall survival, every two months after end of treatment (EOT) observation period at 30 days after the last medication, from randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to 2 year
progression free survival, Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks, until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Safety and tolerance evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs, Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0., from first dose to within 30 days after the last dose
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after second-line or above standard chemotherapy. After checking eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized into Fruquintinib plus BSC group (treatment group) or placebo plus BSC group (control group) in a ration of 2:1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall Survival (OS). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.1), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), . Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
