A Study of HS-10365 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
HS-10365 is a small molecular, oral potent, selective RET inhibitor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of HS-10365 in Chinese advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients without any systemic therapy.
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: HS-10365 capsules
ORR assessed by IRC, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a CR or PR that was confirmed at a subsequent scan at least 4 weeks later, as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From the date of first occurrence of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on 2 consecutive occasions (≥4 weeks), until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, up to 48 months.
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Objective response was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate disease control rate. Disease control was deﬁned as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response (confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease for at least 5 weeks)., From the first occurrence of confirmed CR or PR or SD until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, up to 48 months.|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR), From the date of the first dose to disease progression or death in patients who achieve CR or PR, whichever came first, up to 48months.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression of tumor was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate progression free survival. Progression-free survival was deﬁned as the time from date of ﬁrst dose until the documentation of objective PD or death from any cause in the absence of progression (whichever occurred first), regardless of whether they subsequently received non-study anti-cancer therapy., From the date of the first dose until the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, up to 48 months.|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), The time from initial administration to death from any cause, up to 5 years.|Incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events, Assessed by number and severity of adverse events as recorded on the case report form, vital signs, laboratory variables, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and NCI CTCAE v5.0., From the first dose until 28 days after the last dose|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HS-10365, Cmax of HS-10365, At the firs of every Cycle from 1 to 12（each cycle is 28 days）
This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center Phase 2 study in participants with treatment-naïve locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer, which is designed to investigate the anti-tumor activity, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HS-10365 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). HS-10365 will be administered orally twice daily until the occurrence of disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, withdrawal of consent, death or the end of the study. Primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) by Independent Reading Committee (IRC). Secondary and exploratory objectives include evaluation of secondary efficacy endpoints, safety and PK in the study population.
