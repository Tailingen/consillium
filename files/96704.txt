Adjuvant Chemotherapy +/- Cemiplimab and Sequential Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Unfit or Elderly Patients With Stage III Lung Cancer
The use of neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy could improve survival outcomes of patients eligible for sequential radio-chemotherapy comparing to the benefit already obtained with maintenance immunotherapy.

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30 item instrument meant to assess some of the different aspects that define the quality of life of cancer patients.

Scale : Not at all / A little / Quite a bit / Very much, About 18 months|To evaluate the quality of life of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy before hypofractionated radiotherapy with questionnaire EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer LC29 (QLQ-LC29)., Time to symptom deterioration will be defined as the time from inclusion until the date of first clinically meaningful symptom deterioration (an increase in the score from baseline of ≥10) or death (by any cause) in the absence of a clinically meaningful symptom deterioration, regardless of whether the subject withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to symptom deterioration.

The EORTC QLQ-LC29 incorporates 5 multi-item scales to assess symptom or quality of life issues.
