64Cu-SAR-BBN for Identification of Participants With Recurrence of Prostate Cancer (SABRE)
The aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 64Cu-SAR-BBN and determine the ability of 64Cu-SAR-BBN Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to correctly detect the recurrence of prostate cancer in participants with PSMA-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following definitive therapy.
