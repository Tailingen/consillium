Safety and Efficacy Study of Epcoritamab in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Richter's Syndrome
The study is a global, multi-center safety and efficacy trial of epcoritamab, an antibody also known as EPKINLY™ and GEN3013 (DuoBody®-CD3xCD20). Epcoritamab will be tested either in

Relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as:

* Monotherapy, or
* Combination therapy:

  * epcoritamab + venetoclax
  * epcoritamab + pirtobrutinib

Treatment-naïve (TN) high risk (HR) (CLL):

• epcoritamab + pirtobrutinib

Combination therapy for Richter's Syndrome (RS):

* epcoritamab + lenalidomide
* epcoritamab + R-CHOP (i.e., rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine \[Oncovin®\] and prednisone).

The study includes participants with R/R or TN HR CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and participants with RS.

The trial consists of two parts, a dose-escalation phase (phase Ib) and an expansion phase (phase II). Participants with RS are only included in the expansion phase.

Epcoritamab will be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Standard-of-care and combination treatments (venetoclax, pirtobrutinib, lenalidomide, and R-CHOP) will be given either orally (by mouth) or intravenously (in a vein).

Study details include:

* Study duration will be up to 5 years after the last participant's first treatment in the trial.
* The treatment duration for each participant will be between 12 months (1 year) and 24 months (2 years), depending upon the treatment arm assigned.
* The visit frequency will be either weekly, every other week, or monthly, depending upon the part of the study.

All participants will receive active drug; no one will be given placebo.

The purpose of the dose-escalation phase of the trial is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; if reached) as well as establish the safety profile of epcoritamab monotherapy and epcoritamab + venetoclax in participants with R/R CLL.

The purpose of the expansion phase is to assess and evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles of epcoritamab monotherapy, epcoritamab + venetoclax and epcoritamab + pirtobrutinib at the RP2D for participants with R/R CLL, TN HR CLL and SLL. Along with this, epcoritamab monotherapy, epcoritamab + lenalidomide and epcoritamab + R-CHOP will be evaluated in participants with RS to assess their efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles.

The purpose of safety run-in phase for pirtobrutinib combination therapy is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles of pirtobrutinib in combination with epcoritamab.
