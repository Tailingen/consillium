Alpelisib in Pediatric and Adult Patients With Lymphatic Malformations Associated With a PIK3CA Mutation.
The main purpose of this study in participants with PIK3CA-mutated LyM is to assess the change in radiological response and symptom severity upon treatment with alpelisib film-coated tablets (FCT) as compared to placebo.
Lymphatic Malformations
DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Placebo
Stage 2:Radiological response rate at Week 24 of Stage 2 (adult and pediatric (6 - 17 years of age) participants), Radiological response defined by achieving at least 20% reduction in the sum of target lesion volumes (1 to 3 lesions), assessed by MRI by a BIRC at Week 24, provided that none of the individual target lesions has at least 20% increase from baseline and in absence of progression of non-target lesions and without new lesions. The percentage of participants with a radiological response at Week 24 of Stage 2 in adult and pediatric (6-17 years of age) groups will be assessed, Baseline, Week 24
Stage 2: Percentage of participants with at least a 1-point improvement compared to baseline based on patient global impression of severity (PGI-S) scale at Week 24 of Stage 2 (adult and pediatric (6 - 17 years of age) participants), PGI-S is a single item measure to assess the overall severity of a patient's condition. This single item instrument uses a 5-point rating scale, which ranges from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (very severe). Lower scores indicate better health status.

This is a phase II/III multi-center study with two stages:

* Stage 1 is designed to select the dose(s) for the confirmatory phase (DSCP) for alpelisib in Stage 2 and will comprise a 24-week open-label core phase in adult (â‰¥18 years of age) and pediatric participants (6-17 years of age) with PIK3CA-mutated LyM, followed by an extension. After eligibility has been confirmed at screening, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the different alpelisib doses according to their age. Depending on the results at the end of Stage 1 core phase, the Stage 2 will be opened to adult and/or pediatric participants or the study may be stopped.
* Stage 2 is designed to confirm the efficacy and assess safety of alpelisib at the DSCP in participants with PIK3CA-mutated LyM and will comprise a 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase in adult (â‰¥18 years of age) and pediatric participants 6-17 years of age followed by an open-label extension. After eligibility has been confirmed at screening participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to alpelisib or placebo.

Additionally, in parallel, Stage 2 will include a 24-week open-label core phase in pediatric participants 0-5 years of age followed by an extension, if pediatric participants will be enrolling in Stage 2.

Based on the results of the 24-week open-label core phase of Stage 1, the dose(s) for Stage 2 will be selected by Novartis in consultation with the Steering Committee (SC). During the 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled core phase of Stage 2, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will conduct periodic safety and efficacy reviews to assess the risk benefit profile of the treatment.
