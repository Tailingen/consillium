Comparison of Radical Prostatectomy Performed by Robot-assisted Laparoscopy or Conventional Laparoscopy or by Laparotomy
Minimally invasive surgery has developed widely since the 1980s and has revolutionized the practices of surgeons. In urology, the development of laparoscopy and then robot-assisted surgery has considerably improved the management of pathologies. In France, as in all the countries concerned, the spread of robotic surgery has taken place without prior studies validating this new technology, nor organizational rules in terms of quality and access to care. The report of the Haute Autorité de Santé dated November 2016 underlines the weakness of the methodological quality of studies and meta-analyzes evaluating robot-assisted total prostatectomy compared to other surgical techniques by laparotomy or conventional laparoscopy. It therefore appears important to evaluate in a large study the interest of this technique in order to help the authorities to decide on the real benefit of this technology and to provide reliable answers to the patients.
