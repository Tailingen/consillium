Prognostic Study of Prostate Cancer Via Dynamic Change of PSA in Peritoneal Drainage Fluid After Radical Prostatectomy
This study investigates the prognostic value of dynamic changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels found in the peritoneal drainage fluid after radical prostatectomy. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, and radical prostatectomy is a standard treatment. While PSA levels in the blood are commonly used as a marker for diagnosis, this study focuses on the significance of PSA levels in the prognosis of prostate cancer. The findings may provide insights into improved post-surgical monitoring and more tailored therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer patients.

PSA Levels in Drainage Fluid, Postoperative Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels in The Peritoneal Drainage Fluid, Measured daily for up to 3 days post-surgery.
This study examines the prognostic significance of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels in the peritoneal drainage fluid following radical prostatectomy, a common surgical treatment for prostate cancer. PSA is widely used as a biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment response, and recurrence monitoring in the blood. However, this research seeks to explore the prognostic value of PSA in the drainage fluid.

The study involves continuous monitoring of PSA levels in the drainage fluid after radical prostatectomy, with the hypothesis that dynamic changes in these levels could serve as an early warning system for potential tumor recurrence, residual disease, or metastasis. The research will correlate these fluid PSA levels with patient outcomes, recurrence rates, and other clinical factors to determine their predictive value.

By investigating this novel source of PSA monitoring, the study aims to reduce invasive tests, enhance post-operative surveillance, and improve early detection of disease recurrence for prostate cancer patients. This research could contribute to refining post-surgical care protocols, offering a new tool for predict long-term outcomes for individuals undergoing radical prostatectomy.
