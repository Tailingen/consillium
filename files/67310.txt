Transoral Robotic Surgery in Treating Patients With Benign or Malignant Tumors of the Head and Neck
This pilot clinical trial studies transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in treating patients with benign or malignant tumors of the head and neck. TORS is a less invasive type of surgery for head and neck cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery

PROCEDURE: transoral robotic surgery|PROCEDURE: quality of life assessment
Determine the feasibility of the TORS in patients with oral and laryngopharyngeal benign and malignant lesions., up to eight years
Assess the impact of TORS on the intra-operative surgical outcomes such as operative time, blood loss and complications., If the planned procedure is a combined procedure, (robotic + non robotic) above mentioned measures are going to be presented separately for successful fully robotic surgeries and for unsuccessful mixed surgeries.

2. To identify the learning curve for TORS by measuring the efficiency and accuracy of the surgeons who perform the procedures., up to eight years|Assess the quality of life of the patients with TORS., up to eight years
To conduct a pilot single-arm study to assess transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oral and laryngopharyngeal benign and malignant lesions using the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System.
