Toripalimab in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600 Wild Type Melanoma
In view of the fact that neoadjuvant therapy for malignant melanoma is in the exploratory stage, and the current data on neoadjuvant immunology are mainly from European and American populations, it is necessary to carry out clinical trials in the status of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with melanoma in China. Toripalimab has been extensively studied in the field of malignant melanoma, and its effectiveness and safety have been proven. Therefore, the investigators initiated a single-arm exploratory study to investigate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab in neoadjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600 wild-type malignant melanoma.
