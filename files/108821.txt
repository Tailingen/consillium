Participants who received a ADP adoptive cell therapy will be enrolled in this non-therapeutic, multi-center, long term follow-up (LTFU) study and will be followed for up to 15 years post-infusion of lentiviral vector-based adoptive cell therapy. Participants will be monitored for safety following last adoptive cell therapy infusion.
