MINT I Multi- Institutional Neo-adjuvant Therapy MammaPrint Project I
Genomics assays that measure specific gene expression patterns in a patient's primary tumor have become important prognostic tools for breast cancer patients. This study is designed to test the ability of MammaPrint速 in combination with TargetPrint速, BluePrint速, and TheraPrint速, as well as traditional pathologic and clinical prognostic factors, to predict responsiveness to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).

Determine the predictive power of chemosensitivity of MammaPrint as measured by pCR., 6-12 months|Determine the predictive power of chemosensitivity of the combination of MammaPrint and BluePrint as measured by pCR., 6-12 months
Compare TargetPrint single gene read out of ER, PR and HER2 with local and centralized IHC and/or CISH/FISH assessment of ER, PR and HER2., Baseline. First study visit.|Identify possible correlations between the TheraPrint Research Gene Panel outcomes and chemoresponsiveness., 6-9 months|Identify and/or validate predictive gene expression profiles of clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy., 6-12 months|Compare the three BluePrint molecular subtype categories with IHC-based subtype classification., Baseline. First study visit.
Patients with suspected primary breast cancer on mammography and clinical examination will be assessed for eligibility by having a needle core biopsy to confirm invasive carcinoma.

A fresh unfixed tumor specimen, incisional or core biopsy will be sent to Agendia to determine the MammaPrint risk profile, the BluePrint molecular subtyping profile, the TargetPrint ER, PR and HER2 single gene readout, the 56-geneTheraPrint Research Gene Panel and the additional genes as measured on the whole genome (44k) array.

Surgical Protocol:

1. Determination of nodal status:

   * For clinically node-negative patients: Axillary ultra sound, followed by Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) biopsy
   * For clinically node-positive patients: ultra sound-guided Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA), followed by core biopsy
2. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
3. Definitive surgery:

   * For node-positive patients: lumpectomy, repeat SLN biopsy, Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND)
   * For node-negative patients: lumpectomy, repeat SLN biopsy (optional), no ALND

Response will be measured by pathological Complete Response (pCR) and by centrally assessed Residual Cancer Burden (RCB).
