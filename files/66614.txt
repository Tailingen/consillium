HPV Vaccination in Women With Cystic Fibrosis
The main risk factor for the development of cervical lesions is human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Vaccination against human papillomavirus, which is offered to all girls aged 11 to 14, and catching up to girls aged 15 to 19, is an effective method of preventing cervical pathology. Despite this, human papillomavirus vaccination coverage remains low in France.

Some women with cystic fibrosis might need a transplantation, which is a factor associated with increased risk of human papillomavirus carriage and cervical pathology. An over-risk of cervical pathology would also be present in non-transplanted women with cystic fibrosis. Particular attention should therefore be paid to vaccination in this population.

The objective is to estimate the frequency of human papillomavirus vaccination in young patients with cystic fibrosis, and to evaluate the reasons for non-vaccination.
