Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of AMX-500 in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
The study will be conducted in 4 parts and will commence with dose escalation of AMX-500 as a monotherapy (Part 1), followed by monotherapy dose expansion (Part 2).

* Part 1 (Monotherapy Dose Escalation): Single-agent AMX-500 dose escalation
* Part 2 (Monotherapy Dose Expansion): Single-agent AMX-500 dose expansion

The study may subsequently continue via a protocol amendment with dose escalation of AMX-500 combinations (Part 3) followed by combination therapy dose expansion (Part 4).
