Docetaxel in Treating Older Patients With Metastatic Breast, Lung, or Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well docetaxel works in treating older patients with metastatic breast, lung, or prostate cancer.
Breast Cancer|Lung Cancer|Prostate Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel
Pharmacokinetics of docetaxel
Correlation between docetaxel clearance with estimated cytochrome p450 activity by the Erythromycin Breath Test|Response|Toxicity|Correlation between toxicity and functional status decline|Relationship between comorbid conditions at baseline and declines in functional status
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in older patients with metastatic breast, lung, or prostate cancer.
* Determine the response of patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the short-term changes in functional status, in terms of activities of daily living, independent activities of daily living, and Karnofsky performance status, in patients treated with this drug.
* Correlate the number of comorbid conditions at baseline with declines in functional status in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
