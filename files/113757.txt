A Study of NVL-330 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic HER2-altered NSCLC (HEROEX-1)
Phase 1a/1b dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NVL-330, determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and evaluate the antitumor activity in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-altered NSCLC.

Phase 1a dose escalation is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of NVL-330 and to select the candidate RP2D(s) and, if applicable, the MTD.

Phase 1b expansion is designed to further evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of the candidate RP2D(s) of NVL-330 and to determine the RP2D of NVL 330 in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 mutant NSCLC.

The planned Phase 1a/1b first-in-human study is designed as a two-part clinical trial to investigate NVL-330 in pre-treated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-altered NSCLC. The dose escalation phase of the trial is designed to enroll a set number of patients per cohort at protocol defined dose levels. After the initial patients are treated at a given dose level and monitored for at least 28 days, available data will be reviewed, and initiation of the next dosing group will proceed with consideration given to the overall safety profile.

The expansion phase of the trial is designed to further evaluate safety and activity and to confirm the RP2D(s).
