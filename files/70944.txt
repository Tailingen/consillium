A Study Evaluating Safety, Tolerability, and Clinical Activity of Forimtamig-Based Treatment Combinations in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of forimtamig when administered alone or in combination with carfilzomib or daratumumab or other combination partners in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). The study consists of two phases: a dose exploration phase and a dose-expansion phase.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Investigator per IMWG Criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR) for Participants who Achieve a Partial Response (PR) or Better as Determined by the Investigator per IMWG Criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|Time to First Response as Determined by the Investigator per IMWG Criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Best Response as Determined by the Investigator per IMWG Criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS) as Determined by the Investigator per IMWG Criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|Serum Concentration of Forimtamig, Up to approximately 24 months|Percentage of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Forimtamig, Up to approximately 24 months
