TT-702 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours.
This clinical trial is evaluating the drug candidate TT-702 in patients with advanced solid tumours. The main aims of the trial are to determine the maximum dose of TT-702 that can be given safely to patients alone and in combination with other anti-cancer agents.

TT-702 is a 'small molecule prodrug'. TT-702 is converted into TT-478, which then targets and blocks the function of the 'A2B adenosine receptor'. It is hoped that by blocking this receptor the immune system will become more active in recognising and removing tumour cells.

This clinical trial has two phases:

* Phase I, dose escalation phase - groups of patients will receive increasing doses of TT-702 to find an optimal dose that best targets the tumours. This phase will consist of both monotherapy and combination escalation cohorts. In the combination escalation cohorts, TT-702 will be evaluated in combination with the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist darolutamide to be assessed in mCRPC. Potential agents for further combination escalation cohorts have not yet been defined.
* Phase II, expansion phase - larger groups of patients will receive the selected dose of TT-702 considered to be optimal in the Phase I, dose escalation phase. This phase will consist of three monotherapy expansion cohorts (metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer \[mCRPC\] cohort, Mismatch Repair \[MMR\]/ Microsatellite Instability \[MSI\] defective tumours cohort and a triple negative breast cancer \[TNBC\] cohort) and combination expansion cohorts. In the combination expansion cohorts, TT-702 will be evaluated in combination with the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist darolutamide to be assessed in mCRPC. Potential agents for further combination expansion cohorts have not yet been defined.

The main aims of this trial are to:

* Find the maximum dose of TT-702 as a monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs that can be given safely to patients.
* Define the side effects of TT-702 and how these can be managed.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and elimination kinetics of TT-702.
