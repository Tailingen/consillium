Cetuximab, Radiotherapy and Twice Weekly Gemcitabine to Treat Pancreatic Cancer
This study is designed to establish the safety and efficacy of a combination of Erbitux (cetuximab)/Gemzar (gemcitabine)/radiation in patients with pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab/Gemcitabine|PROCEDURE: Radiotherapy
Objective Response of Tumor by RECIST 1.0 Criteria, Per RECIST Criteria (v. 1.0) and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter (SLD)of target lesions at baseline; Progressive Disease (PD), \>=20% increase in the SLD of target lesions at baseline; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient decrease in SLD to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in SLD to qualify for PD., one month post-therapy
Number of Participants Assessed for Adverse Events, Adverse events assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, Participants were followed during treatment and for 30 days after completion of treatment|Number of Participants Determined to be Resectable (Eligible for Surgery)After Completion of Therapy, Tumor resectability is based on CT scan and as defined by the American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Convened Consensus Conference on Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer (Callery MP, et al. Ann Surg Oncol 2009; 16:1727-1733): no evidence of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal vein (PV)abutment, distortion, tumor thrombus, or venous encasement, and clear fat planes around celiac axis (CA), hepatic artery (HA), and superior mesenteric artery (SMA)., 1 month after completion of treatment|Role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Status in Response to Treatment., Tumor was assessed for EGFR status by immunohistochemistry. EGFR positive and EGRF negative tumor types were evaluated and compared for response to treatment., One month post-therapy|Disease-Free Survival After Therapy, Time to disease progression after therapy., Five years post treatment|Overall Length of Survival After Therapy, Length of survival after therapy in all participants enrolled., Five years post treatment|Pattern of Failure After Therapy, Local recurrence, distant recurrence, or both., Five years post treatment
