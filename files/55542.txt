Efficacy and Safety of HGXJT in Bone Metastatic NSCLC Patients
This is a double-blind, randomized controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of HGXJT in combination with ICI-based standard treatment in lung cancer patients with bone metastases. Enrolled participates will randomly receive HGXJT or placebo during the first 4-6 cycles of ICI-based standard treatment.

(Disease control rate assessed by investigators) DCR (CR+PR+SD), DCR (disease control rate) is defined as sum of complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate and stable disease (SD) rate, according to RECIST v 1.1, based on the chest, abdomen and/or brain CT/MRI evaluation. Patients will undergo a follow-up imaging examination every 3 months, with an additional imaging examination after the first two cycles of treatment (normally 6 weeks)., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months.
Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression, date of withdraw, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months.|Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization to the date of withdraw or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization to the date of withdraw or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 120 months.|ORR(Objective response rate), ORR (overall response rate) is defined as sum of complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate , according to RECIST v 1.1, based on the chest, abdomen and/or brain CT/MRI evaluation.
