Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI Combined With IVIM-DWI for Early Prediction of Chemosensitivity in Liver MBC
The purpose of this study is to further use DCE-MRI and ivim-dwi to predict the chemotherapy sensitivity of liver metastasis of breast cancer at an early stage, and to predict the treatment response of tumor at an early stage by using the changes of their functional parameters, and to compare the efficacy and advantages of IVIM functional parameters and DCE-MRI parameters in predicting the efficacy.To explore the efficacy of "perfusion" and "diffusion" parameters of magnetic resonance imaging as "biomarkers" for early prediction of chemotherapy response and prognosis of breast cancer patients with liver metastasis. And to provide guidance for optimizing the clinical treatment scheme of breast cancer patients with liver metastasis.

At the same time, this study will use the method of artificial intelligence to deeply mine the images, and further find out the indicators for early prediction of the therapeutic effect of liver metastasis of breast cancer.

The first MR examination was arranged within 7 days before treatment (baseline). The MRI scanning sequence included conventional T1, T2 weighted imaging, T1+dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, and IVIM-DWI imaging.The second and third MR examinations were arranged within 7 days after the first chemotherapy and the second chemotherapy. The examination steps and parameters were the same as those of the first examination.
