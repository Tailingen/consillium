Neoadjuvant Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients With Docetaxel and Carboplatin to Assess Anti-tumor Activity
This is a single arm open label phase II study in women with clinical stage 2 or 3 triple negative breast cancer to assess the anti-tumor activity (in terms of pathologic complete response rate) of neoadjuvant docetaxel in combination with carboplatin. Patient derived xenografts will also be developed simultaneously for the purposes of genoproteomic analysis.

Please note that Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) has a parallel study the same as this study. Baylor is expected to enroll approximately 19 participants that have complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study (excluded participants from BCM will include male participants or participants with inflammatory breast cancer). The investigators will pool participants and data from the BCM study and the study at Washington University School of Medicine. Pooling the data will potentially improve statistical power.
Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: FDG-PET/MR
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate, -A patient is considered to not to have a pCR if any of the following are true:

* There is histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen or the axillary lymph nodes.
* The patient has discontinued neoadjuvant treatment early due to refusal, toxicity, or radiographic evidence of progression and then goes straight to surgery where there is histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and the axillary lymph nodes
* The patient has discontinued neoadjuvant treatment early due to refusal, toxicity or radiographic evidence of progression and then receives alternative treatment.
* The patient discontinues study treatment, refuses surgery, or is unable to undergo surgery due to a co-morbid condition.

Thus, any patient who does not receive alternative treatment prior to surgery and has no histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and the axillary lymph nodes is considered to have a pCR., At the time of surgery (surgery will take place 3-5 weeks after completion of treatment and estimated treatment length is 18 weeks)
