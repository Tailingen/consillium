Tumor Response Time of Palbociclib in Combination With AI in Real-world Chinese Patients
The international treatment guidelines now include recommendations for the use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in combination with hormone agents for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative ABC as the first-line standard therapy in endocrine sensitive patients.

Nevertheless, it is generally thought that chemotherapy is associated with greater and earlier tumor response, especially in case of high burden of disease. In a retrospective analysis of real-world clinical practice (2002-2012) from US, only 60% of patients initiated ET as the first treatment following metastatic diagnosis . In the real-life world of China, a large number of HR+/HER2- ABC patients with non-visceral crisis also received chemotherapy in first-line treatment, even though the ORR is similar compared with CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy. Zhejiang Cancer Hospital retrospective analysis of 5 cases of advanced breast cancer first-line use of Ibance + ET, they were evaluated within 50 days (from 27days to 50days).

Based on the early response time observed in real-world data mentioned above, it is proposed a prospective study to further observe the tumor reduction rate in real-world, including to identify the time of patient symptom improvement according to the quality of life scale.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: AI
Early Tumor Shrinkage (ETS), 10% change in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions at the first scan after 4weeks and 8weeks of treatment., 4 weeks, 8weeks|Time To Response (TTR), Time to first documented complete of partial response., Up to approximately 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1), Up to approximately 24 months|Number of participants with Adverse Events per CTCAE version 4.03 and type, Safety will be determined by type, severity of adverse events per CTCAE version 4.03 and type, Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Definitive 10% Deterioration in the Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QOL) Scale Score of the EORTC QLQ-C30, At least 10% relative to baseline worsening of the corresponding scale score (without further improvement above the threshold) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), time to death due to any cause, Randomization to death from any cause, through the end of study (approximately 60months)]
According to the early assessment(4 weeks) , this prospective study comprehensively investigate TTR of Palbociclib+ET in the first line treatment for HR+/HER2- MBC patients in China real-world study.

Furthermore, evaluate the Early Tumor Shrinkage(ETS) of Palbociclib + ET, and assess Treatment Free Interval (TFI) with TTR and ETS；TFI was analyzed at the following time points: ≤24, \>24, ≤36, \> 36, ≤48, \>48 months.

Accroding to the follow-up of QoL questionnaire, understand the clinical symptoms improvements time.

Meanwhile, cooperation with radiology department, establish a model for predicting early response by observing the imaging and clinical pathological characteristics of patients with ETS.
