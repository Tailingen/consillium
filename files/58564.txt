Two Regimens of Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Localized Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors
This clinical trial is studying the side effects of combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed localized Ewing sarcoma family of tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

Event Free Survival, Disease progression, occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm (SMN)or death will be considered an analytic event. In all other cases, the patient will be considered censored at last contact., From enrollment to event or 10 years from enrollment, whichever occurs first
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the feasibility and safety of adding interval-compressed vincristine, topotecan hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide to a treatment protocol utilizing interval compression of vincristine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the event-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

INDUCTION THERAPY (WEEKS 1-12): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 9 and on day 1 in weeks 5 and 11; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 3 and 7; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 3 and 7; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 5 and 11. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24-36 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy and continuing for at least 7 days or until blood counts recover, whichever comes last. Filgrastim is discontinued at least 24 hours prior to the next course of chemotherapy.

LOCAL CONTROL: Patients who respond to induction therapy may undergo surgery alone if the lesion can be resected with negative margins and with a reasonable functional result beginning in week 13. Following surgery, patients with unresectable lesions or inadequate margins may receive radiotherapy during week 15. Patients with bulky lesions in surgically difficult sites such as the spine, skull, and periacetabular pelvis; poor response to induction chemotherapy; or those in whom surgery would result in unacceptable functional results may receive radiotherapy alone in weeks 13-19. Patients with bulky lesions in difficult sites and who do not have a good clinical and radiographic response to induction therapy may receive radiotherapy to the primary site during weeks 13-19 followed by surgery of the involved site during week 25 after recovery from course 11 of chemotherapy. Patients with microscopic residual disease after planned pre-operative radiotherapy will receive additional radiotherapy.

CONTINUATION THERAPY (WEEKS 15-36): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 15, 16, 21-24, 27-30, 33, and 34; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 15, 21, and 29; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 15, 21 and 29 and on day 1 in weeks 23, 27, and 33; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 17, 19, 25, 31, and 35; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 17, 19, 25, 31, and 35; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 of weeks 23, 27, and 33. Patients also receive G-CSF SC as in induction therapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 10 years.
