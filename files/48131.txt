Molecular Profiling in Lung Cancer Patients
The main purpose of this study of pemetrexed combined with cisplatin used as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (2 or 3 cycles) in participants with operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is to look at various genes present in participants' blood and tumor tissue to see if there is any link between the levels or changes in the genes and how participants with lung cancer respond to pemetrexed and cisplatin treatment.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Carcinoma
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Radical Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) surgery
High/Low Expression of Selected Molecular Markers in Tumor Tissues and Hypermethylated Genes in Peripheral Blood, Molecular markers assessed by immunohistochemistry: thymidylate synthase, glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); and by polymerase chain reaction: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), reduced folate carrier, alpha folate receptor, Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1 (ERCC1), folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH). Hypermethylated genes assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Due to small sample size, tumor-tissue analyses were not done., Baseline, Cycle 2, and surgery (4-8 weeks after last dose of pemetrexed)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Tumor Response (Response Rate), Tumor response to treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD)=small changes that do not meet above criteria. Response rate was estimated as the total number of CR or PR, divided by the total number of participants treated., Treatment start to disease progression or surgery (4-8 weeks after last dose of pemetrexed)|Duration of Response, The duration of response was defined as the time from complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to disease progression. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Time of response to disease progression (up to 44.4 months)|Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS was the time from date of first dose to first observation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. If a participant was not known to have died or have PD, DFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment., Treatment start to disease progression or death from any cause (up to 45.5 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from treatment start to death from any cause. For participants who were alive, OS was censored at the last contact date., Treatment start to death from any cause (up to 47.6 months)
