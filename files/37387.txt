Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy Combined With Sintilimab and Regorafenib as Adjuvant Therapy for Colorectal Liver Metastasis Patients With a High Risk of Recurrent: a Single-arm, Phase II Study
Pts with histologically confirmed CRLM and whose CRS \>2 were enrolled into this single-arm, phase II study. The critical enrollment criteria were that Subjects had completely resected Primary lesion and liver metastases and had no evidence of extrahepatic disease. After hepatectomy， HAIC (FOLFOX: oxaliplatin 85mg/m2, 5- fluorouracil 2500mg/m2, calcium folinate 400mg/m2) was given every 4-6 weeks for 2-4 cycles depending on pts' health status, in combination with Sintilimab (200mg, iv, d1) and regorafenib (80mg, po, d1-21) every 3 weeks for up to 6 months. The primary endpoint was 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and secondary endpoints included RFS, overall survival (OS), safety, and health-related quality of life.
