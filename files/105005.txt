A Study of NTX-1088, a Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the Poliovirus Receptor (PVR, CD155), as Monotherapy and Combined With Pembrolizumab
This is a Phase 1,open-label, multi-center, first-in-human, 2-part (Part 1: dose escalation and Part 2: expansion) study, evaluating multiple doses and schedules of intravenously (IV) administered NTX-1088, with or without pembrolizumab, in patients with advanced solid malignancies (i.e., locally advanced or metastatic).
Cancer|Tumor, Solid|Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Cancer|Locally Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: NTX-1088|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), The incidence of DLTs during the DLT assessment period., First 21 days of treatment.|Dose-Finding, Determination of the MTD or maximum tested dose, and the RP2D., Screening to 30 days from last dose.|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events (AE), The incidences and percentages of patients experiencing AEs summarized by NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grade and by causality., Screening to 30 days from last dose.
Pharmacokinetics of NTX-1088, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Day 1 of dosing through 21 days post last dose.|Pharmacokinetics of NTX-1088, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Day 1 of dosing through 21 days post last dose.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR according to RECIST v1.1., Day 1 of dosing through 90 days after the last dose.|Duration of Response (DoR), Time from the date measurement criteria are first met for PR or CR to the date measurement criteria are first met for progressive disease., Day 1 of dosing through 90 days after the last dose.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of initiation of study therapy to the date measurement criteria are first met for progressive disease or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Day 1 of dosing through 90 days after the last dose.|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of initiation of study therapy to the date of death from any cause., Day 1 of dosing through 90 days after the last dose.
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study whose principal Part 1 stage objective is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the anti-PVR monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a single agent and combined with the anti-PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

In the Part 2 stage, the antitumor activity of NTX-1088 alone or combined with pembrolizumab will be evaluated in patients with malignancies known to express PVR.
