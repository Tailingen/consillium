Study of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan With Bevacizumab Versus Bevacizumab Monotherapy for First-line Maintenance in HER2-Expressing Ovarian Cancer (DESTINY-Ovarian01)
This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in combination with bevacizumab versus bevacizumab monotherapy as first-line maintenance therapy, in participants with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-expressing (immunohistochemistry \[IHC\] 3+/2+/1+) advanced high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab Deruxtecan|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in the HER2 IHC 3+/2+ population, Time from randomization to time of objective radiographic disease progression as assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., From date of randomization to radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 35 months
Overall Survival in the HER2 IHC 3+/2+ population, Time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization to death due to any cause, up to approximately 72 months|Progression Free Survival by BICR in the HER2 IHC 3+/2+/1+ population, Time from randomization to time of objective radiographic disease progression as assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., From date of randomization to radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 35 months|Overall Survival in the HER2 IHC 3+/2+/1+ population, Time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization to death due to any cause, up to approximately 72 months|Progression Free Survival by the investigator in HER2 IHC 3+/2+ population, Time from randomization to time of objective radiographic disease progression as assessed by the investigator based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., From date of randomization to radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 35 months|Progression Free Survival by the investigator in HER2 IHC 3+/2+/1+ population, Time from randomization to time of objective radiographic disease progression as assessed by the investigator based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., From date of randomization to radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 35 months
A non-randomized safety run-in phase will be conducted prior to randomization phase to assess the safety of T-DXd in combination with bevacizumab.
