INO-5401 + INO-9012 in Combination With Atezolizumab in Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic/Recurrent Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a Phase I/IIA, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary clinical efficacy of INO-5401 + INO-9012 delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by electroporation (EP), in combination with atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent Urothelial Carcinoma (UCa). The trial population is divided into two cohorts: Cohort A: Participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent UCa, who have confirmed disease progression during or following treatment with anti-Programmed Death receptor-1/Programmed Death receptor Ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) therapy; Cohort B: Participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent UCa, who are treatment naïve and ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A safety run-in will be performed with up to six participants (safety analysis participants) from cohort A.
