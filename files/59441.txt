An Expanded Clinical Study of Triple Therapy for Refractory Solid Tumors That Failed First-line Treatment for Recurrence and Metastasis
The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy /PD-1 monoclonal antibody/targeted therapy, chemotherapy /PD-1 monoclonal antibody/targeted therapy + noninvasive electromagnetic wave hyperthermia and chemotherapy /PD-1 monoclonal antibody/targeted therapy + noninvasive electromagnetic wave hyperthermia + autosomatic immunotherapy in the treatment of refractory refractory solid tumors with first-line treatment failure was compared.
