Cetuximab & Concomitant-Boost Accelerated RT in Patients With Locally Advanced Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
The purpose of this study is to determine the 1-year rate of locoregional disease control in the experimental arm, using a control arm to avoid selection bias.
Oropharyngeal Neoplasms
DRUG: Cetuximab
1-year rate of Locoregional Disease Control in the experimental arm, deffined as complete and persistent disappearance of disease in the primary tumour and regional lymph nodes.
Toxicity and safety of treatment will be evaluated using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) of the NCI, version 3.0.; and late toxicity from radiotherapy, using RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme.
* To determine the 1-year rate of locoregional disease control in the experimental arm, using a control arm to avoid selection bias.
* To determine the 2 and 3 year rate of locoregional disease control.
* To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of cetuximab and concomitant-boost accelerated radiotherapy followed by 12 weeks of complementary treatment with cetuximab. Both acute and chronic toxicity will be assessed.
* To determine specific disease-free survival, event-free survival, disease-specific survival and overall survival
* To determine acute and late toxicity
* To determine EGFR, p53, Ki67, and evaluate its value as a prognostic factor.
