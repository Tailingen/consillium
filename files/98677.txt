Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of GS-5829 (Alobresib) as a Single Agent and In Combination With Enzalutamide in Participants With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This study consists of two phases: Dose Escalation (Phase 1b) and Dose Expansion (Phase 2)

The Dose Escalation phase will characterize the safety, tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of alobresib as a single agent and in combination with enzalutamide, in participants with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

The Dose Expansion phase will evaluate the following:

* In group 1, the efficacy of alobresib as a single agent in participants with mCRPC who have progressed while receiving enzalutamide (may have also received abiraterone)
* In group 2, the efficacy of alobresib combined with enzalutamide in participants with mCRPC who have progressed while receiving treatment with abiraterone (may not have previously received enzalutamide)
* In group 3, the efficacy of alobresib combined with enzalutamide in participants with mCRPC who have had prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression, but not radiographic progression, while receiving treatment with enzalutamide (participants may have also previously received abiraterone)
Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Alobresib|DRUG: Enzalutamide
Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Number of Participants Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was a toxicity, considered possibly related to alobresib, and which occurred during the DLT assessment window (Days 1 through 28) in each cohort: Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 500/mm\^3), Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (ANC\< 1000/mm\^3) with fever (a single temperature \> 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C for more than 1 hour (h)), Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 2 bleeding (eg, gastrointestinal, respiratory, epistaxis, purpura), Grade ≥ 3 non hematologic toxicity, except- Grade 3 nausea or emesis with maximum duration of 48 h on adequate medical therapy and Grade 3 diarrhea which persists for \< 72 h in the absence of maximal medical therapy, Grade ≥ 2 non hematologic treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) that in the opinion of the investigator was of potential clinical significance such that further dose escalation would expose participants to unacceptable risk, treatment interruption ≥ 7 days due to unresolved toxicity., Day 1 through Day 28|Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Non-progression Rate at Week 24 According to Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) Criteria, The non-progression rate at Week 24 was defined as the proportion of participants who did not progress by Week 24., Week 24
Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of Alobresib, Cmax is the maximum observed concentration of drug in plasma., Monotherapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Combination therapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15|Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Ctau: Observed Drug Concentration at the End of the Dosing Interval of Alobresib, Ctau is the observed concentration of drug in plasma at the end of dosing., Monotherapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Combination therapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 15|Phase 1b Dose Escalation: AUClast: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Quantifiable Concentration of Alobresib, AUClast is the concentration of drug over time zero to last concentration (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve)., Monotherapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Combination therapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15|Phase 1b Dose Escalation: AUCtau: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve Over the Dosing Interval of Alobresib, AUCtau is defined as the concentration of drug over time (the area under the concentration verses time curve over the dosing interval)., Monotherapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Combination therapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 15|Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Tmax: Time (Observed Time Point) of Cmax of Alobresib, Tmax is the time observed for the Cmax of alobresib., Monotherapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Combination therapy: Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15|Percentage of Participants Who Had ≥ 30% Reduction in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) From Baseline at Week 12, PSA response was defined as percentage of participants with ≥ 30% decline in PSA from baseline by 12 weeks., Baseline; Week 12|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression (assessed per PCWG2) or death from any cause. PCWG2 criteria for progression was determined as 'Decline from baseline' when record start of therapy to first prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir and confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later; 'No decline from baseline' when PSA progression ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks., Up to approximately 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug to death from any cause., Up to approximately 4 years
