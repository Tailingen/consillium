Medico Economic Study, Comparing Intrabeam® on Surgical Resection Bed to Conventional Surgery + EBRT, in Breast Cancer
Current breast cancer treatment is based on surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormonotherapy. Conservative surgery or mastectomy are followed by complementary externe radiotherapy.

This adjuvant external breast radiotherapy (EBRT) is heavy, spread over more than 6 weeks with :

* 25 sessions and delivery of a unit dose of 2 Gy to obtain a total dose of 50 Gy (5 sessions per week in general);
* 16 Gy overimpression (boost) dose located in the tumour bed, in 5 to 8 fractions, in situations at high risk of recurrence.

In addition, EBRT is responsible for many adverse effects, some of which can lead to lasting or permanent sequelae.

Many focused partial breast irradiation techniques have been developed in recent years with the objective of reducing the duration and morbidity of overall breast irradiation.

Among these techniques, intraoperative breast radiotherapy (IBRT) is recommended in cancers diagnosed at early stages for which tumorectomy is expected and which present a low risk of recurrence.

The main advantages of IBRTare :

* Improvement of the quality of life due to a single session of radiotherapy associated with surgical ;
* Increased precision to deliver the necessary dose in tumour tissue;
* Preservation of surrounding healthy tissue ;
* Reduction in the overall cost of treatment through shorter hospital stays and the absence of medical transport for conventional radiotherapy sessions.

RIOP SEIN is a project supported by Institut National du Cancer (INCa)

, which consists of a medico-economic evaluation of IBRT, with Intrabeam® system on surgical resection bed relative to conventional surgery + EBRT in postmenopausal patients operated by conservative surgery for Low risk breast cancer
Menopausal Patients|Low-risk Breast Cancer
RADIATION: RIOP-Intrabeam® system|RADIATION: conventional surgery +RTE
Actual cost, Actual cost measured individually for each patient for both techniques used, involving all costs from surgery to 2 months after the end of radiotherapy including costs related to possible acute complications of radiotherapy, 2 months after the end of radiotherapy
Local-regional recurrence rate, Analysis of the local-regional relapse rate with Intrabeam system as compared with the results published with EBRT, 10 years|Complication rates, Early and late complication rates, 10 years|Esthetic result, Taking photos at inclusion, 2 months, 1 year, 5 years and 10 years from the end of radiotherapy, 10 years|quality of life after surgery and radiotherapy, questionnaires EQ 5D, 10 years|quality of life after surgery and radiotherapy, questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30, 10 years|quality of life after surgery and radiotherapy, questionnaires BR23, 10 years
Main objective is the economic comparison Intrabeam® system versus EBRT, in terms of real costs. Costs will be taken into account:

* of equipment,
* of staff,
* of transport.

Secondary objectives are :

* Compare local-regional survival without recurrence with conventional irradiation
* Analyze the rate of early and late complications
* Impact of intraoperative irradiation on the esthetic outcome and quality of life of patients

Schedule of the visits :

RIOP arm : Surgery with Intrabeam®. A first visit will be scheduled at 2 months from surgery then at 6 months then every 6 months for 5 years, then every year after 5 years.

RTE arm: surgery, EBRT over 33 sessions then visit at 6 months then every 6 months 6 for 5 years, then every year after 5 years.

In RIOP ARM, additional EBRT may be performed +/- chemotherapy if the treatment received is insufficient.

Quality of life will be assessed in each treatment arm at inclusion before randomization, 2 months after surgery, every 6 months for 5 years and every year after 5 years using quality of life questionnaires: Euroqol EQ 5D, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QlQ-C30 and BR23 module specific for breast cancer.
