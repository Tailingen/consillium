Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab for Patients With Advanced Rare Genitourinary Tumors
This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for rare genitourinary malignancies among four cohorts, bladder or upper tract carcinoma with variant histology, adrenocortical carcinoma, other rare genitourinary carcinomas and any genitourinary carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Given preliminary results, the study is being tested in additional patients with bladder or upper tract carcinoma with variant histology at this time while the adrenocortical carcinoma, other rare genitourinary malignancies arms have closed to accrual

-The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Nivolumab
* Ipilimumab
Genitourinary Cancer|Adrenocortical Carcinoma|Non-urothelial Bladder|Non-urothelial Upper Tract|Penile Cancer|Non-adenocarcinoma Prostate Cancer|Refractory Germ-cell|High Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma/Small Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Objective Response Rate, Radiologic disease assessment performed at 12 weeks after initial treatment and then every 6 or 12 weeks. These radiologic disease assessments are evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines. This will be conducted by cohort ((1) ACC, (2) Non-urothelial bladder/upper tract cancer and (3) other rare GU tumors), Imaging will occur every 6-12 weeks study entry up until disease progression (up to 24 months)
Objective Response Rate for all rare GU tumor types, Radiologic disease assessment performed at 12 weeks after initial treatment and then every 6 or 12 weeks. These radiologic disease assessments are evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines. A pooled analysis of all tumor cohorts will be done as a secondary analysis., Imaging will occur every 6-12 weeks study entry up until disease progression (up to 24 months)|Duration of Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause) estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meir for all patients and by tumor cohorts. (((1) ACC, (2) Non-urothelial bladder/upper tract cancer and (3) other rare GU tumors), Imaging will occur every 6-12 weeks study entry up until disease progression (up to 24 months)|Immune related objective response rate, Radiologic disease assessment performed at 12 weeks after initial treatment and then every 6 or 12 weeks. These radiologic disease assessments are evaluated per Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC) and will be analyzed for all patients any by tumor cohort ((1) ACC, (2) Non-urothelial bladder/upper tract cancer and (3) other rare GU tumors), Imaging will occur every 6-12 weeks study entry up until disease progression (up to 24 months)|Progression-Free Survival for the total cohort and by tumor cohort, PFS is measured from the start of treatment until the documented progression by RESIST criteria or death from any cause. This will be summarized using the method of Kaplan-Meir for all patients and by tumor cohorts. ((1) ACC, (2) Non-urothelial bladder/upper tract cancer and (3) other rare GU tumors), From start of treatment until date of death from any cause (average 24 months)|Overall Survival for all patients and by tumor cohort, OS is measured from the start of treatment until date of death from any cause and will be analyzed in all patients and by tumor cohorts ((1) ACC, (2) Non-urothelial bladder/upper tract cancer and (3) other rare GU tumors), From start of treatment until date of death from any cause. (Average 24 months)|Safety and tolerability according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., All adverse events recorded during the trial will be summarized for the safety population.The incidence of events that are new or worsening from the time of first dose of treatment will be summarized according to system organ class and/or preferred term, severity (based on CTCAE version 4), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment., Throughout the course of the study, approximately 24 months after study entry.
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the combination of drugs works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for this specific disease but the combination is approved for use in melanoma patients.

In this research study, the investigators are...

* Investigating the response of the participant's cancer to treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab,
* Assessing the safety of treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab and
* Evaluating response and resistance to treatment by looking at the participant's tumor tissue and blood for markers to predict response and resistance to therapy.
