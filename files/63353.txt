A Trial of SHR-1316/Placebo in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Resectable NSCLC
This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant treatment with monoclonal antibody SHR-1316 or placebo in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy in participants with resectable Stage II, IIIA, or selected IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) followed by adjuvant SHR-1316 or placebo and monitoring.
