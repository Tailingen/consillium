Quality of Life After Cytoreductive Surgery and Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
Cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal chemotherapy is one of the most important treatments for patients with colorectal cancer and peritoneal metastasis. For the best survival rates, complete removal of all metastatic lesions is the most important part of treatment, and various surgical procedures are required for the complete cytoreduction. Therefore, the postoperative morbidity rates are higher than those of localized colon cancer surgeries and patients can experience a prolonged recovery period and deterioration of physical activities over a long period. The aim of this study is to investigate the change of quality of life after cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.
