The Impact of Ureteral Stents on Peristalsis
The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of ureteral stents on the functioning of ureteral peristalsis (normal contractions in the ureteral organ muscle).
Kidney Stones|Tumor|Hydronephrosis
DEVICE: Ureteral Stent
Effect of stent on ureteral peristalsis in stented ureter, before and after stent insertion (approximately 30 minutes), before and after stent insertion (approximately 30 minutes)
Effect of stent on ureteral peristalsis in non-stented ureter, Effect of stent on ureteral peristalsis in non-stented ureter pre and post stenting, 30 minutes (pre and post stenting)
Ureteral stents are commonly used in the field of urology to maintain urinary drainage and are inserted into ureters of patients who suffer from kidney stones, urinary tract infections or cancer. Usually the muscle cells of the ureter contract in a coordinated fashion (peristalsis) in order to provide urinary flow from the kidney into the bladder. By inserting a stent these contractions are disrupted, eventually resulting in a loss of peristalsis. This phenomena is accompanied by swelling of the kidney and pain, which are well-known negative side effects of stents. To avoid stent-related morbidity and improve patients care this issue needs to be investigated further. A first step is to analyse the impact of stents on peristalsis and to possibly bring these results into context with hypothesised molecular mechanisms involved in peristalsis.
