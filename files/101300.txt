A Study of APG-115 in as a Monotherapy or Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanomas or Advanced Solid Tumors
This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of APG-115, an MDM2 inhibitor, either alone or in combination with pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanomas or advanced solid tumors. Our hypothesis is that restoration of the immune response concomitant to inhibition of the MDM2 pathway (which restores p53 functions) may promote cancer cell death, leading to effective anticancer therapy.

DRUG: Phase 1b: APG-115+pembrolizumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Part I is to assess the safety and tolerability of APG-115 by assessing the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of APG-115 in combination with pembrolizumab. End points included: Incidence of DLTs during the first 3 weeks of treatment of each dose cohort; Severity and frequency of any adverse event(s) (AE) and serious adverse event(s) (SAE) based on NCI CTCAE 5.0, 21 days|Recommended Phase II Dose, Part I is aimed to generate data to select the recommended Phase II dose, 21 days|Overall Response Rate, Phase II is to assess overall response rate of APG-115 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab defined as the percentage of subjects with a best overall confirmed complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) at any time as per RECIST 1.1, up to 12 months
This is a phase I/II study to assess the safety and tolerability of APG-115 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, NSCLC, solid tumors with ATM mutation, liposarcoma, urothelial carcinomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)The hypothesis is that the current therapy may improve ORR, progression-free survival, and synergistic effect of APG-115 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in these patients.
