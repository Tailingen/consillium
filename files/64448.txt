Double-bed SPECT/CT for Bone Scintigraphy in Initial Staging of Cancer Patients
Bone scintigraphy is currently a reference test in the initial staging of cancer. Bone scintigraphy historically consists in a planar whole-body scintigraphy (WBS). SPECT/CT has been shown to dramatically reduce the proportion of inconclusive results and increase the specificity of bone scintigraphy. Therefore, in most of nuclear m√©dicine centers, the usual protocol for staging of bone metastases consists in a whole-body planar acquisition followed, if needed, by a targeted SPECT/CT to characterize suspicious or equivocal uptakes seen on WBS. The aim of this study is to assess the incremental diagnostic utility of a systematic double-bed SPECT/CT acquisition for bone scintigraphy in initial staging of cancer patients compared with the conventional "WBS plus single-bed targeted SPECT/CT" strategy.

Images are interpreted by two nuclear medicine physicians in a 3-step procedure and by consensus. Firstly,only WBS planar images are considered. Secondly, a single-bed SPECT/CT chosen based on planar images is used if WBS demonstrated any equivocal or suspicious uptake.

Finally, WBS and double-bed SPECT/CT images are used for interpretation.

A per-lesion, a per-anatomical region and a per-patient analysis is performed. At each step, lesions, regions and diagnostic conclusions are classified using a 3-level scale, as negative for malignancy, equivocal or suspicious for metastasis
