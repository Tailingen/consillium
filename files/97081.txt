Chemoradiation With Durvalumab Followed by Durvalumab Maintenance for Limited Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a single arm Phase II study, in which 4 cycles of chemotherapy (Etoposide and Cisplatin) and durvalumab with thoracic radiotherapy (52.2Gy, 2.1Gy/Fx) start at the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy and durvalumab for limited disease-small cell lung cancer. Four weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiation therapy, patients will receive durvalumab consolidation monotherapy every 4 weeks until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity up to the maximum duration of 2 years since enrollment.
