A Study of BBI608 in Combination With Standard Chemotherapies in Adult Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open label, multi-center, multi-arm, dose-escalation study of BBI608 administered in combination with Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin.

Assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 when administered in combination with standard chemotherapies by performing tumor assessments every 8 weeks, 6 months|Assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 when administered in combination with standard chemotherapies by performing serum CA 19-9 level measurement, Assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 when administered in combination with standard chemotherapies in adult patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma by performing serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level measurement every 4 weeks, 6 months|Assess pharmacokinetic profile of BBI608 when administered in combination with standard chemotherapies, Blood sampling to assess the pharmacokinetic profile (Area under the curve) of BBI608., On Day 1 and Day 15 of the first cycle prior to dosing and 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 5.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 24 hours after first dose|Assess pharmacodynamic activity of BBI608 when administered in combination with standard chemotherapies, Tumor Biopsy to provide information of the biomarkers by histopathology and Cancer Stem Cell assays., During the first 28 days of treatment
This is an open label, multi-center, multi-arm, dose-escalation study of BBI608 administered in combination with either Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin. A study cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in combination with Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin. Combination treatment will continue in 28 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or another discontinuation criterion is met. BBI608 may be continued post-progression if the patient is obtaining potential clinical benefit, in the opinion of the investigator. If administration of Gemcitabine and/or nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin is discontinued due to chemotherapy backbone-related toxicities, the administration of BBI608 can be continued.
