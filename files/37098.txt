IL-2 "SELECT" Tissue Collection Protocol in Patients With Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine which participants with melanoma have a better response to IL-2 and to identify markers that may predict response to IL-2 by collecting participant information (for example; cancer diagnosis and history, prior treatments for cancer, etc.) blood and tumor samples prior to treatment and tumor measurements after treatment.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: IL-2
To determine if DASL subclassification can identify a group of patients with advanced melanoma who are significantly more likely to respond to high dose IL-2 based on therapy than the historical 16% response rate in an unselected patient population, 2 years
To validate the usefulness of serum fibronectin and VEGF levels as negative predictors of response, 2 years|To explore the predictive value of several genetic polymorphisms associated with immune function, 2 years|To explore the predictive value of BRAF^V600E mutational status as a predictor of response and benefit to high dose IL-2, 2 years|To explore the relationship of serum fibronectin and VEGF levels with the molecular signature of immune responsiveness in patients with advanced melanoma receiving high-dose IL-2 in order to identify specific cohorts with dramatic differences in response, 2 years|To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy to those who will benefit the most, 2 years
Original tumor slides will be collected to identify tumor markers that may predict responses to treatment. Blood samples will be obtained prior to treatment with IL-2.
