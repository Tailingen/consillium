The investigators will explain the study to all patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the study period. After signing the informed consent patients will be randomized 1:1 to oral contraceptive 4 mg drospirenone once daily or oral contraceptive 4 mg drospirenone + combination of 200 mg S-adenosylmethionine, 100 mg N-acetylcisteine, 75 mg Alpha lipoid acid and 0,65 mg vitamin B6 (Metionac) twice daily. Patients for whom oral contraceptive is not indicated will be enrolled in third study group of Metionac twice daily. 2 study visits will be carried out, Baseline (Visit 0) and after 6 months therapy (Visit 1).
