Comparison of Postoperative Analgesia Methods in Patients Undergoing Major Intraabdominal Surgery
This study aims to examine the effects of M-TAPA applied for postoperative analgesia in patients who had major intraabdominal surgery on the postoperative pain score, the change in the postoperative total opioid requirement and the side effects.
Abdominal Cancer|Abdomen Disease
OTHER: M-Tapa Block
Opioid Consumption, The postoperative opioid consumption, Postoperative 24 hours
NRS Scores, Numeric Rating Scale score (rating from 1 to 10. 1:no pain to 10: worst pain ever), postoperative 24 hours|the need for rescue analgesia, if NRS\>4: apply rescue analgesia: the total count of rescue analgesia need, postoperative 24 hours|side effects, nausea- vomiting, postoperative 24 hours
The investigators seperated the patients into two groups as M-TAPA applied group and control group.In group M-TAPA, M-TAPA block was performed bilaterally with 20 mL of 0.2% bupivacaine under ultrasound guidance at the end of surgery. No block was performed in the control group. The participants were administered morphine through patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with a bolus dose of 1 mg, 15 min lockout interval. The postoperative pain scores (the numeric rating scores (NRS)), total opiod consumption in the first 48 h, and opioid related side effects were recorded.
