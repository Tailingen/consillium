Re-irradiation With Fractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery Plus Cetuximab in Patients With Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
This trial examines survival and toxicity in previously irradiated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with radiosurgery and cetuximab and to evaluate the acute and late toxicities associated with the above therapy.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Cetuximab|DEVICE: Stereotactic radiosurgery
1-year Local Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression (response as assessed by subjective interpretation of the first PET-CT) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) was defined as greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). If the measurable disease was restricted to a solitary lesion, the protocol specified that neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology and histology., At 1-year|1-year Locoregional Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression (response as assessed by subjective interpretation of the first PET-CT) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) was defined as greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). If the measurable disease was restricted to a solitary lesion, the protocol specified that neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology and histology., At 1-year|1-year Distant Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression (response as assessed by subjective interpretation of the first PET-CT) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) was defined as greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). If the measurable disease was restricted to a solitary lesion, the protocol specified that neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology and histology., At 1-year
1-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression was defined as greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0), taking as reference the smallest sum and longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). If the measurable disease was restricted to a solitary lesion, the protocol specified that neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology and histology., At 1-year|Overall Survival (OS), Number of months patients remaining alive after study treatment., Up to 2 years|Overall Response (OR), Response by number and percentage of patients assessed by subjective interpretation of the first PET-CT. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions: Complete Response(CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Up to 2 years|Changes in Tumor Glucose Metabolism, Glucose metabolism was assessed by FDG PET. FDG uptake reflects the tissue glucose metabolism and is usually high in high-grade tumors and relatively low in low-grade tumors., Up to 24 months / post therapy|Changes in Tumor Hypoxia., Changes in tumor hypoxia (tumor cells deprived of oxygen) as a result of Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) through assessment by pre-and post-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- and fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET., Up to 24 months; before and after treatment|Quality of Life (QoL), Percentage of patients that reported stable and/or improved of quality of life after SBRT as indicated by a quantitative increase or maintenance in overall score. Quality of Life was assessed by longitudinal collection of the University of Washington Quality of Life Registry (UW-QoL-R) survey data, both pre- and post-SBRT. Patients completed the previously validated UW-QoL-R survey at enrollment and again after SBRT. UW-QoL-R measures patient reported QoL in 12 head and neck-specific and 3 global health domains, using a single Likert-scale question with an assigned score of 0 to 100 with 100 representing normal function., Baseline, 6-8 weeks post-treatment; up to 16 months
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide with approximately 500,000 cases worldwide yearly. There were an estimated 39,250 new cases and 11,000 deaths in the United States in 2005 (Jemal 2005, Spitz MR). Despite major improvements in the treatment of SCCHN in recent years which include the introduction of concurrent chemoradiotherapy as an effective primary or postoperative therapy, the five-year survival rate for patients with SCCHN in the United States and other developed countries remains poor as nearly 50-60% of these patients will die as a direct result of recurrent locoregional disease. This study aims to determine the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) of previously irradiated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with radiosurgery and cetuximab and to evaluate the acute and late toxicities associated with the therapy.
