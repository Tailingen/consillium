A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Inavolisib Plus CDK4/6 Inhibitor and Letrozole vs Placebo + CDK4/6i and Letrozole in Participants With Endocrine-Sensitive PIK3CA-Mutated, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of inavolisib plus a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) and letrozole versus placebo plus a CDK4/6i and letrozole in the first-line setting in participants with endocrine-sensitive PIK3CA-mutated hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), advanced breast cancer (ABC).
