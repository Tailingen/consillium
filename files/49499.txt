Assessing the Impact of Dosage Frequency of Propranolol on Sleep Patterns in Patients With Infantile Hemangiomas
The purpose of this study is to assess the baseline sleep pattern disruption for patients starting oral propranolol at the standard BID dosing regimen compared to the control (timolol) group and to determine if there is a significant improvement in the sleep patterns in infants taking oral propranolol on the TID dosing regimen versus the control (timolol) group
