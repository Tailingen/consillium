Radioiodine Dosimetry Protocol for Thyroid Cancer Metastases
The main purpose of the study is to establish a relationship between the administered activity of the radioiodine and absorbed dose in the tumor sites.
Thyroid Carcinoma|Metastatic Sites Lung Bone Nodal
OTHER: SPECT scan
The primary outcome measure is to correlate the predicted dose from the tracer study with the actual absorbed dose measure on the therapeutic scan
The secondary outcomes will be to assess the response at 6 months post therapy in each patient
Study Design - the assessment of patients with multiple tumour sites with metastatic thyroid cancer to correlate the administered activity to absorbed dose. Patients will receive the standard therapy dose of 5.5 GBq as per the hospital policy and there will be no change for the protocol purpose.
