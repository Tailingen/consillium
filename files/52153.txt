The Combination of Fruquintinib, Tislelizumab and Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer(RIFLE)
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical trial.This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in combination with Fruquintinib and Tislelizumab, and to examine the impact of the combination therapy on tumor control, long-term survival and quality of life in patients with Metastatic colorectal cancer.

A total of 68 metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have failed the first-line standard treatment, will be recruited and receive multisite SABR(8-12 Gy, 4-5 times) followed by fruquintinib(5mg, qd) and tislelizumab(200mg, q3w) within two weeks from completion.The overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate(DCR), progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) will be analyzed.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)|DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Objective Response Rate, The percentage of patients with objective response in the non-irradiated metastatic lesions. Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per response evaluation criteria (RECIST v1.1) and the immune related response criteria (iRECIST) after treatment., Up to 2 years
Disease Control Rate, The percentage of patients with disease control in the non-irradiated metastatic lesions. Disease control is defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST after treatment., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response, Defined as the time between PR/CR and subsequent progression disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time from initiation of treatment to PD or death from any cause., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from initiation of treatment to death from any cause., Up to 3 years|Acute Toxicity, The percentage of patients with treatment-related acute toxicities as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0, from treatment initiation until 90 days upon completion of immunotherapy., Up to 2 years
