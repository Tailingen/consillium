Immunogenicity and Safety of the 9-valent Human Papillomavirus (9vHPV) Vaccine in Japanese Boys and Girls (V503-066)
The primary objective of this study is the estimation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 seroconversion at 1 month post last dose (Month 7) following 3 doses and 2 doses of the 9-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccine. No hypothesis will be tested since this study is an estimation-only study.

BIOLOGICAL: 9vHPV vaccine
Seroconversion Percentages for the HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, The percentage of seropositive participants is reported. Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were determined using competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA). Seroconversion was defined as changing serostatus from seronegative at Day 1 to seropositive at 4 weeks post last vaccination., 1 month after final dose (Month 7)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Injection-site Adverse Event (AE), The number of participants with injection-site AEs (erythema/redness, pain and swelling) is reported. An AE any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to 5 days after each vaccination (up to ~6 months)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Systemic Adverse Event, The number of participants with a systemic AE is reported. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to 15 days after each vaccination (up to ~6.5 months)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE), The number of participants with an SAE is reported. An SAE is defined as one that results in death, is life threatening, or requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other important medical event that may require medical intervention., Up to ~Month 30
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) for the HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, The GMT for each HPV serotype is presented. Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were determined using competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA)., 1 month after final dose (Month 7)
