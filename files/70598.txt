A Study of Concurrent Chemoradiation in Combination With or Without PD1 Inhibitor AB122 Adenosine 2a Receptor / Adenosine 2b Receptor Inhibitor AB928 Therapies in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancers
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of chemotherapy and radiation in combination with the investigational study drugs zimberelimab (AB122) and etrumadenant (AB928) in subjects with a locally advances head or neck cancer. The study will also ask how the study drugs change the following:

* The microbiome that lives in the mouth and on the skin
* Immune cells as they respond to a skin wound
* Scarring (fibrosis) caused by radiation

After completing a screening phase, subjects will be assigned to one of three cohorts:

* Cohort 1: Subjects who will receive cisplatin, radiation and zimberelimab followed by zimberelimab only.
* Cohort 2: Subjects who will receive cisplatin, radiation, zimberelimab and etrumadenant followed by zimberelimab and etrumadent.
* Cohort 3: Subjects who will receive cisplatin and radiation followed by an observation period.

All three cohorts will be followed for a 24 months following the conclusion of the chemoradiation.
