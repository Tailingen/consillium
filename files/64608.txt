This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in the weekly (QW) and/or every 3 weeks (Q3W) regimens, safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, PD profile and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of RO7122290 in combination with cibisatamab Q3W after pretreatment with obinutuzumab, in participants with previously treated metastatic, microsatellite-stable colorectal adenocarcinoma with high CEACAM5 expression
