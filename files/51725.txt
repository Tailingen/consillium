A Study of SHR-A1403 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
SHR-A1403 is a humanized IgG2, anti-C-Met monoclonal antibody conjugated to microtubule inhibitor (c-Met ADC).The aim of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-A1403，to define the dose limited toxicity（DLT）and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)，to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SHR-A1403，to assess the antitumor activity of SHR-A1403 in patients with advanced solid tumors preliminarily and to recommend the reasonable dosage regimen of SHR-A1403 for the follow-up clinical trial.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SHR-A1403
The assessment of Treatment-related Adverse Events of SHR-A1403 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, Assessment of the incidence and severity of treatment-related Advanse events will be collected and analysed in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHR-A1403 with the current version of the NCI CTCAE, up to 24 months|DLT, A DLT is considered at AE related to study drug unless there is a clear, well-documented, alternative explanation for the toxicity. Severity of AEs are graded according to the current version of the NCI CTCAE for the study, the occurence of the following drug related AEs during the first cycle(1 to 21days from the first infusion) will be considered a DLT by the investigator and SMC., up to 24 months|MTD, MTD is the highest dose whose toxicity probability was lower or close to the preset target level of toxicity probability (30% in this study) during the DLT observation in the dose escalation of SHR-A1403., up to 24 months

This study is a phase I clinical trial of single arm，open-label，dose escalation with single and multiple doses.The safety,PK and preliminary efficacy of SHR-A1403 were evaluated respectively in the patients with advanced solid tumors that have invalid standard treatment or no standard and effective treatment.SHR-A1403 is administered with intravenous infusion every three weeks (q3w) for a treatment cycle.Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observation will end after 3 weeks from the start of study treatment(21 days). The dose escalation is designed by Modified Toxicity Probability Interval-2 Designs（mTPI-2) and will continue until an MTD or preliminary RP2D is identified. 3 patients are enrolled and observed in the initial dose. After completing the DLT assessment, the next decision of dose escalation will be performed according to the mTPI-2 detailed dose climbing/descending plan. After each decision, 3 other patients will be enrolled in the next phase of dose escalation until the maximum number of subjects specified in the study protocol or the dose escalation terminated by the Safety Monitoring Committee(SMC).

The study consists of 3 periods: Screening Period (up to 14 days before the first dose), Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period (up to 3 months after the last dose of study treatment).

The safety and tolerability of SHR-A1403 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG, and adverse events (AEs) as defined by the current version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 4.03). Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

Response assessment will be performed by the end of Cycle 2 (6 weeks after the first infusion). Subsequently, post-dose tumor response evaluations will be performed every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, then by every 12 weeks thereafter, and at short-term follow up. For subjects who discontinue study treatment, tumor imaging should also be performed at end of therapy. Tumor imaging will be performed for all subjects as feasible (e.g., may not be able to be performed in subjects who withdraw consent or would not be performed in subjects who are lost to follow-up) until documented progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, initiation of a new antitumor therapy, withdrawal of consent, or the occurrence of death or end of study, whichever occurs first.

Blood samples collected pre-dose and post-dose will be analyzed for PK variables. In general, PK data analysis will include, but will not be limited to, time to maximal serum concentration (tmax), maximal serum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from time 0 to Day 21 of Cycle 1 (AUC0-21d), and observed terminal half life (t1/2) in Cycle 1; as well as concentration (average) (Cavg), area under the curve from time 0 to the end of the dosing interval (Day 21) after repeated dosing (AUC0-τ), t1/2, clearance at steady state (CLss), volume of distribution during terminal phase (Vz), and accumulation ratio (Rac) (AUC0-τ/AUC0-21d) for longer-term analyses.

Tumor tissue samples will be collected in pre- and post-treatment for additional exploratory biomarkers. Tumor samples of Pre-treatment (i.e., Screening) could be obtained for c-Met status analysis by IHC through either subject's archived paraffin tissues or fresh (preferred) biopsies, and tumor tissue biopsies of post-treatment at C2D8 , pre- and post-treatments are optional. In addition, blood samples will also be collected in pre- and post-treatment and serum will be prepared for circulatory biomarker (soluble c-Met) analysis by ELISA at screening and C2D8; these blood samples are required in the study.
