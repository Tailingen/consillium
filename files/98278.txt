Management of Malignant Pleural Effusions Using an Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Catheter and Non-Vacuum Collection System
In this study, the investigators will collect data on patients who are using the Aspira system as part of their clinical care for the management of recurrent pleural effusion. Data will be collected on patient demographics, placement of the pleural catheter, palliation of dyspnea, complication rates, and rates of spontaneous pleurodesis.
Malignant Pleural Effusion
DEVICE: Aspira Catheter|PROCEDURE: Ultrasound
Relief of dyspnea as measured using the Visual Analog Scale for Dyspnea (VAS-Dyspnea), * This will be determined based on the difference between the VAS-Dyspnea score on the day of catheter insertion prior to catheter insertion compared with the VAS-Dyspnea score on the 2 week follow up visit
* The scale presents the question "how much shortness of breath are you having right now?" with a straight line. At one end it states "no shortness of breath" and the other end is "shortness of breath as bad as can be". The participant will mark the line on how they feel
* No shortness is breath is 0% score and shortness of breath as bad as can be is 100% score, Through 2 weeks following catheter insertion
Rate of infection, -Defined as the isolation of any bacteria within a pleural fluid specimen drawn for clinical purposes, 1 year|Rate of spontaneous pleurodesis, -Defined as pleural fluid drainage less than 75ml every other day for three consecutive drainage sessions, 1 year
