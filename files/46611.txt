Anesthesia Modality and Oncologic Outcomes in High-Risk NMIBC: A Randomized Trial
To demonstrate the superior efficacy of spinal anesthesia (SA) versus general anesthesia (GA) according to the delay of time to recurrence in high-risk NMIBC patients up to Week 104 after TURBT.

Time to recurrence in high risk NMIBC patients, The time to recurrence is defined as the number of days from TURBT to the day on which the subject presents with gross hematuria, positive urine cytology, all-risk bladder tumor relapse or newly diagnosed upper tract UC with pathological confirmation, radiographically detected tumor metastasis, or cancer-specific death beyond 90 days after diagnosis, whichever occurs first., From date of TURBT (Study Day 0) until documented recurrence or last follow-up, up to 104 weeks
Time to event in high-risk NMIBC patients up to Week 104, An event is defined as a composite variable reflecting the recurrence of a high-risk disease (any high-grade disease, any T1 tumor, multifocal disease, \>3 cm, variant histology, lymphovascular invasion, or CIS), disease progression or metastasis, BCG unresponsiveness, or cancer-specific death, whichever occurs first., From date of TURBT (Study Day 0) until documented recurrence or last follow-up, up to 104 weeks
