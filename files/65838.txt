Diagnostic Accuracy of MRI, DWI MRI, FDG-PET/CT and FEC PET/CT in the Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Surgically Staged Endometrial and Cervical Carcinoma
This is a prospective diagnostic performance study which compares three new imaging methods with the current standard imaging method for the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes.
Surgically Staged Endometrial and Cervical Carcinoma|Cervical Cancer: Invasive Disease, FIGO Stage 1B1 or Higher|Endometrial Cancer|Stage 1A With Myometrial Invasion or Any Higher Stage and Grade 3|Stage 1A With Myometrial Invasion or Any Other Higher Stage and Serous Papillary or Clear Cell Sub-types|Stage II Disease or Above and Any Histology Grade
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Diffusion-weighted MRI|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fluorodeoxyglucose-18-PET/CT|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fluoro-ethyl-coline-PET/CT
Detection rate (DR) vrs false positive rate (FPR) for each of the diagnostic modalities., 36 months
Detection rate (DR) vrs false positive rate (FPR) between each of the diagnostic modalities and within different histological sub-sets., 36 months|Nodal Coverage planning: standard radiotherapy planning vrs DW-MRI, 36 months|Histopathological findings vrs functional imaging findings, 36 months
The aim is to demonstrate whether leading edge molecular imaging technologies (FDG-PET/CT, DW-MRI and Fluoro-ethyl-choline (FEC) PET/CT) can identify lymph node metastases with sufficient accuracy to allow non-invasive lymph node staging in patients with endometrial and cervical carcinoma.
