Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Post Autologous Transplant for Hodgkins Lymphoma
The purpose of this study to evaluate the feasibility of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous transplant
Hodgkin Disease
DRUG: Lenalidomide
To evaluate the feasibility of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma after ASCT, as measured by dropout rate., Will be described by the proportion of patients who drop out of the study for drug-related reasons at or before 12 months, 12 months
Overall survival (OS), Until death (estimated to be 10 years)|Adverse event profile, To establish the adverse event profile of long-term maintenance therapy with lenalidomide in this patient population., From start of treatment through 30 days following completion of treatment|Conversion of partial response/stable disease post-ASCT to complete response., To assess the conversion of partial response/stable disease post-autologous stem cell transplant to complete response., 1 year|Evaluate immune response, To evaluate changes in immune cell number and function and plasma proteins before, during, and after lenalidomide therapy (correlative studies)., Through 30 days after end of treatment|Event-free survival (EFS), Until progression or death (whichever comes first) - estimated to be 10 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Until progression (estimated to be 10 years)
Primary Objectives

-To evaluate the feasibility of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant, as measured by dropout rate.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess overall survival, event free survival, and progression free survival.
* To establish the adverse event profile of long-term maintenance therapy with lenalidomide in this patient population.
* To assess the conversion of partial response/stable disease post-ASCT to complete response.
* To evaluate changes in immune cell number and function and plasma proteins before, during, and after lenalidomide therapy (correlative studies).
