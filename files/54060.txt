A Phase I Trial of Combination Gemcitabine and Nab-Sirolimus in Advanced Leiomyosarcomas or Advanced Soft-Tissue Sarcomas With TSC2 or TSC1 Loss-of-function Mutations or Deletions
To find a recommended dose of gemcitabine and nab-sirolimus that can be given in combination to participants with advanced leiomyosarcomas or soft-tissue sarcomas.
Leiomyosarcoma|Soft-tissue Sarcomas
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-Sirolimus
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

* To estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of gemcitabine and nab-sirolimus combination in patients with advanced leiomyosarcomas or advanced soft-tissue sarcomas with TSC2 or TSC1 loss-of-function mutations or deletions.

Secondary Objectives

* To estimate the rate of toxicity in the combination of gemcitabine and nab-sirolimus in participants with advanced leiomyosarcomas or advanced soft-tissue sarcomas with TSC2 or TSC1 loss-of-function mutations or deletions.
* To describe anti-tumor activity (ORR) by radiographic evaluation (RECIST 1.1)
* To describe Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).

Exploratory Objectives

* To estimate the rate of detection of ctDNA in blood samples of participants with advanced leiomyosarcomas or advanced soft-tissue sarcomas with TSC2 or TSC1 loss-of-function mutations or deletions.
* To describe the relationship of ctDNA changes in blood samples and anti-tumor activity of gemcitabine and nab-sirolimus in patients with advanced leiomyosarcomas or advanced soft-tissue sarcomas with TSC2 or TSC1 loss-of-function mutations or deletions.
* To describe the relationship between baseline expression of pERK1/2 by IHC on tumor samples and anti-tumor activity of gemcitabine and nab-sirolimus in participants with advanced leiomyosarcomas or advanced soft-tissue sarcomas with TSC2 or TSC1 loss-of-function mutations or deletions.
* To describe the relationship between decreased expression of pAKT and pS6 after two cycles of gemcitabine and nab-sirolimus and anti-tumor activity in participants with advanced leiomyosarcomas or advanced soft-tissue sarcomas with TSC2 or TSC1 loss-of-function mutations or deletions.
* To obtain discovery genomic data with RNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing for rare tumors (planned through the MD Anderson Cancer Center Patient Mosaic project). This will be part of a separate IRB-approved consent, which includes RNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing of the tumor and whole genome sequencing of the germline. The Patient Mosaic project takes a patient-centric approach to learn more about different cancer types, with a focus on rare cancers. This approach includes comprehensive molecular profiling including: germline whole genome sequencing, tumor whole genome sequencing, tumor transcriptome sequencing, and gut microbiome sequencing,
