Study of Lanreotide Autogel in Non-functioning Entero-pancreatic Endocrine Tumours
The study will compare the difference between lanreotide Autogel and placebo on progression free survival in patients who have an endocrine tumour in the pancreas or intestines.
Endocrine Tumors
DRUG: lanreotide (Autogel formulation)|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization to first documentation of disease progression, or death. Disease progression centrally assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.0, From randomisation up to the last tumour assessment (scheduled at 96 weeks). Radiological scans were performed every 12 weeks during the first year and every 24 weeks during the second year
Percentage of Patients Alive & Without Disease Progression, Percentage of patients still ongoing (or completing at Week 96) without centrally assessed disease progression or death at Weeks 48 and 96., Week 48 & 96|Pharmacokinetic Profile of Lanreotide, Pharmacokinetic Profile of Lanreotide assessed by mean serum concentration at specified timepoints, Week 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96|Change in the Global Health Status Quality of Life Assessment, Transformed scores from European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire responses (QLQ)-C30. Questionnaire response scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate best possible Quality of Life., Week 12 to Week 96 (last visit)|Percentage of Patients With a Greater Than or Equal to 50% Decrease in Plasma Chromogranin A (CgA) Levels, Week 12 to Week 96 (last visit)|Percentage of Patients Still Alive Based on Available Overall Survival Data, Overall survival defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause. Subjects were followed for overall survival beyond study completion/withdrawal via annual telephone contact until the last subject completed the study., Randomisation to death or last visit, up to 321 weeks
The study will compare the difference between lanreotide Autogel and placebo on progression free survival in patients who have an endocrine tumour in the pancreas or intestines.
