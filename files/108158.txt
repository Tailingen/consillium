Oral Cancer Screening and Education in Hong Kong
This study will be conducted to obtain data on oral cancer risk factors to generate machine learning models with good predictive accuracy for stratifying individuals with high-oral cancer risk and delineating high-risk and low-risk oral lesions. Likewise, this study will seek to provide oral cancer-related health education and training on oral-self-examination for beneficiaries
