The study is intended to compare the detection rate obtained by performing G-EYE® high definition colonoscopy vs. the detection rate obtained by performing ECV high definition colonoscopy.
Adenoma|Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: ENDOCUFF VISION® device|DEVICE: G-EYE® colonoscope
Comparison between adenoma detection rate of G-EYE® colonoscopy and EndoCuff Vision®, G-EYE® colonoscopy adenoma detection rate will be compared to the adenoma detection rate of EndoCuff Vision® colonoscopy. The primary performance measure is the adenoma detection rate (ADR), which is defined as the percentage of subjects with at least one adenoma found, in each of the study groups., June 2021
This is a multicenter, two-arm, randomized, open-label study intended to compare the detection rate obtained by performing G-EYE® high definition colonoscopy vs. the detection rate obtained by performing ECV high definition colonoscopy.
