A Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study to Investigate the Effect of Rifampin on PK of Vemurafenib (Zelboraf)
This open-label, multi-center, three-period, one-sequence study will investigate the effect of rifampin on the PK of vemurafenib in participants with unresectable BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma or other malignant tumor type that harbors a V600-activating mutation of BRAF without acceptable standard treatment options. Eligible participants will have the option to continue treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study GO28399 (NCT01739764).
Malignant Melanoma, Neoplasms
DRUG: Rifampin|DRUG: Vemurafenib
Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration Time Point (AUClast) of Vemurafenib, AUClast is the area under the vemurafenib plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the time of last measured concentration of vemurafenib (Tlast). Area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of the plasma concentration of a drug over time. AUClast is presented in micrograms times (\*) hour per milliliter (mcg\*h/mL)., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time (AUC[0-inf]) of Vemurafenib, AUC(0-inf) is the AUC from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0-inf). AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of a drug over time. AUC(0-inf) is presented in mcg\*h/mL., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Vemurafenib, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma vemurafenib concentration, presented in microgram per milliliter (mcg/mL)., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)
Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of Vemurafenib, Tmax is the time from vemurafenib administration to reach Cmax for vemurafenib., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)|Plasma Elimination Half Life (t1/2) of Vemurafenib, Plasma elimination half-life is the time measured during drug elimination phase for the plasma drug concentration to decrease by one half., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)|Plasma Apparent Clearance (CL/F) of Vemurafenib, Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is removed (metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes) from the blood. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Zero to 168 Hours [AUC(0-168)] of Vemurafenib, AUC(0-168) is the AUC from time zero (pre-dose) to 168 hours (time point for last blood sample collection). AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of a drug over time. AUC(0-168) is presented in mcg\*h/mL., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)|Percent Extrapolated AUC(0-inf) (AUCpeo) of Vemurafenib, The AUCpeo, that is, percent area obtained after extrapolation from Tlast to infinity is calculated by using the formula AUCpeo = 100\*(AUC\[0-inf\] minus AUC\[0-last\])/AUC(0-inf). This parameter provides information about what percentage of the theoretical curve AUC(0-inf) is possible to determine experimentally (AUC0-last)., Predose (0 hour), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30-32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 hours post vemurafenib-dose on Day 1 (Period A) and Day 17 (Period C)
