SY001 Targets Mesothelin in a Single-arm, Dose-increasing Setting in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
Single-arm, dose-increasing setting study of CAR macrophages in Mesothelin overexpressing solid tumors.
Treatment Related Cancer|Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: SY001
Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD will be determined based on DLTs observed during the first 28 days of study treatment., up to 28 days after SY001 infusion.
Objective response rate (ORR), Treatment response was assessed according to the criteria of RECIST 1.1, with PET-CT scans being the primary method used to evaluate tumor progression., 3 months|Time to Peak (Tmax), Changes in the CAR gene copy number after infusion of SY001; time to peak (Tmax) from 0 to 1 month., 1 month|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC), Changes in the CAR gene copy number after infusion of SY001, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 1 month, 1 month|Maximum Plasma Concentration of cytokines (Cmax), Changes in cytokines in peripheral blood after infusion of SY001., 1 month
This study was a single-arm, single-center, dose-increasing design, using the "3+3" approach for dose escalation, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and initial effectiveness of SY001, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics, cytokines and the correlation between the efficacy of SY001.
