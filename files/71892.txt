A Phase Ⅲ Study of Rilvegostomig in Combination With Fluoropyrimidine and Trastuzumab Deruxtecan as the First-line Treatment for HER2-positive Gastric Cancer
This is a Phase Ⅲ, randomized, open-label, Sponsor-blinded, 3-arm, global, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig in combination with fluoropyrimidine and T-DXd (Arm A) compared to trastuzumab, chemotherapy, and pembrolizumab (Arm B) in HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma participants whose tumors express PD L1 CPS ≥ 1. Rilvegostomig in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy will be evaluated in a separate arm (Arm C) to assess the contribution of each component in the experimental arm.

The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig in combination with fluoropyrimidine and T-DXd (Arm A) compared to trastuzumab, chemotherapy, and pembrolizumab (Arm B) in HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma participants whose tumors express PD L1 CPS ≥ 1. Rilvegostomig in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy will be evaluated in a separate arm (Arm C) to assess the contribution of each component in the experimental arm.

This study will be conducted at up to 200-250 sites globally in approximately 25 countries.
