INVINCIBLE TRIAL: Intratumoral INT230-6 in Breast Cancer
This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, parallel design, window of opportunity trial evaluating intratumoral INT230-6 in up to 90 patients with early stage breast cancer. In a 2:1 randomization, patients on the treatment arm will receive intratumoral INT230-6 injections prior to breast surgery.

The study comprises 2 consecutive parts. The first part will be to test safety and feasibility of the dosing procedures. Results from Part I of the study will standardise the optimal dose and frequency of INT230-6 for participants in Part II.

Part I: Open-label 2:1 randomized study of up to 30 patients. Treatment arm patients will be given up to 3 doses of INT230-6 injected weekly prior to breast surgery, at a dose based on longest diameter. The control arm patients receive no treatment.

Part II: Double-blind, 2:1 randomized study of up to an additional 60 patients. The placebo arm includes a saline injection of similar dose and frequency as the treatment arm (up to 2 doses of INT230-6/saline injected weekly prior to breast surgery).
