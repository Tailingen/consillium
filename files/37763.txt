huCART19-IL18 in CD19+ Cancers
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of huCART19-IL18 cells in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ cancers.

This is a Phase I study to assess the safety, tolerability, manufacturing feasibility, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of huCART19-IL18 cells in patients with CD19+ cancers. The study will take place in two parts: an initial Dose-Finding Phase and an Expansion Phase. In the dose-finding phase, the maximum tolerated dose will be determined using a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design within each of the following disease-specific cohorts:

* Cohort A: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Active, Not Recruiting)
* Cohort B: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
* Cohort C: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Active, Not Recruiting)
* The Expansion Phase will evaluate changes in the huCART19-IL18 manufacturing process, using the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) arising out of the dose-finding phase. Cohort D: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
