Evaluation of [18F]Fluoroethyl Triazole Labelled [Tyr3]-Octreotate Analogues for the Imaging of Neuroendocrine Tumours.
Radiolabelled somatostatin analogs are invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (NET). The most common positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers used for the visualisation of NET are radiolabelled somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labelled with \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptides. However, \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptide radiolabelled SSAs have significant limitations in terms of accessibility and low throughput. The team at Imperial College London developed a novel radiotracer, \[18F\]fluoroethyl triazole labelled \[Tyr3\]-Octreotate analogue (\[18F\]-FET-βAG-TOCA), in an attempt to overcome these limitations. The FETONET study was designed to have 3 parts. The FETONET study was designed to have 3 parts. Part A evaluated the biodistribution, dosimetry and safety of \[18F\]FET-βAG-TOCA. Uptake was assessed at multiple time points over a 4 hour period. The data was analysed and an optimal imaging time point determined. Part B of the FETONET study involved the performance of whole body static \[18F\]FET-βAG-TOCA PET-CT imaging, at the optimal time point previously established, within a larger cohort of patients. Part C comprised a prospective non-inferiority study that analysed the \[18F\]FET-βAG-TOCA PET/CT data collected within Part A \& Part B and compared this to standard of care \[Ga68\]Ga-DOTA-peptide PET-CT imaging.

DRUG: [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA
To Determine the Biodistribution of [18F] Following Single I.V Administration of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA Injection in Patients With a Histological Diagnosis of NET., Mean residence time (MRT) was used to characterise the biodistribution of \[18F\]-FET-βAG-TOCA throughout the body. Mean residence time is a pharmacokinetic/uptake parameter that describes the average length of time a radiotracer resides within the body, or a particular organ, before being eliminated. Understanding MRT helps researchers to determine how long a radiotracer remains in the system, which is crucial for drug dosing, therapeutic efficacy, and potential toxicity assessment., Baseline (on day of scan over 4 hours)|To Calculate the Effective Dose (ED) of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA, Effective dose is an estimate of the overall risk of potential harm from exposure to ionising radiation. ED takes into account, the absorbed dose to all organs of the body, the relative harm level of the radiation and the sensitivities of each organ to radiation. ED may help in understanding the risk of potential long-term health effects from radiation exposure, such as the risk of developing cancer later in life. The unit of measure for ED is millisievert per megabecquerel (mSv/MBq), which refers to the effective dose (amount of radiation absorbed by the body) per unit of activity administered., Baseline (on the day of the scan over 4 hours)|To Assess Tumoural Uptake of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA, Standardised uptake value (SUV) is a semiquantitative measurement of radiotracer uptake in tissue. It is a ratio that compares the activity concentration in a specific region of interest to the activity concentration in the whole body. SUVmax is the highest value of the SUV measured within a region of interest., Baseline (on the scan day over 4 hours)
To Compare the Diagnostic Efficacy of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA PET/CT With Standard of Care Somatostatin Receptor Imaging in Patients With a Histological Diagnosis of NET., To determine the clinical utility of \[18F\]-FET-βAG-TOCA-PET/CT compared with standard of care \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptide imaging. Standardised uptake value (SUV) is a semiquantitative measurement of radiotracer uptake in tissue. It is a ratio that compares the activity concentration in a specific region of interest to the activity concentration in the whole body. SUVmax is the highest value of the SUV measured within a region of interest. The median SUVmax of \[18F\]-FET-βAG-TOCA and \[68Ga\]-DOTA-peptide per anatomic region were calculated to determine diagnostic efficacy. Diagnostic efficacy is the ability of a test to correctly identify a disease or condition when it's present and correctly identify the absence of a disease when it's not present., [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT imaging performed within 6 months of the [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA PET/CT scan.|Comparison of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA PET/CT Scan and Central Review (Nuclear Medicine and Radiology Physician Experts) of All Imaging Received., The \[18F\]FET-βAG-TOCA and \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT scans were reviewed by independent imaging experts to obtain an objective inter-reader lesion detection rate. To avoid recall bias, the \[18F\]FET-βAG-TOCA and \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT scans for each subject were reviewed at less 4 weeks apart in random order Percentage of agreement, also known as percent agreement, is a simple method to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), calculating the proportion of times raters agree without considering chance. It's calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the total number of ratings and multiplying by 100, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-peptide PET/CT imaging assessed within 6 months of the [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA PET/CT scan.
Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are tumours derived from enterochromaffin cells, which are characterised by the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) on their surface. These tumours release substances into systemic circulation, resulting in episodic flushing, wheezing, diarrhoea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease. All of these symptoms negatively impact on patients' quality of life. The management of NET is primarily determined by the stage of disease. For patients with localised or limited disease the primary modality of therapy is surgery. Whilst patients with metastatic disease, undergo systemic therapy with palliative intent. Accurate imaging is therefore central to the management of this disease. Whilst computed tomography (CT) is useful in the localisation of NET, nuclear imaging using tumour-specific radiolabelled receptors are considerably more sensitive and specific methods for detecting NET and their metastases. The most commonly used positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers used for the visualisation of NET are radiolabelled somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labelled with \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptides. The \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-peptide radiolabelled SSAs have significant limitations in terms of accessibility and low throughput.
