Radiotherapy to Block Oligoprogression In Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
This study is being done to answer the following question: Can the chance of lung cancer growing or spreading be lowered by adding targeted radiotherapy to the usual combination of drugs?

This study is being done to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for lung cancer. The usual approach is defined as the care most people get for non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: SBRT|OTHER: Second-line standard of care therapy
Progression-free survival, 5.5 years|Overall survival, 5.5 years
Number and severity of adverse events, 5.5 years|Patient-reported adverse events utilizing PRO-CTCAE questionnaire, 5.5 years|Patient-reported quality of life utilizing EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, 5.5 years|Patient-reported quality of life utilizing QLQ-LC-13 questionnaire, 5.5 years|Cost-effectiveness utilizing EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (Canadian sites only), 5.5 years
The usual approach for patients who are not in a study and whose disease has gotten worse is to switch treatments. Sometimes, combinations of drugs or radiotherapy are used. The study doctor can explain which treatment may be best. These treatments can reduce symptoms and may stop the tumour from growing for several months or longer.
