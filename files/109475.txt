Berzosertib Human Mass Balance Study (DDRiver Solid Tumors 208)
The study was conducted in two periods, Period 1 (mass balance) and Period 2 (extension). The purpose of Period 1 of this study was to provide a quantitative characterization of the mass balance, rates and routes of elimination, and metabolic pathways after a single intravenous administration of \[14C\]berzosertib.
