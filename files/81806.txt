Efficacy and Safety of TACE in Combination With ICIs for HCC: a Real-world Study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) .
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: TACE+ICIs|PROCEDURE: TACE
Progression free survival(PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to progression according to mRECIST or death from any cause. When pseudoprogression is suspected by investigator, tumor response will be re-assessed per iRECIST to confirm (also applicable for secondary endpoint of efficacy)., up to approximately 1 years
Overall survival(OS), The OS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to death from any cause., up to approximately 2 years|Time to Progression(TTP), The TTP is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to progression according to mRECIST. When pseudoprogression is suspected by investigator, tumor response will be re-assessed per iRECIST to confirm., up to approximately 1 years|Objective response rate(ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response or partial response per mRECIST., 6-8 week after TACE|Disease control rate(DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to mRECIST., 6-8 week after TACE|Adverse event(AE), Number and degree of the AEs according to CTCAE version 5.0., baseline to end of study (approximately 2 years)
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can induce immunogenic cell death and tumor-specific immune response which results in the release of tumor antigens and transform "cold" tumors with lacking immune effector cells into "hot" tumors with immune effector cells infiltration. This provides a theoretical basis for TACE combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TACE in combination with ICIs in patients with HCC. This real-world study also explores the optimal combined treatment and outcome of HCC patients for providing further information for clinical practice and trials.
