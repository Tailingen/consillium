BLAST MRD AML-1: BLockade of PD-1 Added to Standard Therapy to Target Measurable Residual Disease in Acute Myeloid Leukemia 1- A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Anti-PD-1 Pembrolizumab in Combination With Intensive Chemotherapy as Frontline Therapy in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This phase II trial studies how well cytarabine and idarubicin or daunorubicin with or without pembrolizumab work in treating patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cytarabine, idarubicin, and daunorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving induction chemotherapy with pembrolizumab may work better than induction chemotherapy alone in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

MRD assessment, Will be assessed by duplex sequencing. Library preparation, sequencing, and analysis will be performed with TwinStrand's optimized workflow, and TwinStrand's bioinformatics core will perform all analyses related to assay output., Up to end of consolidation|MRD detection, Will compare duplex sequencing and multiparameter flow cytometry for MRD detection. McNemar's Chi-squared test for paired samples (regular duplex sequencing versus multiparameter flow cytometry and ultra-deep duplex sequencing versus multiparameter flow cytometry) will be used to compare the MRD measures., Up to end of consolidation|Immune cell subsets, Will assess immune cell subsets and correlate with response to combine chemotherapy and anti PD-1 directed therapy using mass cytometry. All data will be analyzed and graphs generated using the DVS Cytobank software (Cytobank). Will also measure CD47 levels on leukemic blasts prior to and after chemotherapy and pembrolizumab application to see whether CD47 expression levels correlate with responders versus non-responders and whether expression levels change at different times of therapy. Statistical analyses of the frequency of CD8 positive (+), CD4+, Foxp3 T regulatory cells (Tregs), CD8+/Foxp3+ Tregs, central memory effector (TCM)/ memory cells that re-express CD45RA (TEMRA), effector memory (TEM)/TEMRA, the percentage of Ki67 and GzmB in PD-1+, Eomes+ CD8 T-cells to compare changes over time from baseline to several time-points will be performed by using mixed effects modeling with a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control for false discovery rates., At time of relapse, assessed up to 3 years|PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, An association of clinical response with the expression of PD-L1 acute myeloid leukemia bone marrow cells will be assessed by a Pearson Chi-square test on a 2 x 2 table of frequencies.

TCR diversity and clonality will be calculated using a software by Adaptive Technologies. T-cell repertoire diversity and clonality will be correlated with clinic-pathological parameters such as response to treatment, survival, and immune infiltrating profile, as well as genomic profiles (total mutation burden, non-synonymous mutation burden, predicted neoantigen burden, clonal mutation burden and clonal predicted neoantigen burden). TCR profile generated from treatment-refractory tumors at the time of disease progression will be compared to data from pre-treatment tumor samples to explore the TCR repertoire evolution of these tumors under therapeutic pressure., Up to time of relapse, assessed up to 3 years|Gut microbiome, Analysis of microbiome communities will be performed in R. Pairwise differences in temporal variability across body sites will be made using Mann-Whitney U test, whereas pairwise differences among response groups performed using Student's t-test. Correlation between microbial/metabolome changes with immune-checkpoint expression and kinetics of immune cell subset recovery and programming in the standard of care and experimental arm will be evaluated. As a marker of mucosal immunity, changes in immune cell content within stool samples in patients that experience colitis or gastrointestinal graft versus host disease will be compared to suitable controls., At time of post-consolidation cycle 1

IV. Assess event free survival (EFS), measured from randomization to failure to achieve CR/CRi, relapse or death from any cause, and relapse free survival (RFS), calculated as the time from first documentation of CR/CRi to either disease relapse or death from any cause.

V. Assess the duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from first CR/CRi to the date of the first documented relapse or death, whichever occurs first) and overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to death from any cause.

VI. Assess safety endpoints including proportion of patients who develop severe toxicity as defined in the protocol.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:
