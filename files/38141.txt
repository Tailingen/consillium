Anesthesia Management of Retroperitoneal Adrenalectomies
This study is a prospective, perioperative evaluation of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in patients undergoing retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies.
Adrenal Tumors
Arterial-alveolar Carbon dioxide Difference, 3 years
Perioperative maximal mean arterial pressure, 3 Years
Due to their underlying disease, patients with adrenal tumors are prone to episodes of hyper- and hypotension. Furthermore, excessive hypercarbia and an increased arterial-alveolar CO2 difference can be seen during these operations.
