PREVALENCE STUDY OF PNH CLONES IN PATIENTS WITH NEOPLASIES
Multicenter prevalence study of the PNH clone (paroxysmal hemoglobinuria nocturnal) in SMP Ph-. This multicenter, prospective study aims to evaluate the presence of an PNH clone in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasia Phcon or without mutations in the 3 main genes involved in this disease (JAK2, MPL, and Cal-R),but showing signs of ongoing hemolysis or particular clinical conditions.

To this end, a multicolor flow cytometric test will be used to evaluate the presence of deficient GPI molecules in granulocytic, monocytic and other cells erythrocyte (flow cytometric test, based on the use of the FLAER reagent in peripheral blood samples).

The study will be conducted at clinical hematology centers in the wider area of the Romagna and at other Italian hematology clinical centers, where and analyzed the peripheral blood samples and clinical data to be included in the study.

The participating centers will carry out the flow cytometric diagnostic test at i own reference laboratories, while the biological material for subsequent studies genetic-molecular type (next generation sequencing) will be analyzed centrally at the Biosciences laboratory of the IRST IRCCS only for cases testing positive for the presence of the PNH clone. Clinical information will be collected for each patient enrolled in the study necessary for the classification of the case and all the laboratory data necessary for achievement of the objectives of the study. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of PNH clones in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm Ph- with or without mutations affecting the 3 main genes involved in this disease (JAK2, MPL, e Cal-R), but showing signs of ongoing hemolysis or particular clinical conditions.

Secondary objectives of the study are:

- correlate the characteristics of the PNH clone with the clinical characteristics and laboratory of myeloproliferative neoplasms Ph- (the presence of phenomena thrombotics, the disease state, the DIPSS prognostic score index, and the state mutational).

· characterize the genomic architecture of the cases using NGS technology positive results
