Study of Pomalidomide, Oral Dexamethasone and Very Low-dose Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Refractory Multiple Myeloma Who Have Received Lenalidomide and Bortezomib
Clinical trial with a pharmaceutical specialty in a new combination.

Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with multiple treatment-resistant or relapsing myeloma who have received at least two previous treatments, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and who have experienced a disease progression in the last treatment.

The combination of Pomalidomide with Cyclophosphamide at metronomic doses (Very low doses) and Dexamethasone is tested in this clinical situation.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide + Cyclophosphamide + Dexamethasone
