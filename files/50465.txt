ZZ06 in Adult Patients With Advanced EGFR Positive Solid Tumor Malignancies
This is a Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ZZ06 in participants with all Adult Patients with Advanced EGFR-positive Solid Tumor Malignancies who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor therapies. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , to characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of ZZ06 as a single agent in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.

PK parameters: Area under curve (AUC), According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., up to 28 weeks|PK parameters: Cmax, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., up to 28 weeks|PK parameters: Clearance rate (CL), According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., up to 28 weeks|PK parameters: t1/2, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., up to 28 weeks|PK parameters: Vz, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., up to 28 weeks
The study will start with an accelerated-titration dose escalation scheme, enrolling 1 patient per cohort for the first 2 cohorts with expansion to 3 patients in the event of Grade â‰¥ 2 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or dose limiting toxicity (DLT) possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug. After the first 2 cohorts, the study will then proceed to a 3+3 design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and expansion to 6 patients in the event of a DLT.
