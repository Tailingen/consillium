CGX1321 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and CGX1321 With Pembrolizumab or Encorafenib + Cetuximab in Subjects With Advanced GI Tumors (Keynote 596)
This is a multicenter, open-label study conducted in two phases: Phase 1 consisting of a CGX1321 Single Agent Dose Escalation Phase in solid tumors, CGX1321 Single Agent Dose Expansion Phase in GI tumors and Roll-over Cohort of CGX1321 and pembrolizumab in subjects who have progressed on single agent CGX1321 and Phase 1b consisting of CGX1321 in combination with pembrolizumab in colorectal tumors and CGX1321 in combination with encorafenib + cetuximab in BRAFV600E mutated colorectal tumors. Both phases are to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity.
Solid Tumors|GI Cancer
DRUG: CGX1321|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: encorafenib|DRUG: cetuximab
Number of participants with adverse events and/or abnormal laboratory values that are related to treatment, safety, 55 months
CGX1321 area under the curve, pharmacokinetics, 30 Days|CGX1321 maximum or peak concentration, pharmacokinetics, 30 Days|CGX1321 minimum or trough concentration, pharmacokinetics, 30 Days|CGX1321 time to maximum concentration, pharmacokinetics, 30 Days|CGX1321 half-life, pharmacokinetics, 30 Days
The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to examine the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

The purpose of the Dose Expansion Phase, Roll-over Cohort and Phase 1b is to continue to examine the safety and confirm the final Phase 2 dose of CGX1321 alone in subjects with advanced GI tumors (Dose Expansion Phase) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of CGX1321 in combination with pembrolizumab (Phase 1b and Roll-over Cohort) and of CGX1321 in combination with encorafenib + cetuxumab (Phase 1b)
