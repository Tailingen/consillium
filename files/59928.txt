Photoacoustic Imaging of the Breast in Patients With Breast Cancer and Healthy Subjects
This trial studies photoacoustic imaging of the breast in patients with breast cancer and healthy subjects. Dense breasts typically reduce the sensitivity of a mammography and also is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Photoacoustic tomography combines light and sound to provide more information about breast tissue.
Breast Carcinoma|Healthy Subject
PROCEDURE: Photoacoustic Imaging
Identify photoacoustic features of breast malignancies, Photoacoustic excitation and detection will be performed, Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To identify photoacoustic features of breast malignancy and treatment response

OUTLINE:

Participants undergo photoacoustic imaging of the breast over 30 minutes. At subject's discretion, imaging may repeat for a total of 10 studies, each in a separate day.
