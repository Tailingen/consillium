Phase I/II Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of BIBF 1120 and Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study aim is to determine maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBF 1120 in HCC (hepatocellular cancer) and compare efficacy of BIBF 1120 to Sorafenib in HCC patients
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: BIBF 1120
Maximum Tolerated Dose in Phase I, The MTD was defined as the highest dose studied for which the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) was 0/3 or less than 2/6 patients during the first treatment course., 4 weeks|Time to Progression (TTP) in Phase II, TTP according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.0 criteria based on central independent review. TTP RECIST 1.0 was defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression according to RECIST 1.0., From randomization until data cut-off (15 July 2014); Up to 1031 days
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity in Phase I, Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity are presented, 4 weeks|Objective Tumour Response by RECIST, Objective RECIST 1.0 tumour response was defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) and was derived from the patient's best objective RECIST 1.0 response based on central independent review.

95% Confidence Interval presented below are computed by Clopper and Pearson method., From randomization until data cut-off (15 July 2014); Up to 1031 days|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS by RECIST 1.0 was defined as the duration from date of randomisation to date of progression or death, whichever occurred earlier, based on central independent review., From randomization until data cut-off (15 July 2014); Up to 1031 days|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the duration from date of randomisation to the date of death., From randomization until data cut-off (15 July 2014); Up to 1031 days
