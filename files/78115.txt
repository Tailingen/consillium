Trial of Nab-sirolimus in Patients With Well-differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs) of the Gastrointestinal Tract, Lung, or Pancreas Who Have Not Received Prior Treatment With mTOR Inhibitors
A Phase 2 multi-center, open-label, single arm study of nab-sirolimus in patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, or pancreas who have not received prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors
Neuroendocrine Tumors|NET|Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor|Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumor|Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumor
DRUG: nab-sirolimus
Efficacy of nab-sirolimus, Objective Response Rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response (BOR) of confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) from the time of study treatment initiation until progression of disease (PD) as determined by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1, 12 Months
Incidence and severity of treatment, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0, 12 Months|Duration of response, Determined for patients with BOR of confirmed CR or PR defined as time from scan first showing response by RECIST v1.1 to PD or death, 12 Months|Disease control rate, BOR of confirmed CR or PR (either of any duration) or stable disease (SD) â‰¥12 weeks by RECISTv1.1 following study treatment initiation, 12 Months|Time to response, Time from first dose of study medication to initial measurement of CR or PR, where CR or PR is subsequently confirmed by RECIST v1.1, 12 Months|Progression-free survival, Number of months from study treatment initiation to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, 12 Months|Overall survival, Number of months from study treatment initiation to the date of death due to any cause, 24 Months
This is a prospective phase 2 single arm, open-label, multi-institutional study to determine the efficacy and safety prospective of nab-sirolimus and patients with functional or non-functional, well-differentiated, locally advanced unresectable in metastatic NETs of the GI tract, lung, or pancreas.
