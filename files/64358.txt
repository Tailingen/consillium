Nitrates and IL-8 in Barrett's Esophagus
The purpose of this study is to determine if nitrates and IL-8 (which are found in food and throughout the body regulating stomach acidity) play a role in Barrett's Esophagus and/or Esophageal Adenocarcinoma severity and if screening for these biomarkers can help predict patients that are more at risk for developing worsening disease.
