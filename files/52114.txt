Lung Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab Injection|RADIATION: chest radiation|DRUG: concurrent chemotherapy
PFS, Progression-free survival in patients, 3-year
OS, overall survival in patients, 3-year|response rate, 3-year|rate of grade 3-4 radiation esophagitis, 3-year|rate of grade 3-4 radiation pneumonitis, 3-year
This prospective phase II study is determined to explore the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy and bevacizumab maintenance therapy for oligometastatic lung adenocarcinoma with negative driver genes.

The patients receive SBRT radiotherapy for the primary (if any) and metastatic lesions or divided radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy.Bevacizumab maintenance therapy starts 1-2 months later after the chemotherapy.The recommended dose for intravenous infusion is 15mg/kg body weight, and the drug is given every 3 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs. Toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0.
