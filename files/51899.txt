A Phase 3 Study of Pacritinib in Patients with Primary Myelofibrosis, Post Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis, or Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis
This study (study ID PAC203 North America; PAC303 ex-North America) is evaluating 200 mg BID of pacritinib compared to physician's choice (P/C) therapy in patients with MF and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count \<50,000/μL). Approximately 399 patients in total will be enrolled, randomized 2:1 to either pacritinib (approximately 266 patients) or to P/C therapy (approximately 133 patients)

Spleen volume, To compare the efficacy of pacritinib with that of physician's choice (P/C) therapy, as assessed by the proportion of patients achieving a ≥35% spleen volume reduction (SVR) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, preferred) or computed tomography (CT) scans, From baseline at 24 weeks|Total Symptom Score (TSS) (excluding tiredness), To compare the efficacy of pacritinib compared to P/C therapy, as assessed by the proportion of patients achieving a ≥50% reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS). The TSS is the sum of the individual symptom scores for tiredness, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, and pain under ribs on the left side. Symptoms are ranked 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable), From baseline at Week 24

* cardiovascular death, defined as death due to acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, death due to cardiovascular procedures, death due to cardiovascular hemorrhage, or death due to peripheral artery disease
* non-fatal myocardial infarction
* non-fatal stroke of any classification, including reversible focal neurological defects with imaging evidence of a new cerebral lesion consistent with ischemia or hemorrhage, Baseline to up to 24 Weeks
The study is a randomized, controlled phase 3 study comparing the efficacy of pacritinib with P/C therapy in patients with PMF, PPV-MF, or PET-MF (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System \[DIPSS\] risk score of Intermediate-1 to High-Risk), who have had had no or limited exposure to any JAK2 inhibitor or are JAK2 inhibitor-naive, and who have severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count \<50,000/µL). This study was designed to use the pacritinib 200 mg BID dose, which was determined to be the optimal dose based on dose- and exposure-response analyses conducted using all available data, including the dosing data from the previous portion of this study. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive pacritinib 200 mg BID or the P/C therapy (limited to single drugs from the following list: corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, danazol, or low-dose ruxolitinib). The proposed P/C regimen for a patient must be selected prior to randomization. Randomization will be stratified by prior JAK2 inhibitor therapy (yes/no) and P/C therapy selected prior to randomization. Prior JAK2 inhibitor therapy will be defined as any duration of treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor, such as ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or momelotinib. To be eligible, patients are not allowed to have been treated with more than one JAK2 inhibitor. Assigned treatment will continue until the patient experiences progressive disease or intolerable AEs, withdraws consent, or initiates new MF-directed therapy. No study treatment crossover will be allowed at any time. All patients should complete all visit procedures through Week 24, including patients who stop treatment or have protocol-defined progressive disease prior to Week 24, unless the patient withdraws consent for study procedures, dies, undergoes splenic irradiation or splenectomy, initiates any non-protocol-directed anti-MF treatment, or the study is terminated. In addition to the above, patients will be considered to have discontinued treatment if pacritinib or P/C therapy is held for \>28 consecutive days due to treatment toxicity, or if treatment is discontinued for lack of efficacy, or at the request of the principal investigator or the patient. Following the Week 24 assessment, patients who are benefiting from therapy will be allowed to continue receiving the assigned treatment (pacritinib or P/C) until the patient experiences progressive disease, intolerable AEs, withdraws consent, or initiates new MF-directed therapy. All randomized patients will be followed for survival for 2.5 years from the date of randomization unless consent for follow-up is withdrawn.
