Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented relapse of the disease or death due to any cause. Relapse was based on investigator assessment and was assigned only if: It was documented according to Cheson guidelines by an objective radiological assessment method; It was documented by a biopsy proven lymphoma including new or recurrent bone marrow involvement; A new anticancer therapy for lymphoma started with subsequent confirmation of the relapse within 4 weeks of the start of this anticancer therapy, From date of randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented recurrence of the disease, or death due to any cause and up to 6 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of the last contact., From date of randomization to date of death due to any cause up to around 7 years|Lymphoma-specific Survival (LSS), LSS was defined as time from randomization to death as a result of lymphoma., From randomization to death documented as a result of lymphoma up to 7 years
