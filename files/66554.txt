A Study of SB-743921 in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study was an early-phase trial arranged into two phases. The Phase I portion was a dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and to identify the maximum tolerated dose of SB-743921 in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Hodgkin Lymphoma. Phase II was intended to assess the activity, safety and tolerability of SB-743921 in patients with Indolent and Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas exclusively. The Phase II portion of the study was not initiated.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Hodgkin's Disease
DRUG: SB-743921|DRUG: SB-743921
Phase 1: Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) First Without and Then With Administration of Prophylactic G-CSF., Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was determined by testing increasing doses in cohorts with at least 3 patients each. MTD reflects the highest dose of drug that did not cause dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., 28 days
