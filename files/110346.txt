Irreversible Electroporation(IRE) For Lung Neoplasms Accompanied by Respiratory Function Insufficiency
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for Lung Neoplasms accompanied by Respiratory Function Insufficiency.
Lung Neoplasms Accompanied by Respiratory Function Insufficiency
PROCEDURE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE)|DEVICE: NanoKnife
Number of participants with Adverse events, 6 month
Percentage of lesions that show no sign of recurrence 12 months after IRE, 12 months|A minimum and maximum range of voltage for safe and effective IRE, A minimum and maximum range of voltage for safe and effective IRE will be analyzed for optimal choice., 3 months|Progress free disease (PFS), A minimum and maximum range of voltage for safe and effective IRE will be analyzed for optimal choice., 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Patients will be followed for 36 months after IRE for OS analyzed., 36 months
By enrolling patients with Lung Neoplasms accompanied by Respiratory Function Insufficiency adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of percutaneous IRE for Lung Neoplasms accompanied by Respiratory Function Insufficiency.
