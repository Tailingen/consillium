Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Rechallenge After Immune-related Adverse Events
Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have proved effective in treating many cancers, patients receiving ICIs may experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Little evidence exists on the safety of resuming these treatments after an irAE.

Our objective was to investigate the safety of ICI rechallenge after an irAE using the WHO pharmacovigilance database
Cancer
DRUG: Immune Checkpoint Modulator
Rate of occurrence of second immune-related adverse events (irAEs), percentage of cases experiencing a second irAE among the rechallenged cases, Number of case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports, through study completion (an average of 2 months).
