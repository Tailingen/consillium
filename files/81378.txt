Evaluation of Denosumab in Combination With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this project is to test the addition of a new treatment called denosumab to standard immunotherapies for patients with metastatic melanoma. Denosumab has been used for many years to help treat cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer, but it is not currently used in melanoma. We hope the addition of denosumab to current melanoma therapies will make these treatments work better without adding to the side effects.

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread).

Study details: Nivolumab and ipilimumab are approved treatments for advanced melanoma in Australia and overseas. Patients with metastatic melanoma, who are not enrolled in a study, are commonly prescribed nivolumab alone or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab as standard care. However, there is limited information on the effectiveness and safety of these treatments in combination with denosumab. Recent melanoma research in animal models has shown that denosumab can make immunotherapies such as ipilimumab and nivolumab work better. Because denosumab has been used in patients with breast and prostate cancer for a long time and is safe, we now want to test the benefits and safety of adding denosumab to immunotherapies in this study.

Median Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time from enrolment to date of disease progression as measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria, Approximately 5 years|Occurrence of Grade 3 and 4 Selected Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs) of interest, Defined as all irAEs except skin-related toxicity not requiring systemic treatment and laboratory abnormalities not requiring intervention or cessation of treatment with the exception of liver dysfunction and grade 3 thrombocytopenia of greater than 7 days; using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Approximately 2 years
Rate of Grade 3 and 4 irAEs, Description of all adverse events by type, frequency and severity using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Approximately 2 years|Best Overall Response According to RECIST 1.1, Disease assessment by CT using RECIST v1.1 will be undertaken at Baseline and every 8 weeks (from Week 9) until Week 49 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression., Approximately 3 years|Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time from enrolment to date of disease progression as measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Assessed at 6 and 12 months post enrolment., Approximately 5 years|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from enrolment to the time of death. Median overall survival will be assessed at 12 and 24 months post enrolment., Approximately 5 years|Toxicity Profiles of the Checkpoint-Denosumab Combinations, Description of all adverse events by type, frequency and severity using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Approximately 2 years|Occurrence of Treatment Discontinuation Due to Toxicity, Number of patients who withdraw from the study due to intolerable adverse reactions, Approximately 2 years
To assess the local tumour and systemic immunological responses to both combination treatment regimens (exploratory objective), As an exploratory objective, this will be done to comprehensively characterise lymphocyte populations residing within the tumour bed and peripheral blood prior to, during and following treatment with RANKL and immune checkpoint inhibition., Approximately 2 years|To evaluate early FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose) PET (positron emission tomography) response as a predictor of clinical benefit, As an exploratory objective, this will be done to assess the predictive and prognostic significance of early changes in FDG-PET to immune checkpoint inhibitors and denosumab in conjunction with conventional CT imaging., Approximately 2 years|To evaluate longitudinal cellular and molecular changes in archival tumour tissue, fresh tumour biopsies and circulating biomarkers to define mechanisms of activity and resistance, As an exploratory objective, these studies will focus on the mechanism of action of the combination, putative determinants of response and resistance and monitoring of tumour kinetics., Approximately 3 years|To correlate the makeup and changes in the microbiome with treatment response., As an exploratory objective, this is an optional assessment that will allow the collection of samples which will be used to assess and characterise the microbiome in order to better understand determinants of sensitivity and resistance to the study treatments., Approximately 2 years
