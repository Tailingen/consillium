Myeloma XIV: Frailty-adjusted Therapy in Transplant Non-Eligible Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
Trial Title:

FiTNEss (UK-MRA Myeloma XIV) - Frailty-adjusted therapy in Transplant Non-Eligible patients with newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

Overview:

A phase III, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial to compare standard (reactive) and frailty-adjusted (adaptive) induction therapy delivery with the novel triplet ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD), and to compare maintenance lenalidomide (R) to lenalidomide plus ixazomib (R+I) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not suitable for a stem cell transplant.

All participants receive induction treatment with ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone and are randomised on a 1:1 basis at trial entry to the use of frailty score-adjusted up-front dose reductions vs. standard up-front dosing followed by toxicity dependent reactive dose-modifications during therapy. Following 12 cycles of induction treatment participants alive and progression-free undergo a second randomisation on a 1:1 basis to maintenance treatment with lenalidomide plus placebo versus lenalidomide plus ixazomib. Participants and their treating physicians will be blinded to maintenance allocation.

Participant population:

* Newly diagnosed as having Multiple Myeloma (MM) according to the updated IMWG diagnostic criteria 2014 (see Appendix 1 for criteria)
* Not eligible for stem cell transplant
* Aged at least 18 years
* Able to provide written informed consent

Number of participants:

740 participants will be entered into the trial at Randomisation 1 (R1), with 478 participants at Randomisation 2 (R2).

Objectives:

The primary objectives of this study are to determine:

* Early treatment cessation (within 60 days of randomisation) for standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing
* Progression-free survival (PFS, from maintenance randomisation) for lenalidomide + placebo (R) versus lenalidomide + ixazomib (R+I)

The secondary objectives of this study are to assess progression-free survival (PFS) for standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing reductions, time to progression, time to 2nd PFS event (PFS2), overall survival (OS), survival after progression, deaths within 12 months of R1, overall response rate (ORR), attainment of ≥VGPR, attainment of MRD negativity, duration of response, time to improved response, time to next treatment, treatment compliance and total amount of therapy delivered, toxicity \& safety including the incidence of SPMs, Quality of Life (QoL), cost effectiveness of standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing of IRD and cost-effectiveness of R + I versus R.

Exploratory objectives are prospective validation of a novel frailty risk score (UK-MRA Myeloma Risk Profile - MRP), usefulness of Karnofsky Performance Status (PS), and association of molecular subgroups with response, PFS and OS.

The total amount of therapy delivered will be first defined as the number of induction and maintenance cycles which the participant received. This may be extended to consider the percentage of protocol dose delivered. For each treatment (ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) this will be defined as the total dose received in a cycle compared to the total dose the participant should have received in the cycle without modifications, averaged across all cycles of treatment., Number of induction and maintenance cycles a participant received (each cycle of induction or maintenance is 28 days), until disease progression, up to 120 months|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (Toxicity and safety, including incidence of second malignancies), Toxicity \& safety, including incidence of second malignancies Toxicity and safety will be reported based on the adverse events, as graded by CTCAE V5 and determined by routine clinical assessments at each centre. The number of SAEs will be reported according to MedDRA System Organ Class. All second primary malignancies will be reported based on information collected on the Case Report Form., Baseline, end of each induction cycle (each induction cycle is 28 days), end of each maintenance cycle (each maintenance cycle is 28 days), until disease progression, up to 120 months|EORTC QLQ-C30_questionnaire, European Organization for the Research \& Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is used to measure patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) at R1, after cycles 2, 4, 6 \& 12 of induction, and after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance (all cycles are 28 days).

The QLQ-C30 comprises multi-item scales \& single-item measures: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea \& vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, \& 6 single items assessing additional symptoms (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation \& diarrhoea). All scales \& single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level: a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high quality of life, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems., Randomisation 1; after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days); after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days)|EORTC QLQ-MY20_questionnaire, The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20) is used to measure patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) at Randomisation 1, after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days), and after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days).

The EORTC QLQ-MY20 comprises 20 questions that address four myeloma-specific QoL domains: Disease Symptoms, Side Effects of Treatment, Future Perspectives, and Body Image. Disease Symptoms, Side Effects of Treatment, and Future Perspectives are all multi-item scales, and Body Image is a single-item scale. Domain scores are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0-100. A high score for Disease Symptoms and Side Effects of Treatment represents a high level of symptomatology or problems, whereas a high score for Future Perspective and Body Image represents better outcomes., Randomisation 1; after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days); after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days)|EQ-5D-3L_questionnaire, The EuroQol 5 Dimension 3 Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) will be used to measure participant-assessed quality of life at Randomisation 1, after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days), and after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days).

The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state., Randomisation 1; after cycles 2, 4, 6 and 12 of induction treatment (each induction cycle is 28 days); after cycles 6 and 12 of maintenance treatment (each maintenance cycle is 28 days)
Novel frailty risk score (UK-MRA MRP)_composite measure, The prospective validation of a novel frailty risk score (UK Myeloma Research Alliance Myeloma Risk Profile (UK-MRA MRP)) will use the following measurements at baseline to categorise individuals into fit, intermediate-fitness and frail using the UK-MRA MRP:

* C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
* Age,
* Performance status on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (scoring from 0 to 5, with 0 - fully active and 5 = dead) and
* Score on Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma scale (ISS). The ISS score categorises newly-diagnosed myeloma patients into three groups (I, II, or III) depending on expected prognosis/overall survival based on measurements of serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum albumin., Through study completion, up to 120 months|Usefulness of Karnofsky PS_composite measure, The Karnofsky Performance Status will be contrasted with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status to consider whether it can appropriately measure the performance status of patients with multiple myeloma., Through study completion, up to 120 months
