ZTE MRI Pulse Sequence Use for Visualization of Bone Cement, Breast Biopsy Markers
This study is being done to determine if a clinically available MRI sequence called ZTE imaging better visualizes breast biopsy markers made of bone cement compared to the currently used breast biopsy markers made of metal.
Breast Carcinoma
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Bone cement marker (BCM) images compared to conventional images, Will be assessed using zero echo-time (ZTE) and standard breast biopsy pulse sequences. Two radiologists will interpret images, evaluating the pulse sequences and ZTE images for marker conspicuity. Each sequence will receive a score for conspicuity ranging from 0 to 2. A score of 0 indicates 'not seen, 1 'maybe seen,' and 2 'well seen.', Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To demonstrate that clinically available ZTE imaging allows for better visualization of bone cement breast biopsy markers when compared to conventional breast biopsy markers and pulse sequences.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Participants undergo standard of care MRI breast imaging with conventional or bone cement breast biopsy markers and complete a questionnaire on study.
