Due to the hidden onset and rapid progression of pancreatic cancer, most patients are already locally advanced or have distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis and lose the opportunity for surgery. Even among operable patients, about 50% will have recurrence and metastasis one year after surgery. Therefore, more and more evidence supports neoadjuvant therapy for patients with high risk factors for resectable pancreatic cancer, and conversion therapy followed by surgery for patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer.
