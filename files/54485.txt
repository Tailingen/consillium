Selecting Patients Who May Benefit From Immunotherapy by Tissue-based Biomarkers.
We have established a machine learning model based on effective TIIC signature which could select GC patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.

The current study aims to enroll 300 GC patients as a validation cohort to vertify the accuracy of TIIC signature in predicting immunotherapy efficacy
Gastric Cancer Patients Received Immunotherapy
