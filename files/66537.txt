FOG-001 in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if FOG-001 is safe and effective in participants with locally advanced or metastatic cancer.

This is a FIH, Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of FOG-001 as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors likely or known to have a Wnt pathway activating mutation (WPAM).
