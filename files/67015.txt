A Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of the Effects Rabeprazole and Rifampin on Dabrafenib in Subjects With BRAF V600 Mutation Positive Tumors
The study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) and rabeprazole (a pH elevating agent) on the PK of dabrafenib (a CYP3A4/CYP2C8 substrate). The study will be conducted in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. Data collected from this study will be used to inform recommendations regarding use of concomitant medications with dabrafenib and future clinical pharmacologic evaluation of dabrafenib.
Cancer
