Effects of Chemotherapy on the Brain in Women With Newly Diagnosed Early-Stage Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Gathering information over time from laboratory tests, imaging scans, and assessment tests may help doctors learn more about the side effects of chemotherapy and plan the best treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effects of chemotherapy on the brain in women with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To prospectively evaluate the acute (1 month after chemotherapy) and relatively long-term (18 months after chemotherapy) effects of standard-dose chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibition on brain function using positron emission tomography (PET) and the glucose metabolism tracer fludeoxyglucose F 18 in women with newly diagnosed, early stage breast cancer.

Secondary

* To evaluate the acute and relatively long-term effects of chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy on MRI measurements of hippocampal volume, cortical grey matter volume, white matter signal hyperintensities, ventricular volume, and whole brain volume in these patients.
* To evaluate the acute and relatively long-term effects of chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibition on cognitive function in these patients.
* To explore the characteristics of these patients that renders them more vulnerable to chemotherapy and/or estrogen suppression-induced cognitive decline.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to planned adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy vs hormonal therapy vs chemotherapy vs no therapy) and the hormone receptor status (positive vs negative).

Patients (groups A-C) undergo bioavailable estradiol measurements, PET scans, and MRI scans at baseline and 1 and 18 months after treatment. Patients also undergo cognitive, neuropsychological, sociodemographic, and quality of life assessments using a battery of study tests and questionnaires at baseline and at 1, 9, and 18 months after treatment. Group D participants (controls) undergo the same testing at equivalent intervals.
