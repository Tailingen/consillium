A Study of DBPR112 in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer and EGFR Mutated Lung Cancer
The study is being performed to assess the MTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of DBPR112 in patients with head and neck cancer and EGFR mutated lung cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer|NSCLC
DRUG: DBPR112
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), up to 22 months|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC from 0 to infinity), For Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2, Day 1, predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs (i.e. predose on Day 2).Predose samples on Cycle 1 Days 8, 15, 22, and 28, Cycle 2 Day 15, and Cycle3-6 Days 1 and 15.|Observed Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), For Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2, Day 1, predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs (i.e. predose on Day 2).Predose samples on Cycle 1 Days 8, 15, 22, and 28, Cycle 2 Day 15, and Cycle3-6 Days 1 and 15.|Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (tmax), For Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2, Day 1, predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs (i.e. predose on Day 2).Predose samples on Cycle 1 Days 8, 15, 22, and 28, Cycle 2 Day 15, and Cycle3-6 Days 1 and 15.
Incidence and intensity of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events as a measure of safety, Adverse events were collected from the time of the first dose of investigational product until 30 days after the last dose of investigational product administration.|Preliminary antitumor activity of DBPR112 in patients with solid tumors, The tumor responses were collected from the time of the first dose of investigational product until 30 days after the last dose of investigational product administration.
This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human study to determine the MTD and RP2D of DBPR112 and to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of DBPR112 in Asian patients. Patients with non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor or in patients with squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN) who have progressed following prior standard therapy will be selected. Approximately 24 to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study as out patients/inpatients, in 2 study centers in Taiwan.
