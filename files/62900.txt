Epacadostat, Pembrolizumab, and CRS-207, With or Without CY/GVAX Pancreas in Patients With Metastatic Pancreas Cancer
This study will enroll patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer and have progressed on prior chemotherapy.

Part 1 (dose escalation) participants will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/cyclophosphamide(CY)/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207, Part 1X (dose escalation) participants will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207. Part 2X (dose expansion) participants will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207.

The primary objectives of this study are to determine the recommended dose of epacadostat in this combination and assess survival of subjects in both treatment groups.
