PRO for Fighting FT in Ovarian Cancer
Non-profit, multicenter, prospective, observational study. This study aims to evaluate whether the articulated treatment algorithm that is now possible for OC patients does produce tangible changes of financial distress over the time and whether the determinants of financial distress change their relative weight over the time.

Financial Toxicity "PROFFIT financial score", PROFFIT financial score is defined according to items 1-7 of the PROFFIT questionnaire. It will be calculated according to published rules (Riva S, et al. BMJ Open. 2019 Sep;9(9):e031485)., baseline visit, at the end of every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 21 or 28 days depending of type of therapy), and at time of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 up to 36 months
Financial toxicity "Determinants", The baseline score for determinants (items 8-16) and their change during treatment, baseline visit, at the end of every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 21 or 28 days depending of type of therapy), and at time of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 up to 36 months.|Changes of PROFFIT financial score, Changes of PROFFIT financial score (items 1-7) from baseline during treatment, will be assessed as secondary endpoints., baseline visit, at the end of every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 21 or 28 days depending of type of therapy), and at time of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 up to 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL), QoL will be assessed as secondary endpoint using selected QoL items (items 29-30 of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, items 55-56 of the EORTC QLQ-OV28 questionnaire) and selected symptoms of the PRO-CTCAE library., baseline visit, at the end of every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 21 or 28 days depending of type of therapy), and at time of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 up to 36 months
PROFFIT questionnaire is an Italian instrument for evaluating FT in cancer patients in the Italian healthcare context. It includes 16 total items, 7 measuring FT (defining the PROFFIT financial score) and 9 measuring possible determinants of FT.The primary aim of the study is to compare PROFFIT financial score (items 1-7 measuring the financial distress) across different lines of treatment for OC patients undergoing anticancer medical treatment. Primary comparison will be based on PROFFIT questionnaire fulfilled at baseline, before starting each line of treatment.

In addition, among secondary aims of this study, we aim to verify whether FT is associated with quality of life response (items 29-30 of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and items 55-56 of the EORTC QLQ-OV28 questionnaire), with patient-self reporting toxicity of treatments (selected symptoms of the PRO-CTCAE library response), and with overall survival.
