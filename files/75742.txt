A Phase 1, Single-arm, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of JWATM204 as T Cell-targeted Immunotherapy in the Treatment Amongst Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of infused autologous GPC3-directed CAR-T in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma refractory to prior systematic treatments.
Liver Carcinoma|Hepatic Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-GPC3 T cells
Rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event that occurred within 28 days after JWATM204 infusion that met any of the following criteria. Any grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicity associated with JWATM204 that has not resolved to ≤ grade 2 within 7 days, excluding clinically insignificant abnormalities in laboratory indicators Hematologic toxicity Grade ≥3 anaphylaxis Grade ≥3 infection did not resolve to grade ≤2 within 7 days after anti-infective treatment. ≥ grade 3 autoimmune toxicity during treatment Grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during treatment that did not resolve to grade ≤2 within 72 hours. Grade ≥3 CAR-T cell-associated encephalopathy syndrome/immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (CRES/ICANS) that did not resolve to grade ≤2 within 72 hours. Grade 5 events of any nonmalignant cause., 28 days|Rate and severity of adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy can be determined., 2 years|Rate and severity of clinically-significant abnormalities in laboratory testings, Clinically-significant abnormalities in laboratory testings., 2 years
Copy number of the vector transgene of JWATM204 in peripheral blood, The pharmacokinetic parameters of JWATM204 will be evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for the copy number of the vector transgene of JWATM204 in peripheral blood to evaluate T-cell expansion and persistence., 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume has reached a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit, including complete response and partial response patients., 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents., 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as time from randomisation to first progression by investigator assessment using revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), 2 years|Overal survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause., 2 years
