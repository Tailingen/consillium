Personalized Escalation of Consolidation Treatment Following Chemoradiotherapy and Immunotherapy in Stage III NSCLC in Stage III NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to test whether or not number of circulating cancer cells detected in the blood can be decreased the by combining the standard treatment (durvalumab) with Tremelimumab and additional chemotherapy
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|NSCLC, Stage III|Nsclc
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DEVICE: AVENIO ctDNA Surveillance Kit|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Change in ctDNA Level Following Chemotherapy, Participants in Cohort 1 MRD+ will be assessed for ctDNA levels at baseline and end of treatment, expected to be 4 cycles of 3 weeks per cycle (defined as ctDNA evaluable set or ctDES). The outcome will be assessed as the number of participants with a ≥ 3 fold decrease in ctDNA level, a number without dispersion., 12 weeks
Presence of Detectable ctDNA Following Chemotherapy, Participants in Cohort 1 MRD+ will be assessed for ctDNA levels at baseline and end of treatment, expected to be 4 cycles of 3 weeks per cycle. The outcome will be assessed as the number of participants with or without detectable ctDNA, a number without dispersion., 12 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the period a participant remains alive after study registration until death due to any cause. Participants lost to follow up will be censored at last known date alive. The outcome will be reported as the number of participants in both cohorts remaining alive after 2 years, a number without dispersion., 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the period a participant remains alive without disease progression after study registration. Tumor status is assessed per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) CT; and/or X rays. Participants lost to follow up will be censored at last known date alive. The outcome will be reported as the number of participants in both cohorts remaining alive without progression after 2 years, a number without dispersion.

* Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all lesions
* Partial Response (PR) = ≥30% decrease in the sum of the lesion diameters
* Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR
* Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of lesion diameters, and/or the appearance of 1+ new lesion(s)
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria, 2 years|Durvalumab and Tremelimumab related Adverse Events (Cohort 1 MRD+ only), Adverse events will be collected for participants of Cohort 1 (MRD+) who initiate treatment with durvalumab and tremelimumab through 930 days after the last dose of durvalumab. AE grade per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5) criteria and relationship to study treatment will be assessed. The outcome will be reported as the number of durvalumab and tremelimumab related adverse events by grade that Cohort 1 MRD+ participants experienced., 13 months
Primary objective is to measure the change in the levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in Cohort 1 (MRD+) due to the addition of Tremelimumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy in subjects with stage III unresectable disease with positive DNA treated with consolidation chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Secondary Objectives:

To determine the proportion of subjects in Cohort 1 MRD+ for whom ctDNA becomes undetectable after adding chemotherapy and tremelimumab to consolidation durvalumab

To describe compare overall survival (OS) of subjects with baseline detectable ctDNA (Cohort 1 MRD+) vs baseline undetectable ctDNA (Cohort 2 MRD ) ·To compare progression free survival (PFS) between subjects with baseline detectable (Cohort 1 MRD+) vs baseline undetectable ctDNA (Cohort 2 MRD )
