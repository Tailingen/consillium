Azacitidine and Chimerism in MDS or AML Patients After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant
Previous studies provide a rationale for administration of AZA after allo SCT for decreasing chimerism. The investigators hypothesize that azacitidine can be well tolerated after SCT and help decrease rate of decreasing donor chimerism and hence decrease relapse without increasing GVHD
Myeloid Malignancy
DRUG: azacitidine
The rate of increase or stable donor chimerism, To determine the rate of increase or stable donor chimerism when using low dose azacitidine post allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with documented low or decreasing donor chimerism, one year
