Pilot Study of Crenolanib Combined With Standard Salvage Chemotherapy in Subjects With R/R AML
The proposed study is designed to combine crenolanib with standard salvage chemotherapy to treat patients with R/R AML irrespective the FLT3 status.
Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Crenolanib|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: G-CSF|DRUG: Idarubicin
Clinical Response to Crenolanib With Standard Salvage Chemotherapy, To determine the response rate to crenolanib. Complete remission (CR) response criteria include a post-baseline bone marrow (BM) biopsy or aspiration % blasts \<5%, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1×10\^9/L and platelet count \>100×10\^9/L. CRi response included all CR criteria met, except participant did not have either platelet recovery or ANC recovery. CRh response included all CR criteria met, except subject only has partial platelet recovery and ANC recovery. Complete CR (CRc) response includes all subjects who achieve a CR, CRi and CRh. Partial Response (PR) response included a decrease of ≥50% in % blasts in the BM aspirate or biopsy from baseline but \>5%. Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLFS) response included ≤5% in % blasts in the BM aspirate or biopsy., 1 year
Open label, dose de-escalation, pilot trial of crenolanib with standard salvage chemotherapy. Subjects may receive up to 2 cycles of induction with standard salvage chemotherapy followed by crenolanib. Each arm will enroll approximately 24 patients (72 total); stratification to each arm will be per physician's choice
