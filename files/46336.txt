Safety and Feasibility Study of Robotic Assisted Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer
Total mesorectal excision has greatly reduced the local recurrence rate of rectal cancer after colorectal surgery. Transanal total mesorectal excision(TaTME) is potentially a suitable option for patients with middle and low rectal cancer. Robotic systems are expected to develop the advantages of TaTME to overcome the limitations of laparoscopic surgery. This study aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of robotic assisted transanal total mesorectal excision in patients with rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer|Perioperative Complication
PROCEDURE: Robotic assisted transanal total mesorectal excision|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic assisted transanal total mesorectal excision
The local recurrence rates of rectal cancer, The incidence of local recurrence rectal cancer within two years after surgery, Two years after surgery|The incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage, The incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage within 30 days after surgery, Within 30 days after surgery|The five-year survival rates, The 5-year survival rates of rectal cancer, Five years after surgery|The distant metastasis rates of rectal cancer, The incidence of distant metastasis rectal cancer within two years after surgery, Five years after surgery
TaTME is potentially a suitable option for patients with middle or low rectal cancer, especially for males with obesity and a narrow pelvis.The da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is expected to overcome the limitations of the laparoscopic transanal approach for rectal surgery. Da Vinci Si Surgical System or da Vinci Xi Surgical System would be used to performed Transanal total mesorectal excision. And the surgery would performed by two-team approach. This study aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of robotic assisted transanal total mesorectal excision in patients with rectal cancer.
