Prostate Cancer Utilities and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
The purpose of this study is to help doctors and patients make better decisions about prostate cancer treatment. This research is being done because we do not know how patient preferences for health states related to prostate cancer affect the final treatment decision.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Survey, interview|BEHAVIORAL: patient utility scores (i.e. patient preference weights)
Utility scores for treatment outcomes, Patient utility scores (i.e. patient preference weights) are calculated using survery data will determine which prostate cancer treatment would be most cost-effective for each subject. Patients will be contacted by phone and patient records will be reviewed 90 days after the survey has been completed to determine whether this data reflects actual treatment decisions., 90 days after enrollment
Anxiety levels, We will also ask patients questions relating to their anxiety levels concerning the possible diagnosis of prostate cancer., 90 days after enrollment
The goal of this project is to incorporate patients' preferences into a previously developed prostate cancer treatment decision-model and to understand the implications for doing so for cost-effectiveness analysis. To do this, it is first necessary to obtain patient utility scores (i.e., patient preference weights). To do this we will perform a survey of patients visiting the urology clinic to undergo prostate biopsies to validate a method of utility assessment, and understand the patients' individual evaluations of treatment-related health studies. We will also ask patients questions relating to their anxiety levels concerning the possible diagnosis of prostate cancer.
