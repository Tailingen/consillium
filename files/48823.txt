Italian Observational Study on CAR-T Therapy for Lymphoma
The goal of this observational study on chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is to monitor the feasibility, efficacy, toxicity and biomarkers in a real life setting.

Partecipants will be asked to agree to their clinical data collection and to partecipate to the optional biological study that aims to evaluate biomarkers of toxicity and response (clinical characteristics, cytokine profile, cellcomposition and type of the CAR-T cell product, lymphoma genomics). The study will evaluate even the disease response according to lugano criteria by PET and CT in routine clinical activity.

Characterization of biomarkers of early response (circulating tumor cell free DNA versus PET and CT scans), To study the circulating cell free DNA modulation during time, besides descriptive statistical analyses, we will use non parametric factorial models for longitudinal data \[Brunner E, Domhof S, Langer F. Nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments. John Wiley \& Sons 2002, New York\]. Such models were chosen because they allow take into account measurement incompleteness and positive asymmetry of biomarker distribution, and because they are robust to outliers. The models also allow to test the difference in the longitudinal profiles according to specific covariates., 10 years, minimum f-up 1 year|Characterization of toxicity biomarkers, Biomarkers will be analysed in relation to toxicities occurrence on order to identify predictors of toxicity onset and severity, 10 years, minimum f-up 1 year|Analysis of the immune reconstitution, Evaluate disease response and immune recovery biomarkers at different time-points up after CAR-T (when clinically indicated or using blood sampling leftover), 10 years, minimum f-up 1 year|Analysis of the CAR-T expression, Evaluate the persistence of CAR-T after administration, 10 years, minimum f-up 1 year|Influence of PET quantitative parameters: tMTV changes between baseline and +30 and +90 after CAR T-cell infusion (ΔSUV max) related to outcome, In our study, the PET scans will be collected and anonymized.

All patients eligible to CAR-T will be consecutively enrolled Biological samples will be stored at each institution or centralized at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano. Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) will be in charge of the GCP management of the study. Web-based CRF are prepared by FIL.
