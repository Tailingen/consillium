Preservation of Swallowing in Respected Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Examining Radiation Volume Effects (PRESERVE): A Randomized Trial
The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment options.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Radiotherapy to all dissected areas|RADIATION: Omit radiation to pN0 neck
Regional failure in the pN0 hemi-neck (s), Rate of relapse in the pN0 neck in Arm 2 compared to historical controls, Baseline to 5 years
Swallowing Quality of life, Assessed with the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) scale, Baseline up to 12 months|Swallowing Quality of life, Assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale, Baseline up to 12 months|Swallowing Quality of life, Assessed with the EORTC QLQ H\&N 35 scale, Baseline up to 12 months|Health Status Quality of life, Assessed with the EORTC EQ-5D-5L scale, Baseline up to 12 months|Overall survival, Defined as time from randomization to death from any cause, Baseline to 5 years|Disease free survival, Defined as the measure of time after treatment during which no sign of cancer is found, Baseline to 5 years|Local recurrence, Defined as Cancer that has recurred at or near the same place as the primary tumor, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected., Baseline to 5 years|Regional recurrence, Defined as recurrence that occurs in the lymph nodes and tissue located in the vicinity of your original cancer, Baseline to 5 years|Locoregional recurrence, Defined as the recurrence of cancer cells at the same site as the original tumor and/or the regional lymph nodes after a disease free period., Baseline to 5 years|Rate of salvage treatment (surgery +/- radiotherapy) in the pN0 neck and freedom from unsalvageable neck recurrence, Rate of salvage treatment (surgery +/- radiotherapy) in the pN0 neck and freedom from, Baseline 5 years|Rate of feeding tub insertion and rate of feeding tube use at 1-year post randomization, Rate of feeding tub insertion and rate of feeding tube use at 1-year post randomization, Randomization to 1 year post randomization|Swallowing function, Measured by the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment (MBsimp) score, Baseline to 1 year|Swallowing function, Measured by the Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity score, Baseline to 1 year|Swallowing function, Measured by the Functional Oral Intake Score, Baseline to 1 year|Rate of toxicity, Assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4, Baseline to 5 years|Rate of failure in the clinically node negative neck, defined as time from randomization to failure in the cN0 neck, Baseline to 5 years
The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment options.

The study will require a sample size of 90 patients randomized in a 2:3 between the two arms. Arm 1 (standard radiation therapy to tumor location and surrounding area) and Arm 2 (targeted radiation therapy to tumor location).

Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years.
