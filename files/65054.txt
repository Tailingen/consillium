Cycle 1, Day 9 and the time of maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Tmax,ss) of geometric means is reported at Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 21 for quizartinib, active metabolite AC886, and quizartinib and AC886., Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 8 to Cycle 1, Day 21 (each cycle 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Metabolite to Parent Ratio (MR) of Active Metabolite (AC886) After a Daily Dose of 20 mg or 40 mg Combined With Chemotherapy to Japanese Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), The metabolite to parent ratio of geometric means for Cmax and AUCtau is reported at Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 9 for active metabolite AC886 is reported., Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 8 (each cycle 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Quizartinib and Active Metabolite (AC886) After a Daily Dose of 20 mg or 40 mg Combined With Chemotherapy to Japanese Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), The trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) of geometric means is reported at Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 21 for serum quizartinib, active metabolite AC886, and quizartinib and AC886., Induction phase Cycle 1, Day 21
