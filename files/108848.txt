Study to Evaluate 5-ALA Combined With CV01 Delivery of Ultrasound in Recurrent High Grade Glioma
A Phase 1 Multi-center clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of 5-aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) Combined With CV01 Delivery of Ultrasound for Sonodynamic Therapy (SDT) in Patients With recurrent High Grade Glioma (HGG).
High Grade Glioma
DRUG: 5 Aminolevulinic Acid|DEVICE: CV01-delivered ultrasound
Incidence of adverse events (Safety and Tolerability), Safety and tolerability as determined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including severe AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), 12 Months|To determine the Maximum Tolerable Duration (MTDu), The MTDu is defined as the highest duration at which fewer than 1/3 of patients experience a Duration limited toxicity, 12 Months
Assessment of Overall response rate (ORR), ORR assessed by RANO criteria, 12 Months|Assessment of Duration of Response (DoR), 12 Months|Assessment of Overall survival (OS), 12 Months|Assessment of Progression free survival (PFS), 12 Months
High-grade gliomas are the most commonly occurring primary CNS tumors in adults. The investigational product in this clinical study is a drug-device combination product consisting of 5-ALA HCl oral solution and the CV01 ultrasound delivery device. 5-ALA will be administered as a sonosensitizer prior to CV01-delivered ultrasound and will be re-administered every 4 weeks prior to CV01 ultrasound delivery. The CV01 device will deliver non-ablative, low-intensity ultrasound to deep regions of the brain to induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Part A will focus on duration escalation and determining the recommended duration of CV01 delivered ultrasound. Part B will further explore safety and tolerability through cohort expansion at the recommended duration of CV01 delivered ultrasound. Part C will include an exploratory surgical cohort at the recommended duration of CV01 delivered ultrasound. This FIH study will evaluate escalating durations of ultrasound delivery with CV01 and will enroll up to 48 patients.
