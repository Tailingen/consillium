A Study of GV20-0251 Monotherapy and GV20-0251 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Solid Tumor Malignancies
This is a Phase 1/2A study of GV20-0251 being developed for the treatment of participants with advanced solid tumors, who are refractory to approved therapies or other standard of care.

This is a Phase 1/2A non-randomized, open label, multi-center study to be conducted in four parts (Parts A, B, C and D).

In Part A, a 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GV20-0251, and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

In Part B, the Bayesian optimal design for Phase II (BOP2) will be utilized to further characterize the anti-tumor activities, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GV20-0251 at the preliminary RP2D across multiple expansion cohorts involving eligible participants.

In Part C, the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design will be employed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GV20-0251 in combination with Pembrolizumab, and to determine the MTD or the preliminary RP2D of this combination.

In Part D, BOP2 will be applied to further characterize the anti-tumor activities, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GV20-0251 in combination with Pembrolizumab at the preliminary RP2D across multiple expansion cohorts involving eligible participants.
