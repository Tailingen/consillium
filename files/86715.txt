Anti-PD-1 Alone or Combined With Autologous DC-CIK Cell Therapy in Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy and toxicity of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody alone with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody plus autologous dendritic cells-cytokine induced killer cell (DC-CIK) immunotherapy in advanced tumor patients.Furthermore,to characterize response to therapy we intent to evaluate the role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and immune repertoire based on the next generation sequencing.

BIOLOGICAL: Anti-PD-1 plus DC-CIK|BIOLOGICAL: Anti-PD-1 alone
Overall survival of the participants(OS), From starting date of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment until date of death from any cause, 24 months
Progression-free survival of the participants(PFS), From starting date of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment until date of until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, 24 months|The changes in immune-response specific patient-reported outcomes(irPRO), To assess the irPRO scale ratings prior to and after the cancer immunotherapy, 24 months|Treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 24 months|The changes in patient self-reported quality of life, To assess the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale ratings prior to and after the cancer immunotherapy, 24 months
