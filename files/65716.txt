Trial to Assess the Effects of an Antimicrobial Mouthwash on the Esophageal Microbiome
This is a randomized, open-label pilot study to assess whether treatment with chlorhexidine mouthwash can alter the esophageal and gastric cardia microbiome
Esophageal Adenocarcinoma|Barrett's Esophagus|Reflux Esophagitis
DRUG: Chlorhexidine gluconate
Reduction of F. Nucleatum in Saliva, Within individual change in relative abundance of F nucleatum in oral samples, 21 days|Difference in Esophageal F. Nucleatum Between Experimental Group and no Intervention Group, Comparison of relative abundance of esophageal F. nucleatum in the mouthwash group vs. the no intervention group., 21 days
Patients scheduled for upper endoscopy for clinical indications will be randomized to 3 weeks of either no treatment or use of twice daily chlorhexidine mouthwash leading up to the endoscopy. There will be 2-3 study visits, at Day 0 and Day 21, and for those subjects in the mouthwash arm, a final visit 1-2 weeks following the Day 21 visit. Subjects will be required to fast overnight prior to the visits on Days 0 and 21.
