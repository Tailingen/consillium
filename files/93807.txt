A Study of the ApricityCare Program for Early Detection and Management of Treatment-related Adverse Events in Patients With Metastatic Cancer
To evaluate the rate of therapy discontinuation due to toxicity (side effects) among participants with metastatic cancer using ApricityCare.

Investigators want to learn if identification of early clinical signs of irAEs with timely treatment can prevent severity progression and reduce treatment discontinuation.
Metastatic Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Metastatic Cancer
Safety and Adverse Events, Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 4.03, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective • To determine the rate of therapy discontinuation due to toxicity among patients using ApricityCare.

Secondary Objectives

• To evaluate time the ease and experience of patient use of ApricityCare (i.e., patient engagement) in reporting symptoms during their systemic cancer treatments. Furthermore, the frequency of patient symptom reporting via check-in to ApricityCare will be evaluated, as will the time taken to respond and engage patients after they report toxicity or other adverse events via ApricityCare.
