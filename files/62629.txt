Image-Guided Biopsies to Identify Mechanisms of Resistance in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With 177Lu-PSMA Radioligand Therapy
This clinical trial studies mechanisms of resistance to 177-lutetium prostate specific membrane antigen (177Lu-PSMA) radioligand therapy using image-guided biopsies in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer that had spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Diagnostic procedures, such as image guided biopsies, may help in learning how well 177Lu-PSMA works to kill tumor cells and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

PROCEDURE: Image Guided Biopsy
Proportion of patients with a successful evaluable biopsy with molecular and cellular alterations after radioligand therapy (RLT), At the end of cycle 2 before the initiation of cycle 3 of RLT (cycle is six weeks)
Proportion of patients with gene mutations that might confer resistance to RLT, At the end of cycle 2 before the initiation of cycle 3 of RLT (cycle is six weeks)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Proportion of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with molecular and cellular alterations in tumor, immune and stromal cells after radioligand therapy assessed by histopathology/immunohistochemistry, ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing and proteomic/phospho-proteomic analyses of biopsy samples.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Sequencing to identify frequently mutated genes.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo an image-guided biopsy at baseline and 2-4 weeks after cycle 2 of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.
