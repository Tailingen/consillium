Substudy 06E: Umbrella Study of Combination Therapies in Esophageal Cancer (MK-3475-06E/KEYMAKER-U06)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ESCC is a type of cancer that starts in certain cells that line the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. This study will look at ESCC that is either locally advanced unresectable, which means it has spread into tissue near where it started and cannot be completely removed by surgery, or metastatic, which means it has spread to other body parts.

Available treatments for these types of ESCC include pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. Chemotherapy is medicine that destroys cancer cells or stops them from growing.

Researchers want to learn about giving pembrolizumab and ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a study medicine, with or without chemotherapy to treat ESCC. I-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells.

The main goal of this study is to learn about the safety of I-DXd and pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy and if people tolerate them. Researchers also want to learn how cancer responds (gets smaller or goes away) to the study treatments.

Percentage of Participants who Experience Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During the Safety Lead-In Phase, A DLT is any of the following toxicities, if determined to be related to study treatment:

* Nonhematologic adverse event (AE) ≥ Grade 3 (non laboratory) in severity, with exceptions
* Grade ≥ 2 treatment-related interstitial lung disease
* Grade 3 or 4 lab value, with exceptions
* Potential drug-induced liver injury event, meeting criteria
* Febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or 4
* Prolonged delay in initiating Cycle 2 due to study intervention-related toxicity
* Study intervention-related toxicity causing participant to discontinue intervention during Cycle 1
* Missing \>25% of study intervention doses due to drug-related AEs during the first cycle
* Grade 5 toxicity The number of participants who experience at least one DLT during the safety lead-in phase (approximately 21 days after the first dose of treatment) will be reported., Up to approximately 21 days|Percentage of Participants who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 28 months|Percentage of Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 25 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR: the disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 73 months
Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 73 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 73 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from allocation/randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 73 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) with at least 6 months PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 73 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of I-DXd, Cmax is defined as the peak level I-DXd reaches in the blood plasma. Blood samples collected predose and at multiple timepoints postdose will be used to determine the Cmax of I-DXd when co-administered with other investigational agents., At designated time points up to approximately 25 months|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of I-DXd, Tmax is defined as the time it took I-DXd to reach its peak level in blood plasma. Blood samples collected predose and at designated timepoints postdose will be used to determine the Tmax of I-DXd when co-administered with other investigational agents., At designated time points up to approximately 25 months|Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve from Time 0 to Last Measurable Plasma Concentration (AUC0-Last) of I-DXd, AUC0-last is defined as the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to time of last measurable concentration of I-DXd in the blood plasma. Blood samples collected at predose and at designated timepoints postdose will be used to determine the AUC0-last of I-DXd in combination with other agents., At designated time points up to approximately 25 months|Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve from Time 0 to the End of the Dosing Period (AUC-tau) of I-DXd, AUC-tau is defined as the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing period. Blood samples collected at predose and at designated timepoints postdose will be used to determine the AUC-tau of I-DXd in combination with other agents., At designated time points up to approximately 25 months|The Percentage of Participants with Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) Against I-DXd, Blood samples collected at designated timepoints will be used to determine the ADA response to I-DXd. The percentage of participants with ADA will be reported., Up to approximately 73 months|The Percentage of Participants with Treatment-Emergent ADA Against I-DXd, Blood samples collected at designated timepoints will be used to determine the treatment-emergent ADA response to I-DXd.
