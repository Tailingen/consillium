Identification of Molecular Signatures of High-risk Oncogenic HPV and Study of Their Associations With the Presence of High-grade Lesions and/or Anal Cancer 10 Years After Inclusion in the ANRS IPERGAY Trial
HPVsign is a cross-sectional, non-comparative, multicenter study involving all participants included in the HPV substudy of the ANRS IPERGAY trial. The study proposes to evaluate the cumulative incidence of high-grade lesions and/or anal cancers using high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) during the HPVsign study and/or diagnosed since the end of participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial.
HPV Infection|Anal Cancer
PROCEDURE: High-resolution anoscopy
High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL) and/or anal cancers diagnosed by an high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), Within the 10 years prior to HPV sign study participation, or at the study proctological examination in the study.
HPV molecular signatures obtained using the Capture-HPV technique: HPV mutations, integration into the human genome, at the time of the ANRS IPERGAY-HPV sub-study, and 10 years later, in the HPVsign study.|Nature of abnormalities on High resolution anoscopy (HRA): condylomas, lesions., Lesions and condylomas are described as follows: location and type., 10 years after participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial|Nature of abnormalities on anal cytology: lesions location, lesions type, lesions grade., at the time of the ANRS IPERGAY-HPV sub-study, and 10 years later, in the HPVsign study.|Nature of abnormalities on anal histology of lesions: location, type, grade, 10 years after participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial|Presence of different HPV virus types in the oropharynx, at the time of the ANRS IPERGAY-HPV sub-study, and 10 years later, in the HPVsign study.
The study aims to enrol 80 to 100 participants in French clinical centres. All the participants have participated to the IPERGAY HPV substudy.

The study proposes to evaluate the cumulative incidence of high-grade lesions and/or anal cancers using high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) during the HPVsign study and/or diagnosed since the end of participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial.

Also, the study proposes to:

* study the association between the presence of HSIL and/or anal cancer and HPV molecular signatures during participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial and 10 years after.
* study the evolution of HPV molecular signatures from participation in the ANRS IPERGAY to current study
* compare HRA results with anal cytology results
* compare the results of anal cytology concomitant with HRA with those obtained during participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial.
* study factors associated with the presence of HSIL and/or anal cancer.
* compare the presence of different HPV virus types in the oropharynx concomitant with HRA and during participation in the ANRS IPERGAY trial.
