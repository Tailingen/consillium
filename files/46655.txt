Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy and Systemic Chemotherapy Versus Systemic Chemotherapy After Curative Resection of Serosa-positive Gastric Cancer
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment modality is designed to eradicate intraperitoneal free tumor cells that can be a source of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Although we have not reached unanimous consensus, favorable reports on the outcome of intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been published.

In this study, we review the clinicopathological characteristics of patients and effects of early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) on overall and gastric cancer-specific survival and patterns of recurrence of gastric cancer patients with macroscopic serosal invasion.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of intraperitoneal chemotherapy on overall and disease free survival of advanced gastric cancer patients with serosal invasion after potentially curative surgery.
