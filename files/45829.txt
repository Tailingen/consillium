Genetic, Microenvironmental, and Immunological Factors in Unresectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) complexity, where genetic, stromal, and immunological factors all interact with each other, is responsible for the overall poor response of PDAC to chemotherapeutic agents, making this a lethal disease. The investigators hypothesize that: (i) dissection of genetic, stromal, and immunological factors on endoscopic ultrasound fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) tissue samples from unresectable PDAC patients' will allow to determine prognostic factors in this patient population; (ii) treatment response and acquisition of tumor chemotherapy resistance could be related to genetic heterogeneity between the primary and metastatic sites and alteration of the molecular profile under drug' selection pressure.

Progression-free-survival (PFS), To assess the impact of comprehensive genetic, stromal, and immunological factors on PFS defined as the time from the date of trial entry until disease progression or relapse., From date of enrollment assessed until death or up to 2 years|Overall survival, To assess the impact of comprehensive genetic, stromal, and immunological factors on Overall survival defined as the length of time (in days) between the treatment date and the date of death., From date of enrollment assessed until death or up to 2 years
