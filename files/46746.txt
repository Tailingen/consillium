Nivolumab Plus Relatlimab in Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
The purpose of this research is to test if a combination treatment of nivolumab and relatlimab will result in tumor reduction in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.
Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Relatlimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) will be the percentage of study participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response PR to study therapy as per treating physician evaluation using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 24 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as per treating physician evaluation using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date that objective progression disease is documented or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death., Up to 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Up to 4 years|Proportion of Study Participants With Treatment-Related Toxicity, The safety profile of the study therapy will be determined by the proportion of study participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). AEs and SAEs will be tabulated by type, grade, severity, treatment attribution according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 25 months
This is a phase II single-institution trial with a Simon two-stage minimax design with 27 patients (13 in stage 1, 14 in stage 2) setting a 5% type I error and 80% power under true objective response rate (ORR) of 20%. The null hypothesis (ORR=5%) is rejected if 4 or more responses are observed in 27 patients. No prior PD-1, CTLA-4 and/or LAG-3 blocking antibody treatment was allowed. We will also perform single-cell mRNA and T-cell receptor (TCR) variable, diversity, and joining (V\[D\]J) sequencing pre-treatment and at either progression or response.

Patients will be treated with nivolumab 480 mg/relatlimab 160 mg IV q4wks to progression or intolerable toxicity for up to two years.
