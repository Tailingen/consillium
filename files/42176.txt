Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Combined With Concurrent Chemotherapy for Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of accelerated hypofractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3 Gy/fraction) concurrent with chemotherapy for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiation/chemotherapy
Number of Participants with Severe and Life-threatening Adverse Events (AE), intolerable toxicities: severe and life-threatening adverse events (Grade III/IV in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE 3.0)), Baseline to the time of intolerable toxicity(up to 1 year) or measured Progressive Disease (PD)
Percentage of Participants with Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 1 Year, Baseline and 1 year
Increasing the biological effective dose (BED) of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can increase local control rates and improve overall survival. Compared with conventional fractionated radiotherapy, accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy can yield higher BED, shorten the total treatment time, and theoretically obtain better efficacy. However, currently, there is no optimal hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen. Based on phase I trial results, we performed this phase II trial to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of accelerated hypofractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy(3-DCRT) combined with concurrent chemotherapy for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.

Patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III NSCLC received 3-DCRT with a total dose of 69 Gy, delivered at 3 Gy per fraction, once daily, five fractions per week, completed within 4.6 weeks. At the same time, platinum doublet chemotherapy was applied.
