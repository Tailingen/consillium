Phase I Study of Dasatinib (BMS-354825) and Imatinib in Subjects With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase
The purpose of this study is to find out whether adding a new drug, dasatinib, to imatinib is safe, and whether the combination of the two drugs will help decrease the number of cells that contain the Philadelphia chromosome.
Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic, Chronic-Phase
DRUG: Dasatinib in combination with imatinib
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of dasatinib when combined with imatinib in chronic phase CML patients.
assess safety and tolerability of dasatinib and imatinib administered in combination throughout study|identify dose limiting toxicities|characterize plasma pharmacokinetics of dasatinib and imatinib in month 1|measure major molecular response rate|measure the major cytogenetic response rate|characterize mutations in the BCR-ABL gene|evaluate progressive free survival and overall survival
The purpose of this study is to find out whether adding a new drug, dasatinib, to imatinib is safe, and whether the combination of the two drugs will help decrease the number of cells that contain the Philadelphia chromosome.
