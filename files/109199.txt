Pilot Study of [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025 Imaging in Patients Undergoing Treatment with HER2-targeted Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine if the radiotracer, \[68Ga\]Ga-ABY-025, used for PET imaging can help us better identify and visualize lesions or tumors, in patients who are receiving standard of care therapy HER2+ cancers.
Locally Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: ABY-025 Loading Dose|DRUG: [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025
Determine safety of [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025 PET. We will assess the number of adverse events (AEs) that are possibly or probably related to the study drug within 24 hours after infusion. Dose limiting toxicities will be defined as an AE grade >2 that is clini, Outcome Measure: After study enrollment, subjects will receive \[68Ga\]Ga-ABY-025 infusion and undergo PET/CT scan. Patients will be immediately assessed for adverse events within the first 30 minutes of infusion and via phone call at 2 days (+/- 1 day) post-infusion from the study coordinator. Adverse events will be monitored up to 21+/-14 days following the infusion of study drug. Repeat infusion and imaging will be obtained either at the time of treatment discontinuation or at 12 months from study consent and will have the same safety monitoring parameters. While there are expected adverse events related to anti-cancer therapy, we will specifically be reporting adverse events that are "definitely related" or "probably related" to the study agent., up to 21+/-14 days from second administration of [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025. Assessments will be performed as part of the routine standard of care for patients undergoing HER2-targeted anti-cancer treatment.
This study will assess a dose of ABY-025 followed by a tracer dose of \[68Ga\]Ga-ABY-025 in subjects with HER2+ solid cancers, or HER2+ or low breast cancer undergoing or planning to undergo treatment with standard-of-care HER2-targeted therapy for an FDA-approved indication. The study drug will be administered on Day 0, and \[68Ga\]Ga-ABY-025 PET/CT scan will be obtained the same day after injection of study drug. Patients will receive a phone call from a study coordinator post-injection to assess for adverse events. Subjects will undergo standard of care evaluation of their advanced disease per the discretion of their treating physician.
