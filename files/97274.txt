Non-Interventional Study (NIS) In Patients With Advanced And/Or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) Treated With SUTENT®
Primary objective: to increase knowledge about safety, tolerability, quality of life and efficacy under conditions of routine use of SUTENT®. Secondary objectives: treatment response, hypothyroidism prevalence.The efficacy will be assessed using the Objective Response Rate, Time to Progression based on the RECIST criteria and the ECOG performance data.

Participants in "Not reported" category were on study, had no data for this time point., Month 9|Percentage of Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status at Month 12, Following are ECOG grades. 0: Fully active, perform all pre-disease activities without restriction. 1: Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory, carry out work of a light or sedentary nature. 2: Ambulatory, capable of selfcare, unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than (\>) 50% of waking hours. 3: Capable of limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair \>50% of waking hours. 4: Completely disabled, not capable of any selfcare, totally confined to bed or chair. 5: Dead. Participants in "Not reported" category were on study, had no data for this time point., Month 12|Correlation Between Sunitinib-induced Hypertension and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), Sunitinib-induced hypertension was determined using blood pressure recorded at each postbaseline visit. Once participants were identified as having sunitinib-induced hypertension, they retained that status at subsequent visits. PFS is the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of tumor response to treatment. Hazard ratio represents the relationship between sunitinib-induced hypertension and PFS (presence/absence of hypertension)., Baseline to date of first documentation of response to treatment (up to 12 months)|Correlation Between Sunitinib-induced Hypertension and Tumor Response to Treatment (OS), Sunitinib-induced hypertension was determined using blood pressure recorded at each postbaseline visit. Once participants were identified as having sunitinib-induced hypertension, they retained that status at subsequent visits. OS is the time from start of study treatment to death. Hazard ratio represents the relationship between sunitinib-induced hypertension and OS., Baseline to date of death (up to 12 months)|Percentage of Participants With Hypothyroidism, TSH and FT4 levels were measured and hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH level \>5.0 mIU/L at that time point., Baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, 12|Percentage of Participants With Hypertension, Hypertension was defined as follows. Grade 1: Asymptomatic, transient (less than \[\<\]24 hours) increase by \>20mm Hg (diastolic) or to \>150/100 mm Hg if previously within normal limits (WNL). Grade 2: Recurrent or persistent (24 hours or more) or symptomatic increase by \>20 mm Hg (diastolic) or to \>150/100 mm Hg if previously WNL. Grade 3: Requiring \>1 drug or more intensive therapy than previously. Grade 4: Life-threatening. Grade 5: Death., Baseline, Week 6, Months 3, 6, 9, 12
Summary of Adverse Events for Participants Who Required Dose Modification, Adverse events (AEs) or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose. Study drug modifications included reduced dose or temporary discontinuation of treatment., Baseline up to 12 months|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Hypertension, by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade, Sunitinib-induced hypertension: not present at baseline but developed through the study, or if present at baseline increased by more than (\>) 20% during the study. Grade 1: Asymptomatic, transient (less than \[\<\]24 hours) increase by \>20 millimeters of Mercury (mm Hg) (diastolic) or to \>150/100 mm Hg if previously within normal limits (WNL); Grade 2: Recurrent or persistent (\>=24 hours) or symptomatic increase by \>20 mm Hg (diastolic) or to \>150/100 mm Hg if previously WNL; Grade 3: Requiring \>1 drug or more intensive therapy than previously; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Death., Baseline up to 12 months|Percentage of Participants Responding to Treatment, Response categories for target lesions: Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions, reference=baseline sum of longest dimensions; Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Not sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, not sufficient increase to qualify for PD; Reference for PD and SD: smallest sum of longest dimensions since treatment started., 12 months
180 patients will be enrolled at 20 key oncological centres, the sample size is sufficient for exploratory analysis.
