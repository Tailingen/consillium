Adebrelimab Combined With SOX Regimen in Preoperative Neoadjuvant Transformation Therapy for Locally Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Abstract Objective: Adebrelimab is a PD-L1 inhibitor. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adebrelimab combined with SOX regimen for preoperative neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.

Methods and analysis: This study is a prospective single-center, two-arm, double-blind and randomized controlled clinical trial designed to include 110 patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who will be randomly assigned into two groups: experimental group (adebrelimab combined with SOX regimen) (n=55) and control group (SOX regimen) (n=55). The main efficacy indicators are pathological complete response rate (pCR). The secondary efficacy indicators are R0 resection rate, safety indicators (including surgical and drug treatment safety indicators). disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Ethics: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital (Xijing Hospital) of Air force Military Medical University (KY20232357-F-1).
