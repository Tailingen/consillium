Study in Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
Primary

Compare response rates (relative change in tumor size) to induction chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin/paclitaxel/cetuximab +/- everolimus.

Secondary:

Determine the maximum administered dose (MAD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and safety of everolimus with cisplatin/paclitaxel/cetuximab induction chemotherapy (phase I portion)
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Placebo
Tumor Responses, Change in tumor size (sum of longest diameters of target lesions) after two cycles of induction therapy, expressed as log of ratio of post-treatment to baseline measure., Baseline and 2 months
Results reported here are for the randomized, phase II portion of the trial.
