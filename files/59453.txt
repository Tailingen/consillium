Tablet-based Mobile Health Ultrasound for Point-of-care Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Nigeria (Mobile Health: Technology and Outcomes in Low and Middle-Income Countries)
The purpose of this study is to train Nigerian radiologists to perform ultrasound-guided breast biopsies. Researchers will use mHealth devices to create a sustainable and practical way of training radiologists in Nigeria to perform and clinically implement US-guided breast biopsies into their practice.

PROCEDURE: mHealth US-breast biopsy
Number of successful US-guided breast biopsy, Trainees will be evaluated using a passing criterion of 80% on a validated test that assesses competency based on the The Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation (O-Score). There are 8 variables rated on a scale of 1-5. A trainee will be given a passing grade if the responses on all 8 variables are 4 or 5 and this is achieved in at least 80% of the unsupervised simulation and patient biopsies., 1 year
