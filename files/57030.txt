Abemaciclib in Patients with Oligodendroglioma
This is a phase II, single arm, open label study looking how well a drug called abemaciclib works in patients with recurrent oligodendroglioma
Oligodendroglioma, Adult
DRUG: Abemaciclib 200 MG
Progression-free survival, Assessed as a) Tumor progression (as measured by modified RANO criteria) or death due to disease or toxicity; OR b) alive without tumor progression, 6 months after initiation of study therapy
Safety and tolerability of this therapy, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE version 5.0, From initiation of study drug to 28 days after the end of treatment visit|Objective radiographic response (ORR), measured by modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria., Up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, defined as the time from date of enrollment until the earliest date of disease progression (as determined by modified RANO criteria) or death due to any cause, Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, defined as the time from date of enrollment until death from any cause, From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
Primary Objective:

â€¢ To determine the efficacy of abemaciclib for recurrent oligodendroglioma, as measured by the estimated proportion of patients alive without disease progression at 6 months from study enrollment (PFS-6)

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in recurrent oligodendroglioma
* To estimate the objective radiographic response rate (ORR) associated with abemaciclib in recurrent oligodendroglioma
* To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent oligodendroglioma treated with abemaciclib
* To determine ORR, PFS, and OS in the subgroup of recurrent oligodendroglioma patients with tumor CIC gene mutations

Exploratory Objectives:

* To measure pharmacodynamic markers of abemaciclib activity on oligodendroglial tumor cells
* To identify pre-treatment tumor characteristics that are associated with response to abemaciclib recurrent oligodendroglioma
