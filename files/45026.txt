Testing Ivonescimab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Advanced or Metastatic Gastric/Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the addition of ivonescimab to standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The main question it aims to answer is : Does the addition of ivonescimab increase the response to treatment ? Participants will visit the clinic every 2 weeks for checkups, treatment administration and tests for collection of adverse events.

Objective Response Rate assessed by central review, The objective response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) for a given treatment, Time from randomization to disease progression, up to 3 years
Objective Response Rate assessed by the investigator, The objective response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) for a given treatment, Time from randomization to disease progression, up to 3 years|Duration of response, The time form first documented response (compared to baseline measurement taken at randomization) until the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Time from randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival is the lengh of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse, Time from randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomization to death from any cause, up to 3 years|Time to patient performance status deterioration >2, Time to performance status (PS) deterioration \>2 is defined as the time between patient randomisation and the first date when PS\>2.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS, a simple measure of functional status, determines ability of patient to tolerate therapies. It has scores ranging from 0 to 5 (0 = "fully active", 1 = "completely ambulatory", 2 = "\<50% in bed during the day", 3 = "\>50% in bed, but not bedbound", 4 = "bedbound", and 5 = "death")., From randomization to PS deterioration >2, up to 3 years|Incidence of Treatment Adverse Events, The tolerance and safety will be evaluated by toxicity (acute \[\<1 months after the end of the trial treatment\] and late \[â‰¥1 month after the end of the trial treatment), assessed using the Common terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). CTCAE is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 3 years|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., At baseline, 2 months, 6 months, disease progression and first follow-up visit (up to 3 years).|Quality of Life Questionnaire - Oesophago-Gastric cancer (QLQ-OG25), This EORTC oesophago-gastric cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The QLQ-OG25 contains 25 items organized into six scales: dysphagia (three items), eating restrictions (four items), reflux (two items), odynophagia (two items), pain and discomfort (two items) and anxiety (two items), and ten single items: eating in front of others, dry mouth, trouble with taste, body image, trouble swallowing saliva, choked when swallowing, trouble with coughing, trouble talking, weight loss and hair loss. All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms., At baseline, 2 months, 6 months, disease progression and first follow-up visit (up to 3 years).
Phase 2, multicenter, two-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy of ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma, with and without actionable biomarker (HER2/PD-L1/claudin18.2).
