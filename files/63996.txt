Multifactorial Risk Assessment for Breast & Ovarian Cancer Risk Detection
The objective of this project is to validate a next-generation assay that utilizes both the protein biomarkers of our already established ovarian cancer risk assessment combined with a molecular profile in both germline and early somatic detection.
