Radioimmunoimaging of Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis
The purpose of the study is to determine the capability of a radiolabeled amyloid-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) to document the presence and distribution of amyloid deposits by PET/CT imaging in patients with AL amyloidosis.
AL Amyloidosis
BIOLOGICAL: Single infusion of 124I-labeled anti-amyloid mAb 11-1F4: 2 mCi (1 mg)
Determination of the capability of a radiolabeled amyloid-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) to document the presence and distribution of amyloid deposits by PET/CT in up to 30 patients with AL amyloidosis., PET/CT images will be taken 2 and 5 days post-radiolabeled antibody infusion to evaluate if there is organ/tissue uptake (greater than blood pool) and to determine if the presence of radiolabeled antibody correlates with clinically proven amyloid deposition., Five days post PET/CT scan
To be eligible for this study, patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of AL amyloidosis without significant cardiac (New York Heart Association class IV) disease and not be on kidney dialysis. Additionally, after testing, their blood must not contain antibodies to mouse proteins. The study requires an intravenous infusion, given over 10 minutes, of the radiolabeled antibody, followed 48 hours later by a PET/CT scan. A repeat scan is done 5 days after infusion of the antibody. A 5-ml blood specimen needs to be furnished 4 and 8 weeks after the antibody infusion.
