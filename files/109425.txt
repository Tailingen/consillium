An Additional Analysis of Data from the PARADIGM Exploratory Study (NCT02394834) in Patients with Advanced/Recurrent Colorectal Cancer
The main aim of the study is to check gene change in tumor tissues with an additional analysis of the data from PARADIGM Exploratory Study, which is conducted for people with advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.

In the PARADIGM Exploratory Study (NCT02394834), the drug being tested in this study is called Panitumumab and the main aim of this study is to check side effect from the study treatment (mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab versus mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab therapy) and check if the study treatment improves symptoms of advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.

DRUG: mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy|DRUG: mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy
Overall survival (OS), OS obtained in the main study will be stratified by the gene expression levels in tumor tissues at the baseline of the main study to evaluate the relationship between OS and gene expression. OS will be measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any causes., Up to approximately 63 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS obtained in the main study will be stratified by the gene expression levels in tumor tissues at the baseline of the main study to evaluate the relationship between the PFS and gene expression. PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 63 months
Evaluation of Correlation between Each Gene Mutations in Plasma Free DNA at Baseline of Main Study, and Efficacy Endpoints (OS and PFS), Up to approximately 63 months|Evaluation of Correlation between Each Gene Expression Levels in Tumor Tissue at Baseline of Main Study, and Efficacy Endpoints (OS and PFS), Up to approximately 63 months|Evaluation of Correlation between Change in Each Gene Mutations in Plasma Free DNA at Baseline and Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment of Main Study, and Efficacy Endpoints (OS and PFS), Up to approximately 63 months|Evaluation of Correlation between Change in Each Gene Expression Levels in Tumor Tissue at Baseline and Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment of Main Study, and Efficacy Endpoints (OS and PFS), Up to approximately 63 months|Evaluation of Correlation between High Gene Expression Region in Tumor Tissue at Baseline of Main Study, and Efficacy Endpoints (OS and PFS), Up to approximately 63 months|Evaluation of Correlation between Change in Gene Expression Region in Tumor Tissue at Baseline and Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment of Main Study, and Efficacy Endpoints (OS and PFS), Up to approximately 63 months
This is a non-interventional study to do additional exploratory analysis of biomarkers from the PARADIGM Exploratory Study (NCT02394834), which is conducted for participants with advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer. 757 patients have enrolled in the PARADIGM Exploratory Study.
