Osimertinib (AZD9291) in First-line Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC Patients With EGFR and EGFR T790M
The primary goal is to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib (AZD9291), in terms of the objective response rate in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation at diagnosis as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Safety and efficacy will also be measured.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of patients who achieved complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\] to treatment in accordance to the revised RECIST guidelines (version 1.1) for target lesions: CR, disappearance of all target lesions; PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through study completion. From baseline up to approximately 28 months.
Overall Survival (OS), Time from the start of treatment to the time of death due to any cause., Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Duration of Response (DoR), Time from the first documented response to documented disease progression or death, in accordance with RECIST 1.1 criteria., Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Disease Control Rate, Percentage of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease for a minimum of 24 weeks, assessed in accordance with the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, during all study period from baseline up to 78 weeks from the time of the first administration dose, Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Tumor Shrinkage, Number of patients that presented tumor shrinkage, Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Overall Plasma EGFR Mutation Status at Baseline, Percentage of patients with a positive sensitizing EGFR mutation in plasma at baseline, Baseline|Overall Plasma Acquired Resistance to Osimertinib (AZD9291), Percentage of patients who develop anti-drug mutations in plasma, Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events and SAEs, Patient safety and adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), version 4. Adverse event(s) are those which, according to the protocol or in the opinion of the investigator, can cause serious or permanent damage or which rule out further treatment with the study drug. Grade 3 means severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 means life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated., Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Progression-free Survival, Defined as the period of time from treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined locally by the investigator using RECIST v.1.1., Through study completion. From baseline up to 41 months.|Overall Plasma EGFR Mutation Status at Two Weeks After the First Study Dose, Measured by percentage of patients with a positive sensitizing EGFR mutation in plasma two weeks after the first study dose, Two weeks after the first study dose|Overall Plasma EGFR Mutation Status at Disease Progression, Measured by percentage of patients with a positive sensitizing EGFR mutation in plasma at disease progression, At the time of disease progression confirmed radiologically or clinically, up to 78 weeks|Plasma EGFR Thr790Met Mutation Status at Baseline, Measured by percentage of patients with EGFR Thr790Met mutation in plasma at baseline, At baseline|Plasma EGFR Thr790Met Mutation Status at Two Weeks After the First Study Dose, Measured by percentage of patients with EGFR Thr790Met mutation in plasma at two weeks after the first study dose, Two weeks after the first study dose|Plasma EGFR Thr790Met Mutation Status at Disease Progression, Measured by percentage of patients with EGFR Thr790Met mutation in plasma at disease progression, At the time of disease progression confirmed radiologically or clinically, up to 78 weeks
Naïve patients ≥ 18 years of age with histological confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an activating EGFR mutation and concomitant T790M mutation. Evidence of measurable or evaluable metastatic disease is required.

Primary objective:

* To evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib (AZD9291), in terms of the objective response rate in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation at diagnosis as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Secondary objectives:

* To determine the safety and tolerability profile of osimertinib (AZD9291), measured using the number and severity of AEs entered into the Case Report Form (CRF); chemistry, blood count, vital signs, physical examination, weight, ECG and performance status (S).
* To determine other efficacy parameters such as progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), and tumor shrinkage (TS).
* To correlate the parameters of clinical response efficacy documented with the EGFR mutational status.
* To carry out a longitudinal analysis of EGFR mutations (including the T790M mutation) in plasma and serum.
* To determine levels of BIM mRNA as well as mRNA levels of other biomarkers related to EGFR TKI response and determine whether they are predictors of treatment response.
* To identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib (AZD9291); mutations at the site of covalent binding to the drug (C797) or other mutations in tissue or blood.

Type of study: Multicenter, international, single-arm, open-label, non-controlled phase IIa clinical study.

Treatment: Patients will be treated with 1 tablet of osimertinib (AZD9291) 80 mg per os (p.o.) daily.
