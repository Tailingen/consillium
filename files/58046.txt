Weekly Paclitaxel and Cisplatin to Treat Hormone Receptor Positive and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
The investigators hypothesize that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in a weekly-based regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective and tolerable for locally advanced breast cancer.

In patients with some sub-type advanced breast cancer, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy may improve the pathological remission rate.

Premenopausal patients with triple negative breast caner and hormonal receptor positve breast cancer patients will be randominzed to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy or not.

In this trial, patients with ER and or PR positive breast cancer will be separately randomized to have chemotherapy or chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy according to their menstrual status. Letrozole for the postmenopausal women and ovarian function suppression for the premenopausal women. Patients with triple negative breast cancer will be randomized to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with ovarian function suppression if she is premenopausal. Postermenopausal patients with triple negative breast caner will only have neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients with Her2 overexpression can obtain anti-Her2 target therapy. This study has been amended to a 1:2 ratio to control and neoadjuvant chemotherapy combination of endocrine therapy.
