Lenvatinib Plus I-125 Seed Brachytherapy vs. Lenvatinib for TACE-refractory HCC
This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus iodine-125 seed brachytherapy (Len-I) compared with lenvatinib (Len) alone for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

This is a single-center, prospective and randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Len-I versus Len alone for patients with TACE-refractory HCC.

187 patients with TACE-refractory HCC will be enrolled in this study. The patients will receive either Len-I or Len alone using an 2:1 randomization scheme.

Lenvatinib (body weight â‰¥ 60 kg, 12mg P.O. QD; body weight \< 60 kg, 8mg P.O. QD) will be administered to the patients and last until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first. For patients in the Len-I arm, iodion-125 seeds will be implanted into the the target lesions (viable intrahepatic tumor and/or vascular tumor thrombus) under CT guidance according to the pre-operative planning within 7 days after lenvatinib administration. Iodion-125 seeds implantation can be repeated on demand during follow-up based on the evaluation of laboratory and imaging examination.

The primary end point of this study is overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs).
