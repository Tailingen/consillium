Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: IMMU-107 (hPAM4)
safety will be evaluated based upon physical examinations, hematology and chemistry laboratory testing as well as toxicity, over 12 weeks
Efficacy and Clinical benefit measures such as quality of life, pain assessments, etc., over 5 years
Patients receive a 4-week treatment cycle with once-weekly 30-minute gemcitabine infusions beginning one week prior to the first 90Y-hPAM4dose and continuing during the 3 consecutive weeks over which once weekly 90Y-hPAM4 doses are given. Depending on toxicity, patient cohorts will receive one of several possible 90Y and gemcitabine dose combinations. Post-treatment evaluations conducted until instituting another 90YhPAM4 treatment cycle, maintenance gemcitabine or for a maximum period of 12 weeks.
