Study of Proton SBRT and Immunotherapy for Recurrent/Progressive Locoregional or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
This study observes the clinical efficacy of combining proton SBRT with PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in both the locoregionally recurrent and metastatic settings.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Proton Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) (5 fractions; 3500-4500 cGy)|RADIATION: Proton Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) (3-5 fractions; various dose and fractionation regimens depending on treatment site).|DRUG: Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV q2 weeks|RADIATION: Proton or Photon SBRT (3-5 fractions; various dose and fractionation regimens depending on treatment site).
Objective response rate (ORR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria for locoregional arm, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria, and will be evaluated for both the lesion(s) treated with SBRT, referred to as "Target lesion (+SBRT+Nivo), as well as the lesion(s) not treated with SBRT (if applicable), referred to as "Target lesion (+Nivo only)", per the prescribed treatment. The primary endpoint for the locoregional arm will be considered met if the assumption and desired outcome are achieved for ORR in the "Target lesion(s) (+SBRT+Nivo)". Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the start date of immunotherapy and the date of progression using iRECIST 1.1 criteria., From start date of immunotherapy to disease progression; up to 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria for metastatic arm, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria, and will be evaluated for both the lesion(s) treated with SBRT, referred to as "Target lesion (+SBRT+Nivo), as well as the lesion(s) not treated with SBRT, referred to as "Target lesion (+Nivo only)", per the prescribed treatment. The primary endpoint for the metastatic arm will be considered met if the assumption and desired outcome are achieved for ORR in the "Target lesion(s) (+Nivo only)" since these are the lesions we hypothesize will have an augmented response from proton SBRT through the abscopal effect. Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the start date of immunotherapy and the date of progression using iRECIST 1.1 criteria., From start date of immunotherapy to disease progression; up to 2 years
Local control rate for both arms, From start date of immunotherapy to disease local progression; up to 1 year|Overall Survival Time for both arms, From start date of immunotherapy to date of death, up to 2 years|Overall Survival for both arms, From start date of immunotherapy to 3, 6, 9, and 12 month|Progression-free survival for both arms, From start date of immunotherapy to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first; assessed up to 2 years|Time to progression (TTP), From start date of immunotherapy to disease progression, but does not count patients who die from other causes; assessed up to 2 years|New development of distant metastasis for both arms, From start date of immunotherapy to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first; assessed up to 2 years|Quality of Life for both arms, Quality of life will be assessed through questionaire EORTC QLQ-H\&N35, From start date of immunotherapy (baseline evaluation) to approximately 6 months after enrollment at Day 45, 90, 130, and 170|Quality of Life for both arms, Quality of life will be assessed through questionaire Mayo PRO for Head and Neck, From start date of immunotherapy (baseline evaluation) to approximately 6 months after enrollment at Day 45, 90, 130, and 170|Adverse Effects for both arms, From start date of immunotherapy (baseline evaluation) to approximately 6 months after enrollment at Day 45, 90, 130 and 170|Predictive and prognostic biomarkers for both arms, a maximum of 5 blood draws will be used, Baseline, Day 15-30, 45, 90 and 130
