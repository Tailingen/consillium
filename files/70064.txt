GPED Regimen for Relapsed/Refractory or Advanced ENKTCL
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine, pegaspargase, etoposide, and dexamethasone (GPED) in the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory or advanced NK/T-cell lymphoma patients (ENKTCL).

2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate, PFS is defined as date of enrollment to date of disease progression, relapse, death of any reason, or last follow-up, whichever comes first., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months

Pegaspargase is the cornor stone for the treatment of ENKTCL, and gemcitabine has been shown to be active in ENKTCL. For several patients with relapsed/refractory or advance ENKTCL, hemophagocytic sysdrome (HPS) occurs, and the prognosis is very poor. Studies have found that etoposide and dexamethasone may be effective in controlling HPS. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the role of gemcitabine, pegaspargase, etoposide, and dexamethasone (GPED) in the treatment of relapsed/refractory or advance ENKTCL, wishing to improve the prognosis for these patients.
