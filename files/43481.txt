Living Conditions and Breast Cancer
The main objective of this study is to estimate of the link (odds ratio) between the precariousness defined by the score SPICE (2 groups: precarious and insecure) and stage at diagnosis (2 groups: CAS: stages 1 or 2 the "good prognosis "versus the witnesses: stage 3 or 4 bad prognosis).
Breast Neoplasms
The odds ratio for having a stage I-II diagnosis versus a stage III-IV diagnosis according to EPICE score category (social fragility versus no social fragility)., The main criterion is the estimation of the link (odds ratio) between the precariousness defined by the score SPICE (2 groups: precarious and insecure) and stage at diagnosis (2 groups: CAS: stages 1 or 2 the "good prognosis "versus the witnesses: stage 3 or 4 bad prognosis)., Baseline (Day 0; cross-sectional study)
Our secondary objectives include:

* To study the link between cancer stage at diagnosis and diverse parameters describing living conditions
* To construct a new score for social fragility based on new data collected in this study, and to compare this score with the EPICES score
* To study patient quality of life at study baseline
