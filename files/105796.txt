Defactinib Combined With Pembrolizumab and Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Cancer
In pancreatic cancer, targeting the tumor microenvironment has become a promising therapeutic strategy. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway activation is essential for promoting a fibrotic and inflammatory tumor microenvironment, and FAK inhibitors have demonstrated reasonable anti-tumor activity in the preclinical setting. Furthermore, a maximal synergetic effect was achieved when a FAK inhibitor was given in combination with a PD-1 antagonist and chemotherapy in multiple pancreas tumor animal models. This supports the concept of using FAK inhibitors to reduce stromal fibrosis during checkpoint immunotherapeutic treatment. Therefore, these robust preclinical findings will be tested in the proposed phase I trial.

Recommended phase II dose, * The recommended phase II dose will be determined from the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) found in the dose escalation cohort.
* The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle (21 days). Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached or the completion of cycle 5., Completion of the first cycle of all patients enrolled (approximately 25 months)
Safety and toxicity as measured by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated average of 7 months)|Objective response rate (ORR) in dose escalation cohort, * The definition of ORR is the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response or a partial response
* The definition of complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and no new lesions
* The definition of partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions and no new lesions, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Objective response rate (ORR) in dose expansion cohort, * The definition of ORR is the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response or a partial response
* The definition of complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and no new lesions
* The definition of partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions and no new lesions, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Treatment duration in dose escalation cohort, Completion of treatment (estimated average of 6 months)|Treatment duration in dose expansion cohort, Completion of treatment (estimated average of 6 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS) in dose escalation cohort, * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, appearance of one more new lesions, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Progression-free survival in dose expansion cohort, * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, appearance of one more new lesions, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Overall survival (OS) in dose escalation cohort, -OS: duration of time from start of treatment to time of death from any cause, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Overall survival in dose expansion cohort, -OS: duration of time from start of treatment to time of death from any cause, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Immune-related PFS in dose escalation cohort, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)|Immune-related PFS in dose expansion cohort, Up to 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated average to be 36 months)
