Iressa 2nd Line Phase III Study in Japan
In this study, among the patients with non-small cell lung cancer, those with metastasis or recurrence and previous treatment with chemotherapy will receive gefitinib or docetaxel, and we will compare the effectiveness and safety of gefitinib with docetaxel.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Gefitinib or Docetaxel
Determine the overall survival with these treatments as the primary outcome.
Determine the followings as the secondary outcome variables:|- Progression-free survival (PFS)|- Time to treatment failure (TTF)|- Objective tumour response (CR, PR) and the disease control rate (CR, PR, SD [â‰¥12 weeks]) based on the RECIST guidelines|- Lung cancer subscale (LCS)|- QOL according to FACT-L questionnaire|- Frequency and severity of adverse events.|Determine the followings as the exploratory outcome variables:|- Biomarkers related to expression, activation and dimerisation of EGFR and other ErbB family receptors and associated pathways including downstream signalling pathways|- Biomarkers related to somatic (non-inheritable) mutation analyses of genes of the ErbB family, their signalling pathways and associated pathways which are thought to be influenced by gefitinib in tumour cells.
