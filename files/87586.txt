DB107-Retroviral Replicating Vector (RRV) Combined With DB107-Flucytosine (FC) in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma or Anaplastic Astrocytoma
The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigational products, DB107-RRV and DB107-FC, as a combination treatment will shrink high-grade glioma (HGG) in patients with recurrent/progressive, resectable or unresectable disease and increase the time that disease is controlled.
High Grade Glioma|Anaplastic Astrocytoma
DRUG: DB107-RRV|DRUG: DB107-FC
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as duration from initiation of treatment to the point of disease progression or death., Up to 24 Months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) refers to the duration from the initiation of enrollment until death, regardless of the cause., Up to 24 Months
Assessment of Tumor Status Measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) Criteria, To evaluate the radiological response in participants with recurrent HGG based on overall response (CR) or partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) per the Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria., Up to 5 Years|Number of Treatment Related Toxicities, Number of treatment related toxicities will be assessed by the development of treatment-related ≥ Grade 3 adverse events as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 5 Years|Durable Response Rate (DRR), Durable response rate (DRR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose best response to treatment is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) lasting at least 24 weeks as evidenced by MRI. DDR is calculated as the total number of patients with CR or PR lasting at least 24 weeks., Up to 5 Years|Durable Clinical Benefit Rate (DCBR), Durable clinical benefit rate (DCBR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR or PR lasting at least 24 weeks or SD lasting at least 12 months according to modified RANO criteria as evidenced by MRI imaging. Durable clinical benefit rate is calculated as the total number of patients with CR or PR ≥ 24 weeks or with SD \> 12 months., Up to 5 Years|Duration of Durable Response Rate, Duration of durable response (DDR) is the tabulation of the total number of patients with CR, PR, SD, and PD at 12 months after surgery., 12 Months
