Escalation Study to Determine Bioavailability of a Single Oral Dose of Decitabine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The purpose of this study is to determine how the body absorbs decitabine when taken orally in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Safety will also be assessed for this oral dose.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: decitabine|DRUG: decitabine|DRUG: decitabine|DRUG: decitabine
Pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints will be decitabine PK parameters: Tmax, Cmax, AUC0-inf, t1/2 and F., Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2 from predose up to 6 hours after administration.
Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse events (AEs), medical history, physical examinations, vital signs measurements, use of concomitant medications, and laboratory assessments at baseline and throughout the study period., Up to 30 days after the last dose of decitabine
Cohorts are dosed sequentially, and escalation may stop before the 5th cohort is dosed. Each cycle will be approximately 4 weeks in length. Following Cycle 1, patients may receive an additional 4 follow-up cycles of decitabine. Cycles 2-5 will include a 20 mg/m\^2 1-hour IV infusion of decitabine on Days 1-5 for all cohorts.
