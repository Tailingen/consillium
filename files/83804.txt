Registry for Analysis of Quality of Life, Normal Organ Toxicity and Survival of Pediatric Patients Treated With Proton Therapy
The study aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of proton therapy on quality of life and long-term normal tissue toxicities of the pediatric cancer patients. Based on these results, the predictive model of long-term normal tissue toxicities, survival, and quality of life could be recognized. Risk-adapted treatment strategy based on the predictive model in pediatric cancer patients could be established.
