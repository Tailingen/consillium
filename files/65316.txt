Phase II Study of Biaxin, Revlimid, and Dexamethasone for Untreated Multiple Myeloma
PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

* To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of clarithromycin (Biaxin®), lenalidomide (Revlimid™), and dexamethasone (Decadron®) as an induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).
* To evaluate the safety of the combination of clarithromycin, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone as an induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM.

SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

* To examine the role of clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetic properties of dexamethasone and lenalidomide.
* To examine the angiogenesis profile in untreated patients and in patients receiving induction therapy.
