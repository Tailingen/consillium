Study of the Safety and Efficacy of TH-302 in Combination With Gemcitabine Compared With Gemcitabine Alone in Previously Untreated Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Gemcitabine versus Gemcitabine and TH-302 are effective in the treatment of subjects with first-line metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemzar (Gemcitabine)|DRUG: TH-302|DRUG: TH-302
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year
A hypoxic microenvironment is a characteristic of many solid tumors including pancreatic cancer. The presence of hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy. The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively physiologically target the hypoxic microenvironment. There is an absence of therapeutic options for subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine provides clinical benefit as a single agent, but median survival is about 6 months. Combining gemcitabine with TH-302 may enable the targeting of both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of pancreatic cancer.
