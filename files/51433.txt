LEVANTIS-0093A: GAGomes for Multi-Cancer Early Detection in High-Risk Adults (LEV93A)
LEVANTIS-0093A (LEV93A) is a prospective cohort observational clinical study to validate the plasma free GAGome MCED test in adults at high risk of developing cancer ("high-risk adults"), specifically in 55-80-year-old adults with significant smoking history.

LEV93A will use plasma biospecimens collected within the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial Biomarker sub-study and corresponding participant data prospectively collected within the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial (YLST) and the Yorkshire Kidney Screening Trial (YKST) all of which are sponsored by the University of Leeds and funded by Yorkshire Cancer Research (Award references: L403, L403B L403C), in collaboration with the University of Leeds, with the University of Manchester and with the Leeds Teaching Hospitals.
