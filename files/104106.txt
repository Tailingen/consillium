International, multicenter, comparative, open-label, parallel-group, mixed Observational-Randomized Controlled Trial.

All the patients, who are candidate for the study will receive full information on the characteristics, potential effectiveness and side effects of the two alternatives treatments: radiotherapy (RT) and surgical treatment Eligible patients will be asked to be randomized in order to receive treatment A (surgery, with or without RT) or treatment B (definitive RT) Who will refuse randomization will be included in the Prospective Cohort Study (PCS) and will be treated accordingly to their choice (treatment option A or treatment option B).

The same radiotherapy and surgical regimen will be administered in the PCS and in the Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) cohort
