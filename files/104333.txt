Prediction of the Response to Neoadjuvant Radiation Chemotherapy Through Texture Analysis Derived From Medical Imaging
In patient with complete pathological response, surgery could be omitted without compromising progression-free or overall survival. A powerful prediction model is needed to guide management of this population.

Radiomics features provide complementary information about tumor heterogenity.

The aim of the investigators is to develop a model combining clinical and radiomic criteria able to predict complete pathological response.
Rectal Cancer
Prediction of the complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, defined as the absence of tumor residue on the surgical specimen, ypT0N0, TO = Immediately after biopsy and extension evaluation.
