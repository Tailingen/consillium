Pacritinib Versus Best Available Therapy to Treat Patients With Myelofibrosis and Thrombocytopenia
Phase 3, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral pacritinib compared to Best Available Therapy (BAT) in patients with thrombocytopenia and primary or secondary myelofibrosis.
Primary Myelofibrosis|Post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis|Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis
DRUG: Pacritinib|DRUG: Best Available Therapy
Spleen Volume Reduction, Proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)., Baseline to Week 24|Total Symptom Score (TSS) Reduction, Proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in the total symptom score from baseline to Week 24 on the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form 2.0 (MPN-SAF TSS 2.0). Responses (on a scale from 0 \[absent\] to 10 \[worst imaginable\]) to questions about symptoms (tiredness, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, and pain under the ribs on the left side) were used to calculate the TSS., Baseline to Week 24
Multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of pacritinib with that of BAT in patients with thrombocytopenia and primary or secondary myelofibrosis. Approximately 300 eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to pacritinib 400 mg dosed QD, pacritinib 200 mg dosed BID, or BAT (includes any physician-selected treatment for myelofibrosis, such as approved JAK2 inhibitors administered according to package insert for patients with thrombocytopenia, and may include any treatment received before study entry). Spleen volume will be measured by MRI or CT at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter. An independent radiology facility (IRF), blind to treatment assignments, will measure spleen volumes. Patients will also be followed for safety, Leukemia Free Survival (LFS), Overall Survival (OS), frequency of red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions, and other exploratory endpoints. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate the safety of pacritinib.
