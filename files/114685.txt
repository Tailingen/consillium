Study of Gemzar®, Taxotere®, and Xeloda® (GTX) in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (Stage IVB)
This study is designed to determine whether an investigational drug combination consisting of Gemzar®, Taxotere®, and Xeloda®, (called GTX) is safe and effective in treating advanced pancreatic cancer and to study and enhance the utility of PET scans in the evaluation of patients with pancreatic cancer.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine, Docetaxel, Capecitabine
To Determine Response Rate to the GTX Regimen in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer, Data was not analyzed because original PI left institution before data analysis was completed., 10 weeks
Determine Overall and One Year Survival Rates, Data was not analyzed because original PI left institution before data analysis was completed., One year|Toxicity Assessment, Data was not analyzed because original PI left institution before data analysis was completed., Every month
This Phase II multicenter study is designed to determine the response rate to a biochemically synergistic regimen with Gemzar, Taxotere, and Xeloda in patients with Stage IVB metastatic pancreatic cancer. It will further determine the overall and one year survival rates, the diseasefree interval, and the toxicities for this regimen in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
