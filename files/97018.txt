Preoperative Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The aims of the trial are (1) to determine the tolerability rate in the setting of a multi-centre study and (2) to determine secondary tolerability endpoints, toxicity rates and complete pathologic response rate in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are treated with an integrated preoperative radiotherapy with FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen.
