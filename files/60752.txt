A Study of Therapeutic Amplitude-modulated Electromagnetic Fields in Advanced Tumors
In vitro studies suggest that low levels of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields may modify cell growth. We have identified specific frequencies that may block cancer cell growth. We have developed a device delivering low levels of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields. The device is connected to a spoon-like coupler, which is placed in the patient's mouth during treatment. We will conduct a feasibility study consisting of three daily ambulatory treatments until disease progression.

Background: In vitro studies suggest that low levels of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields may modify cell growth. We have identified specific frequencies that may block cancer cell growth. We have developed a portable and programmable device delivering low levels of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields. The device is connected to a spoon-like coupler, which is placed in the patient's mouth during treatment.

Methods: We will conducted a feasibility study consisting of three daily treatments. All patients with advanced solid tumors and measurable disease will be eligible, irrespective of prior treatments. Patients will be assessed with laboratory exams (complete blood count, comprehensive profile, tumor markers), imaging studies every other month for the first six months, every third month thereafter.
