Fosaprepitant + 5HT3 Receptor Antagonists + Dexamethasone in Germ Cell Tumors
The hypothesis is that the substitution of multi-day oral aprepitant with (intravenous) IV fosaprepitant, in combination with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RA) + dexamethasone will provide comparable protection from 5 day cisplatin chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, compared to the results of our prior study of aprepitant. This study will be the first clinical trial evaluating fosaprepitant in patients receiving multi-day cisplatin. This will be a single arm, phase II study. The investigators propose to utilize intravenous (IV) fosaprepitant on days 3 and 5 of the 5-day cisplatin chemotherapy regimen. It is anticipated that fosaprepitant can suppress delayed chemo-induced nausea and vomiting for 2-5 days after therapy. This study will test the value of fosaprepitant in this patient population.
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting
DRUG: Fosaprepitant|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: 5HT3
Percentage of Participants With Complete Response of Acute and Delayed Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting, complete response (CR) of both acute (days 1 through 5) and delayed (days 6 through 8) CINV, defined by no emetic episodes or use of rescue medications, Days 1-8 of chemotherapy regimen
Total Number of Emetic Episodes, total number of emetic episodes, Days 1-8 of chemotherapy regimen|Use of Rescue Medications., Total number of patients who received rescue medications., Days 1-8 of chemotherapy regimen|Self-Reported Assessment of Nausea, the patient's self-reported assessment of nausea Days 1-8 using a 0-100mm visual analog scale (VAS) median.

The Visual Analouge (VAS) 100mm Scale Score for Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV). Participants were asked to mark a linear scale 100mm in length representing their level of nausea with 0mm indicating no nausea and 100mm indicating severe nausea. Median VAS scores (in mm) are reported, per day., Days 1-8 of chemotherapy regimen
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

Treatment Regimen:

Patients must have no nausea and/or vomiting for 24 hours and must not have used other anti-emetics for 72 hours prior to starting protocol treatment. Treatment must not start until this criteria is satisfied.

Any germ cell chemotherapy regimen utilizing cisplatin (20mg/m\^2 x 5 days). This will usually be combined with bleomycin (BEP), etoposide (EP), ifosfamide (VIP), vinblastine (VeIP), paclitaxel (TIP) or epirubicin. All of these regimens get the identical cisplatin, which is the only highly emetic drug in any of the chemo regimens.

Acute emesis prophylaxis (administered per institutional standards prior to chemotherapy):

* Any 5HT3 receptor antagonist may be used days 1 through 5 or days 1, 3 and 5 if palonosetron is used per institutional standards.
* Dexamethasone 20mg PO (orally) daily, days 1 and 2
* Fosaprepitant 150mg IV on day 3

Delayed emesis prophylaxis:

* Fosaprepitant 150mg IV on day 5
* Dexamethasone 4mg PO BID (twice a day) on days 6, 7 and 8

PRN (as needed) antiemetics allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator

* No additional doses of 5HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or fosaprepitant will be given during the acute or delayed treatment periods
