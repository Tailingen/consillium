Study of Magrolimab Combination Therapy in Patients With Non-Surgically Removable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
The goals of this clinical study are to learn about the safety, tolerability, dosing and effectiveness of magrolimab in combination with nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel (cohort 1) or with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (cohort 2) in patients with non-surgically removable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Magrolimab|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy
Safety Run-in Cohorts: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Adverse Events (AEs), and Laboratory Abnormalities According to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE), Version 5.0, First dose date up to 35 months|Phase 2 Cohort 1: PFS as Determined by Investigator Assessment Using RECIST Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the earliest date of documented disease progression, as determined by investigator assessment per RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 35 months|Cohort 2 (Safety Run-In Cohort 2 and Phase 2 Cohort 2): Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by Investigator Assessment Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 35 months
Phase 2 Cohort 1: Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by Investigator Assessment, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as measured by RECIST version 1.1, as determined by investigator assessment., Up to 35 months|Cohort 2 (Safety Run-in Cohort 2 and Phase 2 Cohort 2): PFS as Determined by Investigator Assessment Using RECIST Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the earliest date of documented disease progression, as determined by investigator assessment per RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 35 months|Phase 2 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Safety Run-in Cohort 2 and Phase 2 Cohort 2): Duration of Response (DOR) as Determined by Investigator Assessment per RECIST Version 1.1, DOR is defined as time from first documentation of complete response or partial response to the earliest date of documented disease progression, as determined by investigator assessment per RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 35 months|Phase 2 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Safety Run-in Cohort 2 and Phase 2 Cohort 2): Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from date of randomization to death from any cause., Up to 35 months|Phase 2 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Safety Run-in Cohort 2 and Phase 2 Cohort 2): Percentage of Participants Experiencing AEs and Laboratory Abnormalities According to NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0, First dose date up to 35 months|Magrolimab Concentration Versus Time, Up to end of treatment (approximately 35 months)|Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) to Magrolimab, Up to end of treatment (approximately 35 months)
The primary objective of this study for the safety run-in cohorts of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of magrolimab in combination with nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel (Safety Run-In Cohort 1), and sacituzumab govitecan (Safety Run-In Cohort 2) in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).

The primary objective of this study for Phase 2 Cohort 1 is to compare the efficacy of magrolimab in combination with nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel versus nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone, as determined by progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment.

The primary objective of this study for Phase 2 Cohort 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of magrolimab in combination with sacituzumab govitecan as determined by confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment.
