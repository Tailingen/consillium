D2C7-IT + 2141-V11 Combination Post-resection in rGBM
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of D2C7-IT+2141-V11 administered in the non-enhancing tumor of patients with resected recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) via convection enhanced delivery (CED), followed by subcutaneous cervical perilymphatic injections (CPLIs) of 2141-V11 2 and 4 weeks post infusion, then every 3 weeks for a year, and every 4-6 weeks thereafter if patients benefit from therapy.
Recurrent Glioblastoma IDH Wildtype
DRUG: D2C7-IT|DRUG: 2141 V11
Primary Outcome - Safety, Describe the safety of the combination of D2C7-IT+2141-V11 administered in non-enhancing tumor of recurrent GBM patients via CED, followed by cervical perilymphatic subcutaneous injections of 2141-V11.

The proportion of patients who experience unacceptable toxicity will be reported., 5 years|Primary Outcome - Efficacy, To assess overall survival defined as the time between initiation of treatment with D2C7-IT+2141-V11 and death or last follow-up if alive.

Median overall survival will be reported, 6 years
Approximately 46 evaluable patients will be enrolled in this study. Enrolled patients must have previously undergone maximal safe surgical tumor resection, with histopathologic confirmation of recurrence of GBM. Post-operative MRI also must have demonstrated a residual area of non-enhancing disease (as assessed by T2/ FLAIR images) that is amenable to infusion (no larger than 3 x 3 cm of residual enhancing disease).

Study participants will receive D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 infused in the residual disease via CED followed by repeated, imaging guided injections of 2141-V11 in the cervical perilymphatic subcutaneous area ipsilateral to the tumor.
