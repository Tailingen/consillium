HRCT in Prediction of Tumor Invasion in GGO Lung Adenocarcinoma (ECTOP-1008)
This study is one of Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Projects (ECTOP-1008). It aims to evaluate the correlation between radiological diagnosis based on HRCT and pathological invasiveness.Investigators observe the radiological features and the correlation with the postoperative pathological findings.
Adenocarcinoma of Lung
Sensitivity, Diagnostic sensitivity of pathologic tumor invasion evaluated by HRCT, Pathologic reports were available, usually 1 month after surgery
Value of radiologic parameters for tumor invasion, The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the invasion prediction model based on radiologic parameters., Pathologic reports were available, usually 1 month after surgery
Preoperative evaluation of pathologic tumor invasion of ground glass opacity (GGO) featured lung adenocarcinoma is important for selection of appropriate surgical extent. Whether thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan could precisely predict pathologic tumor invasion remains unknown. Patients with peripheral GGO nodules (GGNs) would be enrolled, and HRCT with target scan would be performed preoperatively. Pathologic tumor invasion (invasive adenocarcinoma \[IAD\] versus adenocarcinoma in situ \[AIS\]/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma \[MIA\]) would be evaluated according to radiologic parameters of HRCT before surgery. Primary endpoint of this trial is the diagnostic sensitivity of pathologic tumor invasion evaluated by HRCT. Secondary endpoint is the diagnostic value of radiologic parameters of HRCT for pathologic tumor invasion of GGO featured lung adenocarcinoma.
