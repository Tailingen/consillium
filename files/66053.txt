Tislelizumab Combined With Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant tislelizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell cancer. The tumor microenvironment and circulating immunological biomarkers in these patients were further evaluated to explore the factors affecting the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer. This study will provide valuable information for further prospective clinical trials of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapy in esophageal cancer patients.
