Real-world Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Early-stage Lung Cancer After the Surgery
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the efficacy and long-term clinical outcomes of early-stage lung cancer patients who have received surgery using the real-world data. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the best surgical strategy for patients with early-stage lung cancer?
* What are the risk factors for early-stage lung cancer? Participants will receive surgery and the study will analyze the real-world data.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Sublobar resection|OTHER: Lobectomy
Disease-free survival(DFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence)., Defined as the time from the date of surgery until the date of first documented progression or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), whichever came first, assessed up to 10 years.
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from surgery time until death from any cause., From date of diagnosis until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 10 years.|5-year Overall Survival (overall survival) Rate, The time from surgery time until death from any cause, estimated from a Kaplan Meier plot of OS at the time of the primary analysis., From date of surgery until date of death due to any cause. Assessed at 5 years.|Patterns of Relapse, Relapse was defined as disease recurrence at any site., Within 10 years after surgery|Perioperative Complication rate, Complications after the surgery, Within 6 months after surgery
This observational study aims to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and long-term clinical outcomes of surgical interventions in early-stage lung cancer patients, utilizing real-world data.

Central to this investigation are two key questions:

* What is the optimal surgical approach for managing early-stage lung cancer?
* What are the primary risk factors associated with the development of early-stage lung cancer? Participants will undergo surgical procedures, and through rigorous analysis of real-world data, this study endeavors to provide nuanced insights into these fundamental queries, fostering advancements in clinical decision-making and patient management strategies.
