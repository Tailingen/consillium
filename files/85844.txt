CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for GD2 Positive Glioma Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with GD2 positive glioma patients.
GD2 Positive Glioma|CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T cell immunotherapy
The effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）, 3 months
Progress free survival（PFS）, 1 year
Overall survival（OS）, 3 years
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant receptor with both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic malignancies and solid malignant tumors.This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen receptor aiming at GD2 antigen. After CAR-T cell infusion, At periodic intervals, the investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.Through this study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with GD2 positive glioma patients.
