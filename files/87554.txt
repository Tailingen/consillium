A Randomized Trial of Letters From Family Physicians to Encourage Screening Mammography in Overdue Women
A randomized, double-blinded study conducted in British Columbia, Canada, where there is a publicly funded, organized screening program and screening mammography is recommended at 24-month intervals. Eligible women aged 51-73 years old and overdue for their screening mammogram by 6-24 months are identified in the database of the Screening Mammography Program of BC (SMPBC). Family physicians are recruited by mail and asked to sign letters to the overdue women in their practices. The overdue women are randomized and mailed either the signed reminder letter and the standard reminder postcard, or the standard reminder postcard alone. The primary endpoint is the proportion of overdue women attending a screening mammogram appointment 6 months after the mailing.
