The Influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI )Assisted Polyp Detection (Discovery System) on Visual Gaze Patterns During Real-time Colonoscopy
In this study, the investigators aim to assess the influence of a computer-aided detection (CADe) system on the visual gaze patterns of endoscopists in order to further understand the effect of AI during real-time colonoscopy.
