A Study of TQB2450 in Subjects With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
This study is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,placebo parallel controlled, multi-centre,phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2450 with or without anlotinib compared with placebo as consolidation treatment in subjects with locally advanced/unresectable (Stage III) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer that has not progressed after prior concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy.
Stage III Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: TQB2450|DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: TQB2450(blank)|DRUG: Anlotinib(blank)
Progression Free Survival (PFS) evaluated by Independent Review Committee(IRC), PFS defined as the time from randomization until the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, based on IRC., up to 33 months
PFS evaluated by Investigator, PFS defined as the time from randomization until the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, based on investigator., up to 33 months|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Participants who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., up to 5 years|Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., up to 33 months|Disease control rate（DCR）, Percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)., up to 33 months|Duration of response（DOR）, The time when the participants first achieved complete or partial remission to disease progression., up to 33 months|PFS rate at month 6, The percentage of PFS at month 6, up to 6 months|PFS rate at month 12, The percentage of PFS at month 12, up to 12 months|Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression, etc., Tissue samples were collected during the screening period for pd-l1 analysis. Blood samples were collected for Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) test before enrollment (within 7 days before medication) and after exit (±3 days)., up to 33 months|Immunogenicity, such as the incidence of ADA, Degree of the immune response caused by the drug., on day 1, 42, 105, 189 and 90 days after the last administration.
