Additional 4 Cycles of Cisplatin (CDDP4) in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Achievement of pathologic complete response is important prognosticator to predict long term outcome in triple negative cancer. The efficacy of adding 4 cycles of cisplatin (CDDP4) is to be investigated whether addtional pathologic complete response is achieved for those triple negative breast cancer patients who recieved 4 cycles of adriamycin with cyclophosphamide(AC4) but did not reach clinical complete response during the course of neoadjuvant therapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: AC4-CDDP4
pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, Rate of pCR (as defined by NSABP \[National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project\] criteria - absence of invasive disease in the breast \[ypT0\]) at the time of surgery., up to 36 weeks
Overall response rate (ORR) by radiologic evaluation, after completion of chemotherapy Overall objective clinical response rate = CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) rate, measured by US (or MRI) and assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), up to 36 weeks|Complete metabolic response (CMR) rate after 2 cycles of AC, after 2 cycles of AC, up to 12 weeks|3 year disease free survival (3yr-DFS), 3 years|Rate of breast conservation, after surgery, up to 36 weeks
