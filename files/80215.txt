Posoleucel (ALVR105, Formerly Viralym-M) for Multi-Virus Prevention in Patients Post-Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate posoleucel (ALVR105, formerly Viralym-M); an allogeneic, off-the-shelf multi-virus specific T cell therapy that targets six viral pathogens: BK virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6 and JC virus.

This is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial comparing posoleucel to placebo for the prevention of infection or disease due to AdV, BKV, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, or JCV in high-risk adult and pediatric patients after allogeneic HCT.

There are 2 parts to the study, an open label Phase 2 cohort described in this posting, and a randomized, placebo controlled Phase 3 cohort described in NCT05305040. In the Phase 2 part, 25 to 35 eligible allogeneic HCT recipients will be enrolled and will receive 7 doses of posoleucel over 12 weeks, followed by a 14 week follow-up period.
