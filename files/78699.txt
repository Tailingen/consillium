A Phase I Study of RGT-264 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of RGT-264 as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: RGT-264 phosphate tablets
Number of subjects with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) at each cohort dose level in dose escalation stage, DLTs will be evaluated from Day 1 (the day of the first dose) to Day 21 after first dose of study treatment in escalation stage. Number of DLTs will be used in dose ascending and descending decisions., Day 1 to Day 21 after first dose (21 days)|Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), AEs will be characterized by type, seriousness, relationship to study treatment, severity (as graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] version 5.0) and timing., From screening (Day -28 to Day -1) through up to 12 months or until disease progression
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), Blood and urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., PK Blood (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15; PK Urine (Cycle 1 Day 1) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Maximum concentration (Cmax), Blood and urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., PK Blood (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15; PK Urine (Cycle 1 Day 1) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Elimination half-life (t1/2), Blood and urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., PK Blood (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15; PK Urine (Cycle 1 Day 1) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Area under the concentration-time curve over time 0 to t (AUC0-t), Blood and urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., PK Blood (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15; PK Urine (Cycle 1 Day 1) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Area under the concentration-time curve over time 0 to infinite (AUC0-inf), Blood and urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., PK Blood (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15; PK Urine (Cycle 1 Day 1) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Accumulation ratio (Rac), Blood and urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., PK Blood (Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15; PK Urine (Cycle 1 Day 1) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Cumulative urinary excretion, Urine samples will be collected for PK analyses for subjects enrolled in dose escalation stage., Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Tumor Response, Tumor response measured by radiologic imaging techniques at baseline and throughout the study. The same radiologic imaging techniques for each respective patient will be used throughout. Tumor response will be assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Screening until disease progression, initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy, death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or meeting other end-of-study criteria (whichever occurs first) (Assessed up to 12 months).
This first-in-human (FIH) study of RGT-264 will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of RGT-264 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of RGT-264 as monotherapy, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RGT-264. The secondary objectives include the assessments of PK profile and preliminary efficacy of RGT-264.
