Radiosurgery of Ganglion StELlatum In Patients With REFractory Angina Pectoris
The core hypothesis to be tested is that the radiosurgery of stellate ganglion (left one or both if left-sided without full relief of symptoms) is an effective therapy of refractory angina pectoris in patients with no other therapeutic options - proof of concept study.
Coronary Artery Disease|Angina Pectoris|Myocardial Ischemia
PROCEDURE: Radiosurgery of ganglion stellatum
Seattle Angina Questionnaire, The Seattle Angina Questionnaire is a cardiac disease-related quality-of-life measure with 19 items. A lower score corresponds to a lower level of functioning. The scores are classified as "minimal (scores 75-100), mild (50-74), moderate (25-49), and severe (0-24)., 24 months|Safety of radiosurgery of ganglion stellatum, Safety of radiosurgery of ganglion stellatum will be observed and assessed according to the occurrence of adverse events, 24 months
Usage of angina pectoris relief drugs, The change of angina pectoris relief drugs will be evaluated, 24 months|Six-minute walk test improvement, Change in the six-minute walk test will be evaluated before and after the procedure, 24 months
Design: prospective, interventional trial (University Hospital Ostrava, Cardiocentre AGEL Podlesi Hospital Trinec)

* radiosurgery of left GS after confirmation of responding to anesthetic blockade
* in case of remaining AP after three months, radiosurgery of right GS in case of response confirmation to anesthetic blockade (patients must be responders of anesthetic blockade of left stellate ganglion)
* Seattle Angina Questionary (SAQ) and amount of nitrate usage for responding confirmation
* Radiotherapy 40 Gy
* 2-year follow-up
* Scheduled follow-up visits: 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (24)

Preliminary examination: selective coronary angiography, transthoracic echocardiography, stress test, 6 min walk test, SAQ (19-item)

Endopoints:

Primary Endpoints: SAQ, safety of the radiosurgery of GS Secondary Endpoints:usage decrease of angina relief drugs, 6 min walk test improvement

Follow-up visits examination, Restage: 6 min walk test, SAQ, amount of nitrate usage, ECG, blood tests incl. NT-proBNP, NSE
