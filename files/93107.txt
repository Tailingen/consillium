Tranexamic Acid After Pathological Fracture Treated With Modular Arthroplasty
This study assesses the safety and efficacy of TXA for patients treated for pathological femur fractures using modular prosthetics.
Metastases to Bone
DRUG: Tranexamic acid injection
Number of participants who require a blood transfusion., Need of blood transfusion, During Hospitalization (up to day 10)
Estimeted blood lost after surgery., Gross total blood loss was estimated utilizing the formula PBV Ã— (Hctpre- Hctpost)/Hcta, During Hospitalization (up to day 3)|Number of participants with embolic complication., Yes or No, During Hospitalization (up to day 10)
Tranexamic acid is an efficacious medication for curtailing blood loss, haemoglobin drop, and the requirement for transfusions. Additionally, it is a secure medication, even when administered to oncology patients receiving reduction haemarthroplasty for pathological femoral fractures.
