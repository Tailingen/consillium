Effect of Ultrasound Combined With Microbubbles on Blood Perfusion in Invasive Breast Cancer
Blood perfusion insufficiency and hypoxia are the main causes of drug resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer. Increasing blood perfusion can improve drug delivery. The cavitation effect of ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMBs) is known to enhance tumor blood perfusion, so we conducted a prospective human study to investigate the effects of USMBs on hemoperfusion in invasive breast cancer (IBC).

changes in peak intensity (PI), PI represents the quantitative scale of the highest average concentration of microbubble (MB) in the region of interest (ROI); thus, a larger PI corresponds to a higher concentration of MB in the ROI., 15 minutes after the USMB procedure|area under the curve (AUC), AUC represents the total amount of MB passing through the ROI during perfusion; thus, a larger AUC corresponds to greater perfusion in the ROI., 15 minutes after the USMB procedure|percentage increase in the perfusion area (%) of tumor, The percentage increase in the perfusion area (%) was calculated as follows: (perfusion area after the USMB procedure - perfusion area before the USMB procedure) × 100%/perfusion area before the USMB procedure. The greater "percentage increase of perfusion area (%)", the more significant the improvement of blood perfusion., 15 minutes after the USMB procedure
patients with IBC were selected from the breast surgery department of our hospital. To induce an enhanced perfusion effect, IBC tumors were treated with SonoVue® microbubbles (MBs) stimulated by ultrasound, with a mechanical index (MI) of 0.2-0.3; 1 mL of SonoVue® MBs were injected at 3.5-min intervals three times for a USMB treatment lasting 10 min. The contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) parameters peak intensity (PI), area under the curve (AUC), and perfusion area were used to evaluate the changes in blood perfusion.
