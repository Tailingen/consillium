7-hydroxystaurosporine and Topotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Progressed Small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well giving UCN-01 together with topotecan works in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that relapsed or progressed after previous chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also increase the effectiveness of topotecan by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving UCN-01 together with topotecan may kill more tumor cells.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the anti tumour activity of UCN-01 in combination with topotecan in patients with SCLC who relapsed or progressed \>= 3 months after completing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (patient with sensitive disease) using objective response rates (complete and partial).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the anti tumour activity of UCN-01 in combination with topotecan with regards to stable disease rate, median and overall survival rates as well as to determine the safety and tolerability of this combination.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR.

Patients are followed for survival.
