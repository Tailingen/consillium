Association Between Persistent Organic Pollutants and Type 2 Diabetes /Thyroid Cancer
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a class of organic pollutants in the environment characterized by persistent, bioaccumulation, long-range transport and biological toxicity. Due to its widespread distribution in the environment and Lipophilicity, POPs can bioaccumulate along the food chain and eventually accumulate in the human body. There are many types of POPs, including dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) . POPs is ubiquitous and Lipophilic in the environment, so the potential harm of POPs to human body has aroused wide concern. A growing number of studies have found that exposure to POPs may be associated with an increased risk of endocrine disease, particularly type 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Persistent organic pollutant exposure on the development ofType 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer by analyzing serum Persistent organic pollutant concentrations in controls, and patients with Type 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer.
