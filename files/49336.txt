A Safety and Pharmacokinetic Phase I/Ib Study of AMC303 in Patients With Solid Tumours
This is a two part Phase I/Ib, open-label, non-randomized and multi-center, dose escalation study with a 3+3 design (Part 1) and an expansion cohort at the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (Part 2). If MTD is not reached in Part 1, RP2D will be determined after completion of Part 1 considering safety and tolerability, also beyond the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) results.
