Positron Emission Tomography (PET) With 3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-L-enylalanine (18F-FDOPA) Study
The 18F-FDOPA PET tracer is an amino acid analogue that can be used to visualize high-grade glioma not clearly identified on diagnostic MRI. Use of 18F-FDOPA PET will permit neurosurgeons to achieve a complete resection more frequently.
Cancer (High-grace Glioma)
PROCEDURE: Surgical neuronavigation with 18F-DOPA PET imaging
The proportion of subjects that have a complete resection of the volume of 18F-FDOPA PET tracer on their postoperative 18F-FDOPA PET scan., Less than 72 hours postoperatively
