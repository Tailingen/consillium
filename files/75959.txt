The Combination of Adebrelimab, Apatinib, and Lrinotecan Liposome for Second-line Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer
This study is a prospective, dual arm, open Ib/II phase clinical trial, with the main objective of exploring the safety and efficacy of Adebrelimab combined with Apatinib and Lrinotecan liposome for second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer.

The study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety introduction period, which includes 6 patients. Observe whether the subjects experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the observation period. If no subjects experience DLT during the observation period, the study enters the next stage. The dose of Lrinotecan liposome used during the safety introduction period is 80mg/m2, and the DLTs observation period is 1 cycle. If the patient cannot tolerate it, the dose will be reduced to 60mg/m2.

In the second stage, advanced gastric cancer subjects who have progressed to first-line treatment will be included in two cohorts: those who have previously received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have first-line PFS\&amp;gt;7m (cohort 1) and those who have received standard systemic chemotherapy (cohort 2). 30 subjects will be included in each population, and a total of 66 subjects are planned to be enrolled.

The study includes a screening period (from the signing of the informed consent form by the subjects to the first treatment, not exceeding 28 days), a treatment period (Adebrelimab combined with Apatinib and Lrinotecan liposome), and a follow-up period (including safety and survival follow-up).
