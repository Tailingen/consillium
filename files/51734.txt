Study of ICP-105 in Solid Tumors Patients
Open-label, non-randomized, Phase I, dose-escalating, first-in-man study.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ICP-105
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], will be evaluated by CTCAE v4.03, Every cycle (28 days) for approximately 24 months or earlier if patient terminates from the study
Cmax, the peak plasma concentration, Every cycle (28 days) for approximately 24 months or earlier if patient terminates from the study|AUC, area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve, Every cycle (28 days) for approximately 24 months or earlier if patient terminates from the study|Apparent half-life for designated elimination phases (tÂ½), will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin, Every cycle (28 days) for approximately 24 months or earlier if patient terminates from the study
The study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period with repeated 28-day treatment cycles (duration treatment with ICP-105), and a follow-up period (within 30 days of the last dose and post-treatment follow-up 30 days after the last visit). The recruited patients receive a single dose on day 1, then after a 3-day washout period, multiple dosing will be initiated following dose-escalation schedule. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period consisted of Cycle 0 (single dose and washout period) and Cycle 1 (28-day cycle).
