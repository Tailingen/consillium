Neoadjuvant Intra-tumor Double Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer.
This phase II trial studies how well intra-tumor injection of double checkpoint inhibitors work when given alone and in combination with chemotherapy or/and bevacizumab in treating patients with previously untreated stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, pembrolizumab or durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in interventional radiological chemotherapy, such as idabubicin, can directly kill the cancer cell and release tumor antigens to activate DC function in situ. Giving intra-tumor injection of checkpoints inhibitors with or without chemotherapy and/or bevecizumab may work better than in vein infusion of the drugs in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Antibodies against CTLA4, PD1 or PDL1 are representative drugs for the check-points inhibitory agents, and their clinical indications have been approved in various types of tumors, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and late recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, et al. Those drugs are regularly systemically administrated by vein infusion, however, local delivery of those drugs via interventional radiology technique including trans-artery or intra-tumor injection may increase the local drug concentration of the tumor, improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions. CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab has been widely effectively using to combine with PD1 or PDL1 antibody and this study is to combine ipilimumab and PD1 antibody or PDL1 antibody, so called double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy, as neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC via intra-tumor admistration. To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been developed on the safety, efficacy and survival benefit of the double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy for cancer patients as neoadjuvant treatment via intra-tumor delivery. This phase II clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and survival benefit of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab or durvalumab combination with or without chemodrug and/or bevacizumab as neoaduvant therapy on patients with NSCLC, including safety, pCR, mPR, PFS, ORR, DCR, and median survival time.
