Buffered Lidocaine for Reducing Pain in Patients Undergoing Prostate Biopsy, BURN Trial
This phase I/II trial examines if buffered lidocaine reduces the pain that patients may experience during prostate biopsy. Prostate biopsies are typically performed awake, in the office, with only local anesthetic. As a result, many patients note considerable pain during these procedures. Local anesthetics such as lidocaine are typically acidic, which is thought to cause pain and burning during infiltration (injection). As a result, buffered local anesthetic has become the standard of care (SOC) in multiple specialties using awake local anesthetic. However, it has not been explored during prostate biopsies. Adminstering buffered lidocaine may reduce pain in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.

DRUG: Buffered Lidocaine (1% Lidocaine + 8.4% Sodium Bicarbonate, in a 3:1 ratio)|DRUG: Lidocaine|PROCEDURE: Biopsy of Prostate|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Pain of Local Anesthetic Injection, Pain associated with the injection of local anesthetic, assessed by a written questionnaire (Visual Analogue Scale, 0 \[least\] to 10 \[worst pain\])., Within 20 seconds of completing the injection of all local anesthetic
Pain of the Prostate Biopsy, Pain associated with the biopsies of the prostate, assessed by a questionnaire (Visual Analogue Scale, 0 \[least\] to 10 \[worst pain\])., Within 10 minutes of completing the prostate biopsy, and on post-operative day 1|Willingness to perform another prostate biopsy in the future, if medically necessary, Assessed by a questionnaire (Visual Analogue Scale, 0 \[least likely\] to 10 \[most likely\]), Within 10 minutes of completing the prostate biopsy, and on post-operative day 1|Incidence of adverse events, Will be assessed by patient self-report using an electronic written questionnaire. Will be assessed for inability to urinate, bleeding, allergic reaction, fever, or fatigue, or significant chills, or nausea/vomiting., Post-operative day 1
OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive SOC lidocaine via injection during SOC prostate biopsy on study.

ARM B: Patients receive buffered lidocaine via injection during SOC prostate biopsy on study.

After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up 1-2 days post-biopsy.
