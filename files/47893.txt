Using Circulating Tumor DNA to Personalize Duration of Consolidation Durvalumab
This research aims to incorporate ctDNA analysis into clinical practice to individualize therapy in patients with stage III NSCLC by moving to a treatment-by-marker based approach (as opposed to treatment based on clinical or radiographic evidence of disease).
NSCLC, Stage III
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Signatera ctDNA test|DRUG: Durvalumab
Determine if de-escalating number of Durvalumab cycles based on personalized ctDNA clearance has non-inferior 2-year PFS rate, Determine if de-escalating the number of Durvalumab cycles based on personalized ctDNA clearance guidance to at least 6 cycles after CRT in stage III non-resectable NSCLC has non-inferior 2-year PFS rate compared with historical control of empirically treating stage III non-resectable NSCLC for 1 year of Durvalumab after CRT., Baseline to 24 months
Estimate the 24-month overall survival (OS) of patient treated with consolidation Durvalumab based on personalized ctDNA clearance, Estimate the 24-month overall survival (OS) of patient treated with consolidation Durvalumab based on personalized ctDNA clearance guidance for at least 6 cycles after CRT in stage III non-resectable NSCLC., Baseline to 24 months|Estimate the 24-month PFS in patients with persistently detectable ctDNA without radiographic progression, Estimate the 24-month PFS in patients with persistently detectable ctDNA without radiographic progression of disease after receiving â‰¥ 6 months of consolidation Durvalumab., Baseline to 24 months
There is a critical need to identify MRD to determine which patients benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy and to optimize and personalize the duration of consolidation Durvalumab. The long-term goal is to incorporate ctDNA analysis into clinical practice to individualize therapy in patients with stage III NSCLC by moving to a treatment-by-marker based approach (as opposed to treatment based on clinical or radiographic evidence of disease). This approach may spare a subset of patients from treatment with unnecessarily excessive cycles of consolidation immunotherapy if they are already cured with CRT alone and individualize the duration of consolidation immunotherapy in patients not cured with CRT. The study team also seek to identify early in the treatment course, patients who are destined not to be cured with consolidation immunotherapy so that alternative strategies can be tested when tumor burden is low.
