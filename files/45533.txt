Activity and Safety Study of BKM120 in Monotherapy in Patient With Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Recurrent or Progressive
The aim of this study is to determine the activity, to assess the safety and tolerance of BKM120 in adult patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer progressive under platin and cetuximab-based chemotherapy.
Head and Neck Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis|Recurrent Disease|Progressive Disease
DRUG: BKM120
2 months disease control rate, Control rate= Complete response, partial response and stable disease according to RECIST 1.1, 2 months after the first BKM120 intake
Progression free survival, At 2 months, 4 months and then every 2 months|Overall survival (OS), OS will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause., Baseline, at 2 months, 4 months and then every 2 months at the end of Study|Safety, The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events based on the common toxicity criteria adverse event (CTCAE) V4.0 grade., continuous up to 30 days after the last treatment|Objective response rate, Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patient with complete or partial response according RECIST 1.1, At Baseline, 2 months, 4 months and then every 2 months, at the end of Study|Duration of response, The duration of response will be measured from the time of first documented response until the first documented disease progression or death due to underlying cancer., At Baseline, 2 months, 4months and then every 2 months, at the end of Study|Time to Progression, Time to Progression will be measured from the time of treatment start until the first documented disease progression. Patients with no event at the time of the analysis will be censored at their last tumor assessment date., At Baseline, 2 months, 4months and then every 2 months, at the end of Study
BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. The PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway deregulation is frequently observed in Head and neck cancer. In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the PI3K/AKT pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab.

In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy. Since resistance to cetuximab can result from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the PI3K pathway, BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of patients: patients presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation.
