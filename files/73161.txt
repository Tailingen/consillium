99mTc-DARPinG3-based HER2 Expression Molecular Imaging in HER2-positive Breast Cancer During Chemo+Targeted Therapy
An open-label, single center study with 99mTc-DARPinG3 SPECT and biopsies of primary tumour in HER2-positive Breast Cancer in dynamic of chemo+targeted therapy, where the primary endpoint of the study is to find out the correlation between the HER2 expression measured by 99mTc-DARPin G3 SPECT and standard histopathology from primary tumor in dynamic of chemo+targeted therapy.

DRUG: 99mTc-DARPinG3
SPECT/CT-based 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake value in primary tumor (standardized uptake value (SUV)), SPECT/CT-based 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake value in primary tumor lesions (SUV) of 99mTc-DARPinG3 focal uptake coinciding with tumor lesions will be assessed using SPECT/CT at 4 hours after injection and measured in counts and SUV before and after 2 and 4 courses of chemo+targeted therapy, 4 hours|SPECT-based tumor-to-background ratio (conventional units), The SPECT-based tumor-to-background ratio will be calculated as follows: the value of 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake coinciding with primary tumor lesions (SUV) will be divided by the value of 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake coinciding with the regions without pathological findings (SUV) before and after 2 and 4 courses of chemo+targeted therapy, 4 hours
Tumor-to-background ratio 99mTc-DARPinG3 SPECT versus immunohistochemical study, Comparison of the 99mTc-DARPinG3 accumulation (SUV or count-to-background ratio) in primary tumour with the results of morphological and immunohistochemical studies (score from 1 to 3) before and after 2 and 4 courses of chemo+targeted therapy, 4 hours
none Methodology: Open-label, exploratory, single center study. The subjects will receive a single injection of the labelled tracer.
