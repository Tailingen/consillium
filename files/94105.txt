A Phase I Study of S-1 in Combination With Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced or Recurrent Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and recommend a proper dose for our phase II study of S-1 when combined with radiation therapy for locally advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.

To define dose limited toxicities(DLT) of S-1, peroral BID, in treatment days concurrently with radiation therapy (RT) in locally advanced or recurrent gastric cancer., Dose limited toxicities defined as below: leucopenia ≥4 neutropenia ≥ 4, anemia ≥ 3, thrombocytopenia ≥ 3, alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3, alkaline phosphatase (ALT) ≥ 3, total bilirubin ≥ 3,blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/Cr ≥ 2,non-granular cell decreased fever ≥ 2, nausea/vomiting ≥ 2, fatigue ≥ 3, weight loss ≥ 3, diarrhea ≥ 3, abdominal pain ≥ 3, dysphagia ≥ 3, hand-foot syndrome ≥ 2, neurotoxicity ≥ 2., up to 9 weeks
To define maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of S-1, peroral BID, in treatment days concurrently with radiation therapy, If 1 of 3 patients treated within a S-1 dose level experiences DLTs, 3 more patients will be treated at the same level. If a second patient experiences DLTs, then escalation will be stopped and the MTD is defined as the level below DLT dose level., up to 9 weeks
This is a Phase I trial of S-1 given in treatment days with an oral dose from 30mg/m2/d to 80mg/m2/d, concurrently with radiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer. Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a standard manner. S-1 will be administered for 6 dose levels,30/40/50/60/70/80mg/m2/d. Patients will be assessed for acute toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE)3.0.
