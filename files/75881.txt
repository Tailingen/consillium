Study of ASTX295 in Patients With Solid Tumors With Wild-Type p53
Study ASTX295-01 is a first in human Phase 1/2 open-label study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of ASTX295 in participants with wild-type TP53 advanced solid tumors. Phase 1 is a dose escalation and dose expansion study design. Sponsor made the strategic decision to not pursue the Phase 2 part of the study.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ASTX295
Phase 1a: Safety and tolerability of ASTX295 including determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) to Phase 1b, From the date of the first dose until 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment|Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimen of ASTX295 to proceed to Phase 2, The RP2D will be based on incidence and severity of AEs, including SAEs and will be determined by the data and safety review committee (DSRC), From the date of the first dose until 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment, an average of 6 months to 1 year|Phase 2: Disease control rate (DCR) in Cohort 1, DCR will be calculated in Cohort 1 as the number of subjects whose response at Week 16 is CR, partial response (PR), or stable disease, divided by the total number of subjects evaluable for DCR analysis., From the date of the first dose until Week 16|Phase 2: Overall response rate (ORR) in Cohorts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, ORR in Cohorts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be calculated as the number of subjects whose best response is CR or PR, divided by the total number of subjects evaluable for ORR analysis., From the date of the first dose until study treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months to 1 year
Phase 1: Preliminary clinical activity of ASTX295 as assessed by disease control rate (DCR), DCR will be calculated as the number of subjects whose response at Week 16 is CR, PR, or stable disease, divided by the total number of subjects evaluable for DCR analysis, From the date of the first dose until Week 16|Phase 1: Preliminary clinical activity as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) of ASTX295, ORR will be calculated as the number of subjects whose best response is CR or PR, divided by the total number of subjects evaluable for ORR analysis, From the date of the first dose until study treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months to 1 year|Phase 2: Safety profile of ASTX295, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs), From the date of the first dose until 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment, an average of 6 months to 1 year|Phase 2: Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of the first dose until the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 1 year|Phase 2: Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to date of death due to any cause, Up to approximately 1 year|Phase 2: Overall response rate (ORR) in Cohort 1, ORR in Cohort 1 will be calculated as the number of subjects whose best response is CR or PR, divided by the total number of subjects evaluable for ORR analysis., From the date of the first dose until study treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months to 1 year|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ASTX295 (area under the curve [AUC]), Blood will be collected during Cycles 1 and 2 in Phase 1, Cycles 1 and 3 in Phase 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ASTX295 (minimum concentration [Cmin]), Blood will be collected during Cycles 1 and 2 in Phase 1, Cycles 1 and 3 in Phase 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ASTX295 (maximum concentration [Cmax]), Blood will be collected during Cycles 1 and 2 in Phase 1, Cycles 1 and 3 in Phase 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ASTX295 (time to reach maximum concentration [Tmax]), Blood will be collected during Cycles 1 and 2 in Phase 1, Cycles 1 and 3 in Phase 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ASTX295 (elimination half-life [tÂ½]), Blood will be collected during Cycles 1 and 2 in Phase 1, Cycles 1 and 3 in Phase 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
