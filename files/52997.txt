Study of ASP7517 Alone and With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Expressing WT1 Antigen
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical response of ASP7517, and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and/or the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ASP7517 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.

This study will also evaluate other measures of anticancer activity of ASP7517 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab based on central and local assessment.

Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Events below occurring within 28 days of first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and considered related to IP.

Monotherapy:

Non-hematologic AEs grade \>= 3 not resolving to Grade \<=2 within 72 hours of onset; Confirmed Hy's law; Infusion-related reaction (IRR) requiring infusion discontinuation; Treatment-related toxicity with \> 2 weeks delay in initiating Cycle 2 or discontinuation during Cycle 1; Grade \>= 3 anemia requiring transfusion or thrombocytopenia with bleeding requiring transfusion/hospitalization; Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with/without infection; Grade 5 treatment-related toxicity

Combination Therapy:

DLTs mentioned above; Grade \>= 2 pneumonitis, encephalopathy, meningitis, motor/sensory neuropathy; Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \> 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) in absence of liver metastases; AST or ALT \> 8 x ULN in presence of liver metastases; Total bilirubin \> 3 x ULN; Guillain-Barre syndrome/myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, 28 days|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of study IP and other study treatments, whether or not considered related to the study IP and other study treatments. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study IP and other study treatments. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures. AEs will be graded using NCI-CTCAE guidelines, version 5.0., Up to 27 months|Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs), An AE is considered "serious" if the event: results in death; is life threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; other medically important events., Up to 27 months|Number of participants with laboratory value abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values., Up to 27 months|Number of participants with 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant 12-lead ECG values., Up to 27 months|Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant vital sign values., Up to 27 months|Number of participants with physical exam abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant physical exam values., Up to 27 months|Number of participants at each grade of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, The ECOG scale will be used to assess performance status. Grades range from 0 (fully active) to 5 (dead). Negative change scores indicate an improvement. Positive scores indicate a decline in performance., Up to 27 months|Objective Response Rate per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) (iORR), iORR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as confirmed modified Complete Response (iCR) or modified Partial Response (iPR) per iRECIST by independent central review., Up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate per iRECIST (iDCR), iDCR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as confirmed iCR, iPR or stable disease (iSD), per iRECIST., Up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1, DCR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as confirmed CR, PR or SD per RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival per iRECIST (iPFS) using Independent Central Review, iPFS is defined as the time from the start of the study treatment until death from any cause or radiographic disease progression assessed per iRECIST by independent central review., Up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival per iRECIST (iPFS) using Investigator Assessment, iPFS is defined as the time from the start of the study treatment until death from any cause or radiographic disease progression assessed per iRECIST by investigator assessment., Up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 using Independent Central Review, PFS is defined as the time from the start of the study treatment until death from any cause or radiographic disease progression assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review., Up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 using Investigator Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from the start of the study treatment until death from any cause or radiographic disease progression assessed per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to 24 months|Duration of Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause., Up to 36 months|Duration of Response per iRECIST (iDOR) using Independent Central Review, iDOR will be calculated only for the subgroup of participants with confirmed response iCR/iPR per iRECIST by independent central review., Up to 24 months|Duration of Response per iRECIST (iDOR) using Investigator Assessment, iDOR will be calculated only for the subgroup of participants with confirmed response iCR/iPR per iRECIST by investigator assessment., Up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 using Independent Central Review, DOR will be calculated only for the subgroup of participants with confirmed response CR/PR per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review., Up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 using Investigator Assessment, DOR will be calculated only for the subgroup of participants with confirmed response CR/PR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to 24 months
This study consists of arms receiving ASP7517 monotherapy and arms receiving ASP7517 and pembrolizumab combination therapy in Phase 1 (dose escalation cohort) and Phase 2 (dose expansion cohort). Phase 2 monotherapy and combination dose expansion cohorts will be opened after the phase 1 escalation cohort has been completed.
