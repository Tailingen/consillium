Mindfulness-Based Intervention in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy
There is evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and yoga might improve Quality of Life (QOL) and reduce stress in breast cancer survivors. These interventions are becoming increasingly popular in cancer survivors. However, little is known about the feasibility and effect of MBIs administered during the interval of time of chemotherapy, on QOL and stress. The investigators are planning a MBI intervention study developed specifically for breast cancer survivors receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) at the investigators institution, for at least 8 sessions combined with at least 8 weeks of home-practice, in 25 women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Mindfulness
Feasibility - percentage of patients recruited from those approached, percentage of patients who dropped off, percentage of patients who are compliant (attending more than 75% of recommended sessions), While receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months)
Stress - measured by the Perceived Stress Scale - statistically and clinically significant reductions in stress, Stress will be measured before the start of chemotherapy, monthly while receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) and at 3 months after chemotherapy, 7-8 months
Fatigue - Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory -Short Form statistically and clinically significant reductions in fatigue score, Fatigue will be measured by the before the start of chemotherapy, monthly while receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) and at 3 months after chemotherapy, 7-8 months|Quality of life measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast - statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality of life, Quality of life will be measured before the start of chemotherapy, monthly while receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) and at 3 months after chemotherapy, 7-8 months|Sleep measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index -statistically and clinically significant improvements in sleep, Sleep will be measured before the start of chemotherapy, monthly while receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) and at 3 months after chemotherapy, 7-8 months
