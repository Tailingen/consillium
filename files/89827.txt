Comparative Efficacy of Cemiplimab to Historical Standard of Care in France
Primary Objective:

-Assess the effectiveness of cemiplimab versus other available systemic therapies in patients up to 2018 or say historical system organ class (SOC) with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation, on overall survival (OS).

Secondary Objectives:

* Assess Progression Free Survival (PFS)
* To assess Duration of Response (DOR)
* To assess Objective Response Rate (ORR)
* To describe adverse events leading to treatment interruptions and deaths
Cancer/Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Skin
DRUG: Cemiplimab
Overall Survival (OS), The difference OS between treatment and control groups expressed as a Hazard Ratio (HR). OS is the time between treatment initiation and the date of death from any cause. For participants who are alive at data cutoff collection, their survival time will be censored at the last date that they were known to be alive., From patient advanced CSCC diagnosis date up to last medical record available on site or the end of the observation period (July 2022),whichever occurred first
Progression-Free Surivival (PFS), Difference in PFS between interventional and control groups expressed as a HR. Defined as the time elapsed from date of first treatment intake to the date of documented recurrent or progressive disease reported by the Investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression will be assessed by tumour response evaluation according to Investigator assessment. Tumour response will be evaluated per routine clinical practice as progressive/not progressive by the physian., From patient advanced CSCC diagnosis date up to last medical record available on site or the end of the observation period (July 2022),whichever occurred first|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time elapsed between the first reported objective response (complete or partial response) and the first date of recurrent or progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Tumour response will be evaluated per routine clinical practice by the physician., From patient advanced CSCC diagnosis date up to last medical record available on site or the end of the observation period (July 2022),whichever occurred first|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants who achieve partial or complete response from the start of the study treatment. The ORR will be assessed by tumour response evaluation according to Investigator assessment. Tumour response will be evaluated per routine clinical practice by the physician), From patient advanced CSCC diagnosis date up to last medical record available on site or the end of the observation period (July 2022),whichever occurred first
Study duration is approximately 9 months. For the Standard of Care Arm, data of the subjects evaluated between 01 Aug 2013 and 01 Aug 2018 was observed. For the Cemiplimab arm, data of the subjects evaluated between Aug 2018 and October 2019 was observed.
