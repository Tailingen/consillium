Phase I/II Study Evaluating AUTO4 in Patients With TRBC1 Positive T Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO4 a CAR T cell treatment targeting TRBC1 in patients with relapsed or refractory TRBC1 positive selected T-Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
T Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified|Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: AUTO4
Phase I: Safety (Frequency and severity of adverse events and serious AEs) and confirmation of Phase II dose and schedule., 24 months post treatment|Phase II: Objective Response (CR + PR) Rate post AUTO4 infusion., 24 months post treatment
Assess overall safety and tolerability in terms of frequency and severity of all AEs and SAEs and incidence and severity of opportunistic infections following AUTO4 infusion., 24 months post treatment|Feasibility of generating AUTO4: Number of patients whose cells achieve successful AUTO4 manufacture as a proportion of the number of patients undergoing leukapheresis., Up to 8 weeks post leukapheresis|Time to response (PR and CR), 24 months post treatment
The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I/dose escalation phase and a Phase II/expansion phase. Patients with relapsed or refractory TRBC1 positive selected T-NHL will be enrolled in both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis to harvest T cells, the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR-T product AUTO4. Following preconditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO4 intravenously as a single dose following which they will then enter a 24-month follow-up period
