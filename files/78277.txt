A Phase II Study Comparing The Efficacy Of Venetoclax + Fulvestrant Vs. Fulvestrant In Women With Estrogen Receptor-Positive, Her2-Negative Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Experienced Disease Recurrence Or Progression During Or After CDK4/6 Inhibitor Therapy
This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to compare the efficacy of venetoclax in combination with fulvestrant compared with fulvestrant alone in women with ER+, HER2-negative, locally advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) who experienced disease recurrence or progression during or after treatment with CDK4/6i therapy for at least 8 weeks. As of 9th October 2020, participants in the Venetoclax + Fulvestrant arm, have all discontinued Venetoclax treatment and have continued on Fulvestrant treatment alone.
Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER2)-Negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Clinical Benefit Defined as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) Lasting >= 24 Weeks, as Determined by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, Clinical Benefit was defined as CR, PR, or SD lasting more than equal to 24 weeks from randomization in participants with measurable disease at baseline, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: CR, Disappearance of all target lesions; PR, PR \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (TL) taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters; SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Disease Progression (PD), PD\>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TL taking as reference the smallest sum on study(Nadir). In addition to the relative increase of 20% sum must have demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm., Randomization through till 6 months after the last participant is enrolled into the study (up to approximately 23 months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression (as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization through till 6 months after the last participant is enrolled into the study (up to approximately 23 months)|Objective Response (OR), OR was defined as CR or PR, in participants with measurable disease at baseline as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization through till 6 months after the last participant is enrolled into the study (up to approximately 23 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of the first documented disease progression (as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Time from first occurrence of a documented objective response to the first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, until 6 months after the last participant is enrolled in the study (up to approximately 23 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Randomization to death from any cause, through till the end of the study (up to approximately 32 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory values or abnormal clinical test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study were also considered as AEs., Baseline up until 28 days after the last dose of study drug (venetoclax or fulvestrant, whichever is later) up to approximately 32 months|Plasma Concentrations of Venetoclax, Cycle 1 Day 1: 4 hours (hrs) post-dose; Cycle 2 Day 1: pre-dose (within 1 hr) and 2, 4, 6, 8 hrs post-dose; any time during visits up to study drug discontinuation/Early Termination (up to approximately 32 months)|Plasma Concentrations of Fulvestrant (in Presence of Venetoclax), Cycle 2 Day 1: pre-dose (within 1 hr); Cycle 6 Day 1: pre-dose (within 1 hr); any time during visits up to study drug discontinuation/Early Termination (up to approximately 32 months)|Plasma Concentrations of Fulvestrant (in Absence of Venetoclax), Cycle 2 Day 1: pre-dose (within 1 hr); any time during visits up to study drug discontinuation/Early Termination (up to approximately 32 months)
