Imaging Malignant Glioma With 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT
The purpose of this study is to characterize tumour uptake of somatostatin analog 68Ga-DOTATOC in patients with either primary or recurrent malignant glioma. The investigators hypothesis is that some primary and recurrent malignant gliomas overexpress SST2 receptor which can be imaged with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT. The investigators also hypothesize that tumor uptake of 68Ga-DOTATOC correlates with immunohistochemically determined SST2 receptor status of the tumor specimen.
Glioma
DRUG: [68Ga]DOTATOC
Malignant glioma uptake of 68Ga-DOTATOC, PET/CT imaging of the brain starts immediately after the intravenous bolus injection of 68Ga-DOTATOC. Dynamic PET/CT imaging is done over 60-min. A late 90-min scan will be obtained for selected patients. PET studies are analyzed by determining the Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) of the tumor using regions of interest (ROI) drawn both manually and automatically on the tumor., within 90 minutes post-injection
