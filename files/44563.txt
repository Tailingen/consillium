PROstate CAncer Radiotherapy - Bowel Quality of Life (PROCAR-BQ)
This is a prospective pilot study to evaluate the mean increase of bowel symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy (RT) in prostate cancer (PCa) patient using the validated \& newly translated EORTC-QLQ PRT20 module.

Mean Delta of EORTC Proctitis Module (PRT20) score, Mean Delta between the end and the beginning of RT (4 weeks) in PRT20 score (Min 18, Max 72, higher scores mean worse outcome), At study completion, an average of 4 months
Mean Delta of EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) score, Mean Delta between the end and the beginning of RT (4 weeks) in C30 score (For symptoms: Min 28, Max 112, higher scores mean worse outcome; For general status: Min 2, Max 14, higher scores mean better outcome), At study completion, an average of 4 months
Sarcopenia prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta., Descriptive analysis of sarcopenia prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta.

Men with L3 skeletal muscle index \< 52.4 cm2/m2 will be classified as having sarcopenia. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (SMA) in cm2 at the third lumbar vertebra will be measured on the CT simulation (2 weeks before RT start) then normalized for stature to report the L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) in cm2/m2. Hand-grip strength will be assessed as supportive measure the same day., At study completion, an average of 4 months|Malnutrition prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta., Descriptive analysis of GLIM (Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition) criteria for malnutrition diagnosis prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta.

One of the three positive phenotypic criteria will lead to positive diagnosis of malnutrition:

* \>5 % weight loss within past 6 months (asked to patient during visit or compared to previous reports),
* BMI \< 20-22 (weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2),
* Reduces muscle mass by L3 skeletal muscle index \< 52.4 cm2/m2 (skeletal muscle cross-sectional area in cm2 at the third lumbar vertebra will be measured by CT then normalized for stature to report the L3 skeletal muscle index in cm2/m2), At study completion, an average of 4 months|Max Dose on Bowel Bag, Sigmoid & Rectum and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta., Descriptive analysis of Dmax in Gray (Gy) on Bowel Bag, Sigmoid \& Rectum on RT plan dosimetry and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta., At study completion, an average of 4 months|Mean Dose on Bowel Bag, Sigmoid & Rectum and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta., Descriptive analysis of Dmean in Gray (Gy) on Bowel Bag, Sigmoid \& Rectum on RT plan dosimetry and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta., At study completion, an average of 4 months|Low Diet Quality Index prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 Delta, Descriptive analysis of Low Diet Quality Index (DQI-I) prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta.

DQI-I will be calculated from analysis of patient usual diet by the mean of a diet history and 24-h recall method before the start of RT and by it's conversion in nutritional values using composition tables. The continuous measure of the total DQI-I scores (Min 0, Max 100) of each patient will be categorized into quartiles (Very low, Low, Intermediate, High) and correlated to individual PRT20 and QLQ-C30 Delta in a descriptive manner., At study completion, an average of 4 months|Low Physical Activity Level prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 Delta, Descriptive analysis of Low Physical Activity Level (PAL) prevalence and its association with PRT20 and QLQ-C30 score Delta.

Physical Activity Level will be recorded by the mean of PolarÂ® Watches which will be loaned to the patient by the PI at the CT sim appointment for two weeks (usual waiting time between CT and treatment) and recovered on the first day of treatment, At study completion, an average of 4 months
Questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and PRT20 modules) will be held to patients at the beginning and at the end of RT (4 weeks) to evaluate the mean increase of lower GI symptoms and decrease in overall QoL after pelvic RT.

For exploratory objectives, GLIM (Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition) criteria for malnutrition diagnosis, a 24h recall and DQI-I calculation will be assessed by the PI before the start of RT. CT sim \& dosimetry will be analyse by the PI before treatment to evaluation the body composition and the max and mean dose received by the bowel, the sigmoid and the rectum. A Polar watches will be loaned to the patient by the PI at the CT sim appointment to record patient's daily movement for two weeks (usual waiting time between CT and treatment) and recovered on the first day of treatment.
