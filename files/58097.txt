A Web-based Calculator Predicts Heterogeneous Frailty Trajectories
To explore the predictive factors of frailty trajectories and develop a web-based nomogram among gastric cancer survivors.
Gastric Cancer
frailty trajectories, Frailty was measured by Tilburg frailty indicator (TFI) scale at discharge, one month, three months, six months and twelve months after surgery., 1 year
The aims of this study are to explore the predictive factors of frailty trajectories in gastric cancer patients more comprehensively based on the health ecology theory and to construct a clinically convenient web-based prediction calculator, so as to screen high-risk frailty elderly gastric cancer patients at an early stage in clinical practice, and thus to implement early interventions to improve the prognosis.
