Pembrolizumab for Advanced NSCLC and PS 2-3
This single center open-label trial will enroll a single cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are ineligible for treatment with curative intent due to 1) disease stage IV, or 2) inability to tolerate intensive surgery or chemo-radiation. Patients will be eligible for the trial if ISMMS reviewed samples from tumor biopsy have a PDL-1 TPS ≥ 1% and have ECOG performance status rated 2 or 3. All patients will receive anti PD-1 therapy with pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks, during which patients will also undergo serial QOL assessments.

This trial will follow a phase II single arm, open label design. The study will enroll 45 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint of which will be change in QOL as measured by the EORTC's QLQ-C30 between Day 1 and Day 84 +/- 7 days. Secondary outcomes including evaluation for development of confounding mental health conditions will be evaluated via serial HADS assessments. Concomitant radiographic assessment with PET/CT, regardless of the doses of pembrolizumab received, will allow for evaluation of secondary efficacy outcomes, including disease response by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a disease-specific 13-item self-administered questionnaire for lung cancer, to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30. It comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (ie, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and side effects from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (ie, hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia). Scores from 0 to 100 were derived for each symptom item, with higher scores representing greater level of symptoms., Baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment|Change in EORTC's QLQ-LC13 Quality of Life (QOL) score, Change in Quality of Life (QOL) score at 12 weeks post-treatment with pembrolizumab as measured by EORTC's QLQ-LC13.

Study Drug, Dose, Route, and Regimen: Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, with the option to transition to pembrolizumab 400 mg IV every 6 weeks thereafter. Pembrolizumab will then be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death.

Statistical Considerations: This is a phase II clinical trial to assess the change in Quality of Life (QoL), measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 scores, for patients with treatment-naïve, advanced or metastatic NSCLC and ECOG 2/3 on Pembrolizumab treatment. The global QoL (QLQ-30) at baseline in 218 lung cancer patients had a mean of 57.6 and standard deviation (SD) of 24.3. The research team will test the difference in the change in QoL score between baseline and 12 weeks after Pembrolizumab treatment. A meaningful change, as documented in the literature, has determined to be a 10 score difference. The SD of the change is 18.9, assuming that the pre-/post- correlation is 0.7. A sample of 31 achieves 81% power to detect a mean of paired differences of 10 with an estimated SD of differences of 18.9 and with a significance level of 0.05 using a two-sided paired t-test. Considering the potential 30% drop-out, this study will enroll 45 patients to ensure at least 31 evaluable patients.

Approximately 20 new patients with metastatic NSCLC are seen per month at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai Chelsea sites; of these, approximately 7-8 have a PS of 2-3 based on past experience. Thus, the study can reasonably expect to accrue 2 patients per month to the study, with approximately 24 months needed to complete accrual.
