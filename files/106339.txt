Adaptive Randomization of Aerobic Exercise During Chemotherapy in Colon Cancer
To goal of this clinical trial is to quantify the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise training compared to attention control on chemotherapy relative dose intensity in colon cancer survivors.
Colonic Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Progressive stretching
Chemotherapy Relative Dose Intensity, The ratio of the delivered dose intensity to the standard or planned dose intensity., 12- or 24-weeks
