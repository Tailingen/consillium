TT-00973-MS Tablets in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of TT-00973-MS tablets in patients with solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: TT-00973-MS tablets treatment
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), To evaluate the incidence of DLT and determine the maximum tolerated dose., At the end Cycle 1(each cycle is 28 days)|Incidence of adverse events and sevious adverse events, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TT-00973-MS tablets administered orally in patients with advanced solid tumors. NCI CTCAE 5.0 grading system will be used to determine the severity., Adverse events are collected from the patient's first dose of TT-00973-MS until 28 days following the last dose of study drug.
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours post-dose on Day 1 single dose; pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 28 of Cycle 1|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours post-dose on Day 1 single dose; pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 28 of Cycle 1|Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours post-dose on Day 1 single dose;pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 28 of Cycle 1|terminal half-life (T1/2), Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours post-dose on Day 1 single dose;pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 28 of Cycle 1|Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the rate of CR and PR., Up to approximately 1 year|Objective response rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the rate of CR, PR and SD., Up to approximately 1 year|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS will be calculated from the date of first dose to the date of documented confirmed relapse/progression or death, whichever occurs first., Until the date of documented confirmed relapse/progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 1 year.|Duration of response(DOR), DOR will be calculated as the date of the first documented CR/PR to the date of the first documented confirmed relapse or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 1 year|Overall survival(OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from first dose to the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 1 year
A modified 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) during dose escalation period. Futher expansion period will enroll additional 12\~18 patients at the appropriate dose to futher evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of TT-00973-MS.
