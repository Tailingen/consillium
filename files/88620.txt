Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignant blood disease with genetic heterogeneity and originated from hematopoietic stem progenitor cells.In the past 50 years, the "3+7" induction regimen represented by cytotoxic drugs (including anthracyclines/anthraquinones combined with cytarabine) has remained the standard induction regimen for newly diagnosed AML patients with intensive chemotherapy. In AML patients \<60 years old, the "3+7" regimen induces a complete response rate of 60% to 80%, but the treatment-related mortality is as high as 13%, and more than half of the patients face the threat of relapse, and the 5-year overall survival rate is about 35% to 40%.
