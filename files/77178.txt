Generation of Organoids of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Tract Obtained From Patients Undergoing Surgery
Observational, prospective, feasibility pilot study of the preparation of organoids starting from tumor tissue and surrounding healthy tissue, collected during surgery, performed according to standard clinical practice.
Gastro-entero-pancreatic Neoplasms
Set up of at least 10 organoid cultures, The organoids will be generated from tumor tissue samples and surrounding healthy tissue obtained from patients affected by GEP-NEN (who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria) collected, according to clinical practice, during tumor resection surgery. Only the excess material after carrying out all the investigations necessary for the correct diagnosis histological analysis can be used for the purpose of the project, 42 months
Given the need for the use of experimental models that mimic the tumor of origin
