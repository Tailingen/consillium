The Effect of Rituximab on Cognitive and Hand Functions in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis
The goal of this clinical trial is to know if rituximab can improve cognitive and hand functions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients with high disability (EDSS 6.5 or more). The main questions it aims to answer are:

Can rituximab improve cognitive and hand functions in SPMS patients? Can rituximab improve the quality of life and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in SPMS patients?

Researchers will compare patients who receive rituximab to patient who receive placebo to see the effects of rituximab on cognition, hand functions, quality of life and EDSS.

Demographic and clinical data as age, gender, disease duration and EDSS will be obtained from each participant. Participants will perform The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS), The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) and The MS-QLQ27 questionnaire at baseline and after one year of receiving either rituximab or placebo.
Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)
DRUG: Rituximab|OTHER: Saline (NaCl 0,9 %) (placebo)
The effect of rituximab on cognitive functions assessed by The Symbol Digit Modalities Test, The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) presents a series of nine symbols, each paired with a single digit in a key at the top of a standard sheet of paper. Patients are asked to identify the digit associated with each symbol as rapidly as possible for 90 seconds. The outcome measure is the number of correct responses over the 90 seconds time span., One year|The effect of rituximab on cognitive functions assessed by The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised, The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) constitutes of six abstract designs presented to the patient for 10 seconds. The display is removed from view and patients render the stimuli via pencil on paper manual responses. Each design receives from 0 to 2 points representing accuracy and location. Thus, scores range from 0 to 12. There are three learning trials. The outcome measure is the total number of points earned over the three trials., One year|The effect of rituximab on cognitive functions assessed by The California Verbal Learning Test-II, The California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) begins with the examiner reading a list of 16 words. Patients listen to the list and report as many of the items as possible. After recall is recorded, the entire list is read again followed by a second attempt at recall. Altogether, there are five learning trials. The outcome measure is the total number of recalled items over the five trials., One year|The effect of rituximab on hand functions assessed by The Nine-Hole Peg Test, The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) is a wood or plastic board with 9 holes (10 mm diameter, 15 mm depth) and a container. It is administered by asking the patient to take the pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board as quickly as possible. Participants must then remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container. The outcome measure is the time taken to complete the activity, recorded in seconds., One year
The effect of rituximab on quality of life, Using MS-QLQ27 questionnaire, which contains 27 items covering physical, mental, and treatment-specific impairments as well as items relating to leisure, social, and work life issues. Scaling of items is a 5 point scale ranged from 1: "not at all impaired" to 5: "extremely impaired., One year|The effect of rituximab on EDSS, The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a tool used for quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability., One year
