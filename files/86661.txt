A Study of IMP4297 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of IMP4297 administered orally once every day to patients with advanced solid tumors for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has proven to be ineffective or intolerable. Patients with advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer or prostate cancer are preferred. There are two stages to this study: a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage.

DRUG: IMP4297
The AEs (adverse event) of single and multiple doses of IMP4297 administered to participants with advanced solid tumors., Evaluate the TEAE (treatment-emergent adverse event) of IMP4297, Each visit after IMP4297 administrated (through study completion, an average of 10 months)|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of IMP4297, Evaluate DLT and determine the MTD, Within 28 days after IMP4297 administrated
