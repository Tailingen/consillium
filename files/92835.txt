Home-Based Exercise Program During Neoadjuvant Treatment to Improve Fatigue and Quality of Life in Early HER2-Positive and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this trial is to learn if a home-based exercise program (intervention) reduces fatigue and improves quality of life in adult patients with early breast cancer who are proposed for preoperative chemotherapy.

Conducted at Centro Hospitalar Universit치rio de Santo Ant칩nio, Porto, Portugal. It compares a structured exercise program prescribed by the physical and rehabilitation medicine team to routine counseling for physical activity by the medical oncologist.

All participants will:

1. Visit the hospital 3 times for physical assessments, at beginning of chemotherapy (T0), at 3-months (T1) and 1 month after surgery (T2)
2. Reply to questionnaires of fatigue and quality of life, at T0, T1 and T2
3. Adhere to routine medical oncology visits, treatments and exams

Participants of the intervention-arm will additionally:

1. Receive a exercise book, with exercise instructions and calendar
2. Have two in-person lessons about the exercise program
3. Visit the hospital 1 additional time, to have the second lesson
4. Wear a sport bracelet while exercising, to monitor heart rate Recruitment began in April 2024, with results to be shared in medical publications and conferences.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)|HER2-Positive Breast Cancer|Early Breast Cancer|Cancer-related Fatigue|Quality of Life (QOL)
BEHAVIORAL: Home-based exercise program|BEHAVIORAL: Promotion of Healthy Physical Activity
Health-related quality of life, Changes in health-related quality of life, measured by EORTC QLQ-30, from baseline (T0) to 12 weeks of systemic therapy (T1) and to 1 month after surgery (T2), From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Fatigue, Changes in patient-reported fatigue, measured by FACIT-Fatigue, from baseline (T0) to 12 weeks of systemic therapy (T1) and to 1 month after surgery (T2), From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery
Exercise capacity, Change on exercise capacity, measured as 6MWT distance, from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Physical activity levels, Change on physical activity levels, measured by IPAQ-SF questionnaire (or by accelerometer), from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Hand grip strength, Change on hand grip strength, from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Timed Up and Go, Change on "Timed Up and Go", from T0 to T1 and from T0 to T2., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Complete pathologic response rate, Percentage of participants of each arm that achieved complete pathological response, as assessed by a dedicated pathologist from our institution, blinded for the intervention., From 1 month up to 2 months after breast surgery. Data can be restropectively collected from the pathologic report after this period.|Compliance to intervention, Rate of participants that accepted to participate, that completed intervention, and the percentage of programed exercise sessions that were completed ", at T0, T1 and T2., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Safety, Reported adverse events potentially related to exercise., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery|Compliance to questionnaires, Rate of participants who replied to the quality of life and fatigue questionnaires, at T0, T1 and T2., From enrolement to up to 2 months after the end of intervention period, i.e. after breast surgery
Lymphedema, Changes in arms circumferences from T0 to T2, and from T0 to 6-12m after the surgery., From enrolement to up to 12 months after the end of intervention period.|Disease free survival, Time from the beginning of neoadjuvant treatment until death or recurrence of breast cancer disease., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months|Overall survival, Time from the beginning of neoadjuvant treatment until death., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 120 months|Health costs, Health costs estimation based on number of emergency episodes, in-hospital days, delayed day hospital sessions, off-labor days., From enrolement up to 6 months after surgery.
