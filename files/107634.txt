Study to Assess Safety of HDP-101 in Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and the therapeutic potential of HDP-101 in patients with plasma cell disorders including multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma|Plasma Cell Disorder
DRUG: HDP-101
Number of patients who experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment - Part 1 as defined in Clinical Study Protocol, Up to Day 21 (from first dose)|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of enrolled subjects who achieve a partial response (PR) or better, i.e. stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) and PR, according to the IMWG criteria., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Assess the safety and tolerability of HDP-101, Number of patients with serious and non-serious adverse events grouped by system organ class and preferred terms based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 5.0) classification., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To assess the anticancer activity of HDP-101 in terms of time-to-event (TTE), Clinical efficacy of HDP-101 measured by Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
The study will consists of two parts: a Part 1 dose escalation phase and a Part 2a expansion phase for safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity testing. The study will enroll subjects with relapsed/refractory MM or other plasma cell disorders expressing BCMA. An adaptive 2-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) for dose-escalation with overdose control will be used in the dose-escalation phase for determination of the MTD or the RP2D. Dose-expansion phase of the study aims to collect preliminary evidence of antitumor activity and to confirm the safety of the HDP-101 as a monotherapy.
