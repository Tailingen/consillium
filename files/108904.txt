The purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess the molecular profile of the tumour ecosystem of CSCC patients who receive immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant curative setting, in order to identify molecular mechanisms facilitating treatment response and resistance and to identify molecular markers for disease monitoring. Patients who receive immunotherapy for the neoadjuvant management of CSCC will be invited to participate in this translational research study during their treatment journey to provide tumour tissue (fresh and formal-fixed paraffin-embedded, FFPE) and blood samples before and after exposure to immunotherapy.

This study has primarily a translational research objective with the clinical component conducted as a prospective, single-centre, single-arm, open label study.
