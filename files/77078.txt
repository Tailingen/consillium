Can Pretreatment MRI be Used to Predict Intra-arterial Chemotherapy Response in Retinoblastoma?
Retinoblastoma is the most frequent intraocular tumor in children and represents 6% of all pediatric cancers before the age of 5 years-old. The outcome is now excellent with 95 to 97% of 5-years survival rate. Conservative treatments are being more and more used, and intra arterial chemotherapy is one of the adjuvant treatments proposed to the children. The treatment is efficient in most cases, but a small proportion of children will have an early progression after treatment. MRI is used for the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. We aim to find prognostic factors using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for early identification of children response to intra arterial chemotherapy.
