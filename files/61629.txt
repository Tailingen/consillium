Lenvatinib, Sintilimab Plus SIRT for Unresectable HCC
This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab plus Y-90 selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for patients with unresectable intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

This is a single-center, prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, sintilimab plus SIRT (Len-Sin-SIRT) in patient with unresectable HCC.

30 patients with unresectable intermediate-advanced HCC (BCLC B/C stage) will be enrolled in this study. The patients will receive lenvatinib (body weight â‰¥60kg, 12mg; body weight \<60kg, 8mg; P.O. QD) and sintilimab (200mg I.V. Q3W) at 3-7 days after SIRT. Sintilimab will last up to 24 months, or until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first. Lenvatinib will last until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first.

The primary end point of this study is Progression free survival (PFS) per mRECIST. The secondary endpoints are PFS per RECIST 1.1, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs).
