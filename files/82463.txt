Study of 4 Bone Turnover Markers in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Treated With Intravenous Bisphosphonate in Routine Care
The aim of this study is looking at the Kinetics of bone turnover markers (C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagene (CTX), amino-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX), Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and Sclerostin (SOST)) in serum and urine until 12 months in Patients with Multiple Myeloma Treated With intravenous bisphosphonates in routine care.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Blood and urine collection
Changes in bone turnover markers, bone turnover markers include: C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagene (CTX) in serum, amino-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX) in urine, Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and Sclerostin (SOST) in plasma, Baseline, then every 2 months in 12 months
time to maximum variation of bone turnover markers, CTX, NTX, DKK-1 and SOST, Baseline, then every 2 months in 12 months|Doses of intravenous bisphosphonate, To study the relationship between doses and bone turnover markers, Up to 12 months|Rate of intravenous bisphosphonate, To study the relationship between doses and bone turnover markers, Up to 12 months|evolution of bone lesions by imaging, evolution of bone lesions by imaging, Up to 12 months|Number of new bone events, Up to 12 months|Number of adverse events likely to be related to bisphosphonate, Up to 12 months|Changes in Monoclonal protein, To evaluated response to treatment, Baseline, then every 2 months in 12 months
