Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Monitoring in the Assessment and Prediction of the Efficacy of PARP Inhibitors (PARPi)
To evaluate the application value of customized ctDNA monitoring in efficacy assessment and prediction during PARPi treatment
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
Radiological progression free survival (rPFS), Radiological progression free survival (rPFS) - defined as the time from randomisation to radiological progression, assessed by investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 (soft tissue) and Prostate Cancer Working Group-3 (PCWG-3) criteria (bone), or death from any cause, or the last follow-up, whichever occurs first, From date of randomisation to until radiographic progression (up to 1 year)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of patients with at least one visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), in their soft tissue disease assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), in the absence of progression on bone scan assessed by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)). Per RECIST v1.1, CR=Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; For each treatment group, ORR is the number of patients with a CR and PR., From randomisation until radiographic progression (up to 1 year)|PSA response rate, PSA response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a PSA decline (defined as a ≥30%, ≥50% and other declines in PSA from baseline)., From randomisation until radiographic progression (up to 1 year)
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from treatment commencement to death of any cause, 2 years
This clinical study is an open-label, single-center, observational study to evaluate the application value of customized ctDNA monitoring in efficacy assessment and prediction during PARPi treatment in mCRPC patients. A total of 30 participants with second-line treatment failure will be registered in this study. Whole blood collection will be conducted during the treatment for ctDNA detection, homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes testing, personalized panel customization and whole exome sequencing.
