Study of Pamiparib in Newly Diagnosed and rGBM
This is an open-label, single-center Phase 0/2 study that will enroll up to 30 participants with newly diagnosed (N=12) and recurrent glioblastoma (N=18). The trial will be composed of a Phase 0 component (subdivided into Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C), and an Exploratory Phase 2 component. Participants with tumors demonstrating a PK response in the Phase 0 component of the study will graduate to an exploratory Phase 2 component that combines therapeutic dosing of pamiparib plus fractionated radiotherapy (for unmethylated MGMT promoter newly-diagnosed cases), pamiparib plus fractionated radiotherapy (for recurrent cases) or Olaparib plus fractionated radiotherapy (recurrent cases).
