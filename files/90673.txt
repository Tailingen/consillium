A Prospective Study Comparing the Incidence of Infantile Hemangiomas Following Normal Pregnancies Versus Pregnancies Complicated by Placental Abnormalities
The purpose of this study is to investigate the pathogenesis of hemangiomas of infancy as they relate to normal pregnancies and those pregnancies complicated by placenta abnormalities. Women of all gestational ages will be enrolled in the study. Maternal serum, placental, and cord blood samples will be obtained for each subject. A medical history will be obtained for each subject. Post-delivery a member of the study team will perform a cutaneous exam of the infant to establish what birthmarks are present at birth. Mother will receive four phone call follow ups to determine if the infant has had any skin changes. If yes, mother will be asked to bring the child in for evaluation. If a hemangioma is diagnosed, a blood draw will be performed.
