Effect of Oral Supplementation With a Fibre Enriched Paediatric Sip Feed For Children With Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
This is a randomised, controlled, open-label intervention study. It is hypothesized that supplementation with a fibre enriched sip feed will improve the nutritional status, gut microbiota and quality of life (QOL) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and may enhance their immune response. This could give them a better chance to finish their induction chemotherapy successfully with fewer side effects.
