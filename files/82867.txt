Surgical Treatment of Early Stage Glotto-supraglottic Laryngeal Cancer Via Transoral Resection With Robotic Assistance
The main objective of this study is to determine the rate of healthy surgical margins after tumor resection in transoral robot-assisted surgery for glottic and/or supraglottic early stage (T1-T2) laryngeal cancer.
Laryngeal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Transoral robot-assisted tumor resection using the da Vinci robot
The presence/absence of cancerous tissue in the surgical margins of the resectioned tumors, 1 day
Time to prepare the surgical setting (min), 1 day|Time necessary to dock the robot (min), 1 day|Total surgical time (console time) (min), 1 day|Intervention time taking into account cervical ganglions (min), 1 day|Was a tracheotomy necessary? yes/no, 1 day|Presence / absence of bleeding complications, 1 day|Was a conversion to an open procedure necessary? yes/no, 1 day
