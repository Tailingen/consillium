A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Breast Cancer Who Have Received Prior Anti-HER2 And Chemotherapy-based Treatment
This two-cohort, open-label, multicenter study will assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab emtansine in participants with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who have received prior anti-HER2 and chemotherapy-based treatment. Participants in Cohort 1 will be drawn from the general participant population; Cohort 2 will include only Asian participants.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab Emtansine
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events of Primary Interest (AEPIs), The AEPIs in this study were defined as the following: adverse events (AEs) Grade \>/= 3, specifically, hepatic events, allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage events, all Grade \>/= 3 AEs related to trastuzumab emtansine and pneumonitis events of all grades., Baseline up to approximately 7 years
Percentage of Participants With Specific AEPIs, The AEPIs in this study were defined as the following: adverse events (AEs) Grade \>/= 3, specifically, hepatic events, allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage events, all Grade \>/= 3 AEs related to trastuzumab emtansine and pneumonitis events of all grades., Baseline up to approximately 7 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), AESIs included: 1) Potential drug-induced liver injury, which included any potential case of drug-induced liver injury as, assessed by laboratory criteria for Hy's law (AST and/or ALT elevations that were \>3 × ULN, Concurrent elevation of total bilirubin \>2 × ULN (or clinical jaundice if total bilirubin measures were not available), except in participants with documented Gilbert's syndrome. Those with Gilbert's syndrome, elevation of direct bilirubin \>2 × ULN was used instead. 2) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by study drug was defined as any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic. A transmission of an infectious agent suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a participant exposed to a medicinal product., Baseline up to approximately 7 years|Progression-Free Survival According to Response Evaluation for Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1 As Per Investigator Assessment, Progression free survival is defined as the time (in months) between the date of first dose and the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of \>/= 5 millimeters (mm)., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 12 weeks during treatment period thereafter 28-42 days after the last dose or every 3-6 months up to approximately 7 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as time to death, which is the time from the date of dosing until the date of death, regardless of the cause of death., Baseline until death (up to approximately 7 years)|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) According to RECIST v 1.1 As Per Investigator Assessment, Best Overall Response reported here is the Best confirmed Overall Response. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, i.e., to be a responder, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat assessments that had to be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met, i.e., participants needed to have two consecutive assessments of PR or CR. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 12 weeks during treatment period thereafter 28-42 days after the last dose or every 3-6 months up to approximately 7 years)|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit (CR or PR or Stable Disease [SD]) According to RECIST v 1.1, Clinical Benefit was defined as CR plus PR plus SD. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 12 weeks during treatment period thereafter 28-42 days after the last dose or every 3-6 months up to approximately 7 years)|Duration of Response (DOR) According to RECIST v 1.1, DOR is defined as the period from the date of initial confirmed PR or CR (whichever occurs first) until the date of PD or death from any cause. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of \>/= 5 millimeters (mm)., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 12 weeks during treatment period thereafter 28-42 days after the last dose or every 3-6 months up to approximately 7 years)|Time to Response According to RECIST v 1.1, Time to Response is defined as the time from first dose to first documentation of confirmed PR or CR (whichever occurs first). CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 12 weeks during treatment period thereafter 28-42 days after the last dose or every 3-6 months up to approximately 7 years)|Number of Hospital Visits, The number of hospital visits were recorded to evaluate the resoruce expenditures while participants were on study treatment., Baseline up to approximately 7 years|Type of Hospital Visits, The type of hospital visits (intensive care unit (ICU) versus other) were recorded to evaluate the resoruce expenditures while participants were on study treatment. The number of participants with at least one ICU visit are based on the number of participants with at least one hospital visit, in each group., Baseline up to approximately 7 years
