The Safety and Efficacy of RD06-03 CART Cell Injection in Patients With R/R Acute B-lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study is designed to explore the safety and efficacy for patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.
B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
DRUG: RD06-03 cell injection
Dose-limiting toxicity, DLT, Up to 2 years
The study completes the enrollment of all evaluable subjects for DLT during the dose escalation phase, followed by DLT observation, and enters a efficacy exploration phase lasting up to 1 year. After safety conclusions are drawn for each group, investigators may choose to expand cases in the corresponding dose group based on treatment response, but the total number of cases should not exceed 12 (expanded cases are not subjected to DLT evaluation).
