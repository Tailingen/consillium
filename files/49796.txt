A Trial of Gefitinib in Combination With BKM120 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, With Enrichment for Patients Whose Tumours Harbour Molecular Alterations of PI3K Pathway and Known to Overexpress EGFR
The safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of gefitinib and BKM120 will be determined.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Solid Tumors
DRUG: Gefitinib and BKM120

Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BKM120 in combination with gefitinib., 22 time points up to 4 weeks|Preliminary antitumor activity, Using radiological imaging and RECIST criteria, 24 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, 24 months
2.1 Primary

â€¢ The safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of gefitinib and BKM120 will be determined.

2.2 Secondary

* The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of gefitinib in combination with BKM120 will be determined.
* The preliminary anti-tumor activity of gefitinib in combination with BKM120 will be determined.
* The pharmacodynamic target modulation effects using a hair follicle assay will be determined.

2.3 Exploratory

* The role of circulating tumour cells as assessed by a microfluidic device will be analyzed and the genetic alterations implicated in lung cancer, including but not limited to EGFR mutations, PI3KCA mutations, PTEN loss will be characterized.
* The feasibility of detecting somatic mutations from plasma DNA will be ascertained.
