Scandinavian Cohort Study for Optimal Use of Portal Vein Embolization
Several aspects on the use of portal vein embolization (PVE) are poorly studied and todays recommendations are based on low-grade evidence. In this Scandinavian multicenter cohort study we will study some of the controversial aspects on the use of PVE to try to provide clearer answers on its optimal use. Six tertiary university hospital hepatobiliary units in Sweden, Norway and Denmark participate and contribute with all PVE procedures performed at their units during the study period. We will then study several aspects PVE technique in relation to induced hypertrophy and surgical outcome.
Hepatic Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Portal vein embolization
Future liver remnant hypertrophy, Increase in future liver remnant, (%), Based on radiology around 4 weeks before and after intervention
Effect of segment 4 embolization on hypertrophy, Increase in future liver remnant (%) dependeing on if segment 4 is embolized or not., Based on radiology around 4 weeks before and after intervention|Effect of hyperbilirubinemia on hypertrophy, Increase in future liver remnant (%) dependeing on the levels of bilirubin before portal vein embolization., Based on radiology around 4 weeks before and after intervention|Effect of sarcopenia on hypertrophy, Increase in future liver remnant (%) dependeing on the level of sarcopenia before portal vein embolization., Based on radiology around 4 weeks before and after intervention
