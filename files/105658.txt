Oral Health in Breast Cancer Survivors on Aromatase Inhibitors
The purpose of this study is to determine how aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as Arimidex, Aromasin or Femara affect a woman's oral health and oral health related quality of life. Patients, dental professionals and medical oncologists will benefit from a greater understanding of the best oral care follow up practices of breast cancer survivors using aromatase inhibitors.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

This cross-sectional prevalence study seeks to investigate the incidence and severity of oral health changes, specifically of periodontal conditions, among breast cancer survivors and the ways in which these outcomes affect their quality of life.

Secondary

* To determine the prevalence and severity of oral conditions in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer using adjuvant AI therapy as compared to postmenopausal women not using adjuvant AI therapy.
* To determine if adjuvant AI therapy use is associated with greater alveolar bone loss or increased levels of bone turnover biomarkers in postmenopausal women with cancer undergoing adjuvant AI therapy compared to postmenopausal women not receiving AI therapy.
* To determine the oral health-related quality of life among postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant AI therapy.
