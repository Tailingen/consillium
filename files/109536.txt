Data showed that ovarian suppression therapy may protect the ovarian function in premenopausal patients received chemotherapy for breast cancer. However this is still a controversial issue. Sequential use of GnRHa (Zoladex) as ovarian suppression treatment after chemotherapy has been established as an effective endocrine therapy for ER positive premenopausal breast cancer. The present study is a randomized open-label phase III study that aims to observe the efficacy and safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous combination of Zoladex up to 2-3years and chemotherapy compared with the sequential schedule in ≤ 45 year old premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients.
