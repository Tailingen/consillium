A Study of Dasatinib, Cetuximab and Radiation With or Without Cisplatin in HNSCC
Primary Objective for Phase I

1. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of daily Oral dasatinib in combination with cetuximab/RT in Cohort A.
2. To determine the MTD of daily oral dasatinib in combination with cisplatin/cetuximab/RT in Cohort B
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
MTD of Daily Oral Dasatinib in Combination With Cetuximab/RT in Cohort A and Daily Oral Dasatinib in Combination With Cetuximab/Cis or Carboplatin/RT in Cohort B 2. MTD of Daily Oral Dasatinib in Combination With Cisplatin/Cetuximab/RT in Cohort B, The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for Dasatinib was defined as a) the dose producing DLT ( Dose limiting toxicity) in 0-1 out of 6 patients, or b) the dose level below the dose which produced DLT in \<2 out of 6 patients, or c) the dose of 150mg PO QD with less than 33% rate of DLT., Last day of Radiation
Primary Objective for Phase I

1. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of daily Oral dasatinib in combination with cetuximab/RT in Cohort A, in patients with AJCC stage II (T2N0) and III (T1-2N1) SCCHN of oral cavity, oropharynx, T2N0 hypopharynx, T2N0-1 supraglottic larynx.
2. To determine the MTD of daily oral dasatinib in combination with cisplatin/cetuximab/RT in Cohort B, in patients with AJCC stage III (T3N0-1) and IV (T1-4N2-3M0, T4N0-1M0) squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.
