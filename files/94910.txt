Modified Long-Course Radiotherapy Followed by Chemotherapy and PD-1 Inhibitor for MSS/pMMR High-risk Mid/Low LARC (MODIFI-RC-I)
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether a total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) regimen combining long-course chemoradiotherapy, sequential chemotherapy, and PD-1 inhibitor can improve response rates, enhance tolerability, and improve prognosis in patients with locally advanced, microsatellite-stable (MSS) rectal cancer.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does this TNT approach improve complete response (CR) rates?

How does selective reduction of clinical target volume (CTV) to S2/S3 level compare with conventional CTV irradiation in terms of efficacy and safety?

Researchers will compare a selective CTV reduction group and a conventional CTV irradiation group to assess differences in treatment outcomes, including complete response, tumor regression grading (TRG), organ preservation, R0 resection rates, and long-term survival.

Participants will:

Receive long-course chemoradiotherapy with either conventional or reduced CTV irradiation.

Undergo sequential chemotherapy.

Receive PD-1 inhibitor treatment.

Be monitored for safety, tumor regression, and long-term survival outcomes.
