Study of Adoptive Cellular Therapy Using Autologous T Cells Transduced With Lentivirus to Express a CD33 Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD33-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Any time the words "you," "your," "I," or "me" appear, it is meant to apply to the potential participant.

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and tolerability of 3 different doses of CD33-CAR-T cells (referred to throughout the consent as "T-cells") in patients who have CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to treatment).

CD33-CAR-T is made by genetically modifying (changing) your T-cells (a type of white blood cell). T-cells are genetically changed to help target leukemia cells.

This is an investigational study. CD33-CAR-T is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

Up to 39 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
Hematopoietic/Lymphoid Cancer|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: CD33-CAR-T Cell Infusion
Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of CD33-CAR-T Cells, RP2D defined as the highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with at most 1 instance of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

DLT is defined as a clinically significant adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and occurring during the first course on study that meets any of the following criteria:

* CTCAE grades non-reversible grade 3, or any grade 4-5 allergic reactions related to the study cell infusion.
* CTCAE grades non-reversible grade 3, or any grade 4-5 autoimmune reactions related to the study cell infusion.
* CTCAE grades non-reversible grade 3, or any grade 4-5 organ toxicity (cardiac, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal/genitourinary, or neurologic) not pre-existing or due to the underlying malignancy and occurring within 28 days of study product infusion related to study cell infusion., 28 days after completion of the CD33-CAR-T infusion
Disease Response to CD33-CAR-T Cells, Response to treatment evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standardized response criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes.

Disease response to CD33-CAR-T cells defined as Complete Remission (CR), Complete Remission without Platelet Recovery (CRp), Complete Remission without Neutrophil Recovery (CRn), Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi), Partial Remission (PR) or Non-responder (NR)., On Day 7, at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, and at Months 3, 6, and 12 after CD33-CAR-T Cell infusion
