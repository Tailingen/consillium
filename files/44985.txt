Single Arm Study of Neoadjuvant Dostarlimab in Stage II and III Deficient Mismatch Repair Colon Cancers
This is a Phase II, single arm study looking at the rate of major clinical response and non-operative management in Stage II and III colon cancer after 18 weeks (up to 6 cycles) of neoadjuvant dostarlimab.
Colon Cancer|dMMR Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Dostarlimab
Major Clinical Response (MCR) Rate, MCR rate is defined as the proportion of patients meeting the following criteria at 18 weeks: 1) ctDNA is stable or declining, 2) a clinically asymptomatic primary tumor, and 3) no metastatic disease., From Dostarlimab initiation to 18 weeks.
Metastasis-Free Survival (MFS) Prior to Surgery, MFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the date of metastasis or death due to any cause, if occurring prior to surgery. Otherwise, patients will be censored at the date of surgery or last radiographic assessment, whichever occurs first., From Dostarlimab initiation until surgery or Dostarlimab completion, up to 2 years.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the date of first documentation of disease progression (defined as increasing ctDNA, symptomatic primary tumor or metastasis), or death due to any cause. Otherwise, patients will be censored at last radiographic assessment., From treatment Dostarlimab until study completion, up to 5 years.|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with RECIST disease response (CR, PR). All patients that do not meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis cutoff date will be considered non-responders., From Dostarlimab initiation until surgery or Dostarlimab completion, up to 2 years.
The purpose of this research study is to look at the effects of the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab on dMMR colon cancer tumors and to see if these patients can avoid surgical resection, with the option to go to surgery only if the tumor does not respond.
