Technical Failure During Colorectal Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR): The "Through Thick and Thin" Study
Among advanced resection techniques, endoscopic full thickness resection (EFTR) allows closure and full-thickness resection by the use of the non-exposed full thickness resection device (FTRD). The study is a retrospective analysis of technical failure occurring during colorectal full-thickness resection. Full thickness resection is a safe and effective procedure for "difficult" colorectal lesions. However, technical failure can occur and to date there is no evidence about type and clinical consequences in this setting.

The study is a multicentre retrospective study involving centres with experience in advanced colorectal resections.

Each centre is invited to submit information about the Centre and to report alle the consecutive cases corresponding to technical failure.
