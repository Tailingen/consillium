A Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability of SH3765 Tablet in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumor
The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of SH3765 in subjects with advanced malignant tumor by determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The second objective is to evaluate the PK profile and preliminary efficacy of SH3765 in subjects with advanced malignant tumor.
Advanced Malignant Tumor
DRUG: SH3765 tablet
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as an adverse event that meets protocol defined DLT criteria occurring from the first dose to the end of cycle 1 of multiple doses, except those unequivocally due to the underlying malignancy or an extraneous cause., Within the first 28 days of consecutive treatment|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose at which DLT occurred in less than one-third of subjects during the DLT observation period., Within the first 28 days of consecutive treatment
Cmax, Highest observed plasma concentration of SH3765, 4 weeks|Tmax, Time of highest observed plasma concentration of SH3765, 4 weeks|T1/2, Elimination half-life of SH3765, 4 weeks|Area Under the Curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration time curve of SH3765, 4 weeks|Mean Residence Time (MRT), The average residence time in body of SH3765, 4 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR), up to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), up to 12 months|Disease control rates (DCR), up to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR), up to 12 months|Lymph node response rate (LNR), up to 12 months
This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, multidose, two-part study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of SH3765, a protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitor, in subjects with advanced malignant tumor including but not limited to solid tumor and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
