Clinical Trial to Compare the Immunogenicity, Safety, and Tolerability of an Adjuvanted A(H1N1) Influenza Vaccine Versus Non-Adjuvanted A(H1N1) Influenza Vaccines in Patients With Invasive Solid Tumors
This is a phase III, randomized, controlled, open label study with two vaccine regimens. The study will assess the relative safety and immunogenicity of vaccine regimens comparing adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted formulations of A(H1N1) inactivated influenza virus vaccine in subjects with Solid Invasive Tumors and to compare safety and immunogenicity data with a contemporaneously enrolled control group of age-comparable, healthy subjects.

Because certain individuals may be hypo-responsive to influenza vaccination, additional studies with high-risk groups are warranted in order to determine the optimal vaccine formulation and dosing schedule for prevention of novel H1N1 virus infection.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the optimal influenza vaccination strategy in patients with invasive solid tumors, 3 months
Assess whether the adjuvanted vaccine offers a meaningful benefit in relation to the non-adjuvanted vaccine in this at-risk population, 3 months|Assess whether two doses of either study vaccine will provide meaningful benefit in comparison to one dose, 3 months|Assess the persistence of antibody levels in the two vaccine groups, 3 months|Gain further insight into the safety of the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines in this high-risk patient population, 3 months
