Post-surgery Radiotherapy
DEVICE: Mepitel Film|DRUG: skin cream
Mepitel Film efficacy in treating skin toxicity evaluatet with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4 will be used to evaluate the toxicity, one week after start of radiotherapy
Time for the skin toxicity appearance and resolution, one week after start of radiotherapy|Severity of the chronic skin toxicity, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4, one week after start of radiotherapy
For patients randomized in the mepitel arm:

Mepitel film will be placed on the patients' skin just before the start of the radiotherapy and will be replaced once a week until the end of the radiotherapy. In case of skin toxicities mepitel film will be placed until resolution of the toxicities. In case of new skin toxicities appearance the patient will be retreated with mepitel.

For patients randomized in the standard of treatment arm:

Patients will be treated with aqueous (Excipial U hydrolotion) or antiseptic (Flammazine o Ialugen Plus) cream in case of skin erythema. In case of new skin toxicities appearance the patient will be retreated with standard of care treatment.
