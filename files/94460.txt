Pazopanib in Imatinib Refractory or Intolerant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)
This study is being done to gather information about the safety (any harmful effects) and effectiveness (usefulness) of Pazopanib in the treatment of Gastrointestinal Stroma Tumors (GIST) that cannot be treated by surgery or has spread to other organs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved Pazopanib for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer but it is not approved for the treatment of GIST. The investigators hope to learn about the safety and usefulness (effectiveness) of Pazopanib for patients with GIST.

Primary Objective:

Non-progression rate based on RECIST criteria (CR+PR+SD)

Secondary Objectives:

* Response per Choi criteria
* 6 month progression-free survival
* Safety and tolerability
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
DRUG: Pazopanib
Non-progression Rate Based on RECIST 1.0 Criteria (CR+PR+SD), 4-mo non-progression rate

"Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progression, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, 24 weeks
Response Per Choi Criteria, Response per Choi criteria

* Complete response - Disappearance of all lesions; no new lesion
* Partial response - A decrease in size of \> or = 10% or a decrease in tumor density (HU) \> or = 15% on CT. No new lesions. No obvious progression of nonmeasurable disease.
* Stable disease - Does not meet the criteria for CR, PR, or PD. No symptomatic deterioration attributed to tumor progression.
* Progressive disease - An increase in tumor size of \> or = 10% and does not meet criteria of PR by tumor density (HU) on CT. New lesions. New intratumoral nodules or increase in the size of the existing intratumoral nodules., 6 months
