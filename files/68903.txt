Clinical Study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Combined with PD-1 Blockade in Recurrent or Metastatic NPC
This is a prospective, single-arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection combined with PD-1 blockade in patients with recurrent (not unable to locally curative treatment) or metastatic NPC who failed at least first-line platinum-containing standard regimen and/or anti PD-1/L1.
Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection|DRUG: PD-1 Inhibitors
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as time from the first assessment of CR or PR until the date of the first occurrence of PD, or until the date of death, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the date of diagnosis to death or last follow-up, with no restriction on the cause of death., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Thirty-two recurrent (not unable to locally curative treatment) or metastatic NPC patients who had failed at least first-line platinum-containing standard regimen and/or anti PD-1/L1 were eligible to receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection combined with PD-1 blockade once every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles, following PD-1 blockade alone once every 3 weeks for 2 years. All patients will be treated until disease progression as determined by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, intolerable toxicity, subject withdrawal of informed consent, initiation of new antitumor therapy, loss of follow-up, death, or study completion, whichever occurs first. Regular visits and imaging examinations will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment regimen.
