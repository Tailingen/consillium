Study of Lenalidomide and XRT in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
- The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of lenalidomide and radiation therapy is effective in controlling tumor growth in patients with newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.
Glioblastoma|Gliosarcoma|Malignant Gliomas
DRUG: lenalidomide|RADIATION: Radiation
To determine the efficacy of lenalidomide with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma., 3 years
To assess the proportion of patients treated with lenalidomide and radiation therapy surviving at 12 months, 3 years|to evaluate the time to tumor progression, 3 years|the radiologic response, 3 years|to determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of lenalidomide and radiation therapy., 3 years
* Patients will receive lenalidomide orally once daily for 21 days followed by a one week rest period (this is equivalent to one cycle).
* Four to seven days from the first dose of lenalidomide, the patient will start radiation therapy for approximately 6-7 weeks.
* A neurologic exam and routine blood tests will be performed weekly while the patient is receiving radiation therapy.
* Following the 11th week of treatment a MRI/CT scan will be performed to assess the status of the tumor. If there is no change, or there is shrinkage in the size of the tumor, the treatment will continue for another 4 week cycle.
* The four week cycle will continue as long as the disease remains stable or improved and the patient does not develop intolerable side effects. A MRI/CT scan will be done every 2 cycles (8 weeks).
