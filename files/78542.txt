An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of YY201 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignancies
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I clinical study of YY201 in the patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas and relapsed/refractory large granular lymphocytic leukemia who failed or cannot tolerate standard treatment.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Hematological Malignancy
DRUG: YY201
Dose limiting toxicity, The incidence and severity of adverse events (TEAE) during treatment were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, v5.0), Up to 31 days after the initial drug administration|Maximum tolerated dose, In the dose increment stage, the highest dose whose estimated DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate but does not exceed the upper bound of the equivalent interval of DLT rate is selected as MTD., Up to approximately 24 months|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of YY201 . The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of YY201 ., Up to approximately 24 months|Recommended Dose for Phase II Clinical Studies (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of YY201., Up to 31 days after the initial drug administration
Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of YY201 will be investigated., Up to 31 days after the initial drug administration|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of YY201 will be investigated., Up to 31 days after the initial drug administration|T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of YY201 will be investigated., Up to 31 days after the initial drug administration|Duration of Response(DoR), The time from the patient's first objective response to the patient's disease recurrence, progression, or death., Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Disease Response(TTR), The time from the first dose of YY201 to the first occurrence of objective response., Up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), The time from start date of study drug to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 24 months
This study includes a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. In the dose escalation phase the MTD and/or RP2D of YY201 will be determined and in the dose expansion phase the anti-tumor efficacy of YY201 will be evaluated in patients with relapsed‚ÅÑrefractory hematological malignancies. The two-phase study will assess the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy , safety, tolerability, and PK profile of YY201 .
