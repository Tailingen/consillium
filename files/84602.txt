Deep Inspiration Breath-hold Radiotherapy for Left-sided Breast Cancer
Postoperative breast radiotherapy (RT) has been associated with increased risk of heart toxicity. However, there is a lack of knowledge for radiation-induced early cardiovascular injury, especially for hypofractionated RT. This study aims to prospectively detect and predict early clinical or subclinical cardiac events in women undergoing adjuvant RT for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Cardiac Event
DEVICE: Deep inspiration breath-hold technique
Incidence of clinical or subclinical cardiac injury, predefined cardiac events, two years
Women with left-sided breast cancer undergo hypofractionated RT at either free-breathing or deep inspiration breath-hold. The incidence and potential clinical, dosimetric and biological indicators of early clinical or subclinical cardiac injury are investigate at 2 years.
