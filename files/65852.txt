First in Human, Dose Escalation Study of AN4005
Open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of AN4005 in patients with advanced tumors. This study is a first-in-human, dose escalation study with the objective to establish the MTD and/or RP2D of AN4005.

Except for Dose Level 0 (50 mg), a traditional "3 + 3 design" will be utilized for dose finding with dose escalation and/or de-escalation as appropriate.

In this study, one sentinel patient will be dosed at 50 mg first, then increasing doses of AN4005 will be administered to cohorts of 3 subjects, at doses ranging from 100 mg twice daily (BID) to 600 mg BID (see the table below). The proposed starting dose, 50 mg BID, has been selected based on integrated data from nonclinical studies. If 50 mg BID for one cycle is deemed to be tolerable upon review of safety data, the dose of AN4005 will be escalated to 100 mg BID in a cohort of 3 patients, and further dose escalations will be performed in separate cohorts based on review of data from all preceding cohorts. The dose escalation will be conducted in a sequential manner. Intermediate dose levels (decrement) may be explored. Decisions with regard to dose escalation to next dose level will be made jointly by the investigators and the sponsor. AE data collected for approximately 90 days following the end of exposure will also be used to inform the final dose and schedule. A minimum of 6 patients will be treated at the MTD/RP2D.
