Neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab in dMMR/ POLE-EDM Uterine Cancer Patients: a Feasibility Study
In this feasibility study the investigators intend to treat patients with high mutational uterine cancer with two cycles immune checkpoint inhibition before standard-of-care hysterectomy.
Uterine Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)
The primary objective is to characterize pathologic responses (necrosis/viable tumor cells) in uterine cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab, Hematoxylin and eosin staining on endometrium tissue collected during standard-of-care hysterectomy will be assessed by an experienced pathologist for evidence of necrosis and/or viable tumor cells, Tumor tissue is collected during standard of care hysterectomy (up to 6-10 weeks after baseline)|The primary objective is to characterize pathologic responses (Degree of immune infiltration) in uterine cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab, Hematoxylin and eosin staining on endometrium tissue collected during standard-of-care hysterectomy will be assessed by an experienced pathologist for degree of immune infiltration., Tumor tissue is collected during standard of care hysterectomy (week 6-10 after baseline)|The primary objective is to characterize pathologic responses (Degrees of inflammation, fibrosis, and mucin) in uterine cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab, Hematoxylin and eosin staining on endometrium tissue collected during standard-of-care hysterectomy will be assessed by an experienced pathologist for degrees of inflammation, fibrosis, and mucin, consistent with an ongoing immune response., Tumor tissue is collected during standard of care hysterectomy (week 6-10 after baseline)
Radiologic response, To assess the objective response rate of the tumor by MRI using RECIST1.1 in uterine cancer patients treated with 2 cycles neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab, MRI is scheduled before start study drug (week 1) and after final study drug ( 6-10 weeks after baseline)
Systemic immune response using an IFN-y-ELISPOT to screen for the presence of antigen-specific T-cell responses to mutation associated neo antigens, Collection of PBMC (60mL blood by vena puncture) before, during and after treatment to assess antigen specific T cell responses to mutation-associated neo-antigens, At 6 timepoints through the study up to 32 weeks.|Safety (adverse events), Adverse events will be documented according CTCAE., Through study completion, an average of 32 weeks.|Feasibility (surgical delays due to study treatment), The number of treatment-related surgical postponements will be counted to assess feasibility., Up to planned hysterectomy (6-10 weeks after baseline)|Predictive value of pipelle biopsy, In order to assess the correlation of pathological response seen in the biopsy and the surgical specimen. A pipelle biopsy will be obtained during surgery and assess as the tumor specimen from hysterectomy in the primary endpoint., An additional pipelle biopsy is obtained before start of the hysterectomy (6-10 weeks after baseline).
Objective:

The investigators aim to establish proof-of-concept for use of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) as novel neo-adjuvant therapy in (deficient mismatch repair) dMMR and (Polymerase Îµ mutation)POLE-EDM uterine cancer (UC). When ICB proves to be feasible as defined in the primary endpoint, a follow-up with a larger multicenter studies to determine clinical efficacy, such as postponing standard-of-care surgery or randomized studies to standard-of-care.

Study design:

The investigators planned a window-of-opportunity study of ICB in primary dMMR UC (n=10) and primary POLE-EDM UC (n=10) patients. ICB (pembrolizumab; anti-PD1) will be administered in two cycles of 3 weeks between diagnosis and standard-of-care hysterectomy.

Tumor responses to pembrolizumab will be assessed 3 weeks after the second cycle of pembrolizumab by a pathologist (primary endpoint) and MRI (secondary endpoint).After treatment with immun checkpoint blockade a hysterectomy will take place (standard-of care). Peripheral blood and tumor samples will be used to evaluate immune responses.

Study population:

Primary dMMR/ POLE-EDM UC patients of any stage and/or grade who are intended to be treated with a hysterectomy recruited from the North-Netherlands oncological region.

Intervention: Pembrolizumab, 200mg IV Q3W for a total of 2 administrations per patient, integrated into standard-of-care protocol prior to surgery. Based on the well-established time lines, the interval between diagnosis and standard of care hysterectomy is sufficient to treat patients with two cycles of pembrolizumab without interfering with standard of care.

Main study endpoints:

The primary endpoint is the response rate of the tumor assessed by pathology in uterine cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab. The secondary endpoint is the objective response rate of the tumor by MRI using RECIST. Exploratory objectives are immunogenicity, safety and the value of a pipelle biopsy as a predictor for response.
