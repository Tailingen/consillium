Cabozantinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma.
In this Phase II study we investigate the benefit of cabozantinib treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastasized urothelial cell carcinoma who have been pre-treated with checkpoint inhibitors only (cohort 1) or who have been pre-treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (cohort 2). We are lacking adequate response and outcome data in patients after immunotherapy and consider that this study will improve future treatment modalities for this important patient cohort.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib
Objective response rate after 6 months of cabozantinib treatment, The response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed reduction in tumor size compared to baseline as well as fulfilling the criteria for complete or partial response according to RECIST 1.1. The response to treatment is measured by computer tomography (CT) every 12 weeks starting from the first day of cabozantinib treatment., 6 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first intake of trial medication to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm., Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years|1-year survival, Rate of subjects surviving for at least one year after first intake/dose of trial medication, 1 year|Overall survival, The time between first application of trial medication to date of death due to any cause, Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years|Clinical benefit rate, Complete or partial response or stable disease for ≥ 6 months according to RECIST 1.1, Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years|Response duration, Duration of response in months from the first response (CR or PR) to progress after first intake of treatment medication, Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be presented., Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to Adverse Events (AEs), The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years
