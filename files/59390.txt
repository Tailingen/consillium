KN035 for dMMR/MSI-H Advanced Solid Tumors
In this study, patients with previously-treated locally-advanced or metastatic mismatched repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors will be treated with KN035 monotherapy.

For colorectal cancer participants, who are required to have been previously treated with standard therapies , other solid tumor participants, who are required to have been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard of care therapy.

Later-line therapies after failure of standard treatments for advanced colorectal and non-colorectal cancer patients are limited. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) played a role of positive predictive factor, which had been documented after the pembrolizumab and nivolumab trial were reported, for PD-1 blockade monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal and non-colorectal cancers.

In this study, patients with previously-treated locally-advanced or metastatic mismatched repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors will be treated with KN035 monotherapy.
