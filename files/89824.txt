A Trial of Temsirolimus With Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in Children With Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma
This is a phase I study of temsirolimus (Torisel) combined with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL).
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute, Childhood|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma|Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Temsirolimus|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Hydrocortisone|DRUG: Cytarabine
Number of Patients That Experienced DLT During Cycle 1 of Therapy, The incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be measured. The maximum tolerated dose will be the highest study dose at which 1 or fewer of six patients experience DLT during cycle 1 of therapy. All these analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature., Cycle 1 (a minimum of 4 weeks and a max of 8 weeks)
Response Rate at the Completion of 1 Cycle of Study Treatment, CR = Complete remission defined as attainment of bone marrow with \<5% blasts with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral counts (absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) \> or = to 500/uL and platelet count \> or = to 50,000 microliters) CRi = Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery defined as attainment of bone marrow with \>5% blasts with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease but insufficient recovery of ANC \< 500/uL or platelets \< 50,000 microliters PR = partial remission defined as complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of 5-25% blasts if greater than 25% blasts originally without new sites of extramedullary disease and with recovery of ANC.

SD = stable disease defined as not satisfying criteria for PD, or has recovery of ANC \> or = to 500/uL and fails to qualify for CR, CRi, or PR PD = progressive disease defined as an increase of at least 25% in bone marrow leukemic cells, Cycle 1 (a minimum of 4 weeks and a max of 8 weeks)|Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) Levels Present at End of Cycle 1 Therapy in Patients, MRD positive is defined as \> or = to 0.1% MRD MRD negative is define as \< 0.1% MRD

All these analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature., Cycle 1 (a minimum of 4 weeks and a max of 8 weeks)
Studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) inhibit growth of pre-B and T-cell ALL cell lines in vitro and in ALL xenograft models. The MTI temsirolimus was chosen for use in this study due to its weekly intravenous dosing, its more predictable blood levels, and availability of a single-agent pediatric MTD and its sustained biologic effect due to conversion to sirolimus. This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus that can given in combination with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in relapsed ALL, LL or PTL. A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design will be used. Response to treatment will be evaluated. Biology tests will be done to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD), temsirolimus' effect on glucocorticoid resistance, and mTOR inhibition.
