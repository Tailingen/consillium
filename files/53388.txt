A Study of IMM-101 in Combination With Radiation Induced Tumour Necrosis in Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effects of IMM 101 in combination with a single targeted dose of radiation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in whom chemotherapy or other treatment has not been effective. Administration of radiation (using the CyberKnife) to the target tumour growth in the liver results in the release of tumour material. IMM-101 may help the immune system to react to the tumour material released from the damaged tumour, and so have a beneficial effect in slowing down the rate of growth of other tumour growths in the liver and other organs.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Mycobacterium obuense|RADIATION: SBRT
Disease Stabilisation Rate, The disease stabilisation rate at 24 weeks defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response, partial response or stable disease in accordance with immune-related response criteria., 24 weeks
Safety and Tolerability Profiles, Safety and tolerability profiles as judged by:

Local and systemic toxicities. Number, type and degree of toxicities as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.

Safety and tolerability are be monitored through the study by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), 48 weeks|Objective Response Rate, Patients with an objective response were those who had a complete (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease(SD) based on CT scan findings, absence of clinical signs and symptoms of progression, did not withdraw due to disease progression prior to/at the Week 12/ 24 /36 / 48 assessment and were alive at the relevant assessment point, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks|Disease Stabilisation Rate, Patients with disease stabilisation were those who had CR, PR, or SD based on CT scan findings, absence of clinical signs and symptoms of progression, did not withdraw due to disease progression prior to/at the Week 24, 36 or 48 assessment and were alive at the respective assessment., 12, 36 and 48 weeks|Overall Disease Stabilisation Rate, The overall disease stabilisation rate was recorded as the percentage of patients with a CR, PR or SD as best overall response and was to be assessed at 12, 24 (primary time point), 36 and 48 weeks and overall., 12, 36 and 48 weeks.|Overall Response Rate, The overall response rate will be recorded as the percentage of patients with a CR or PR as best overall response., 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks.|Survival, The number of patients alive at 12, 24, 36 \& 48 weeks. Patients without a date of death were to be censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. The protocol made provision for patients to continue to be followed up and data to be collected, post study withdrawal., 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks
Radiotherapy given in standard fractionation regimes leads to cell death by causing double stranded DNA breaks via production of oxygen free radicals. At the very high doses of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) administered with extreme accuracy in a single fraction by the CyberKnife system, there is induction of tumour necrosis due to endothelial cell damage and vascular collapse, cell membrane breakdown, and the release of cellular material and tumour antigens into the circulation, in addition to DNA strand breaks. It is hypothesised that the combination of modulation of the body's immune responses in the presence of an increased exposure to tumour antigen will provide sufficient induction of the immune system to suppress tumour growth.
