A Study of AK104 Plus Platinum-containing Chemotherapy±Bevacizumab as First-line Treatment for Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This is A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase III Study to Evaluate AK104 Plus Platinum-containing Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab as First-line Treatment for Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AK104|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: Placebo
progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, Proportion of subjects who have a complete or partial response relative to baseline as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, Measured from the date of partial or complete response to therapy until the cancer progresses based on RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 2 years|Time to Response（TTR Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, Up to approximately 2 years|AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment, Up to approximately 2 years|Observed concentrations of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration, From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104
