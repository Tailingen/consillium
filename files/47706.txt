Broad Spectrum HPV (Human Papillomavirus) Vaccine Study in 16-to 26-Year-Old Women (V503-001)
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of V503 in comparison to GARDASIL. The primary hypotheses tested in the study were 1) V503 administered to 16- to 26-year-old adolescents and young women is generally well-tolerated, 2) V503 reduces combined incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 31/33/45/52/58-related disease compared with GARDASIL, and 3) V503 induces non-inferior geometric mean titers for HPV Type 6/11/16/18 antibodies compared with GARDASIL.

Base Study: Combined Incidence of HPV Type 31/33/45/52/58-related Disease (Test of Hypothesis), HPV Type 31/33/45/52/58-related high-grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 2/3), Adenocarcinoma in Situ (AIS), Invasive Cervical Carcinoma, high-grade Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN 2/3), high-grade Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VaIN 2/3), vulvar cancer, or vaginal cancer were determined by clinical/pathologic criteria and positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay for virus subtype.

Titers are reported in milli Merck Units/mL. Statistical analysis was performed only for HPV types contained in both vaccines., 4 weeks postdose 3 in the base study|Base Study: Percentage of Participants With One or More Adverse Event, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.

Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. AEs such as redness, swelling, and pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection site were recorded., Up to Day 5 after any vaccination|Base Study: Percentage of Participants With One or More Non-injection-site (Systemic) Adverse Event, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. Systemic AEs were those not categorized as injection-site AEs., Up to Day 15 after any vaccination|Base Study: Percentage of Participants With One or More Vaccine-related Adverse Event, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.
