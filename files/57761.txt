Alternative Schedule of Velcade/Dexamethasone Plus Doxil for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The current study is being conducted to evaluate the possibility that a different schedule of bortezomib, doxorubicin HCl liposome, and dexamethasone might decrease the incidence of peripheral neuropathy yet maintain similar efficacy and allow maintenance of bortezomib dosing for a longer period.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: bortezomib|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: doxorubicin HCl liposome
Incidence of Treatment-emergent Peripheral Neuropathy, Every 4 weeks from start of treatment until end of treatment
Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was measured from day 1 of treatment until time of progression, assessed up to 40 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Response, Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Minor Response (MR) each required stable bone disease and normal calcium levels. CR also required 100% serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reduction, negative immunofixation (IF), 100% urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP)reduction, and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow. PR also required \>=50% SPEP reduction, \>=90% UPEP reduction, and \>=50% reduction in plasma cells in bone marrow. MR also required \>=25% SPEP reduction, \>=50% UPEP reduction, and \> 25% reduction in plasma cells., Every 8 weeks from start of treatment until end of treatment|Relative Dose Intensity of Bortezomib, Relative dose intensity is defined as actual dose/scheduled dose. Bortezomib is administered on Days 1, 4, 15, and 18 every 28 days., Each dose of bortezomib (days 1, 4, 15, and 18 every 28 days)
