J-pouch Versus Side-to-end Coloanal Anastomosis After Preoperative Radiotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer
The objective of this study was to compare the functional and surgical results of the J-pouch with those of the side-to-end anastomosis and their impact on quality of life.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: j-pouch coloanal anastomosis|PROCEDURE: side-to-end coloanal anastomosis
Primary endpoint was the function of the neo-rectum as assessed by a validated functional outcome questionnaire at 4 months., 4 months
Function of the neo-rectum as assessed by the functional outcome questionnaire, 12 months|Surgical results, 4 and 12 months|Quality of life, 4 and 12 months
Invalidating anorectal dysfunctions are common after restorative rectal surgery. Improvement of functional results by the technically more demanding J-pouch has been demonstrated in comparison with the straight coloanal anastomosis. In the present multicenter randomized trial we assessed whether the J-pouch is also superior to the side-to-end coloanal anastomosis.
