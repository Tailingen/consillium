FreezIng bReaST Cancer in Brazil: a Before-after Study
Image-guided tumor ablation is a non-surgical, minimally invasive therapy available for local therapy of some carcinomas as an alternative to surgical treatment. This study assesses whether cryoablation can be used as an alternative to surgery in cases of early invasive breast carcinoma.
Breast Cancer|Breast Neoplasms
DEVICE: Cryoablation
Tumor ablation, Successful tumor ablation will be defined as absence of residual viable invasive or in situ carcinoma in the surgical specimen., 1 month
Negative predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Magnetic resonance imaging will be conducted between 14 to 28 days after cryoablation. Negative predictive value of MRI will be calculated according to the pathological report after the traditional surgery. Negative predictive value = number of the patients who is pathologically negative divided by the number of patients who is MRI negative., 14 days and 28 days|Accuracy of conventional imaging methods (mammography and ultrasound), Mammography and ultrasound will be conducted between 14 to 28 days after cryoablation. Accuracy of conventional imaging methods will be calculated according to the pathological report after the traditional surgery., 14 days and 28 days|Measurement of the ice ball by ultrasound, To compare the baseline tumor size, ultrasound measurement of the ice ball, and the pathological result., 14 days and 28 days
Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of cryoablation in the local treatment of breast cancer, through the absence of neoplastic cells (invasive or in situ).
