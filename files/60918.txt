Safety and Effectiveness Study of RF Ablation of Uterine Fibroids to Reduce Menstrual Bleeding: the Fibroid Ablation Study
The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a minimum 75% volume radiofrequency ablation of fibroids associated with menorrhagia results in reduction of menstrual bleeding.
