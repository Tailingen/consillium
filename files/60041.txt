Lenalidomide, Vorinostat and Dexamethasone in Relapsed Patients With Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (PTCL)
A standard therapy is neither established in first-line patients nor in relapsed patients with PTCL, and there is still an unmet medical need to identify novel efficacious and safe therapy regimens.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a Lenalidomide plus Vorinostat and Dexamethasone combination therapy as an effective and safe therapeutic regimen, in the treatment of relapsed PTCL following failure of prior regimens.
Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Vorinostat, Lenalidomide
The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a Lenalidomide, Vorinostat, and Dexamethasone combination regimen in terms of occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at any dose level., 6 months
Remission rate of a combination therapy with Lenalidomide, Vorinostat, and Dexamethasone in a treatment refractory or relapsed population, defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 6 months
