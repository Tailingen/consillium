PET Image Exploration of Novel Tracer [68Ga]-FAPI-JNU Imaging Studies in Patients with Malignant Tumors
To investigate the biological distribution of a new tracer 68Ga-FAPI-JNU in the primary, metastatic and normal tissues of patients with malignant tumors, and to evaluate the biological distribution of 68GA-FAPI-JNU with standardized uptake values.
Cancer|Solid Malignancies
DRUG: 68Ga-FAPI-JNU
Evaluation of the distribution of 68Ga-FAPI-JNU in tumors, metastases and normal tissues, CT and PET scans were performed on the patients injected with 68Ga-FAPI-JNU. After image reconstruction and PET/CT image fusion, the biological distribution of 68Ga-FAPI-JNU in the primary tumor, metastatic tumor and various tissues and organs of the patients was evaluated by radioactive uptake value (standardized uptake value, SUV), 4 hour
PET/CT imaging was performed about 1 hour after the patient was injected with the novel tracer 68Ga-FAPI-JNU. SUVmax and SUVmean values of the area of interest were mapped by two diagnostic physicians with more than 5 years of experience after the imaging was completed.
