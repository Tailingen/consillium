Effect of Stellate Ganglion Block on ME/CFS
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the effects of stellate ganglion block (SGB) in participants with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does SGB treatment improve symptoms of ME/CFS (e.g. brain fog, fatigue)? Do changes in symptoms go along with changes in blood or saliva?

Participants will receive a total of six blocks over three weeks (one block on each side, one day apart, per week). Prior to treatment and at two points following treatment, participants will complete surveys, take a cognitive (puzzle type) test, and provide blood and saliva for analysis. Participants will measure their heart rate daily using a free smart phone app.

Change in Subjective Rating of Symptoms at 2 Weeks, The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate whether stellate ganglion block treatment improves the subjective rating of symptoms (severity and frequency) and the amount of limitations to activities. We will measure the change from baseline scores at two weeks for the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire to measure the frequency and severity of symptoms (on a scale of 0 to 4 in which a higher score indicates more frequent or more severe) and the Rand Short Form-36-Physical Fatigue subscale (SF-36PF) to measure the amount of limitations due to symptoms (on a scale of 1-3 in which a higher score indicates less limitation)., 2 weeks|Change in Subjective Rating of Symptoms at 2 Months, The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate whether stellate ganglion block treatment improves the subjective rating of symptoms (severity and frequency) and the amount of limitations to activities.

Scores are standardized and scaled to adjust for age and the device on which tests are taken. Scores range from 0 to 200, in which the average score (corresponding to the 50th percentile) is set to 100, and higher scores indicate better cognitive function. Scores are obtained for attention, executive function, and memory. Scores at baseline will be compared to scores at two weeks post-treatment., 2 weeks|Change in Cognitive Function at 2 Months, The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate whether stellate ganglion block treatment reduces "brain fog" as measured by computerized neurocognitive tests for attention, executive function, and memory.

Change in Orthostatic Tolerance at 2 Weeks, The 10-minute National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) lean test will be used to measure hemodynamic changes during orthostatic challenge (lying down vs. standing up). The study will measure change from baseline at 2 weeks post-treatment., 2 weeks|Change in Orthostatic Tolerance at 2 Months, The 10-minute National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) lean test will be used to measure hemodynamic changes during orthostatic challenge (lying down vs. standing up).

These parameters reflect the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (aka "autonomic tone"). ME/CFS patients are known to have excessive sympathetic tone. Within normal levels, better outcomes are indicated by lower resting heart rate, increased heart rate variability, and increased blood oxygenation., 2 weeks|Change in Autonomic Tone at 2 Months, A wearable device (a ring worn on a finger at night) will be used to measure resting heart rate (beats per minute), heart rate variability (milliseconds), and blood oxygenation (percentage oxygen aka SpO2) during the night and for 5 minutes upon awakening, in combination with a smart phone app, at baseline and two months after treatment.

Change in Salivary Cortisol upon Awakening at 2 Weeks, Concentration of free cortisol in saliva upon awakening will be measured in micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), at baseline and two weeks after treatment. ME/CFS patients have abnormally low levels of cortisol in general and upon awakening. An increased concentration within the normal range (from 0.007 ug/dL to 0.115 ug/dL) indicates a better outcome., 2 weeks|Change in Salivary Cortisol Upon Awakening at 2 Months, Concentration of free cortisol in saliva upon awakening will be measured in micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), at baseline and two months after treatment.

Changes in abnormal metabolites toward normal values would indicate a better outcome., 2 weeks|Change in Metabolites at 2 Months, Plasma will be analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to determine the levels of 433 hydrophilic metabolites (relative to an unchanging molecule in plasma) at baseline and at two months after treatment.
