BI-1910 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this first in human clinical trial is to test BI-1910 administered as single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed after standard therapy.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* how safe and tolerable is BI-1910
* what is maximum tolerated or administrated dose
* to determine recommended dose for further clinical trials

Participants will receive infusions of BI-1910 alone or combination with pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.

DLTs will be considered by the safety monitoring committee for the purposes of dosing decisions., During phase 1 Part A: from the first dose of BI-1910 for 21 days.

This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, FIH, consecutive-cohort, clinical trial of BI-1910, as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab, in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed after standard therapy.

The trial comprises 2 phases: a Phase 1 with Parts A and B, and a Phase 2a with Parts A and B.

Phase 1 Part A consists of a dose escalation of BI-1910 as a single agent to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine the RP2D as a single agent (sRP2D) in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed after standard therapy.

Phase 1 Part B consists of a dose escalation of BI-1910 in combination with pembrolizumab to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment and to allow selection of the RP2D for BI-1910 in combination with pembrolizumab (cRP2D) in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed after standard therapy.

Phase 2a will assess BI-1910 administered as a single agent (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B) at the respective hypothesized RP2D(s) determined in Phase 1. Phase 2a expansion will be conducted in indication specific cohorts of subjects. The aim of the Phase 2a is to urther assess the safety and tolerability of BI-1910 as a single agent (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B), characterize its PK and pharmacodynamics, and assess preliminary antitumor activity by ORR, DoR, and progression-free survival (PFS), as measured by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST.
