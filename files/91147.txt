Radiomics-based Models for the Prediction of Pathological Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy in Gastric and Gastroesophageal Cancer
Identifying predictors of response to neoadjuvant therapy in gastric and gastro-oesophageal cancer early in the history of the disease would ensure optimal treatment planning.

The study aims to apply radiomics for the prediction of response to neoadjuvant therapy.
