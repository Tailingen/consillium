Overall response rate (ORR)., Tumor measurements will be obtained using CT-scans (or MRIs) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline then every 8 weeks (+/- one week) according to RECIST v1.1. At the investigator's discretion, tumor assessments may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected.

It is preferred that the scans for a patient are taken with the same technique (CT or MRI) throughout the study., 2 months

Background - Rationale Aflibercept The addition of aflibercept to the standard FOLFIRI regimen as second-line therapy was evaluated in a large phase III study (EFC10262-VELOUR). This combination significantly improved both PFS (4.7 to 6.9 months, HR=0.76; P=\<0.001) and OS (12.1 to 13.5 months, HR=0.82; P=0.003). In the evaluable population (86.5%), the tumor response rate was also improved when adding aflibercept (ORR=19.8% \[16.4-23.2\]) to the FOLFIRI regimen (ORR=11.1% \[8.5-13.8\]).

Irinotecan The combination of aflibercept with FOLFIRI3, an optimized irinotecan-based regimen, was evaluated in 65 patients in a French multicentric retrospective cohort. (Carola C et al, WJCO 2018) In the cohort of irinotecan-naïve patients (n=30), the objective response rate was 43.3%, and the disease control rate 76.7%. Median PFS and OS were 11.3 months (95% CI 6.1-29.0) and 17.0 months (95% CI 13.0-17.3). The most common (\>5%) grade 3-4 adverse events were diarrhea (37.9%), neutropenia (14.3%), stomatitis and anemia (10.4%), hypertension (6.7%).

In the cohort of patients previously treated with irinotecan (n=35), the objective response rate was 34.3%, and the disease control rate 60.0%. Median PFS and OS were 5.7 months (95% CI 3.9-10.4) and 14.3 months (95% CI 12.8-19.5).

Study Objectives

Primary:

•To compare once (day 1) or twice (day 1, day 3) administration of irinotecan in combination with 5-fluorouracile and aflibercept as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in terms of overall response rate (ORR)

Secondary:

* To evaluate disease control rate (DRC) and Early Response Rate (ERR)
* To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS),
* to evaluate the conversion rate to locoregional therapy, surgery of metastasis, the quality of resection (R0, R1, R2) and the pathological response in patients with resected metastatic disease,
* To assess the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30),
* To assess Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) on using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC version 5.0).

Exploratory:

* To assess the impact on selected circulating biomarkers (angiogenic and exosomal)
* To assess the impact on selected tumor biomarkers
