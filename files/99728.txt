Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Vietnam with high mortality rate. Patients at early stages undergo radical gastrectomy with curative intent, but the remaining tumor cells, termed as minimal residual disease (MRD), can later cause relapse. Conventional methods to monitor MRD such as imaging and blood tests for biomarkers such as CEA are not sensitive and specific enough. ctDNA has recently emerged as a promising noninvasive marker with high accuracy to monitor MRD and detect relapse in many cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. However, its application in gastric cancer has not been extensively evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to use advanced NGS technologies to detect ctDNA in liquid biopsy as a biomarker to monitor MRD after radical gastrectomy.
