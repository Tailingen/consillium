Indolent Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Rituximab
Assess the efficacy, Evaluate the efficacy in term of Overall Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) and Tumour Control Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease), Two weeks after the completion of Rituximab + Lenalidomide
Assess the safety, The safety will be evaluated on the basis of recorded toxicities graded on a scale of 1 to 5 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0, From start of treatment for all follow up period (18 months)

At the end of the third cycle of R-Lenalidomide (week 12 of the study), the patients will be evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment); the patients with Progressive Disease (PD) will be withdrawn of the study. Two weeks after the end last courses of R-Lenalidomide (week 26 of the study) patients will be evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment). Patients with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), and with a stable disease will undergo the follow up phase, while patients with PD will be withdrawn of the study.
