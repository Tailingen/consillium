Assess the Efficacy of Radiotherapy and Sequential Chemotherapy and AK104 Before TME Surgery for Local CRC（AK104-IIT-13）
This study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative short-course radiotherapy combined with AK104 and chemotherapy + TME surgery in patients with advanced rectal cancer.
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
DRUG: AK104 injection|PROCEDURE: TME surgery|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Pathologic complete response rate (pCR), To assess the result from pathology report, From date of randomization until the date of end of treatment,about 18 weeks.
Major pathologic response rate (MPR), To assess the result from pathology report, From date of randomization until the date of end of treatment,about 18 weeks.|3-years DFS rate, To compute the length between end of treatment and relapse, From date of randomization until the date of first documented disease relapse or date of death from any cause, whichever came first about 3years..|3-years OS rate, To compute the length between end of treatment and death, From date of randomization until date of death from any cause,about 3 years.|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and clinically meaningful abnormal laboratory test results, To assess the result from inspection paper during the trail, From date of randomization until the date of end of treatment,about 18 weeks.
Relationship between the expression of immune markers in tumor tissues and blood,the distribution of immune cells, and the efficacy and prognosis of patients, To use PCR to check the immune markers in blood and use immunofluorescent cytochemical techniques to check the immune markers in tumor tissues.The concentration of antigens and antibodies in the blood is measured to determine the efficacy and concentration of the drug after the subject's medication, From date of randomization until the date of end of treatment,about 18 weeks.
Studies included a screening period (no more than 28 days after participants signed informed consent form to 28 days before first dose), treatment (receiving appropriate treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death or study end, whichever occurs first), and follow-up (including safety follow-up and survival follow-up).

Eligible subjects will receive short-course radiotherapy (SCRT), IMRT/VMAT, pelvic 25Gy/5f/1 week. Two weeks after the end of treatment, subjects continued to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy regimen for 4 cycles: AK104 10 mg/kg, intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W), plus CAPOX (capecitabine: 1000mg/m2, bid, po, d1-14, oxaliplatin: 130mg/m2, ivgtt, d1), Q3W. Neoadjuvant therapy was assessed 2 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant therapy, and TME surgery was performed 4 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant therapy (R0 surgery was performed). Patients are not recommended to enter the organ preservation observation; If the efficacy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is evaluated as clinical complete remission (cCR) and the patient strongly refuses surgery, the patient should be informed of the risk of recurrence and ask the patient to sign a rejection of surgery. Medication safety is assessed and, depending on the severity of adverse events (AEs) and drug relevance, investigators will take steps to ensure subject safety. After surgery (or patients who strongly refuse surgery) there is a 30- and 90-day safety follow-up, and survival assessments are performed every 3 months to obtain survival information and collect new tumor treatment information until the death of the participant, withdrawal of informed consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.
