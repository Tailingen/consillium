Bispecific Antibody Plus White Blood Cells in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Bispecific antibodies plus white blood cells may be able to locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bispecific antibodies with white blood cells in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: bispecific antibody MDX447|BIOLOGICAL: lymphokine-activated killer cells|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the safety and tolerability of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes in patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme.
* Determine the response, time to tumor progression, and overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

Patients undergo maximal surgical debulking of the tumor at the time of reservoir placement. Within 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive one treatment of intratumoral bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes. Stable or responding patients may receive a second treatment 1 month later.

Cohorts of 1 or 3 patients receive escalating doses of bispecific antibody MDX447 and activated monocytes until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13 patients will be accrued for this study.
