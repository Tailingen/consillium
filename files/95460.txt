A Phase I Study of TAS-102 in Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Tumors.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of TAS-102 administered in combination with CPT-11 in patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors.
Advanced Gastrointestinal Tumors
DRUG: TAS-102|DRUG: CPT-11|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Determine maximum tolerated dose, The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose level at which less than 33% of the evaluable patients treated experience a dose-limiting toxicity during Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 (ie, during the first 4 weeks) of study drug administration., Through Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (ie, 4 weeks)|Safety monitoring including adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, Standard safety monitoring and grading using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used., Safety is assessed through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment.
Investigate the safety of TAS-102 and CPT-11 at the MTD administered in combination with Bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV)., Standard safety monitoring and grading using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used., Through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment|Investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAS-102, CPT-11, and their metabolites., PK analysis for FTD, FTY, TPI, CPT-11, and SN-38 in plasma and will include Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. FTD and TPI: CL/F, Vd/F will be calculated., Blood samples will be collected in Cycle 1 at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 and 48 hours post AM dose of TAS-102 in combination with CPT-11.|Document any preliminary antitumor activity of TAS-102 administered in combination with CPT-11 and in combination with CPT-11 and Bevacizumab., Tumor assessments using Response Evlauation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), After every 4 cycles (i.e., every 8 weeks)
This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of TAS-102 administered in combination with CPT-11. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the maximum tolerated dose and an Expansion Phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of the maximum tolerated dose. Patients will be assigned to sequential dose-level cohorts with each cohort corresponding to a pre-specified dose of TAS-102 and CPT-11 combination. Escalation to the subsequent dose level will occur only after the previous dose level is determined to be safe.
