UB-VV400 in Combination with Rapamycin in Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is an exploratory, open-label, investigator-initiated trial (IIT) of the safety, efficacy, and PK/Pd of UB-VV400 alone and in combination with rapamycin in adult subjects with R/R LBCL. LBCL will include subjects with aggressive lymphoma, defined as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), including high-grade lymphoma (HGL) with double/triple hit DLBCL; transformed DLBCL (tDLBCL), including Richter's transformation; follicular lymphoma Grade 3B (FL3B); and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The study will include subjects who have had prior CD19-directed CAR T-cell exposure and subjects who are CAR T cell-naive. Clinical unmet need exists in both populations.

The objective of this study is to determine the MTD/MAD and following study of UB-VV400 administered alone and in combination with rapamycin. The dose-finding (DF) portion will evaluate the safety profile of UB-VV400 administered at various dose levels (DLs) alone (Stage 1) and in combination with rapamycin (Stage 2).

The dose-expansion (DE) portion will further optimize the dose and define the safety profile and preliminary efficacy of UB-VV400 alone and/or in combination with rapamycin. The study will use the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design to allocate subjects to various DLs to minimize exposure to subtherapeutic DLs while maintaining appropriate safety parameters. DF will consist of 2 stages: Stage 1 DF aims to identify the MTD of UB-VV400 monotherapy, and Stage 2 DF aims to identify the MTD of UB-VV400 in combination with rapamycin. DF will be initiated in Stage 1 with UB-VV400 monotherapy, administered IV and starting at DL1.
