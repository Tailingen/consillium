Implementation of the Symptom Navi© Program
The Symptom Navi© Program is a program to support symptom self-management of 16 core symptoms frequently experienced by patients in outpatient oncology units.The current study aims to pilot test the implementation of the Symptom Navi© Program under real-life conditions by evaluating procedures, testing preliminary effectiveness and assessing potential unintended effects using a cluster-randomised waitlist design complemented by qualitative methods.

Patients treated in cancer outpatient settings in Switzerland have high unmet care needs, especially in the domain of self-management of symptoms. The Symptom Navi© Program was developed to support symptom self-management of 16 core symptoms frequently experienced by patients in outpatient oncology units. The acceptability and feasibility of the Symptom Navi© Program was supported by a qualitative study with 10 cancer patients who received semi-structured patient consultations and subsequently used the Symptom Navi© Flyers at home.

The overall objective of the current study is to pilot test the implementation of the Symptom Navi© Program under real-life conditions. The aims are to evaluate procedures, to test preliminary effectiveness and to assess potential unintended effects using a cluster-randomised waitlist design complemented by qualitative methods. The unit of randomization are the participating cancer outpatient centres with each centre representing a cluster. Intervention cluster will provide the Symptom Navi© Program, control clusters will provide usual care for symptom-management.
