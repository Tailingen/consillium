Trial of an Alternative Cabozantinib Dosing Schedule in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma and Neuroendocrine Tumors
This is a multi-site, three-cohort phase II trial of cabozantinib for IMDC all-risk frontline metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients OR any line mRCC patients who have not previously been treated with cabozantinib, and patients with pancreatic or extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Nivolumab
Cohort A: Average daily dose of cabozantinib > 42.8 mg in at least 70% of patients, To show that alternative cabozantinib dosing can improve average daily dose compared to historical controls, 2 years|Cohort B: 75% of patients alive and progression free at 12 months, Cohort B: To show that alternative cabozantinib dosing + nivolumab (standard dose) can improve 12-month rate of progression-free survival over standard dose cabozantinib + nivolumab, 1 year|Cohort C: Decreased rate of grade ≥ 3 adverse events compared to 75% reported in CABINET trial, Cohort C: To show that alternative cabozantinib dosing can improve rates of grade \> 3 adverse events compared to the grade 3-5 adverse events reported in the CABINET trial, 2 years
Cohort A: Decreased grade ≥ 3 adverse events compared to historical controls (METEOR trial), Demonstrate that alternative dosing can change overall toxicity compared to historical controls by monitoring grade ≥ 3 adverse events compared to historical controls, 2 years|Cohort A: Improved median duration of time on drug compared to historical controls, Show that alternative scheduling can change median duration of time on drug compared to historical controls, 2 years|Cohort A: Objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria of all patients treated, Response rates will be summarized via frequencies and 95% confidence intervals, and compared to historical results using two-sided one-sample exact binomial tests of proportions, 2 years|Cohort B: Decreased grade ≥ 3 adverse events compared to historical comparison from the CheckMate 9ER trial, Demonstrate that alternative dosing can change overall toxicity compared to historical controls by monitoring grade ≥ 3 adverse events compared to historical controls, 2 years|Cohort B: Improved median duration on the drug (as defined by time from initiation of therapy to time of cessation of therapy) compared to historical comparison to the CheckMate 9ER trial, Show that alternative scheduling can change median duration of time on drug compared to historical controls, 2 years|Cohort B: Increased median average daily dose of cabozantinib, Calculate the median average daily dose, and compare it to the null hypothesis using a one-sample Wilcoxon signed-ran test, 2 years|Cohort B: Objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria of all patients treated, Response rates will be summarized via frequencies and 95% confidence intervals, and compared to historical results using two-sided one-sample exact binomial tests of proportions, 2 years|Cohort B: Overall Survival analysis of all patients treated within the cohort, Overall survival will be analyzed and summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared to results of historic control using two-sided one-sample log-rank tests, 2 years|Cohort C: Percent of patients requiring dose reduction as a descriptive endpoint, Percent of patients requiring dose reduction as a descriptive endpoint will be calculated along with the 95% confidence interval., 2 years|Cohort C: Progression free survival as a descriptive endpoint, Progression free survival will be characterized as a descriptive endpoint using a Kaplan-Meier curve., 2 years
This is a multi-site, three-cohort phase II trial of cabozantinib for IMDC all-risk frontline metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients OR any line mRCC patients who have not previously been treated with cabozantinib, and patients with pancreatic or extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The study is comprised of three cohorts; Cohorts A and C will employ the alternative dosing schema with cabozantinib monotherapy in any-line clear cell or non-clear cell mRCC patients and patients with pancreatic or extra-pancreatic NETs, and Cohort B will employ the alternative dosing schema with cabozantinib in combination with standard-dosed nivolumab in front-line clear cell or non-clear cell mRCC patients.

Study will accrue a total of 111 patients (Cohort A n=49, Cohort B n=37, Cohort C n=25). Patients in cohorts A and C will be treated with the same cabozantinib alternative dosing schema and schedule, with the exception of Cohort B patients also receiving monthly fix-dosed nivolumab infusions. Patients will start at 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and dose escalate or de-escalate based on pre-specified criteria and at set dosing schedules to allow for smaller median dose changes between adjustments. The de-escalation would be fine-tuned and adjustments would be made in 10 mg average daily dosing increments by utilizing alternate day dosing schedules (e.g. 60 mg/40 mg every other day) rather than decreasing by 20 mg (table 1). The maximum dose of cabozantinib is 60 mg daily, while the lowest dosing level on trial will be 20 mg every other day. Cycles would be 28 days, with weekly follow-up for cycle 1 and bi-weekly follow-up for cycle 2 to allow for prompt dose adjustments, and then monthly. At each check-in, patients in Cohorts A and B that have met the established protocol criteria (outlined in Section 6.3) and were not yet at the maximum dose of 60 mg daily would be eligible for dose-escalation. At each check in, patients in cohort C that have met the established protocol criteria and were not yet at the maximum dose of 60 mg daily will be mandated to start next higher dose level. Patients would also be dose de-escalated as determined by the investigator. Patients who de-escalate may be allowed to re-escalate in the future.
