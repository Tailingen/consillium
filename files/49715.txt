Allogenic Stem Cell Transplantation for Children, Adolescents and Young Adults With Relapsed or Refractory AML
1. To evaluate whether stem cell transplantation from a matched sibling donor is equivalent to a matched unrelated donor in in a second complete remission of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
2. To evaluate whether stem cell transplantation (SCT) after chemotherapy (FLAMSA-schema) increases survival compared to a threshold derived from historical data
3. To evaluate whether SCT from haploidentical donors for children having no matched donor will result in better survival with acceptable toxicity.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
BIOLOGICAL: Hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood
To evaluate whether stem cell transplantation (SCT) from a matched sibling donor (MSD) is equivalent to a matched unrelated donor (MUD) in second complete remission (CR2)., day 100|To evaluate whether "FLAMSA" increases leukemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared to a historic control group, day 100|To evaluate whether SCT from haploidentical donors for children having no matched donor will result in an acceptable toxicity profile and a better LFS as compared to historic controls., day 100
Prospective evaluation of event free survival (EFS), LFS, and OS after SCT from either a MSD or a MUD, day 100|To evaluate whether it is feasible to standardize transplantation procedures in children with AML within the AML-Berlin/Frankfurt/MÃ¼nster (BFM) study network, day 100|Decrease of transplantation associated mortality by standardized donor selection criteria, day 100|To further evaluate the contribution of immunomediated effects for the treatment of children suffering from very high risk AML, day 100|Prospective evaluation of late toxicities, day 100 and year 5
Target variables:

* Treatment response
* Event Free Survival
* Leukemia Free Survival
* Graft Versus Host Disease
* Regimen related toxicity
