Study of SBRT Efficacy on Intra and Extra -Cranial Tumors or Metastasis in Pediatrics Population (SBRT Pediatrics)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation treatments (SBRT) on children, teenagers and young adults malignant tumors.
Brain Metastasis|Spinal Tumors|Lung Tumors|Ependymoma
RADIATION: SBRT treatment
Efficacy of SBRT assessed 6 months after treatment, The treatment efficacy is assessed by calculation of local control rate of irradiated locations according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria (complete response + partial response + stable disease), 6 months after inclusion
Efficacy of SBRT assessed between 1,5 and 3 months after treatment, The treatment efficacy is assessed by calculation of local control rate of irradiated locations according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria (complete response + partial response + stable disease) between 1,5 and 3 months after treatment, Between 1,5 and 3 months after inclusion|Progressive Free Survival, Calculated from the date of inclusion to the date defined as the first documented disease progression, or second cancer appearance, or death from any cause (Up to 5 years since the first inclusion), From the date of inclusion to the date of progression|Overall Survival, Calculated from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause (Up to 5 years since the first inclusion), From the date of inclusion to the date of death (Up to 5 years since the first inclusion)|Short time Safety profile of SBRT, Toxicities appeared during SBRT treatment and up to 3 months after SBRT. Toxicities will be assessed by the evaluation of intensity and incidence of the Adverse Events (AE) displayed by patients. The intensity of each AE will be classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, From inclusion to 3 months after inclusion|Long term Safety profile of SBRT, Toxicities appeared after 24 months after inclusion. The outcome measure concerns toxicities appeared after the study following period. Toxicities will be assessed by the evaluation of intensity and incidence of the Adverse Events (AE) displayed by patients. The intensity of each AE will be classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, after 24 months after inclusion|Efficacy of SBRT assessed 12 months after treatment, The treatment efficacy is assessed by calculation of local control rate of irradiated locations according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria (complete response + partial response + stable disease) at 12 months after treatment, 12 months after inclusion|Efficacy of SBRT assessed 24 months after treatment, The treatment efficacy is assessed by calculation of local control rate of irradiated locations according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria (complete response + partial response + stable disease) at 24 months after treatment, 24 months after inclusion|Medium time Safety profile of SBRT, Toxicities appeared between 3 months and 24 months after treatment. Toxicities will be assessed by the evaluation of intensity and incidence of the Adverse Events (AE) displayed by patients. The intensity of each AE will be classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Between 3 months and 24 months after inclusion
SBRT treatment and toxicities related costs for 6 months after SBRT, The SBRT treatment related costs will be evaluated by a "microcosting" method which take into account, in particular, the irradiation duration seance, the time for the mobilized staff, the kind of equipment required, the duration of related AE hospitalizations., 6 months after inclusion|Cost/Efficacy ratio between 2 modalities of SBRT treatment of ependymoma at 6 months after treatment, 2 modalities of SBRT are compared in patients with an ependymoma (3 fractions of 8 Gy versus 5 fractions of 5 Gy). It will be calculated the cost/efficacity ratio for the avoided toxicity 6 months after SBRT.

The costs will be evaluated by the data from french social security system, from homogeneous group of patients and from general classification of professional acts, 6 months after inclusion|Cost/Efficacy ratio between 2 modalities of SBRT treatment of ependymoma at 12 months after treatment, 2 modalities of SBRT are compared in patients with an ependymoma (3 fractions of 8 Gy versus 5 fractions of 5 Gy). It will be calculated :

* the cost/efficacity per gained year of life without relapse after 12 months after SBRT
* the cost/efficacity per gained year of life without disease after 12 months after SBRT.

The costs will be evaluated by the data from french social security system, from homogeneous group of patients and from general classification of professional acts, 12 months after inclusion|Cost/Efficacy ratio between 2 modalities of SBRT treatment of ependymoma at 24 months after treatment, 2 modalities of SBRT are compared in patients with an ependymoma (3 fractions of 8 Gy versus 5 fractions of 5 Gy). It will be calculated :

* the cost/efficacity per gained year of life without relapse after 24 months after SBRT
* the cost/efficacity per gained year of life without disease after 24 months after SBRT.

The costs will be evaluated by the data from french social security system, from homogeneous group of patients and from general classification of professional acts, 24 months after inclusion
SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) is a radiotherapy treatment which involves the delivery of a single high dose radiation treatment or a few fractionated radiation treatments (usually up to 5). A high potent biological dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor improving the cure rates for the tumor, in a manner previously not achievable by standard conventional radiation therapy.

For adult patients, the "Haute Authorité de Santé" (HAS) validates some indications for this treatment which are the followings :

* Few primary or secondary brain tumors, which cannot be surgically removed
* Spinal tumors
* Primary bronchopulmonary tumors T1 T2 N0 M0 and pulmonary metastasis with slow growth and controled primary tumor.

For pediatrics patients, no indication is now validated by HAS. Indications validated for adults are rare in pediatrics but not exceptional, and in such cases efficient alternative treatments does not exist.

In consequence, and regarding the good results obtained in adult patients, it seems very important to validate the efficacy of this treatment on pediatrics population
