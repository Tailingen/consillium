Using Romiplostim to Treat Low Platelet Counts Following Chemotherapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in People With Blood Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, romiplostim, helps low platelet count caused by the standard blood cancer treatment of chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. This study will also look at whether romiplostim can decrease the number of times the participant needs to return to the clinic for platelet transfusions to treat their low platelet count. In addition, the researchers will determine how safe it is to give romiplostim to people with blood cancer who have received treatment with chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.
