A Study Evaluating Furmonertinib Plus Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy Versus Osimertinib in Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Sensitizing Mutation-Positive Non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Brain Metastases
This study is a Phase III, international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of furmonertinib plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (Arm A) versus osimertinib monotherapy (Arm B) in patients with EGFR sensitizing mutation-positive non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. Additionally, a proportion of subjects will receive furmonertinib monotherapy (Arm C) to further explore its efficacy and safety profile.

Stage 1 is the safety run-in phase, planned to enroll approximately 30 subjects who will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either furmonertinib 80 mg QD plus platinum-based chemotherapy or furmonertinib 160 mg QD plus platinum-based chemotherapy, aiming to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different furmonertinib doses in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.

Stage 2 is the randomized controlled phase, in which approximately 350 subjects will be randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio (Arm A : Arm B : Arm C) to receive the investigational treatments.
