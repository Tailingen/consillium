Study of MDX-1203 in Subjects With Advanced/Recurrent Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) or Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL)
The purpose of this study is to determine if MDX-1203 is safe for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma or non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
Renal Cell Carcinoma|Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: MDX-1203
Safety profile of MDX-1203 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), up to 17 cycles
Biomarker: Incidence of CD70+ tumors in target population, Screening
Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, multidose study of MDX-1203, a fully human monoclonal antibody drug conjugate targeting the CD70 transmembrane cell-surface protein which is highly expressed in ccRCC and B-NHL. MDX-1203 is composed of a human anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a prodrug form of a cytotoxic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) minor-groove binding agent (MGBA).

The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (up to 17 cycles or 2 years), and Follow-up (up to 6 months).
