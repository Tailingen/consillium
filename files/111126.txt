Hatha Yoga in Breast Cancer Survivors
This pilot clinical trial studies Hatha yoga in reducing physical and emotional problems in breast cancer survivors with stage II-III lymphedema. Yoga practices may benefit breast cancer survivors with lymphedema as they directly support lymph transport (postures, breathing, relaxation) and emotional well-being (relaxation, meditation).

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the feasibility of a modified yoga program for breast cancer survivors (BCS) with lymphedema.

II. To identify and document required modifications for a safe and feasible practice.

III. To obtain recruitment estimates and determine barriers to recruitment (acceptability).

IV. To evaluate implementation fidelity (adherence and competence) and barriers to implementation fidelity.

V. To establish safety. VI. To assess satisfaction. VII. To determine the preliminary efficacy of a modified yoga program for lymphedema in BCS, and associated physical and psychological symptoms/symptom burden, and overall health status.
