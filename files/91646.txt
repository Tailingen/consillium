A Study of MK-1084 in KRAS Mutant Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-1084-001)
This is a study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of MK-1084 alone, and MK-1084 plus other combination therapies in participants with advanced solid tumors with identified kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog G12C (KRAS G12C) mutation.

Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT is defined as an event with toxicity including the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the probable association with study treatment that are not due to pre-existing conditions as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0). Number of participants who experience a DLT will be reported., Up to ~21 days|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to ~56 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to ~56 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 will be reported., Up to ~56 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The DOR as assessed by the investigator will be reported., Up to ~56 months|Mean Plasma Concentration of MK-1084, Mean Plasma Concentration of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoints during the study in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and every 6 weeks thereafter up to 56 months. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-1084, Cmax of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoints during the study in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and every 6 weeks thereafter up to 56 months. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6).|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of MK-1084, Tmax of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoints during the study in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and every 6 weeks thereafter up to 56 months. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6)|Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of MK-1084, Cmin of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoints during the study in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and every 6 weeks thereafter up to 56 months. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6)|Area Under the Concentration Time-Curve 0-12 Hours (AUC 0-12) of MK-1084, AUC 0-12 of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoint during the study in Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose and up to 12 hours postdose. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6)|Area Under the Concentration Time-Curve 0-24 Hours (AUC 0-24) of MK-1084, AUC 0-24 of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoint during the study in Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose and up to 24 hours postdose. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6)|Half-Life (t1/2) of MK-1084, Half-Life (t1/2) of MK-1084 determined by blood samples collected pre-dose and at designated timepoints post-dose will be reported., At designated timepoint during the study in Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose and up to 24 hours postdose. Cycle=3 weeks (Arms 1-4) and 4 weeks (Arms 5-6)
