Perioperative Tislelizumab Plus Chemotherapy for Resectable Thoracic Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to analyze esophageal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant immunotherapy with chemotherapy followed by esophagectomy to determine whether additional adjuvant therapy is associated with improved survival outcomes.

DRUG: Tislelizumab
2-year disease-free survival in non-pCR patients, The time from the first day of surgery to the first occurrence of local or distant recurrence and metastasis or death from any cause in non-pCR patients, Disease free survival time for recurrence or death within 2 years of surgery
pCR rate, Pathological complete response (pCR) rate of all patients, 4 weeks after surgery|major pathological response, MPR was defined as the presence of viable tumor cells≤10% in the resected tumor specimen, 4 weeks after surgery|2-year DFS in pCR patients, The time from the first day of surgery to the first occurrence of local or distant recurrence and metastasis or death from any cause in pCR patients, Disease free survival time for recurrence or death within 2 years of surgery|R0 resection rate, No vital tumor is presented at the proximal, distal, or circumferential resection margin, then it is considered R0 resection, 4 weeks after surgery|adverse events, Safety will be evaluated for all treated patients using CTCAE V 5.0., Up to 100 months|overall survival, The date of death of any causes since the date of randomization., Up to 5 years
Eligiled patients with pathologically confirmed thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and at clinical T1b-3N1-3M0 or T3N0M0 according to the eighth edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging will be allocated to neoadjuvant immunotherapy (tislelizumab 200mg d1, q3w × 2 cycles ) and chemotherapy (nad-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 d1 + carboplatin AUC = 5 d1, q3w × 2 cycles) treatment. Patients with resected (R0) were assigned to receive tislelizumab ( at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks for 30 weeks) in pCR patients or adjuvant immunotherapy and chemothearpy for two cycles, and then tislelizumab ( at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks for 24 weeks) in non-pCR patients.The primary endpoint for this study is 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) in non-pCR patients.The secondary endpoints include pCR rate, major pathological response (MPR) rate, 2-year DFS in pCR patients, R0 resection rate, adverse events, and overall survival (OS).
