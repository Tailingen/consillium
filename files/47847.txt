A Study of TRC105 in Combination With Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and Bevacizumab in Non-Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
This is a single center, open-label, nonrandomized, phase 1b study of TRC105 in combination with standard dose treatment in patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: TRC105
Number of patients with a change in medical management, Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology for Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE). Incidence, timing, and relatedness of adverse events will be considered as factors in the change of a patient's medical management., Baseline up to 28 days after the last cycle
Measurement of tumor response, Radiological tumor assessments from CT or MRI scans will be used to determine an objective response rate., Baseline to 3 years|Progression-free survival, Time to progressive disease, Baseline to 3 years|Number of patients with progression-free survival at 6 months, The percentage of patients with progression-free survival in the study, 6 months after the last cycle of treatment completed|Overall survival, Length of patient survival after starting study treatment, Baseline to 3 years|Measurement of TRC105 concentrations, Serum TRC105 concentrations will be measured using validated enzyme-linked immunoassay testing that will assist in analyzing the pharmacokinetics of the drug., Collected approximately every 63 days (3 cycles)|Measurement of TRC105 anti-product antibodies, Anti-product antibody concentrations will be measured using validated enzyme-linked immunoassay testing that will assist in analyzing immunogenicity., Collected approximately every 63 days (3 cycles)|Identify angiogenic protein biomarkers, A central reference lab will conduct biomarker testing that will assist in the analysis of the pharmacodynamics effects on circulating angiogenic biomarkers., Collected approximately every 63 days (3 cycles)
Advanced non-small cell lung cancer has been historically difficult to treat, and novel agents are in dire need.TRC105 has been shown to enhance the anti-angiogenic effect of bevacizumab and may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy when combined with bevacizumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin. Participants will be treated with the combination drugs for 6 cycles of therapy (3 weeks per cycle) and may or may not be placed on maintenance therapy depending upon the induction response. Maintenance therapy will continue until there is disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Blood collections and tumor assessments will be performed throughout the study.
