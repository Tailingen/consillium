Therapy Optimisation for the Treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia
The trial will test the effectiveness and toxicity of subcutaneous treatment with one cycle of cladribine in patients with hairy cell leukemia requiring treatment.

They have to be untreated so far or may be pretreated with alpha-interferon.
Hairy Cell Leukemia
DRUG: Cladribine s.c. injection, HCL treatment
Determination of the rate of complete remissions after one cycle with subcutaneous cladribine, 4 months after treatment
Rate of complete remissions in patient who still have detectable residual disease, A second cycle of cladribine after an interval of 4 months following the first cycle., 4 months after treatment
Overall effectiveness, Determination of:

* overall remission rate
* duration of remission
* immunodeficiency induced by treatment, its duration, infectious and other complications resulting from that
* frequency of secondary neoplasia during life long follow up
* overall survival, 20 years|Improvement of remission deepness, Can a complete remission be achieved with a second cycle in patients who have achieved only a partial remission after one cycle?, Date of staging after first cycle + 4 months|Improvement of remission quality, Can the quality of remission achieved with the first cycle be improved with a second cycle?, Date of staging after first cycle + 4 months|Lowering risk of relapse, Can the expected risk of relapse be lowered and the duration of remission be prolonged?, Date of proven remission until the date of firdt documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 20 years
Evaluation of remission status will take place 4 months after treatment. In addition, it will be tested whether patients with non-optimal response will have a benefit from a second cycle of cladribine.

Non-optimal response is: patients with detectable residual disease; achievement of partial remission or detectable residual infiltration in the bone marrow.
