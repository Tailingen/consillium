The Safety And Efficacy Of Sunitinib In Chinese Patients With Progressive Advanced Or Metastatic Well-Differentiated Unresectable Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional (NI) study evaluating the safety and efficacy of sunitinib in Chinese patients with progressive, unresectable, advanced or metastatic well-differentiated, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors(pNET). 100 adults with progressive advanced or metastatic well-differentiated unresectable pNET will be recruited in China hospitals. Each subject will be followed up overall survival (OS) time or the date of withdrawal and subjects who remain alive after study completion will have their OS time censored on the last date known to be alive. Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive at least one dose of sunitinib orally at 37.5 mg once a day on a continuous daily dosing regimen (CDD) or dosage modification is based on daily clinic practice. Subjects will be treated until disease progress, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal from the study at their own request, or until the final analysis for the study is performed. The NI study will capture observations that will be used for evaluating the safety profile of sunitinib, including: subject demographics, medical history and medications. Safety assessments, treatment data and any other laboratory examination results, which were done according to routine clinical practice, will be collected at all visits.
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: sunitinib
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) (All Causalities and Treatment-related), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal product. The event did not necessarily need to have a causal relationship with the product treatment or usage. A TEAE was defined as an event that emerged during treatment, having been absent pretreatment, or worsened relative to the pretreatment state., From baseline up to 8 years|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (All Causalities and Treatment-related), An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect., From baseline up to 8 years|Number of Participants With Hematology/Chemistry/Urinalysis Laboratories of Baseline Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade â‰¤2 at Baseline That Shifted to a Maximum CTCAE Grade 3 or 4, Laboratory abnormalities assessment included: hematologic: hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophile granulocyte count; non-hematologic: total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, glucose, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia., From baseline up to 8 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Investigator assessed PFS according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.6. PFS was defined as the time from the start of sunitinib treatment to first document of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression was defined using RECIST v1.0, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From baseline up to 8 years|Progression-Free Survival by Clinical Judgment, PFS by clinical judgment was defined as the time from the start of sunitinib treatment to first document of objective tumor progression, or first time tumor progression diagnosed by investigator based on clinical judgment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression was defined using RECIST v1.0, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From baseline up to 8 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the start of sunitinib treatment to documentation of death due to any cause., From baseline up to 8 years|Five-Year Survival Rate, Five-year survival rate was defined as the proportion of participants who stayed alive till after 5 years from the start of sunitinib treatment., From baseline up to 8 years
The sunitinib non-interventional (NI) study is a real world observational study which represents the usual and customary treatment of patients and being proposed to collect data systematically and to assess the safety and efficacy in Chinese patients with progressive, unresectable, advanced or metastatic well-differentiated, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.It is designed and conducted to meet CFDA post-marketing commitments. non-probability sample
