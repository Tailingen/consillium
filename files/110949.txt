Investigating the Effectiveness of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in Addition to Standard of Care Treatment for Cancer That Has Spread Beyond the Original Site of Disease
This study is being done to determine if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) when delivered to all sites of disease in participants with 1-5 metastases will increase the length of time before participants' disease gets worse.

Progression Free Survival, To determine whether stereotactic body radiotherapy to all sites of metastatic disease in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer or triple-negative breast cancer improves progression free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death, as compared to standard of care therapy alone., Up to 2 years
Overall Survival, To compare overall survival (OS) between standard of care and SBRT arms., Up to 2 years
