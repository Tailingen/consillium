Thyroid Cancer
Primary endpoints, to measure the accuracy of the Thyroid print test against the surgical pathology report., Samples taken at Baseline
This is a multicenter, non-interventional (observational), prospective, post-market study, matching the Idylla™ ThyroidPrint® RUO Assay result to the gold standard of surgical pathology.

The study population is defined as cases where the thyroid nodule has been reported as indeterminate.

Primary endpoints are the calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, and the negative and positive predictive values of the Idylla™ ThyroidPrint® RUO Assay for indeterminate thyroid nodules.

Secondary endpoint: to assess the failure rate of Idylla™ ThyroidPrint® RUO Assay, including errors and invalids; describe the nature of false negative and false positive cases.
