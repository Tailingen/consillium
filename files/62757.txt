Locked-in Syndrome Caused by Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation: A Case Report
In this case, we report a case of atresia syndrome (LIS), a serious neurological disease caused by pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVM). We present a previously healthy middle-aged woman who developed atresia syndrome after severe pontine infarction due to basilar artery occlusion due to undiagnosed arteriovenous malformation. This report reviewed the medical history, post-admission examination and related literature, and concluded that PAVM should be considered as the cause of implicit stroke, especially in young patients with right-to-left shunt, and should be actively treated.
