Study of LY573636-sodium in Essential Thrombocythemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY573636-sodium to be given to patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to determine any side effects that may be associated with LY573636-sodium in this patient population. Efficacy measures will also be used to assess the activity of LY573636-sodium in acute myeloid leukemia and essential thrombocythemia patients.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Essential Thrombocythemia
DRUG: LY573636-sodium
Recommended Phase 2 Dose of LY573636-Sodium in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), Recommended Phase 2 dose was determined by maximum tolerated dose (MTD). MTD is the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and level immediately below that which had ≥2 instances of DLT. A DLT is an adverse event (AE) observed during the first cycle of treatment that is believed to be related to LY573636 and fulfills any of the following: ET only , Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE, Version 3.0) Grade (Gr) 4 hematologic toxicity for ≥3 days; For all, ≥Gr 3 nonhematological toxicity except for nausea/vomiting or diarrhea unless it fits the next criteria; ≥Gr 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that persists \>7 days despite maximal treatment; Gr 3 electrolyte disturbances that persist despite maximal measures; DLT can be declared if a participant experienced increasing toxicity during treatment. The primary outcome measure was not analyzed because the enrollment was stopped early before MTD was reached., Predose up to 35 days postdose in Cycle 1
Pharmacokinetics Area Under the Curve(AUC) of LY573636 Above the Albumin-Corrected Threshold (AUCalb), LY573636 has been found to be highly bound to albumin. AUCalb is a surrogate measure of exposure to unbound (free) LY573636.

PK sample is withdrawn at any time on days 8,14,15,21,28., Predose,1h,2h,4h, 8d,14d,15d,21d,28d post dose|Number of Participants With Bone Marrow (BM) Response, The International Working Group's revised recommendations were used to assess response in acute myeloid leukemia (AML): complete response (CR) is \<5% blasts in BM and with a cell count ≥200 cells in BM, and with peripheral blood platelets ≥100x10⁹/liter (L) and absolute neutrophils ≥1x10⁹/L; CR with incomplete blood count recovery is defined as CRi; partial response (PR) is ≥5% blasts in BM but with ≥50% reduction in blast count. Number of responders for AML = CR+PR+ CRi. Result of a European Leukemia Net consensus conference was used to assess response in essential thrombocythemia (ET). CR is platelets ≤400x10⁹/L in peripheral blood, no disease-related symptoms, normal spleen size and white blood cells ≤10x10⁹/L in peripheral blood; PR has platelets ≤600x10⁹/L in peripheral blood or decrease \> 50% from baseline but does not meet CR criteria. Number of responders for ET = CR+PR., Baseline to measured progressive disease up to 70 days|Pharmacokinetics: Concentration Maximum (Cmax) of LY573636, PK sample is withdrawn at any time on days 8,14,15,21,28., Predose,1h,2h,4h, 8d,14d,15d,21d,28d post dose
