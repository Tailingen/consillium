Lenalidomide + Azacitidine for Adaptive Immunotherapy -> Auto SCT in Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. An autologous stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by lenalidomide and azacitidine. Giving autologous lymphocytes after the transplant may help destroy any remaining cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This pilot trial is studying how well giving lenalidomide together with azacitidine works when followed by autologous stem cell transplant and autologous lymphocyte infusion in treating patients with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Azacitidine
Feasibility to Mobilize and Infuse Autologous Lymphocytes (ALI) After Immunomodulatory Therapy and After Stem Cell Transplant Engraftment, Time frame is post 2nd and 3rd cycles of rev/aza and after stem cell transplant engraftment., 6 months
Complete Response Rate at 6 Months, 16 of 17 patients proceeded to transplant. 6 month CR rate post transplant was 8/16 (50%)., 6 months|Toxicity as Assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, Time frame includes after stem cell transplant engraftment. Toxicity post ALI infusion: 1 patient grade 1 hypertension 90 min post infusion. Toxicity post Rev maintenance: 1 patient not tolerated, 1 patient dose decreased due to counts., 6 months|Time to Progression Post Transplant, Time to progression post transplant: For patients not in Complete Response (CR), progressive disease requires one or more: \>25% increase in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein(absolute increase of at least 0.5 g/dL); \> 25% increase in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion(absolute increase of at least 200m/24 hours). Increase plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate( absolute increase of at least 10%). Definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum Ca \> 11.5 mg/dL or \> 2.65 mmol/L) not attributable to any other cause. All relapse categories require two consecutive assessments made any time before classification as relapse or progressive disease., 28 months|Progression-free and Overall Survival, Survival and event-free survival curves (any event of fatality, relapse, acute or chronic GVHD) with Kaplan-Meier curves. The incidence curve for relapse - accounting for the competing risk of fatality - is plotted with step-wise curves. The R statistical software (version 2.15) was used for all time-to-event analyses, with the survival package used for survival curves, and the cmprsk package used for all competing risk curves.

Results: The one-year survival rate is 93.3% (SE = 0.4%), and the two-year survival rate is 86.1% (SE = 0.9%)., 1 year to 2 years|Pre- and Post-ALI Immune Response to Cancer Testis Antigens (CTA), Not able to obtain outcome data., 6 months|CTA Expression Before and After Azacitidine Therapy, Six patients tested have demonstrated CTA up-regulation in either unfractionated bone marrow (n = 4) or CD138+ cells (n = 2). CTA (CTAG1B)-specific T cell response has been observed in all three patients tested and persists following SCT., 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the feasibility of mobilizing and infusing autologous lymphocytes (ALI) following immunomodulatory therapy comprising azacitidine and lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma.

Secondary

* Determine the ability to proceed with autologous stem cell transplantation in these patients.
* Determine the complete response rate at 6 months following transplant in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.
* Monitor the toxicity of post-autologous stem cell infusion of autologous lymphocytes.
* Measure the pre- and post-ALI immune response to cancer testis antigens (CTA) (CTA-specific Ig and T-cell repertoire).
* Study the expression of CTA in multiple myeloma before and after azacitidine therapy.

OUTLINE:

* Immunomodulatory therapy: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-5 and oral lenalidomide on days 6-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Lymphapheresis: Patients undergo autologous lymphocyte harvest on day 22 of courses 2 and 3.
* Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT): Patients undergo single or tandem ASCT using standard protocols.
* Autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI): Patients undergo ALI approximately 28-60 days after ASCT.

Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for correlative laboratory studies, including CTA-specific immune monitoring by RT-PCR, ELISPOT assays, and flow cytometry. Tissue samples from bone marrow aspirates are also collected at baseline, during course one, and after course three for CTA expression and methylation studies.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
