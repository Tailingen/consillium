A Study of Two Different Doses of Cabozantinib (XL184) in Progressive, Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral cabozantinib at a 60 mg dose compared with a 140 mg dose in subjects with progressive, metastatic MTC. It will test if the lower dose results in similar progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) with fewer adverse events compared to the PFS, ORR and adverse events found in previous clinical trials of 140 mg.
Medullary Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Cabozantinib (XL184) 140 mg|DRUG: Cabozantinib (XL184) 60 mg|DRUG: Placebo tablet|DRUG: Placebo capsule
Progression Free Survival, PFS is measured from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Assessed for up to 31 months., Up to 31 months
Objective Response Rate, ORR is the proportion of subjects with measurable disease at baseline and who experience a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) which is confirmed â‰¥ 28 days later. Assessed for up to 31 months., Up to 31 months
Safety and tolerability of cabozantinib as assessed by adverse events., Adverse events are measured from informed consent and at least through 30 days after the date of a decision to discontinue study treatment. Assessed for up to 31 months., Up to 31 months
