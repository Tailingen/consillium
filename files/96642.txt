Liposomal Irinotecan and Leucovorin/5-fluorouracil Plus Bevacizumab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a multi-center, single-arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of liposomal irinotecan+5-FU/LV+ bevacizumab as second-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in Chinese population.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a poor prognosis and poses a serious threat to human health. FOLFIRI (irinotecan+5-FU/LV) / FOLFOX (oxaliplatin+5-FU/LV) Â± angiogenesis inhibitors are common treatments for advanced CRC. For patients receiving oxaliplatin-based therapy, irinotecan-based therapy is recommended as second-line therapy. Liposomal irinotecan is a new pharmaceutical form of traditional irinotecan. It adopts a special loading technology to encapsulate traditional irinotecan in liposomes, which can avoid its hydrolysis under physiological conditions, increase the affinity with cancer cells, overcome drug resistance, increase the drug uptake by cancer cells, reduce the drug dose, improve the efficacy and reduce the toxic side effects. The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of liposomal irinotecan+5-FU/LV + bevacizumab as second-line treatment for metastatic CRC.
