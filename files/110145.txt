Skin Cancer Screening Education Study
The overall aim of this population-based screening study is to assess whether the skin cancer screening training of family physicians and dermatologists leads to improved screening outcomes. The training course aims to increase the accuracy of detecting early stages of skin cancer. Screening outcomes of an intervention region (Calgary, Canada) in which physicians receive training will be compared with screening outcomes of a control region (Edmonton, Canada) where no physician training is administered.

The investigators will determine whether:

* clinical screening outcomes are more favorable in the group of trained physicians compared to non trained physicians
* there is an increase of knowledge about skin cancer screening among trained physicians, compared to non trained physicians
* skin cancer screenings are associated with psycho-social harms
* population-based screening has an effect on the overall incidence and stage-specific-incidence of skin cancer in Alberta

The investigators are aiming to recruit 100 physicians per region (total of 200 physicians) who will screen 40,000 to 80,000 individuals over a period of 20 months.

Change in the diagnostic accuracy including knowledge on skin cancer screening, Educational outcomes of physicians will be measured pre- and post-training using knowledge tests in the intervention and control region, month 1 pre-training (intervention and control region), month 1 post-training (intervention region only), and month 12 (both regions)|Number needed to screen (NNS) to identify 1 skin tumor and number needed to excise (NNE) to identify 1 skin tumor, Case report forms will be analyzed to determine clinical screening outcomes such as the NNS, NNE and tumor thickness., 20 months|Patient-rated well-being, A patient questionnaire will be used to assess psycho-social harms of skin cancer screenings., 20 months|Trends of overall skin cancer incidence and stage-specific-incidence, Up to 6 years (2012-2018)
