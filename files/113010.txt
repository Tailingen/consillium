HX008 Plus Irinotecan Versus Placebo Plus Irinotecan as Second-line Treatment in Advanced Gastric Cancer
This is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HX008 injection combined with irinotecan versus placebo combined with irinotecan as second-line therapy in patients with adcanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and/or fluropyrimidine therapy.

Overall Survival (OS) in All Participants, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.

OS is reported here for all participants in the experimental arm and placebo comparator arm., Up to approximately 36 months|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With PD-L1 CPS≥1, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. OS is reported here for all participants in the experimental arm and placebo comparator arm with PD-L1 CPS≥1., Up to approximately 36 months
