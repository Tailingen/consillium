The Aim of This Study is to Demonstrat That Vacuum-assisted Closure Versus Conventional Wound Closure Enables to Diminish Local Complications After Lymph Node Dissection in Patients With Metastatic Skin Tumors
In this study, we compared a negative pressure wound therapy, versus a conventional dressing in order to evaluate the most efficient wound therapy closure after axillary and inguinal lymph nodes dissections in the management of metastatic skin tumors. A vacuum assisted closure therapy should prevent these comorbidities.

Is there a visible scar disunion ?, Yes if there is a scar opening, no if there isn't, between day 1 and day 7, between day 7 and day 30, between day 30 and first year end|Is there lymphorrhoea from the scar ?, Yes if there is lymph coming from the the scar, no if there isn't., between day 1 and day 7, between day 7 and day 30, between day 30 and first year end
Are there lymphocele punctures ?, Yes if there is any lymphocele puncture, no if there isn't, between day 1 and day 7, between day 7 and day 30, between day 30 and first year end|Is there any lymphoedema ?, Yes if there is arm or leg lymphoedema, no if there isn't, between day 1 and day 7, between day 7 and day 30, between day 30 and first year end
Lymphorrhoea, lymphedema and lymphocyte are significant and common complications after axillary and inguinal lymph nodes dissections. A vacuum assisted closure therapy should prevent these comorbidities. In this study, we compared PREVENA, a negative pressure wound therapy, versus conventional dressings. We evaluated the wound complications at the seventh day, the thirtieth day and at this end of the first year after surgery. It is a retrospective study of about ninety lymph nodes dissections among with there were seventy times the use of a negative pressure wound therapy, PREVENA.
