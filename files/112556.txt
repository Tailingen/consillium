A Phase 1 Dose-escalation Study of OSI-906 and Erlotinib (TarcevaÂ®)
Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of OSI-906 in combination with erlotinib
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: OSI-906|DRUG: erlotinib
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose of OSI-906 and erlotinib, 21 days
Safety profile, Pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic activity, Preliminary antitumor activity, 3 years
The study will open with Schedule 1 (S1), in which OSI-906 is administered on Days 1-3 every 7 days. Erlotinib will be administered daily starting on Day 2. A treatment period is defined as 21 days.

Initiation of Schedule 2 (S2), in which OSI-906 is administered daily starting on Day 1 and erlotinib is administered daily starting on Day 2, will occur after observation of clinically significant related toxicity \>/= grade 2 in any patient on S1 or after \> 2 dose levels in S1 have been examined without evidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT).

Initiation of Schedule 3 (S3), in which OSI-906 is administered twice daily starting on Day 1 and erlotinib is administered daily starting on Day 2, will occur after observation of clinically significant related toxicity \>/= grade 2 in any patient on S2 or after \> 2 dose levels in S2 have been examined without evidence of DLT.

Once the phase 2 dose has been established for S3, 1 expansion cohort will be opened.

The Expansion Cohort will enroll approximately 30 evaluable patients with stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). Patients in the NSCLC Expansion Cohort will be required to have either archival tissue or fresh tumor tissue available at the start of study.
