Phase III Study of Socazolimab as First-Line Treatment in Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Socazolimab combined with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab as first-Line treatment in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. The main question it aims to answer is:

Does Socazolimab combined with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab better benefit patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer as first-line treatment compared with placebo combined with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab.

Participants will be treated with Socazolimab/placebo + chemotherapy ± bevacizumab) for 6\~8 cycles (Q3w), following maintenance treatment of Socazolimab/placebo (Q3w).
