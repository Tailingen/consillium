Substudy 02A: Safety and Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Investigational Agents in Participants With Programmed Cell-death 1 (PD-1) Refractory Melanoma (MK-3475-02A/KEYMAKER-U02)
Substudy 02A is part of a larger research study that is testing experimental treatments for melanoma, a type of skin cancer. The larger study is the umbrella study.

The goal of substudy 02A is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational treatment arms in participants with PD-1 refractory melanoma to identify the investigational agent(s) that, when used in combination, are superior to the current treatment options/historical control available.

As of Amendment 4 (effective date: 05JAN2022), a third arm has been opened to participant enrollment, treatment with pembrolizumab and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Enrollment into the first two arms, treatment with pembrolizumab + quavonlimab+ vibostolimab and treatment with pembrolizumab + quavonlimab + lenvatinib has been completed per protocol as of September 2021.

Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to ~28 months|Percentage of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to ~24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ., Up to ~30 months
Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1, For participants in the analysis population who show a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ., Up to ~30 months
