Ripretinib in Combination With Binimetinib in Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
Multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2 study of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). There will be 2 distinct parts in this study: Dose Escalation (Phase 1) and Expansion (Phase 2).
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Ripretinib|DRUG: binimetinib
Safety/tolerability of oral ripretinib in combination with binimetinib: incidence of adverse events, Adverse events \[TEAEs, SAEs, AESIs\], dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinuation, vital signs (heart rate \[beats/min\], and changes in laboratory parameters (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, coagulation)., Approximately 12 months|Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose, Approximately 12 months|Expansion Phase Only: Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib by modified RECIST, Measure ORR, Approximately 36 months
Determine the time to maximum observed concentration (tmax) profile of oral ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure Tmax, Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 Day15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 8 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days|Determine the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) profile of oral ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure Cmax, Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 Day15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 8 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days|Determine the minimum observed concentration (Cmin) profile of oral ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure Cmin, Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 Day15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 8 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days|Determine the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) profile of oral ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure AUC, Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 Day15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 8 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days|Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib by modified RECIST (escalation phase only) and Choi criteria (escalation and expansion phases), Measure ORR, Approximately 36 months|Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure PFS, Approximately 36 months|Evaluate the overall survival (OS) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure OS, Approximately 36 months|Evaluate the duration of response (DOR) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure DOR, Approximately 36 months|Evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure CBR, Approximately 36 months|Evaluate the time to response (TTR) of ripretinib in combination with binimetinib, Measure TTR, Approximately 36 months
