Clinical Stories and Psychological Experiences of Cancer Patients
The purpose of the study is to collect and analyze information from the multidimensional assessment of cancer patients (medical, psychological, psychometric, biological, etc.) treated at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS. The collection of information will allow to investigate the possible presence of correlations between psychological aspects and clinical medical conditions of the person during the course/treatment of cancer.

In the course of the study, the possible presence of previous stressful and/or traumatic events, and the presence of psychological, post-traumatic and/or dissociative symptoms during treatment will be explored. Any correlations between medical conditions and psychological, emotional and behavioral characteristics will also be explored. Finally, it will be possible to investigate the effectiveness of psychological interventions that are carried out according to clinical practice.
