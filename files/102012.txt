INCMGA00012 Plus Chemotherapy in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (POD1UM-105)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of INCMGA00012 in combination with common standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens in participants with advanced solid tumors.
