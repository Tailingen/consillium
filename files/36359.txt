Phase II Trial of 64Cu-ATSM PET/CT in Cervical Cancer
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as 64Cu-labeled diacetyl-bis\[N4-methylthiosemicarbazone\] (copper Cu 64-ATSM) PET/CT scans, may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well copper Cu 64-ATSM PET/CT scans work in predicting disease progression in patients undergoing standard of care treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy (external beam and brachytherapy) per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for newly-diagnosed stage IB, stage II, stage III, or stage IVA cervical cancer via the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging systems.

2. Tumor-to-Muscle uptake ratio (T/M, An FDG-PET/CT-guided circular region of interest of 1.0-1.5 cm in diameter is drawn around the most intense region of the primary tumor to calculate the maximum uptake within the region. In addition, regions of interest are drawn on bilateral gluteal muscle groups on at least 3 slices, and the mean uptake is calculated. The T/M is the ratio of these measurements.), every 3 months for first 2 years and every 6 months during year 3, up to 3 years

* To estimate the accuracy of copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake as a predictor of progression-free survival, overall survival, primary tumor recurrence, and future development of distant metastatic disease in these patients.
* To evaluate the performance of copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake as a predictor of lymph node metastasis at study entry.
* To evaluate whether copper Cu 64-ATSM uptake correlates with tumor volume at study entry.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive copper Cu 64-ATSM IV and undergo PET/CT scan over 30 minutes 30-40 minutes later. Within 4 weeks after copper Cu 64-ATSM-PET/CT scan, patients begin planned concurrent standard of care chemoradiotherapy comprising 6 weeks of radiotherapy (external beam and brachytherapy)and weekly cisplatin administration per NCCN guidelines. Patients then undergo FDG-PET/CT scan 3 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

Tissue samples from previously collected cervical biopsy (obtained for diagnosis) are used for detecting hypoxic markers by immunohistochemistry analysis.

After completion of study intervention, patients are followed for every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
