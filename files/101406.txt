Analysis of Letrozole in Patients With Operable Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
This phase II trial examines letrozole in patients with newly diagnosed hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative invasive breast cancer that can be removed by surgery (operable). Letrozole is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of estrogen produced by the body. This can slow or stop the growth of some types of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow.

Differences in tumor microenvironment subpopulations in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-sensitive version (vs.) AI-resistant hormone receptor (HR)+ breast cancer, Tissue samples from patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer will be collected to compare differences., Up to 8 weeks
Effects of estrogen deprivation on the immune microenvironment, Estrogen receptor will be evaluated by both biopsy and surgical specimens., Up to 8 weeks|Effects of estrogen deprivation on tumor immune microenvironment, Estrogen receptor will be evaluated by both biopsy and surgical specimens., Up to 8 weeks
The purpose of this study is to study to collect tissue samples from patients with early stage hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer.
