Examining the Effectiveness of Multidisciplinary Care Teams in Improving Outcomes for Breast Cancer Patients
To compare clinical outcomes, patient-reported measures (PROMs), and healthcare utilization between standard care with or without an MDCT in a cohort of women treated for breast cancer.

Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Time from the start of treatment to the first occurrence of disease relapse, progression, or death from any cause., 24 months (measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months)|Overall survival, Time from the start of treatment until death from any cause., 24 months (measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months)
Recurrence rate, Number of participants with local or distant breast cancer recurrence., 24 months (measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months)|Complication rate, Incidence of treatment-related complications (e.g., surgical site infections, chemotherapy side effects)., 24 months (measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months)
This single-center, prospective interventional trial evaluates the effectiveness of Multidisciplinary Care Teams (MDCTs) in improving outcomes for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar. The study enrolled 73 participants from May 2021 to April 2024, with follow-up sessions every six months for up to two years.

Participants were randomly assigned to two groups:

Group A (n=37): Received care through MDCTs, which included radiologists, oncologists, and surgeons collaborating to create personalized treatment plans and monitor patient progress.

Group B (n=36): Received standard therapy according to existing institutional protocols.

The study assesses multiple outcomes, including \*\*disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), recurrence rates, complication rates, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), quality of life (measured via SF-36), and healthcare utilization.

Statistical analyses include Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests, Cox proportional hazards regression models, repeated-measures ANOVA, and linear regression models to identify predictors of survival and quality of life.

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed consent prior to enrollment.
