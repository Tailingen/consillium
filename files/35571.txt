Nab-P+Cb+PD1 Inhibitors Combined/not Combined with Bevacizumab As Neoadjuvant Therapy for Early TNBC
We plan to explore the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel+carboplatin+Camrelizumab combined/not combined with bevacizumab in neoadjuvant therapy for early TNBC patients, optimize the administration method and drug combination therapy.

Pathological Complete Response rate(pCR), Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate: It refers to the absence of any invasive cancer in the resected specimens (breast + axilla) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery (i.e., ypT0/is, ypN0)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1 assessment, defined as the number of target lesion responders evaluated by MRI/ultrasound;, up to 24 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: disease progression, local or remote recurrence, second primary malignant tumor (breast cancer or other cancers) or death caused by any reason during neoadjuvant treatment;, 5 years after surgery|Disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from surgery to any of the following events: local or distant recurrence, or death for any reason;, 5 years after surgery|Disease free survival (DDFS), The time from surgery to distant recurrence or death for any reason;, 5 years after surgery|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Evaluate the nature, incidence, and severity of adverse events according to CTCAE 5.0., After each cycle of chemotherapy (21 days as 1 cycle)]
Association of the tumor microenvironment with treatment response, Multiple immunofluorescence: CD3+CD4+PD1+KI67; CD3+CD8+PD1+KI67; GZMB; TCF-1; CD31; NG-2 in tumor tissue., up to 24 weeks|Association of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines with treatment response, Flow cytometric assessment of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets: CD3+CD4+PD1+KI67; CD3+CD8+PD1+KI67 and Detection of peripheral blood cytokines: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and endostatin (ES), up to 24 weeks
This study is a single center, non blinded, randomized phase II clinical trial. A total of 64 TNBC patients are planned to be enrolled. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly divided into four groups (Group A, Group B,Group C, Group D) at a ratio of 1:1:1:1, and stratified according to T stage and N stage. The administration regimen is as follows: Group A： albumin-bound paclitaxe (260 mg/m²,d 1)+Carboplatin (AUC=5, d 1)+Camrelizumab (200 mg, d 1), 21 days as one cycle, 6 cycles; Group B: albumin-bound paclitaxe (125 mg/m²,d 1,8,15)+Carboplatin (AUC=5, d 1 )+Camrelizumab (200 mg, d 1), 21 days as one cycle, 6 cycles; Group C： albumin-bound paclitaxe (260 mg/m²,d 1, 6 cycles)+Carboplatin (AUC=5,d 1, 6 cycles)+Camrelizumab (200 mg, , d 1, 6 cycles)+Bevacizumab (15mg/kg, d 1,5 cycles), 21 days as one cycle; Group D: albumin-bound paclitaxe (125 mg/m²,d 1,8,15,6 cycles)+Carboplatin (AUC=5, d 1, 6 cycles)+Camrelizumab (200 mg, d 1, 6 cycles)+Bevacizumab (15mg/kg, d 1,5 cycles), 21 days as one cycle;

Primary endpoint: Pathological complete response rate (pCR rate).

Secondary study endpoints: Objective response rate (ORR), event free survival rate (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), and safety.

Exploratory endpoints: Differences in efficacy and immune microenvironment under different administration methods, synergistic effect of bevacizumab and immunotherapy.
