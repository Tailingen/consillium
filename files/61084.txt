The Role of Serum Adipokines in Predicting Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Rectal Cancer
It has been shown that adipokines (resistin, leptin, adiponectin) secreted from adipose tissue and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-a are associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer. However, the role of these factors in predicting clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancers is unknown. In this study, the role of serum adipokine levels before neoadjuvant therapy in predicting clinical response in patients with rectal cancer is investigated. For this purpose, blood will be drawn from patients with rectal cancer who will receive neoadjuvant therapy, serum adipokines will be studied and clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy will be compared.
