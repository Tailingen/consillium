Real World Evaluation of the Effectiveness of AZD7442 for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2
If a treated cancer patient cannot make antibodies to a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approved vaccine, their risk for infection and its sequelae are significantly increased. The Astra-Zeneca Immuno-Suppressed Program (AISP) is designed to address whether a patient treated for cancer who receives a single-dose of Evusheld (AZD7442) 600 mg IM or IV will maintain a stable/protective effect against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection including SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalization and/or SARS-CoV-2 related death up to 12 months post-baseline. The program will focus on patients with cancer who have been treated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, other therapy or combination therapy with or without radiation therapy within 12 months prior to enrollment, are willing/able to receive one IM or IV injection of Evusheld, are able to complete 14 Patient Experience/Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) surveys, 6 Quality of Life (QoL) assessments and are willing to allow serum concentrations of Evusheld to be drawn 9 times, 3 SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain-Immunoglobulin G (RBD-IgG) tests, and T-cell assay to be drawn once. In the event of a symptomatic break-thru SARS-CoV-2 positive infection by SARS-COV-2 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, the patient will have an additional Evusheld serum concentration, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-IgG antibody level and T-cell assay obtained in a temporally related manner. The program requires treatment with Evusheld 600 mg IM or IV.

* Incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection including but not limited to SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalization and/or SARS-CoV-2 related death compared between patients treated with chemotherapy only, immunotherapy only, targeted therapy only or other/combination therapy only over 12 months post-baseline., 12 months
The primary objective is to quantify the serum concentration of Evusheld (AZD7442) at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 12-months post-baseline in all qualified cancer patients treated with a single-dose of Evusheld 600 mg IM or IV at baseline.

The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

* Compare the incidence of symptomatic Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection including SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalization and/or SARS-CoV-2 related death between solid tumor and hematologic malignancy patients.
* Compare of the incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection including SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalization and/or SARS-CoV-2 related death between patients treated with chemotherapy only, immunotherapy only, targeted therapy only or other/combination therapy only over 12 months post-baseline.
* Compare the serum concentration of Evusheld at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12-months post-baseline between solid tumor and hematologic malignancy patients.
* Compare the serum concentration of Evusheld at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12-months post-baseline between patients treated with chemotherapy only, immunotherapy only, targeted therapy only or other/combination therapy only.
* Compare of the incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection including SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalization and/or SARS-CoV-2 related death to the levels of serum concentration of Evusheld at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12-months post-baseline in all patients.
* Compare the incidence of severe SARS-CoV-2 (pneumonia or hypoxemia and World Health Organization (WHO) score of ≥5) based on the TACKLE study definition between solid tumor and hematologic malignancy patients.
* Compare the incidence of severe SARS-CoV-2 (pneumonia or hypoxemia, and WHO score of ≥5) based on the TACKLE study definition death between patients treated with chemotherapy only, immunotherapy only, targeted therapy only or other/combination therapy only over 12 months post-baseline.
* Compare the incidence of severe SARS-CoV-2 (pneumonia or hypoxemia, and WHO score of ≥5) based on the TACKLE study definition to the levels of serum concentration of Evusheld at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12-months post-baseline in all patients.
* Compare time to first event e.g., SARS-COV-2 RNA by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positivity, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and/or death between all four strata
* Compare Quality-of-Life metrics in all cancer patients, as measured by change from baseline to days 2, 90, 180, 270, and 360 post-baseline, and then compare the same Quality-of-Life metrics at each timepoint between each of the four strata
* Assess patient safety and adverse events including medically attended visits, Emergency Room/Urgent Care/Telehealth visits using Patient Experience/Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) survey data for patients in each of the four strata
* Evaluate whether solid tumor or hematologic malignancy patients have a greater incidence of Evusheld-related side effects
* Assess the use of Machine Learning to predict the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at days 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 270 and 360 post-baseline in all cancer patients based on serum Evusheld concentration levels 3.3.3 Exploratory Objectives:
* Virologic surveillance to detect all SARS-CoV-2 variants occurring during the study in patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by SARS-COV-2 RNA by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing
* Detection of potential new variants identified by positive SARS-COV-2 RNA by RT-PCR testing
