Radiomics-Based AI Model for Predicting Para-Aortic Lymph Node Metastasis in Gastric Cancer Patients
This study aims to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on radiomics features extracted from preoperative CT images to predict para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis in patients with gastric cancer. Accurately identifying PALN metastasis before surgery can help doctors make better treatment decisions, such as whether to proceed with surgery, consider chemotherapy, or use other treatment strategies. The study will prospectively enroll patients who are diagnosed with gastric cancer and scheduled for surgery. All participants will undergo routine imaging tests, and their data will be analyzed using advanced AI techniques. The results of this study may improve the precision of preoperative staging and support personalized treatment planning for gastric cancer patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Radiomics-Based AI Imaging Analysis
Diagnostic Accuracy of the AI Radiomics Model for Predicting Para-Aortic Lymph Node Metastasis in Gastric Cancer, The primary outcome is the diagnostic performance of the radiomics-based AI model in predicting para-aortic lymph node metastasis (PALNM) in patients with gastric cancer. Performance will be evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values. The ground truth for PALNM status will be based on postoperative pathological findings or multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis. The model's predictions will be compared with actual clinical outcomes to assess its reliability and clinical utility., From Preoperative Imaging to Postoperative Pathological Confirmation (Approximately 4-6 Weeks per Patient)
