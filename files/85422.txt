To Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Tafasitamab Alone or in Combination With Other Drugs in Japanese Participants With Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL)
This is an open-label, multicenter study to evaluate safety and tolerability, determine the RP2Ds of tafasitamab alone in Japanese participants with R/R NHL, or to evaluate efficacy and safety of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in Japanese participants with R/R DLBCL, or tafasitimab in combination with lenalidomide plus R-CHOP in Japanese participants with previously untreated DLBC, or tafasitimab in combination with lenalidomide in Japanese participants with previously R/R DLBC.
