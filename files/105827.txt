MSX-122 Administered Orally in Patients With Refractory Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors
Primary Objectives:

1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose(s) and schedule of MSX-122
2. To characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determine the overall safety and tolerability of MSX-122

Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered MSX-122
2. To evaluate the preliminary evidence for anti-tumor activity of MSX-122
3. To perform correlative studies to elucidate signaling pathways involved in CXCR4 activation in blood and optional tissue specimens by IHC (immunohistochemistry) and RPPA (reverse phase protein microarrays)
