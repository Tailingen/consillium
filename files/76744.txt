Efficacy of FOLFOX Alone, FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab and FOLFOX Plus Panitumumab in Patients With Resectable Liver Metastases
Patients presenting with multiple innumerable liver metastases will probably never come to resection, however, for all others, including patients with numerous multiple metastases or large metastases,resection should be considered after limited chemotherapy.

There is consensus for a backbone chemotherapy consisting of fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin. FOLFOX was used in the previous EORTC study and is again recommended.

The addition of targeted agents to standard chemotherapy in the perioperative strategy for mCRC might increase the ORR and R0 resectability, without significant increase in toxicity, therefore translating to a better outcome.

It was therefore decided to design an open label, randomized, multi-center, 3-arm late phase II study.

Arm A: (standard) mFOLFOX6 + Surgery Arm B: (experimental) mFOLFOX6 + Bevacizumab + Surgery Arm C: (experimental) mFOLFOX6 + Panitumumab + Surgery

DRUG: FOLFOX6|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Panitumumab|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Progression free survival, Increase in progression free survival rate at 1 year in each experimental arm (mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab or panitumumab) compared to mFOLFOX6 alone arm., 1 year
Pathological response rate, Increase in major pathological response rate between mFOLFOX6 alone arm and each experimental arm., 4 years|Resection rate, Compare the percentage of patients with total resection with these three treatments., 4 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death. Patients who are still alive when last traced will be censored at the date of last follow-up., 8 years|Safety, All adverse events will be recorded; the investigator will assess whether those events are drug related (reasonable possibility, no reasonable possibility) and this assessment will be recorded in the database for all adverse events., 4 years
