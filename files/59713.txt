A Study of HS-20122 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase I, multi-center, open-label, study of HS-20122, in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of HS-20122 in advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HS-20122（Phase 1a：Dose Escalation）|DRUG: HS-20122（Phase 1b：Dose Expansion ）
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the maximum applicable dose (MAD), To determine the MTD or MAD for further evaluation of intravenous administration of HS-20122 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, From time of first dose of HS-20122 to end of DLT period (approximately 21 days)
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), Assessed by number and severity of adverse events as recorded on the case report form, vital signs, laboratory variables, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and NCI CTCAE v5.0., From time of Informed Consent to 28 days post last dose of HS-20122|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) as defined in the protocol, Number of patients with at least 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), which is any toxicity defined as a DLT in the Clinical Study Protocol, From time of first dose of HS-20122 to end of DLT period (approximately 21 days)|Observed maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of HS-20122 (including antibody-drug conjugates, total antibody, and payload), The Cmax is the maximum observed drug concentration of HS-20122, From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose|Time to reach maximum observed drug concentration (Tmax) of HS-20122 (including antibody-drug conjugates, total antibody, and payload), The Tmax is defined as time to reach maximum observed drug concentration of HS-20122., From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose.|Area under the curve from time Zero to end of dosing interval (AUC0-t) of HS-20122 (including antibody-drug conjugates, total antibody, and payload), The AUC0-t is defined as the area under the drug concentration-time curve during a dose interval time period(t), From the date of first dose to Cycle 4(each cycle is 28 days) pre-dose.|Area under the curve from time Zero to end of dosing interval (AUC0-∞) of HS-20122 (including antibody-drug conjugates, total antibody, and payload), The AUC0-∞ is defined as the area under the drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, From the date of first dose to Cycle 4(each cycle is 28 days) pre-dose|Incidence of anti-HS-20122 antibody (ADA), ADA incidence was defined as the percentage of participants whose ADA status were identified as positive., From the date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose.|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), assessed by investigators based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, up to 24 months
This is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase I, multi-center, open-label, study of HS-20122, in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of HS-20122 in advanced solid tumors.
