FAPI-PET for Tumor Detection
This is a prospective observational trial investigating correlation with histopathology, positive predictive value, detection rate, reproducibility and impact on clinical management of 68-Ga-FAPI PET/CT or PET/MRI in patients receiving this imaging modality for tumor staging or restaging as part of clinical care.

68-Ga-fibroblast-activation-protein-inhibitors (68-Ga-FAPI) are novel Positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that were recently introduced for the imaging of patients with various cancer diseases. The fibroblast-activation-protein (FAP) is highly expressed in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the stroma of various tumor entities. The aim of this registry study is to collect data on FAPI expression, positive predictive value, detection rate, reproducibility and impact on clinical management of 68-Ga-FAPI PET/CT or PET/MRI on patients receiving this imaging modality at initial diagnosis or restaging as part of clinical care.
