Short-term Outcomes of Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision With Structured Training Curriculums in China
Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is an alternative for mid-low rectal cancer. In China, this procedure has been performed in high-volume centers with structured training curriculums. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes during the initial implementation of the TaTME procedure in high-volume centers who followed structured training curriculums in China.
