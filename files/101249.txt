Novel Cavity Marking Technique in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Breast Conservation Surgery With Oncoplastic Reconstruction for the Delivery of Adjuvant Radiotherapy and Accuracy of Recommended Re-excisions
This study will investigate a novel approach to marking surgical cavity margins following tumor resection, to allow for more accurate radiotherapy following oncoplastic surgery. Our proposed cavity marking schema will allow radiation oncology to identify the cavity margins more accurately on CT simulation for radiation planning and delivery. This cavity marking schema also provides more accurate margin identification in patients recommended for re-excision of close or positive margins.
Ductal Carcinoma in Situ|Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Novel cavity marking technique
Confidence rating in cavity identification, Determine the percentage of patients that receive each of three possible confidence ratings ("Confident", "Informative", and "Ambiguous") from radiation oncologists for their confidence in being able to identify the surgical cavity on imaging., Within 8 weeks of surgery if patient does not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or within 8 weeks following adjuvant chemotherapy (~4-6 months after surgery
Percent of patients needing re-excision, Determine the percentage of patients needing re-excision, 7-14 days post-surgery|Local disease recurrence rate, Determine the percentage of patients that have local disease recurrence at 2 years post-surgery, 2 years post-surgery|Median overall survival rate, Determine the median overall survival rate at 2 years post-surgery., 2 years post-surgery|Median recurrence-free survival rate, Determine the median recurrence-free survival rate at 2 years post-surgery., 2 years post-surgery
