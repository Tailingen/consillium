PCOS Treatment Using DLBS3233, Metformin, and Combination of Both
This is a 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, and controlled clinical study over 6 months of treatment to evaluate the metabolic and clinical efficacy as well as the safety of DLBS3233 alone, metformin and combination of both, in improving metabolic and reproductive parameters.

Measurement of progesterone level will be performed 7 days after the finding of dominant follicle on USG examination to confirm the presence of ovulation., menstrual cycle of Month 3rd up to that of Month 6th|Change of endometrium thickness, Change of endometrium thickness will be measured by using trans-vaginal USG at basal condition and at the day/period of ovulation, 3 to 6 months|Improvement of S/A ratio, Improvement from baseline of the S/A ratio (defined as the ratio between stromal and total area of median ovarian section) will be measured using trans-vaginal USG (trans-longitudinal measurement) at Baseline, menstrual cycle of Month 3rd, and menstrual cycle of Month 6th at basal condition., 3 to 6 months|Improvement in Ferriman-Gallwey Score, Improvement in Ferriman-Gallwey Score from baseline to Month 3rd and Month 6th (the end of study), 3 and 6 months|Reduction of free testosterone level, Reduction of free testosterone level from baseline to Month 6th (end of study), 6 months|Change of luteinizing hormone (LH) level, Change of luteinizing hormone (LH) level from baseline to Month 6th (end of study), 6 months|Change of luteinizing hormone (LH) / follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, Change of luteinizing hormone (LH) / follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio from baseline to Month 6th (end of study), 6 months|Liver function, Liver function (levels of serum AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) will be measured at baseline and Month 6th (end of study), 6 months|Renal function, Renal function (levels of serum creatinine, BUN) will be measured at baseline and Month 6th (end of study), 6 months|Number of adverse events and subjects with events, Adverse events as well as number of events and subjects experiencing the events will be observed and evaluated throughout study period (6 months) and until all adverse events have been recovered or stabilized, During 6 months
There will be 3 groups of treatment (N = 186), each consist of 62 subjects, as the following:

* Treatment I : DLBS3233 100 mg once daily
* Treatment II : Metformin XR 750 mg twice daily
* Treatment III : DLBS3233 100 mg once daily and Metformin XR 750 mg twice daily.

Laboratory examination to evaluate metabolic efficacy parameters will be performed at baseline, Month 3rd, and end of study (Month 6th).

Clinical and laboratory examination to evaluate the reproductive efficacy parameters using trans-vaginal USG and biomarkers (such as reproductive hormones) will be performed at baseline to the end of study.

Safety examination will be performed at baseline and end of study. Occurrence of adverse event will be observed along the study conduct.
