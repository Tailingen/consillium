Circulating Tumor DNA Monitoring in Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
This observational study is conducted to assess the utility of circulating tumor DNA in monitoring the response to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer，and evaluate the consistency of circulating tumor DNA with imaging and CA125 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
the consistency of circulating tumor DNA with CT scan, measuring the mutations of TP53，reporting the changes from baseline to 3 weeks after the first cycle, contrasting with CT scan changes，calculating Kappa value，and conducting a intrarater reliability, at the beginning of Cycle 1 and 3 weeks after Cycle 1. If necessary, also including 3 weeks after Cycle 2（each cycle is 28 days）
The goal of this study is to assess the utility of circulating tumor DNA in monitoring the response to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.This is a single-arm, single-center prospective clinical study.

After enrollment, patients will receive standard treatment (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)and follow-up strategy. Peripheral blood samples will be collected from all patients before treatment and 3 weeks after the first cycle of treatment，If necessary, Peripheral blood samples also be collected after 2 cycles of treatment.Peripheral blood ctDNA will be tested for genetic variation based on next-generation sequencing (NGS).

Finally, this study will to evaluate the consistency of circulating tumor DNA with imaging and CA125 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
