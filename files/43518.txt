Head and Neck Maskless Immobilization Device in Immobilizing Patients With Head and Neck Cancer or Intracranial Tumors Undergoing Radiation Therapy
This pilot clinical trial studies how well head and neck maskless immobilization device works in immobilizing patients with head and neck cancers or intracranial tumors undergoing radiation therapy. Maskless immobilization device may help to prevent movement of head during radiation therapy and immobilize patients with the same accuracy and reliability as the standard thermoplastic mask routinely used for patients receiving radiation therapy.

PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DEVICE: Medical Device|DEVICE: Medical Device|PROCEDURE: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
Accuracy measured by quantifying the difference in translational shifts from the daily setup to planning CT scan digitally reconstructed radiograph, The magnitude of the single vector that depicts the degree of setup discrepancy from CT simulation will be collected for each patient on each day the MID is applied (for both the thermoplastic mask and the MID), Up to 3 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the setup accuracy and reproducibility of the maskless immobilization device (MID) in patients being treated for head and neck cancers or intracranial tumors who require radiation therapy

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the patient comfort and quality of life with the MID compared to the thermoplastic mask.
