Brain Diseases on 7.0T Magnetic Resonance Imaging
This clinical trial studies the use of 7-Tesla (7T)and 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting brain diseases. 7T MRI has increased detection sensitivity, including more accurate lesion delineation, higher inter-rater agreement. Diagnostic procedures such as 7T MRI may help ultimately improved diagnostic and therapies confidence to inform decision making than standard 3T MRI.

7T MRI increased detection sensitivity, attain superior anatomic resolution, higher spatial and spectral specificity of advanced quantitative techniques, and shorter scan times than 3T MRI. When applied clinically, these benefits translate to increased detection sensitivity, and ultimately improved diagnostic and therapies confidence to inform decision making. This study aim to detect the image characteristics and diagnostic accuracy of brain diseases on 7T MRI.
