Transcriptomic Profile of Adipose Tissue Following n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) Supplementation
Adipose tissue is a central organ involved in mediating metabolic health, and so the investigation of treatments which improve adipose tissue function is warranted. LC n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been shown to exert positive effects on adipose tissue gene expression in previous studies. However this has not been investigated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a population shown to display a degree of adipose tissue dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation on gene expression profiles of women with PCOS.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: LC n-3 PUFA (fish oil) Supplement
Gene expression profiling subcutaneous adipose tissue of young women with PCOS following LC n-3 PUFA supplementation versus control, Gene expression profiles were assessed by mircoarray analysis from samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from subjects following LC n-3 PUFA and placebo supplementation. Single gene changes and pathway analyses will be conducted to assess potential differences between PCOS and control samples., Following 6 weeks of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation versus 6 weeks olive oil placebo supplementation
Assessment of biomarkers of hormonal and metabolic health in young women with PCOS following LC n-3 PUFA supplementation versus placebo, Key biomarkers of metabolic health (plasma lipid profile, inflammatory markers and adipokines) and androgenic hormonal profile (testosterone, androstenedione, DHEAS) were assessed by measuring circulating concentrations in plasma., Following 6 weeks of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation versus 6 weeks olive oil placebo supplementation
