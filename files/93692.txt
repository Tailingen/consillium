PULSO Trial: Pulsed Low-Dose-Rate (PLDR) Radiation Chemoradiation (CRT) vs. Standard CRT for Esophageal Cancer
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-arm phase 2 trial that will evaluate whether the use of Pulsed Low-Dose-Rate radiation technique, as compared to standard radiation, is associated with reduced rates of clinically significant esophagitis during and following chemoradiation.

PLDR radiation technique has been shown to kill cancer cells while limiting normal tissue toxicity. In PLDR, subjects receive the same total dose of radiation for each treatment, but the treatment is delivered in a series of low-dose pulses which are separated by timed pauses. Radiation given with this approach may be less toxic but appears to be equally effective. This trial will evaluate the PLDR technique in combination with standard chemotherapy as part of definitive or curative treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer.
