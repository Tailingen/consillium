Resting Metabolic Rate, Fat Distribution, Endocrine and Metabolic Features in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
In a longitudinal, prospective and observational study, patients with PCOS and controls wore the SenseWear Armband for 2 days. Resting metabolic rati (kcal/die), total energy expenditure (MET, kcal) were evaluated. Ultrasonographic pelvic examinations, hirsutism score, anthropometric and menstrual pattern evaluation, hormonal profile assays, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and lipid profile were performed.
