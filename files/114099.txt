Study of HL-085 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Tumors
The investigational product (IP) HL-085 is an adenosine triphosphate-noncompetitive mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor with a strong selective anti-tumor activity, with a much lower dose than selumetinib. It has been shown strong anti-tumor activities in preclinical studies to treat solid tumors, e.g., melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer and other malignancies with RAF and RAS mutations.

Kechow has completed phase I dose escalation study to test HL-085 in patients with advanced NRAS mutated melanoma in China. The tested doses were 0.5 mg, 1mg, 2mg, 3mg, 4mg, 6mg, 9mg, 12mg, 15mg and 18mg BID oral administration and there was no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified. All patients tolerated the study drug reasonably well.

This study is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary antitumor activities of HL-085 in US patients with advanced solid tumors. The objective of the dose escalation is to evaluate safety and tolerability of selected TID and BID dose regimens in US patient population with advanced solid tumor and establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

The starting dose for this trial is 12 mg daily oral administration. Three selected daily doses - 12 mg (4mg TID, 6mg BID), 18 mg (6mg TID, 9 mg BID), and 24 mg (8 mg TID, 12 mg BID) will be tested in this study to assess safety and tolerability of HL-085 at the 3 selected dose levels in US patient population with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: HL-085
Characterize the safety profile of the study drug at 3 dose levels in terms of number of treatment emergent events assessed by CTCAE v5.0., abnormal clinical laboratory and electrocardiograms findings (i.e. QT and QTc intervals)., 7 months (6 months treatment + 1 month follow-up)|Cmax: the maximum plasma concentration of HL-085 or metabolite(s);, 1 month (Cycle 1 Day 1-31)|Tmax: the time of Cmax;, 1 month (Cycle 1 Day 1-31)|Area under the curve at steady state: a measure of the exposure to HL-085 or metabolite(s) at steady state., 1 month (Cycle 1 Day 1-31)
Evaluate the efficacy of the study drug in terms of overall response rate, progression-free survival. ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed per RECIST v1.1., 7 months (6 months treatment + 1 month follow-up)
