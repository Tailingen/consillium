This is a phase Ⅱ, single-arm, open Label, multicenter clinical study in newly diagnosed Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The patients will receive venetoclax, azacitidine and orebatinib regimen in the induction treatment. The patients who respond to induction treatment will undergo consolidation treatment, and an optional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation maintenance treatment with induction therapy according to patient's wishes.
