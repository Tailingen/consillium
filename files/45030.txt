A Phase 1/2 Study of a Fully Human BCMA-targeting CAR (CT103A) in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (FUMANBA-1)
This study is a single-armed, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CT103A in subjects with relapsed and refractory MM.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CT103A
Phase 1: Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Phase 1: Laboratoty tests, Abnormal results of laboratoty tests, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Phase 1: Vital signs, Abnormal results of vital signs, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Phase 1: Physical examination, Abnormal results of physical examination, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Phase 2: Overall response rate (ORR) evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), Percentage of subjects who achieved partial response (PR) or better according to IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma as assessed by an IRC, 3 months post CT103A infusion
Overall response rate (ORR) evaluated by the investigators, Percentage of subjects who achieved partial response (PR) or better according to IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma as assessed by the investigators, 3 months post CT103A infusion|Overall Survival (OS), Time from CT103A infusion to time of death due to any cause, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Duration of Response (DOR), Time from first response evaluated by an IRC or investigators to disease progression or death from any cause, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from CT103A infusion to first documentation of progressive disease (PD), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Time to Response (TTR), Time from CT103A infusion to first documentation of response evaluated by an IRC or investigators, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Laboratoty tests, Abnormal results of laboratoty tests, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Vital signs, Abnormal results of vital signs, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Physical examination, Abnormal results of physical examination, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Proportion of subjects who achieved MRD negative, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, The maximum transgene level at Tmax, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax, Time to peak transgene level, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-28days, Area under the curve of CAR T cells from time zero to Day 28, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-90days, Area under the curve of CAR T cells from time zero to Day 90, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|soluble BCMA levels, soluble BCMA levels in peripheral blood of subjects, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion
Immunogenicity, Development of an anti-CAR antibody response, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|replication competent lentivirus (RCL), The incidence of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion|the levels of CAR-T related inflammatory factors, the levels of CRP, IL-6 and Ferritin, Minimum of 2 years post CT103A infusion
Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture CT103A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells. Bridging therapy is allowed between PBMC collection and lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of CT103A at 1.0 x 10\^6 CAR+ T cells/Kg. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum of 2 years after CT103A infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be followed for up to 15 years after CT103A infusion.
