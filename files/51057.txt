Influence of Nutrition and Sarcopenia on Esophageal Cancer Outcomes
Prospective multicenter longitudinal (observational) study recruiting from tertiary centers for the surgical management of esophageal cancer; Virginia Mason Medical Center (Seattle, USA) and St Mary's Hospital (Imperial College, London, UK). This is intended to be a pilot study.
Esophageal Cancer|Sarcopenia
Longitudinal variation in body composition, Establish the effect of patient and disease-specific factors on body composition in a global cohort of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer, Approximately 1 year
Patient and disease-specific factors, Provide a benchmark for future reporting of body composition and to explore the association between body composition and outcomes of esophageal cancer surgery, Approximately 1 year
Patients undergoing curative treatment for esophageal cancer will be recruited at the time of routine clinical assessment shortly following initial diagnosis and will undergo clinical and radiological evaluation at two study time points: (1) staging investigation (e.g. laparoscopy or endoscopy) and (2) definitive surgical resection. Study time points have been judiciously chosen to coincide with interventions that form part of patient's routine clinical care. It is intended that sampling will occur on the day of each intervention/surgery following a routine period of fasting.
