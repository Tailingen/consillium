Pilot Study of an NTproBNP Guided Strategy of Cardioprotection
Investigators will evaluate the safety and feasibility of a biomarker-guided cardioprotection strategy using NTproBNP, as compared to usual care, in breast cancer and lymphoma patients treated with anthracyclines.

This is a randomized, open-label pilot trial of a biomarker-guided strategy using NT-proBNP to identify and treat patients with a high risk of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity. Patients will be enrolled and randomized prior to initiation of anthracycline-based therapy and followed for 12 months with blood samples, echocardiography, and patient reported outcomes surveys. The overall hypothesis is that a biomarker guided treatment strategy that initiates neurohormonal antagonists in breast cancer or lymphoma patients who have increases in NT-proBNP prior to, during, or after anthracyclines will be feasible, well-tolerated, and result in attenuation of cardiotoxicity, compared to standard care.
