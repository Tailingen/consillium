Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) in Combination with Stereotactic Radiosurgery(SRS) for Brain Metastases from Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III trials. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tumor treating felds (TTF) combined with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the treatment of brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) .
