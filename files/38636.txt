Effects of Myo-inositol in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The study will be carried out at the hospital of the medical school of sao paulo (HC-FMUSP) and the goal is to compare the effects of the administration of myo-inositol in relation to the effects of metformin in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and insulin resistance or glucose intolerance. Menstrual cycle, hyperandrogenism, chronic inflammatory process, carbohydrate metabolism, hepatic steatosis will be evaluated. In total, 60 women in the reproductive period, with a variable age between 18 and 36 years old will be recruited and randomized in two groups: intervention- myo-inositol for 6 months, control group will use metformin also for 6 months.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Resistance, Insulin|Glucose Intolerance
DRUG: Myo-inositol|DRUG: Metformin
Menstrual cycle, Analysis of period calendar., 6 months|Change in glucose metabolism, Glucose tolerance curve with insulin curve will be performed every 3 months., Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Change in glycated hemoglobin, Glycated hemoglobin will be performed every 3 months., Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Change in ultrasound of the ovaries, Transvaginal ultrasound to assess ovarian volume (measured in cubic centimeters) will be done before and after treatment., 6 months|Change in antral follicle count, Ultrasound of the ovaries will be done before and after treatment for antral follicle count (all follicles from 2 to 9 mm will be measured), 6 months|Change in body mass index, Body mass index (kg/m2) will be assessed every 3 months., Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Change in Abdominal Circumference and Hip Circumference, Abdominal circumference and hip circumference (measured in centimeters) will be assessed every 3 months., Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Change in body weight in kilograms, Patients will be weighed every 3 months (measured in kilograms)., Every 3 months for up to 6 months
Assess adherence to treatment., Medication use diary will be delivered and will be reviewed every 3 months to assess adherence to treatment (good adherence will be considered use of more than 80% of the medication provided)., Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Side effects, Questionnaire will be carried out every 3 months for patient to describe the 3 main side effects and how much they have hindered the treatment or not., Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Hepatic steatosis, Initial liver ultrasound will be done and repeated after 6 months of treatment to assess the presence or absence of hepatic steatosis and classify it as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2) and severe (grade 3)., 6 months|Liver enzymes, Liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,alkaline phosphatase) will be collected before and after treatment, 6 months|Chronic inflammatory process, Chronic inflammatory markers will be accessed by analyzing RNA messenger from cervical-vaginal cytology before and after treatment., 6 months|C-reactive protein, Chronic inflammatory process will be also evaluated by serum measurement of c-reactive protein before and after treatment., 6 months|Homocysteine, Serum homocysteine dosage will be done before and after treatment to help assess a chronic inflammatory process., 6 months|Change in Lipid Profile, Serum dosage of the lipid profile (high density lipoprotein - HDL, low density lipoprotein - LDL , very low density lipoprotein - VLDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol) will be done every 3 months, Every 3 months for up to 6 months|Modified Ferriman-Gallwey Score, Modified Ferriman-Gallwey Score will be performed before and after treatment and patients with a score above 7 will be considered hirsute., 6 months|Hormonal dosage (FSH, LH, progesterone, estradiol), Hormonal dosage (FSH - Follicle-stimulating hormone, LH - luteinizing hormone, progesterone, estradiol) will be preformed before and after treatment., 6 months
The study will involve 60 women in the reproductive period, with a variable between 19 and 36 years old and diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), according to Rotterdam- European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) / American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) criteria defined in 2003 and revised in 2018, and insulin resistance (presence acanthosis nigricans) or glucose intolerance (fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin or 75g glycemic overload and blood glucose assessment after 2 hours). It is a comparative and non-inferiority study of myo-inositol in relation to metformin. They will be divided into two groups of 30 patients: Group I (control) - they will receive metformin 850 mg, orally, twice a day; Group II (experiment) - they will receive myo-inositol 2g + folic acid 200mcg, orally, twice a day.
