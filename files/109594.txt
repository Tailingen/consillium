Lung-MAP S1400K: c-MET Positive
S1400K of Lung-MAP seeks to evaluate the overall response rate with ABBV-399 (Process II) in patients with c-MET positive SCCA.

S1400K is a biomarker-driven study for patients with Stage IV or recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, who have c-MET positive squamous cell tumors.
