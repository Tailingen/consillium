Combining Afatinib and Concurrent Chemotherapy, Followed by Osimertinib and Concurrent Chemotherapy, in Untreated EGFR Positive NSCLC Tumors
The aim of the COMBINATION trial is to prospectively study the sequential approach of using afatinib combined with a short course of chemotherapy, followed by osimertinib, upon progression and acquisition of a T790M mutation, also combined with a short course of chemotherapy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Afatinib, Osimertinib, Carboplatin and Pemetrexed
Disease control rate (DCR), To assess the efficacy of the sequential strategy of front-line afatinib-chemo, followed by a treatment with osimertinib-chemo in those patients that develop a T790M mutation as a mechanism of resistance, 18 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess long term efficacy, From start of therapy until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 50 months|Overall Survival (OS), To assess long term efficacy, From start of therapy until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 50 months|Objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 after start of afatinib, To assess short term efficacy, At 6 weeks|Objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 after start of afatinib, To assess short term efficacy, At 12 weeks|Objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 after start of osimertinib, To assess short term efficacy, At 6 weeks|Objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 after start of osimertinib, To assess short term efficacy, At 12 weeks|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), To assess the safety of afatinib and osimertinib intercalated with 2 cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed, From start of therapy until disease progression or study drug toxicity assessed up to 100 days after part 1 and 2
The investigators hypothesized that treating advanced stage EGFR mutation positive NSCLC in first line with afatinib and osimertinib in second line (in T790M positive tumors) will cause an apoptotic cell death in a large part of TKI-sensitive cancer cells, resulting in a large reduction of the tumor bulk. Adding cytotoxic chemotherapy after 6 weeks of EGFR-TKI will destroy remaining TKI-resistant subclones at an early stage, when the TKI-resistance tumor volume is the smallest and most vulnerable. The investigators will administer only 2 cycles of chemotherapy to limit toxicity, while maintaining a substantial anti-cancer effect. After progression on afatinib-chemotherapy combination, some participants will develop T790M and will be able treated by osimertinib-chemotherapy combination.

So, this strategy will allow the investigators to timely sequence the most appropriate drugs (afatinib and osimertinib with chemotherapy) to get the highest anti-cancer efficiency. In this way, the investigators will avoid long periods of maintenance treatments with chemotherapy or anti-VEGFR treatments that are associated with toxicity, costs, and necessitate the participants to come into the ward for intravenous medication. The limited cycles of chemotherapy also allows the treating physician to again treat the participant with the same chemotherapy regimen once progression occurs after all sensible targeted therapy options have been used.

Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that this sequential combination strategy will be more effective than other available strategies and will improve the quality of patient care as compared to current general practice.
