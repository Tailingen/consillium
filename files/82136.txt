Selinexor in Combination With Immunomodulator （Thalidomide/Pomalidomide/Lenalidomide）in RRMM
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell cancer that almost all patients eventually relapse despite advancement in treatment strategies. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a cell surface receptor that expressed primarily by malignant and normal plasma cells. This is a single-arm that includes three arms, Selinexor(ATG-010) in Combination with Immunomodulator (Thalidomide/ Pomalidomide/ Lenalidomide）and Dexamethasone to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients. To evaluate efficacy and safety of Selinexor in combination with Immunomodulator and Dexamethasone in RRMM patients received at least one prior lines of therapy.

This is a single-arm and open-label phase II study of Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma patients who have received at least one prior lines of treatment therapy; This study includes three experimental arms. Arm I is given XTd regimen (ATG-010 60mg/d QW, Thalidomide 100mg/d and Dexamethasone 40mg/d QW) in approximately 30 subjects. Arm II is given XRd regimen (ATG-010 60mg/d QW, Lenalidomide 25mg/d d1-21 and Dexamethasone 40mg/d QW) in approximately 30 subjects, Arm III is given XPd（ATG-010 60mg/d QW, Pomalidomide 4mg/d d1-21 and Dexamethasone 40mg/d QW ) in approximately 30 subjects,The three arms are 4 weeks per cycle and include a total of 12 cycles.
