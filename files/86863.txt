Study on MK-3475 Plus Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Recurrent, Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
The study is designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in recurrent, platinum resistant OC patients. The main objective is to test whether the therapeutic intervention benefits the patients evaluating the increase in overall survival with respect to chemotherapy alone.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Liposomal Doxorubicin
Overall survival (OS), The combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is expected to increase overall survival with respect to chemotherapy alone, from randomization to the date of death, assessed up to 44 months
Progression free survival (PFS), The combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is expected to increase progression free survival with respect to chemotherapy alone, from randomization to the date of radiological/clinical progression of disease or death, assessed up to 44 months|Response rate, The combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is expected to increase response rate with respect to chemotherapy alone., 44 months|Adverse events, Incidence of adverse events, according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 5.0, 44 months|Exploratory Objective: relationship between PD-L1 expression and response to Pembrolizumab treatment., PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue will be characterized by immunohistochemistry to explore the relationship between tumor PD-L1 expression and response to treatment with pembrolizumab., At screening phase: within 28 days before the start of treatment|Exploratory Objective: association between anti-tumor activity from genetic alterations that may indicate a specific genotype reflective of greater dependency on PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint function or other immune checkpoint signaling pathways, DNA isolated from blood or tumor tissue will be analyzed in order to identify genetic alterations and to evaluate specific genetic alterations that may correlate with clinical response to Pembrolizumab., At screening phase (within 28 days before the start of treatment) and every 3 cycles (each cycle is 28 days), up to 44 months|Quality of life, To assess patient-reported outcome (PRO) of patients receiving chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with respect to patients receiving chemotherapy alone utilizing the disease-related symptoms - physical subscale of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy FACT-Ovarian Symptom Index 18 (FOSI-18) Changes. The time to an event in PRO (Patient Reported Outcome) of worsening of disease symptoms will be defined as the time from randomization to a 4-point reduction in the FACT-O questionnaire., 44 months|Quality of life, To assess patient-reported outcome (PRO) of patients receiving chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with respect to patients receiving chemotherapy alone using Euro- Quality of Life 5D tool, indicating which statements best describe the patient health state regarding: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, 44 months
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in recurrent, platinum resistant OC patients. The main objective is to test whether the therapeutic intervention benefits the patients evaluating the increase in overall survival with respect to chemotherapy alone.

Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive:

ARM A:

Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28 Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 At physician' discretion or

ARM B:

Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28 Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv infusion in 30 minutes In both arms patients will receive treatments until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity of patient's refusal. Patients will receive at least 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy at physician's discretion. In the experimental arm patients who stop chemotherapy for toxicity reasons and whose disease is at least in stabilization, may continue treatment with Pembrolizumab as single agent.

Patients will be stratified according to the number of previous chemotherapy lines (1 vs \>1) and measurable/evaluable disease.
