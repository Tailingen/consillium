Radiofrquency Ablation Combined With Cytokine-induced Killer Cells for the Patients With Cholangiocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion can prolong survival of patients with cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation|BIOLOGICAL: Cytokine-induced killer cells
Recurrence-free survival, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time from the date of RFA to the date of recurrence or the date of the last follow-up., 1 year
Adverse events, Adverse events related to RFA and CIK treatments., 4 weeks
The primary objective is to evaluate whether RFA followed by CIK transfusion can prolong survival of patients with cholangiocarcinoma.
