A Study of XZP-3287 in Combination With Letrozole/Anastrozole in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a Phase III clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XZP-3287 in combination with Letrozole/Anastrozole versus placebo in combination with Letrozole/Anastrozole in patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative recurrent/metastatic breast cancer who have not received systemic anticancer therapy.
