Lymphadenectomy In Ovarian Neoplasms
To assess the efficacy of systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and intra-abdominal complete debulking.

Secondary: progression-free survival, complications and quality of life; Exploratory: Role of number of resected lymph nodes for primary and secondary objectives
Ovarian Cancer
PROCEDURE: No Lymphadenectomy (LNE)|PROCEDURE: Lymphadenectomy (LNE)
Overall Survival, time from randomization until death
- Progression-free survival (PFS) - Quality of life (QoL) as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, OV28 - number of resected lymph nodes, Progression-free survival time is calculated from the date of surgery until the date of first progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first or date of last contact (censored observation).
