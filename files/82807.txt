Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Combination With Anlotinib for Limited-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of different dose of anlotinib combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of limited-stage SCLC patients.
Small Cell Lung Cancer Limited Stage
DRUG: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus anlotinib
Maximum Tolerance Dose (MTD) is the dose of treatment in the cohort where there are 2 cases of DLT reported., Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is referred to grade 3 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 hematological toxicity according to NCI CTCAE 4.03 criteria, From enrollment to completion of study. Estimated about 18months
PFS（Progress free survival）, The PFS time is defined as time from enrollment to locoregional or systemic, each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|OS（Overall Survival）, OS was defined as time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause., From enrollment until death (up to 24 months)|ORR（Objective Response Rate）, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as participants who had complete response (CR) or partial response(PR) divided by the total number of patients., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|DCR（Disease Control Rate）, Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as the percentage of participants with Disease Control best overall response (complete response, partial response or stable disease)., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)
Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for VEGFR1、VEGFR2、VEGFR3、FGFR1/2/3、PDGFRa/β c-Kit and MET. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of anlotinib when combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. From low dose group up to high dose group, each one had 3 patients at least. Primary group received anlotinib 8mg. The dose of anlotinib would increase gradually until MTD.
