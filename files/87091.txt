Everolimus Dose Finding Study for Stage IV or Recurrent Cervical Cancer
This Phase 1, single-site, dose-escalation study is being conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RAD001 as part of a specified combination regimen.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: RAD001|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: External Beam Whole Pelvis Radiation Therapy
To determine the maximum tolerated dose for RAD001 as adjunct therapy to standard upfront treatment of advanced stage cervical cancer in combination with weekly cisplatin and whole pelvic external beam radiation, every 7 days|To determine the dose limiting toxicities for RAD001 as adjunct therapy to standard upfront treatment of advanced stage cervical cancer in combination with weekly cisplatin and whole pelvic external beam radiation, every 7 days
To determine the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 given as adjunct therapy to standard upfront treatment of advanced stage cervical cancer, day 1 and day 15 during study treatment|To evaluate the pharmacogenetics of RAD001 in the specified patient population, day 1 prior to starting study treatment|To evaluate microvessel density pre-and post-treatment with the specified treatment regimen in the specified patient population, day 1 and end of treatment|To evaluate potential correlations between biomarkers HIF-1a, TSP-1, P53, VEGF, and VEGFR and use of the specified treatment regimen in the specified patient population, day 1 and end of treatment|To evaluate progression free survival in the specified patient population, from the time of treatment start until progression or up to 5 years after completion of study treatment|To assess quality of life as indicated by the Patient Care Monitor in the specified patient population, every 7 days during study treatment
This Phase 1, single-site, dose-escalation study is being conducted to determine the MTD of RAD001 as part of a specified combination regimen. The combination regimen will be standard field whole pelvic RT in combination with cisplatin at 40mg/m2 weekly with RAD001 at dose escalation daily starting at 5 mg qod, then 5 mg qd, then 10 mg qd during the period of whole pelvic radiation therapy.
