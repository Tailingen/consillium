Short-course Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab with Taxanes in the Adjuvant Treatment of Early HER2-positive Breast Cancer
The investigators plan to carry out a phase II, open-label, single-arm clinical study of short-course trastuzumab, pertuzumab combined with taxanes in the adjuvant treatment of early HER2-positive breast cancer, to explore whether 4 courses of dual HER2 blockade combined with taxanes can lead to a similar prognosis with current standard treatment, which is one-year trastuzumab monotherapy combined with chemotherapy, while reducing the adverse reactions of treatment.
