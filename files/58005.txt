Docetaxel, Estramustine and Short Term Androgen Withdrawal for Patients With a Rising PSA After Local Treatment
The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of chemotherapy drugs and drugs to suppress testosterone (hormone therapy) is effective in controlling early prostate cancer.

This study will attempt to:

* stop or slow the growth of disease
* gain information about prostate cancer
* evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of the study drug
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate|Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Estramustine|DRUG: Casodex|DRUG: Zoladex
To determine the feasibility of administering chemotherapy and medical castration to men with rising PSA after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy., 2 years
To determine the PSA response rate and duration of response|to measure testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin in relation to chemotherapy and hormone therapy., 2 years
* Patients will receive two medications; docetaxel and estramustine. Estramustine will be taken orally three times daily for 5 days starting on day one. Docetaxel will be given intravenously on day 2. These two drugs will be repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles (12 weeks).
* Patients will also take dexamethasone for three days at the beginning of each cycle to help decrease the risk of side effects.
* Patients will also take coumadin every day for three months while on the chemotherapy to reduce the risk of blood clots.
* After 12 weeks the chemotherapy phase will be completed and patient will start on the hormone therapy part of the treatment. Three weeks after the last chemotherapy treatment, patients will start Casodex orally once daily.
* After taking Casodex for 1 week, patients will then start on Zoladex (an injection in the abdomen) every 3 months for a total of 5 injections.
* During study treatment various blood tests will be performed to watch the disease. Study treatment will stop after a total of 18 months (3 months chemotherapy and 15 months hormone therapy). A physical exam and blood tests will be performed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for the third year, and then every 6 months after that.
