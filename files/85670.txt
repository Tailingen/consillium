Study of Ribociclib Administered Concurrently With Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Patients With High-Risk, Node Positive, HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety, tolerability and dose of Ribociclib when combined with adjuvant radiation in women with high-risk ER+ breast cancer.

Once enrolled on study, patients will begin treatment with Ribociclib 400 mg daily at the same time as they initiate standard of care adjuvant radiation therapy- 50 Gy in 25 fractions or 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions +/- 10 Gy boost including comprehensive nodal. Paitents will continue treatment with Ribociclib for up to 6 weeks.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ribociclib|RADIATION: Postoperative Radiation Therapy
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ribociclib administered concurrently with adjuvant RT 1 month post last RT dose, Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and type of adverse events, and clinically significant changes in the patient's physical examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results. Safety variables will be tabulated and presented for all patients in the study. Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation of study treatment will be tabulated., up through 30 days after the last dose of study drug or radiotherapy
Cumulative incidence of local failure (i.e. local recurrence events), Calculation of follow-up time for all endpoints for patients will begin from the date of diagnosis until documentation of local or regional recurrence for local control, any failure (local, regional, or distant) or death for recurrence-free survival, and death for overall survival., up through 2 years after completion of protocol therapy|Local failure-free survival, The time from diagnosis date to the first of local or regional recurrence or death. Patients who are alive and free of local regional recurrence at lat follow up will be cencored at that date., up through 2 years after completion of protocol therapy|Recurrence-free survival, Date of diagnosis until documentation of death. Time-dependent and will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method or cumulative incidence method when competing events., up through 2 years after completion of protocol therapy|Overall survival, Overall survival as determined by the date of diagnosis until documentation of death. Time-dependent and will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method or cumulative incidence method when competing events., up through 2 years after completion of protocol therapy|Disease free survival, Defined as the time to the first of local, regional, or distant recurrence or death, up through 2 years after completion of protocol therapy
