Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin and Radiation Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer
This study will examine a proposed research treatment which evaluates the addition of oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy agent, to gemcitabine, another chemotherapy agent, and radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. The researchers have already done studies using gemcitabine and radiation therapy together. They want to build on the information they have from this previous research. The researchers believe that the combination chemotherapy with radiation is worth investigating to treat pancreatic cancer. They will use this study to determine what type of side effects occur with this treatment and to assess how effective the treatment is at controlling the cancer.
