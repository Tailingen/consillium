An Expanded Access Study of Abiraterone Acetate in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer Who Have Completed Clinical Study COU-AA-001
The purpose of this study is to provide access to abiraterone acetate for patients who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment in Clinical Study COU-AA-001 and continue to receive clinical benefit from this treatment.
Prostate Neoplasms
DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Glucocorticoid
Number of participants with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline according to PSA Working Group criteria, Screening, Cycle 1 Day 1 Pre-dose, every 3 months up to 3 years after study entry|Overall survival, every 3 months up to 3 years after study entry
Number of participants with adverse events, up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication|Time to disease progression, every 3 months up to 3 years after study entry|Time to prostate specific antigen progression, every 3 months up to 3 years after study entry|Objective tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), every 3 months up to 3 years after study entry
This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known) extended access study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continued administration of abiraterone acetate in patients who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment in Clinical Study COU-AA-001 and continue to receive clinical benefit from this treatment. Patients will continue with the same dose regimen administered at the end of Study COU-AA-001 and will receive a low-dose glucocorticoid daily. Patients will be followed every 3 months for disease progression and survival for up to 3 years following study entry. Safety will be monitored throughout the study up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
