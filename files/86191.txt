Histology of Functional Density in Postmenopausal Breast
Increased mammographic density is recognized as an important risk factor for developing breast cancer, however, the underlying mechanism explaining this relationship is unclear. The investigators hypothesize that Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) can more accurately distinguish dense tissue on mammography which is at high risk from dense tissue at low risk by indicating cellular activity in dense tissue as radiotracer uptake (functional density) in the breast. In this pilot study, the investigators want to compare the histological characteristics of breast tissue in patients with who have similar density on mammography but different levels of functional density on MBI.

Degree of lobular involution, Degree of lobular involution as assessed through qualitative and quantitative measurements will be compared between dense tissue which appears photopenic on MBI and dense tissue which appears functionally active on MBI., within 1 month of functional density assessment on MBI|Ki-67 cellular proliferation index, Degree of cellular proliferation as assessed through Ki-67 index will be compared between dense tissue which appears photopenic on MBI and dense tissue which appears functionally active on MBI., within 1 month of functional density assessment on MBI
