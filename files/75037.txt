Impact of Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling on Ovarian Reserve in Patients With Anovulatory Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
Pneumoperitoneum is done by insertion of the verress needle at the inferior edge of the umbilicus putting into consideration the following tests:

1. Needle test: Verress needle patency check.
2. Hissing phenomenon: Needle introduced by open valve mechanism.
3. Aspiration test: Placing a drop of water on the opening of the needle and examine its disappearance into the abdomen.
4. Volume test: Changes occurred in the intra abdominal pressure during gas insufflations.

Intra abdominal pressure 12-16 mmHg usually suitable for this pelvic surgery. Introduction of the laparoscopic instruments all in its place

* Laparoscopic telescope : From the inferior edge of umbilicus through trocar and sleeve which inserted by corkscrew technique then removed to allow the telescope insertion which connected to light source , camera head and color monitor.
* 2nd and 3rd punctures were done allowing another two graspers to be inserted usually at a point represent outer 1/3 of the lateral abdominal wall in an imaginary line from umbilicus to iliac bone

Puncturing technique :

Fixation of one ovary away from intestine by grasping the ovarian ligament with the traumatic grasper which allow good exposure of the ovary and allow drilling .

Drilling needle was introduced and connected by monopolar current, held against ovarian surface for 4 seconds using a power of 40 watt, 4 puncture was done in each ovary with putting into consideration that the puncture must be not superficial and it must go deep through the main substance of the ovary.

Cooling of the ovary by lactated ringer's solution, finally removal of all instruments under vision after exclusion of any complication .
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling
Antral follicular count, AFC is defined as counting of all echo lucent rounded follicles measuring (2-10mm) that present in the substance of the ovary, 3 months from laparoscopy|AntiMullerian hormone, Plasma samples were assayed for AMH in duplicate using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay kit., 3 months from laparoscopy
