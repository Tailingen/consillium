BGB-15025 Alone and in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Tislelizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BGB-15025 alone and in combination with tislelizumab; and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) of BGB-15025 alone and in combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
