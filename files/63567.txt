Anemia Treatment for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
This is a study in patients with chemotherapy induced anemia receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy for the treatment of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that overall survival (OS) is not worse in participants on darbepoetin alfa treated to a hemoglobin ceiling of 12.0 g/dL compared to participants treated with placebo.

Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants were censored on the date of last contact (ie, the date the participant was last known to be alive) if they were not known to have died., From randomization until death or end of study; maximum time on follow-up was 93.6 months.
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the date of radiographic disease progression or death from any cause, whichever event occurred first. Participants without either event were censored on the date of their last disease assessment. Disease progression was based on the investigator's assessment of scans using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 or 1.1 depending on the timing of enrollment., From randomization until disease progression or death; maximum time on follow-up was 87.23 months.|Percentage of Participants With a Red Blood Cell Transfusion or Hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g/dL From Week 5 to End of the Efficacy Treatment Period, Any red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (packed RBCs or whole blood) given or a hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g/dL on or after study day 29 until the EOETP, inclusive., Week 5 (day 29) to end of the efficacy treatment period (EOETP; defined as 21 days after either the last dose of study drug or the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever was later); median (range) duration of dosing was 10 (1 to 106) weeks in both groups.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest, Adverse events of interest for darbepoetin alfa, based on clinical data in anemic patients with cancer to date, included the following categories: antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), cardiac failure, central nervous system vascular disorders, convulsions, embolic and thrombotic events, hypersensitivity, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, malignancies, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Lack of efficacy and medication errors were also evaluated., From first dose of study drug until 30 days after last dose; the median (range) duration of treatment was 10 (1 to 106) weeks in both groups.|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Tumor Response, Objective response was defined as the incidence of a complete or partial response at any time during the study. Response was determined by the investigator's assessment of the scans using RECIST version 1.0 or 1.1 depending on the timing of enrollment., Day 1 to end of the efficacy treatment period (EOETP; defined as 21 days after either the last dose of study drug or the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever was later); median (range) duration of dosing was 10 (1 to 106) weeks in both groups.|Number of Participants Who Developed Neutralizing Antibodies to Darbepoetin Alfa, Developing antibody incidence was defined as neutralizing antibody positive postbaseline with a negative or no result at baseline., Baseline and end of the efficacy treatment period (EOETP; defined as 21 days after either the last dose of study drug or the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever was later. the median (range) duration of treatment was 10 (1 to 106) weeks in both groups.|Percentage of Participants With a Red Blood Cell Transfusion or Hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g/dL From Week 1 to End of the Efficacy Treatment Period, Any red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (packed RBCs or whole blood) given or a hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g/dL on or after study day 1 until the EOETP, inclusive., Week 1 to end of the efficacy treatment period (EOETP; defined as 21 days after either the last dose of study drug or the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever was later); the median (range) duration of treatment was 10 (1 to 106) weeks in both groups.|Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin to End of Efficacy Treatment Period, Post-baseline hemoglobin values within 28 days after a RBC transfusion were not be used in the calculation of change., Baseline and end of the efficacy treatment period (EOETP; defined as 21 days after either the last dose of study drug or the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever was later); the median (range) duration of treatment was 10 (1 to 106) weeks in both groups.
