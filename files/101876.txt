An Open-label, Randomized Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of AUY922 vs Pemetrexed or Docetaxel in NSCLC Patients With EGFR Mutations
The purpose of this study was to determine if AUY922 had superior efficacy when compared to chemotherapy agents docetaxel or pemetrexed in patients whose tumor had EGFR mutations.

The primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of AUY922, when administered i.v. on a once-weekly schedule at 70 mg/m2, versus docetaxel or pemetrexed in adult patients with advanced NSCLC, whose tumors harbored EGFR activating mutations, and had developed resistance to EGFR TKI.
Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: AUY922|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Compared PFS between the treatment of AUY922 to comparators Pemetrexed or Docetaxel. Progression-free survival (PFS) based on local investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1 was the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient had not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 16 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was to be compared between treatment arms. The ORR was to be based on local investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Per this criteria for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.This outcome measure was originally planned to be analyzed up to 24 months. The DMC recommendation at the IA was to stop the study for futility. As a result, collection of all the efficacy assessments was stopped at that time., 16 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a death has not been observed by the date of analysis cutoff, then OS was to be censored at the last known date patient was alive., from randomization until death up to death|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of DCR will be compared between treatment arms. The duration of DCR will be based on local investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1, baseline, until disease progression up to 24 months|Time to Response (TRR), TTR was to compare between treatment arms. The TTR was to be based on local investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1, baseline, until disease progression up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR will be compared between treatment arms. The DOR will be based on local investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1, baseline, until disease progression up to 24 months|Rate of Adverse Events (AEs), To evaluate safety and tolerability of AUY922 compared to chemotherapy agents pemetrexed or docetaxel., baseline, until disease progression up to 24 months|Change in Laboratory Paramenters, Changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), Dose interruptions, reductions and dose intensity., baseline, until disease progression up to 24 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP will be compared between treatment arms. The TTP will be based on local investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1, baseline, until disease progression up to 24 months
