Ph II Study of Perifosine Plus Gleevec for Patients With GIST
This is a Phase II trial designed to determine the efficacy and safety of perifosine plus imatinib mesylate in patients with advanced GIST who develop progressive disease or recurrence while receiving imatinib mesylate.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Perifosine|DRUG: Imatinib Mesylate
To determine the efficacy and safety of perifosine plus imatinib mesylate in patients with advanced GIST who develop progressive disease or recurrence while receiving imatinib mesylate., This is a two-arm Phase II trial to determine whether the experimental regimen is likely to provide a 20% response rate while controlling the toxicity rate at 15%. Response will be evaluated at 2 months from the start of therapy, and is defined using the Choi Criteria. Toxicity is defined as any of the following events: regimen-related death, grade 3 transaminitis, grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity, or grade 4 fatigue or higher within the same 2-month time window., Every 8 weeks
To determine whether inhibition of Akt phosphorylation correlates with survival, time to disease progression, or response rate in patients with advanced GIST treated with imatinib mesylate plus perifosine., As perifosine inhibits activation of Akt and has an acceptable safety profile, this Phase II trial is designed to assess antitumor activity of perifosine in patients with advanced GIST who are refractory to or relapsed from imatinib mesylate., Every 8 weeks
This is a Phase II study of perifosine in combination with imatinib mesylate in patients with advanced GIST. Each cycle lasts 28 days. There will be two treatment arms. On both arms, patients will continue the dose of imatinib mesylate taken during the period of disease progression. Patients will be randomized to one either a weekly or a daily perifosine treatment regimen at the time of registration.
