Safety Study of MPC-3100 in Cancer Patients Who Have Failed Other Treatments
The purpose of this study is to see how safe the study drug is and to determine the best dose to use in cancer patients in the future.

The study drug is designed to reduce the activity of a protein known as "heat shock protein 90", or "Hsp90". Hsp90 is found in every cell in the human body and normally helps those cells (and the body) cope with stressful situations. In certain cancers, however, Hsp90 helps the cancer cells survive and grow. By reducing the activity of Hsp90, the study drug may slow the growth, and reduce the survival, of those cancer cells.

Safety and Tolerability (Maximum Tolerated Dose), After each cohort is enrolled .
Study Drug Pharmacokinetics, Cycle 1|Evidence of anti-tumor activity of study drug., After each odd cycle and end of study.
This is a dose escalation study. As subjects participating in the study tolerate a specific dose level, the new subjects entering will be given a higher dose of the study drug.
