Ublituximab Followed by Response-driven Addition of Umbralisib for Treatment-naive Follicular or Marginal Zone Lymphoma
This is an open-label, Phase II interventional study in order to assess efficacy and safety of single agent ublituximab as initial therapy for FL (Follicular lymphoma) and MZL (Marginal zone lymphoma ) with response driven addition of umbralisib for suboptimal response.
Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Ublituximab|DRUG: Umbralisib
Number of Participants With Complete Response Rate (CR) at 8 Weeks Post Single Agent Induction, Number of subjects that reached a complete response at the end of single agent induction as defined by a Lugano score of 3 or less on arm MONO - Monotherapy: Ublituximab.

Complete response assessed via PET CT scan utilizing the Lugano-Deauville Criteria where none of the lymphoma lesions had FDG ( FluoroDeoxyglucose) avidity greater than the liver uptake.

Patients who did not reach complete response at this point were then bridged to arm COMBO - Combotherapy: Ublituximab + Umbralisib., 8 weeks post induction|Number of Participants With Complete Response Rate (CR) at up to 12 Months Post MONO - Monotherapy: Ublituximab or Combotherapy: Ublituximab + Umbralisib., Number of subjects that reached a complete response at up to 12 months post induction as defined by a Lugano score of 3 or less on arms MONO - Monotherapy: Ublituximab.OR Combotherapy: Ublituximab + Umbralisib.

Complete response assessed via PET CT scan utilizing the Lugano-Deauville Criteria where none of the lymphoma lesions had FDG ( FluoroDeoxyglucose) avidity greater than the liver uptake., up to 12 months post induction
Overall Response Rates (ORR) for Number of Participants, Overall Response Rate for number of subjects as defined by a Lugano score of 3 or less on arms MONO - Monotherapy: Ublituximab.OR Combotherapy: Ublituximab + Umbralisib.

Overall response rate assessed via PET CT utilizing Lugano deauvile criteria where lymphoma lesions had responded and would include complete response, partial response (\> 50% improvement) and stable disease (less than 50 % response), up to 12 months post induction
Based on overall reporting in low tumor burden FL and MZL, CR rate of at least 30% was achieved when single agent rituximab was used in these subsets. The investigators assume that by administering ublituximab (both as a single agent and in combination with umbralisib for individuals who fail to achieve a CR \[Complete response\] with the single agent), the CR rate will increase to 50%. Efficacy will be assessed using the proportion of patients treated with ublituximab alone or with ublituximab administered in combination who have a complete response. Thus, the investigators will test the efficacy of ublituximab using a difference in proportions design by comparing an expected study population control rate of 50% to the comparison proportion being determined by the historical control CR rate of 30%. In other words, the null hypothesis is that the true response rate is 30%, and it will be formally tested against a one-sided alternative that the response rate is 50%.
