Effects of Propofol on Auditory Event-related Potentials and Brain Functional Connectivity in Patients With Supratentorial Glioma
The growth of gliomas often infiltrates important brain tissues and impairs subcortical fiber transmission, resulting in changes in global brain network connectivity. Most of the current anesthesia depth monitoring methods are based on healthy brain function population，which is difficult to reflect the sedation depth of glioma patients accurately. Therefore, this study aims to explore the characteristics of brain network connectivity in glioma patients under different sedation depths by electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory event-related potential (AERP) methods, which may provide a research basis for sedative titration and anesthesia depth identification in glioma patients.
