Almonertinib as First-line Treatment in Patients With EGFR+ Positive Pulmonary Adenosquamous Carcinoma or Combined Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm clinical trial.
Pulmonary Adenosquamous Carcinoma
DRUG: Almonertinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess the efficacy of Almonertinib as first line therapy to EGFRm+, locally advanced or metastatic Pulmonary Adenosquamous Carcinoma patients by assessment of progression free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
Assess the anti-tumor activity: OS, Overall survival (OS), Start of study drug to Survival Endpoint through study completion, an average of 4 years.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: ORR, Objective response rate (ORR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: DCR, Disease control rate (DCR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. The DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: DoR, Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the safety of Almonertinib : Number of AEs/SAEs, Number of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs), Continuously throughout the study until 28 days after Termination of the treatment|QoL QoL, To assess disease-related symptoms and QoL in overall population as well as in pre-specified subgroups, 2 years|Assess the anti-tumor activity: iORR, Intracranial Objective response rate (iORR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: iDCR, Intracranial Disease control rate (iDCR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression assessed up to 24 months.|Intracranial Progression Free Survival (iPFS), To assess the efficacy of Almonertinib as first line therapy to EGFRm+, locally advanced or metastatic Pulmonary Adenosquamous Carcinoma patients by assessment of intracranial progression free survival (iPFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
This is a multicenter, single arm, phase II study assessing the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic Pulmonary Adenosquamous Carcinoma.
