Study of Ruxolitinib in Relapsed or Refractory T or NK Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib works by blocking a protein called JAK. JAK works along with another protein called STAT and is important for survival of many T or NK-cell lymphomas. By blocking JAK, ruxolitinib may cause T or NK-cell lymphomas to shrink.
