Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer Patients
The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate its ability to detect prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Ga-68 labeled PSMA-11|DEVICE: Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT)|DEVICE: Positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI)
Detection Rate of PSMA-11 PET for Positive Disease by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Group, Detection rate is defined as the proportion of all patients who have prostate cancer and are true-positives confirmed by the imaging based on local reads for the detection of metastatic disease. Detection rates will be stratified based upon the PSA group at time of imaging., 1 day|Detection Rate of PSMA-11 PET for Positive Disease in Prostate Bed by PSA Group, Detection rate is defined as the proportion of all patients who have prostate cancer located in the prostate bed and are true-positives confirmed by the imaging based on local reads for the detection of metastatic disease. Detection rates will be stratified based upon the PSA group at time of imaging., 1 day|Detection Rate of PSMA-11 PET for Positive Disease in Pelvic Nodes by PSA Group, Detection rate is defined as the proportion of all patients who have prostate cancer located in the pelvic nodes and are true-positives confirmed by the imaging based on local reads for the detection of metastatic disease. Detection rates will be stratified based upon the PSA group at time of imaging., 1 day|Detection Rate of PSMA-11 PET for Positive Disease in Distant Soft Tissues by PSA Group, Detection rate is defined as the proportion of all patients who have prostate cancer located in the distant soft tissues and are true-positives confirmed by the imaging based on local reads for the detection of metastatic disease. Detection rates will be stratified based upon the PSA group at time of imaging., 1 day|Detection Rate of PSMA-11 PET for Positive Disease in Bones (Osseous Lesions) by PSA Group, Detection rate is defined as the proportion of all patients who have prostate cancer located in the bone (osseous lesions) and are true-positives confirmed by the imaging based on local reads for the detection of metastatic disease. Detection rates will be stratified based upon the PSA group at time of imaging., 1 day
Patients will be imaged using Ga-68 labeled PSMA-11 PET to determine if there is presence of metastatic disease. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a protein expressed on prostate cancer cells that can be imaged using small molecules that target this protocol. PET imaging will begin 50-100 minutes after injection, but may be possible in certain circumstances for imaging to be delayed due to patient workflow or equipment issues

Primary Objective:

Sensitivity on a per-patient and per-region-basis (Table 1) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy, clinical and conventional imaging follow-up.
