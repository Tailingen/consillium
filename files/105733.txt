A Study of Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in Combination With Fluoropyrimidine Plus Oxaliplatin in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy of ipatasertib in combination with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (modified FOLFOX6 \[mFOLFOX6\]) chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either ipatasertib or placebo orally daily on Days 1 to 7 of each 14-day cycle in combination with mFOLFOX6 on Day 1 of each cycle.

DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Ipatasertib|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in All Randomized Participants and Participants With PTEN Loss Tumors at Primary Analysis, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression (as determined using RECIST Version 1.1 and assessed by the investigator), or death from any cause on study. Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or progression of non-target lesions. Death on study was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment regimen. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for evaluation., Screening, at the end of Cycle 4 (cycle = 14 days) and every fourth cycle thereafter until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, assessed up to approximately 1.75 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for evaluation., Baseline up to end of study (up to approximately 7.5 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on the investigator assessment using RECIST v 1.1. CR: disappearance of all target lesions and all pathological lymph nodes below 10 mm. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Screening, at the end of Cycle 4 (cycle = 14 days) and every fourth cycle thereafter until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, up to end of study (up to approximately 7.5 years)|Duration of Objective Tumor Response, Duration of objective tumor response in participants with measurable soft tissue disease at baseline was defined as the time from first observation of an objective tumor response until first observation of disease progression, as assessed by the investigator per modified RECIST Version 1.1. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or progression of non-target lesions., Screening, at the end of Cycle 4 (cycle = 14 days) and every fourth cycle thereafter until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, up to end of study (up to approximately 7.5 years)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Death on study was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment regimen., Baseline until end of study (up to approximately 7.5 years)|Serum Concentration of Ipatasertib, Day 1 at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose; Day 5, pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose
