A Study of LCAR-AIO CAR-T Cells for Treating Relapsed/Refractory Neurological Autoimmune Diseases
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, dose-exploration and expansion clinical study of LCAR-AIO in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory neurological autoimmune diseases.
Multiple Sclerosis (MS)|Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disease (NMOSD)|Anti-Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein-IgG Associated Disorders (MOGAD)|Myasthenia Gravis
BIOLOGICAL: LCAR-AIO T cells
Incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLTs are severe adverse events refers to any untoward medical occurred in a subject participated in a clinical investigation, which have a causal relationship with the treatment and will limit the dose escalation., 30 days after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) Positive Cell Concentration, Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of CAR-T positive cellular concentration., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) regimen finding, RP2D established through dose exploratory., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Transgene Levels of LCAR-AIO CAR-T Cells, Transgene Levels of LCAR-AIO CAR-T Cells using sensitive assay methods will be assessed, Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion
Annua Relapse Rate (ARR), ARR refers to the number of relapses divided by observed year after LCAR-AIO infusion., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores from baseline up to 104 weeks, The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. EDSS score ranges from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death from MS). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Changes in Visual Acuity from baseline up to 104 weeks, The Visual Acuity is determined by Snellen chart and visual field., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Changes in Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score from baseline up to 104 weeks, VAS pain score is used to evaluate pain. Line from 0 = no pain to10 = worst pain., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Changes in MSE proportion from baseline up to 104 weeks, The proportion of patients who achieve Minimal Symptom Expression (MSE, defined as reaching an MG-ADL=0\~1 or QMGS=0\~2) after LCAR-AIO infusion., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Changes in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMGS) from baseline up to 104 weeks, The QMGS is a 13-item scale used to quantify disease severity in MG. The scale measures ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb function, grading each finding, and ranges from 0 (no myasthenic findings) to 39 (maximal myasthenic deficits)., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion|Changes in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score from baseline up to 104 weeks, The MG-ADL is an eight-question survey of symptom severity. The average level of daily activity function in the last 7 days was assessed and the total score was calculated. Each question response graded from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). Cumulative MG-ADL scores range from 0 to 24., Baseline to 104 Weeks after last subject infusion
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy profiles of LCAR-AIO, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) -T cell therapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory neurological autoimmune diseases. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will receive LCAR-AIO infusion. The study will include the following sequential stages: screening, apheresis, pre-treatment (cell product preparation: lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment (LCAR AIO infusion) and follow-up.
