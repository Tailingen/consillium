Disease response was assessed per iwCLL 2008 criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis for participants with CLL and per Lugano classification for participants with SLL., From randomization to the final efficacy analysis cutoff date of 08 August 2022, median time on follow-up was 29.6 months (maximum of 45.2 months).|Rate of Partial Response With Lymphocytosis (PR-L) or Higher Assessed by the Investigator, The rate of partial response with lymphocytosis or better is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CR/CRi), nodular partial response, partial response, or partial response with lymphocytosis as assessed by the investigator.

Disease response was assessed according to the iwCLL 2008 criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis for participants with CLL and in accordance with Lugano classification for participants with SLL.

Partial response with lymphocytosis: blood lymphocytes decreased \< 50% or increased from baseline, and otherwise meeting criteria for PR., From randomization to the final efficacy analysis cutoff date of 08 August 2022, median time on follow-up was 29.6 months (maximum of 45.2 months).|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Median OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to the final efficacy analysis cutoff date of 08 August 2022, median time on follow-up was 29.6 months (maximum of 45.2 months).|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality of Life (QOL), Physical Functioning and Role Functioning Scores, The EORTC QLQ-30 contains 30 questions that incorporate 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The participant answers questions about their health during the past week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where 1 = Not at all (best) and 4 = Very Much (worst) and 2 global health quality of life (QOL) questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1 = Very poor and 7 = Excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. Higher scores in GHS and functional scales indicate better quality of life., Baseline and Weeks 24 and 48|Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Symptom Scales of Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, and Diarrhoea, The EORTC QLQ-30 contains 30 questions that incorporate 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The participant answers questions about their health during the past week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where 1 = Not at all (best) and 4 = Very Much (worst) and 2 global health quality of life (QOL) questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1 = Very poor and 7 = Excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. Lower scores in symptom scales indicate better quality of life., Baseline and Weeks 24 and 48|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life 5-dimensions 5-levels Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The EQ-5D-5L VAS measures a participant's self-rated health on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is 'the best health you can imagine' and 0 is 'the worst health you can imagine.' A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Baseline and Weeks 24 and 48|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:

* Resulted in death
* Was life-threatening
* Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
* Resulted in disability/incapacity
* Resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect
* Was considered a significant medical AE by the investigator based on medical judgment, From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose, up to the end of study data cutoff (28 February 2024); median (range) time on treatment was 41.2 (0.4-59.1) months in the zanubrutinib arm and 37.8 (0.1-60.4) months in the ibrutinib arm.
This is a global, Phase 3, randomized study of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in 652 participants with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

The primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate determined by investigator assessment. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 manner to either zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. Treatment with zanubrutinib and ibrutinib was open label.
