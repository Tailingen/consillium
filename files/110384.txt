Oxaliplatin for Children With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the pediatric neoplastic response to chemotherapy proposed and evaluate sensitivity to oxaliplatin through immunohistochemistry ERCC-1 expression analysis.
Relapsed Solid Tumor|Refractory Solid Tumor
DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Determine pediatric neoplastic response to proposed chemotherapy. Evaluate sensitivity to oxaliplatin through immunohistochemistry ERCC-1 expression analysis., Up 2 years
Define cumulative toxicity after oxaliplatin multiple cycles in this population. Evaluate relation between time exposure to the drug (number of cycles) and response (antitumor effect x response)., Determine response time and overall survival in these patients., Up 2 years
