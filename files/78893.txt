Corneal Findings in Patients Treated With Belantamab Mafodotin
In the upcoming years, more and more ophthalmologists will be confronted with patients receiving Belantamab mafodotin (Belamaf) treatment due to the promising effects on survival in multiple myeloma patients. Early, at best subclinical detection of corneal damage may contribute to the definition of the optimal dosing regimen as well as therapy interval in each patient without the need to stop this lifesaving treatment. However, until today, studies focusing on the development, morphology, and evolution of corneal epithelial changes associated with Belamaf treatment are scarce. In order to clarify the precise pathomechanism of the associated keratopathy, innovative imaging techniques such as corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) need to be used to follow patients prior to therapy and on a regular basis during treatment intervals. In specific, different regions of the cornea, including the central apex, the (mid-) periphery and the limbus need to be explored. The latter, in specific, is often claimed to play an important role in the uptake of Belamaf into the cornea, but has not been studied in any approach so far.

Likewise, there are no reports on the effects of Belamaf on corneal layers adjacent to the corneal epithelium, in specific the subepithelial nerve plexus (SNP). Changes in this layer may suggest a potential peripheral neurotoxic/neurodegenerative effect, associated with Belamaf.

Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from literature on how changes in the anterior layers of the cornea as studied with confocal microscopy in patients on Belamaf treatment differ from distinct corneal changes in these same layers in patients with other anterior corneal diseases including keratokonjunctivits sicca, epithelium basement membrane dystrophy and limbal stem cell disease.

At last, regeneration of the corneal surface after Belamaf discontinuation has been described and is expected, but detailed information on the time to corneal rehabilitation as well as confocal microscopic follow-up of epithelial and neuronal layers during this time is warranted. The purpose of this monocentric, prospective longitudinal study is to answer these specific research questions in a combined clinical approach using corneal confocal microscopy.
