Empowering Patients' Lung Cancer Screening Uptake
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality. Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) decreases mortality rate of lung cancer by 20%. Yet many patients who are eligible for lung cancer screening are still falling through the cracks which prevents patients the ability to detect lung cancer early. This study will test the effect of a a multi-level intervention on ordering LDCT within 6 months after patient enrollment. Our proposed intervention includes (1) Primary care provider notifications of patients' LCS eligibility; (2) patients' education ; (3) patients' referral to financial navigation resources; and (4) patients' reminder to discuss LCS during PCP visit.

Patient and provider experience with intervention, Patient and Providers will be asked questions about their experience with intervention components interview, At the end of all study enrollments a subgroup of patients and providers will be interviewed
