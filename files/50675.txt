Safety Study of CTA018 Injection to Treat Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease
This study will investigate the levels of CTA018 in the body over time (pharmacokinetics, PK) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), undergoing regular hemodialysis. This study will also investigate the safety and effects of different strengths of CTA018, on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.
