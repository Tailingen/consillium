A Study of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Standard Treatment in People With Lung Cancer That Has Spread to the Brain
The researchers are doing this study is to find out whether treating brain metastasis with SRS after 3 months of therapy with osimertinib is better than treating with osimertinib alone in people with NSCLC. The researchers will also look at how the study intervention impacts participants' quality of life. The researchers will measure quality of life by having participants complete questionnaires.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: osimertinib|RADIATION: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), Intracranial progression will be assessed at 3-month intervals and is defined as a ≥20% increase in sum longest distance relative to nadir for target lesions (up to a max of 5 lesions; must include at least one lesion increased in size by an absolute value of 5mm), unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, and/or the presence of new lesions, as defined by the RANO-BM working group criteria, 3 months
Time to CNS progression, defined as ≥20% increase in sum longest distance relative to nadir for target lesions (up to a max of 5 lesions; must include at least one lesion increased in size by an absolute value of 5mm), unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, and/or the presence of new lesions, as per RANO-BM (22). Death from any cause will be considered a competing risk., 9 months
Patients in both arms of this study will receive standard of care (SOC) systemic therapy which includes a backbone of an FDA-approved CNS-active TKI targeting mutant EGFR, specifically osimertinib.
