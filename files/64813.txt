Intratumoral Cisplatin for Resectable NSCLC
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral cisplatin, delivered during a single bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation, in a dose escalation protocol

DESIGN: 3+3 dose escalation.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: cis-diamminedichloroplatinum
Rate of dose limiting toxicity, Adverse events as defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Within 2 weeks of delivery
Major pathologic response, Evaluation of the tissue response to the drug, Assessed on the surgical resection specimen, performed within 30 days of bronchoscopic delivery|Blood biomarker panel, Includes serum cytokine analysis, mass cytometry for inflammatory cells, and complete blood count, Assessed from blood drawn on day of bronchoscopy and day of surgical resection|Tissue biomarker panel, Includes evaluation of cellular constituents and sequencing of cells present in tissue, Assessed from tissue obtained on day of bronchoscopy and day of surgical resection
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Even for early stage disease, the rate of recurrence following surgical resection is as high as 50%. Although neoadjuvant therapy, administered before surgery, for early stage lung cancer is associated with a survival benefit, it is rarely used due to the systemic toxicity of intravenous (IV) cytotoxic chemotherapy. IV immunotherapies are also being evaluated in combination with systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant setting. However, only a minority of patients respond to immunotherapy. One of the most common reasons for failure of immunotherapy is lack of presentation of tumor antigens to the immune system, a problem that may be potentially addressed with cytotoxic agents.

Over the last several years, case series have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of delivering cisplatin directly into lung tumors. Given the current knowledge of safety and tolerability of intratumoral cisplatin, coupled with the potential to achieve immune priming that may help address systemic micrometastases, the investigators postulate that intratumoral cisplatin will be well-tolerated, and potentially effective, neoadjuvant therapy for patients with early stage, resectable, non-small cell lung cancer.
