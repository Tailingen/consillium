Assessment of MGMT Promoter Methylation in Advanced Ewing Sarcoma Treated With Temozolomide and Irinotecan
This is a biological study in patients with advanced Ewing Sarcoma who received, according, clinical practice, temozolomide and irinotecan The O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, will be correlated with the disease clinical data and with the disease response
Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors
OTHER: MGMT methylation evaluation
Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation, Amplification the methylation-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction products will be electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and will visualized with UV light, at day 1
Correlation of the MGMT promoter methylation to the activity of the temozolomide irinotecan combination, Correlation with level of MGMT methylation with tumor response, at month 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12
This is a biological study in patients with advanced Ewing Sarcoma who received, according, clinical practice, temozolomide and irinotecan.

The MGMT methylation status will be correlated with the disease clinical data and with the disease response also in term of metabolic activity (if data will be available) The MGMT methylation analysis will be performed extracting from fresh tumor sample, the DNA on the basis of the standard protocols.
