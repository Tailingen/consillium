OHSV2-PD-L1/CD3-BsAb Administered Via Intratumoral Injection
This study will be a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation followed by the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) expansion study to characterize safety, tolerability, biodistribution, virus shedding and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral injection of BS006 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: BS006 Injection
Incidence of AE (Adverse Event) and SAE (Serious Adverse Event), Toxic reactions according to the NCI-CTCAE 5.0 grading standard that occur within 3 weeks from the first administration, are judged to be drug-related by the investigator, and meet the non-hematological toxicity and hematological toxicity conditions specified in the clinical protocol, Through study completion, an average of about 1 year(a maximum treatment duration of one year)|MTD, To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BS006, up to 1 year
ORR, Determination of the ORR is calculated based on the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR using the RECIST v1.1 and modified WHO response criteria as assessed., up to 1 year|DCR, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD., up to 1 year|Biological activity, Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor PD-L1/CD3 bispecific antibody mRNA expression in fine needle aspirate (FNA)(Only for Part 1), up to 1 year|Biodistribution, BS006 DNA copy, 3 months|Viral shedding, BS006 DNA copy, 3 months
Eligible patients are those who have measurable solid tumors as detected by CT or MRI that have persisted, recurred, or metastasized despite therapy. Patients must have histologically confirmed advanced and/or metastatic melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and other solid tumors with palpable, visible or ultrasound detectable lesions. Also, patients with solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy and for which no existing conventional therapy are eligible. Melanoma patients who were previously treated with IMLYGIC (Talimogene laherparepvec, T-Vec) but did not achieve an optimal response to T-Vec are eligible to receive BS006.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts as described below. Both parts will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period and a follow-up period (safety and long-term follow up). Treatment period of Part 1 will include an initial treatment period (3 doses of BS006) and an optional extended treatment period (repeated every 2 weeks). Subjects will be treated for up to 12 months.
