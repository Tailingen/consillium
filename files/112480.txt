Plasma Biomarker in Predicting Response and Toxicity in HCC Patients Treated With Checkpoint Inhibitors With or Without SBRT
This is a prospective study to investigate the biomarkers in predicting treatment outcome and toxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors with or without stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable|Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy
PROCEDURE: sterotatic body radiotherapy
Exosomal PD-L1 level in serum, Increase in level of exosomal PD-L1 may reflect reinvigoration of T-cell activity against cancer cells, thus predicting the treatment efficacy and toxicities in HCC patients received immunotherapy with or without SBRT, from the date of first study treatment to the date of last study treatment, an average of 3 years|Immune profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), Immune profile of pre-treatment peripheral blood is predictive of sustained responder of radio-embolization, thus predicting the treatment efficacy and toxicities in HCC patients received immunotherapy with or without SBRT, from the date of first study treatment to the date of last study treatment, an average of 3 years
Serum Cytokine profile, SBRT activates the host immune system, in particular those achieving clinical response to the combined treatment, from the date of first study treatment to the date of last study treatment, an average of 3 years
This is a prospective study to investigate the biomarkers in predicting treatment outcome and toxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors with or without stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
