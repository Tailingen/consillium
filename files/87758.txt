Metabolic Impact and Compliance of Controlled, Varying, Mediterranean Diets in Pre-Surgical Prostate Cancer Populations (PROVISIONS)
The study aims to investigate whether following a controlled Mediterranean-style diet prior to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy surgery in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer affects fasting insulin levels and other values that can be measured in blood and tissue samples from surgery.
