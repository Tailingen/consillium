Incremental Value of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Selection of Pancreatic Cancer Patients for Surgery
The aim of the study is to examine the incremental value of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to computed tomography (CT) in the diagnostic workup of pancreatic cancer patients.

The aim of the study is to examine the incremental value of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to computed tomography (CT) in the diagnostic workup of pancreatic cancer patients. We will conduct a nationwide, prospective clinical trial to examine the incremental value of using MRI for identification of liver metastases in pancreatic cancer patients.
