Study of KBA1412 in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors
The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of KBA1412, a patient derived, fully human, monoclonal antibody targeting CD9, in patients with advanced solid malignant tumors
Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancy
DRUG: KBA1412|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Part A & B & C: Frequency and severity of AEs as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Monitoring incidence and severity of Adverse Events during trial participation for each participant, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part A: Frequency and type of DLT s using the CTCAE v5.0, A DLT is defined as an adverse event that is unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and is occurring during the first 21 days of treatment. These events will be classified according to the CTCAE v5.0, First 21 days of treatment|Number of participants with an antitumor response to KBA1412 monotherapy (Part B) or to KBA1412 in combination with pembrolizumab (Part C), Response according to immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), Approximately 24 weeks
Part A: Number of participants with an antitumor response to KBA1412 monotherapy, Response according to immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), Approximately 24 weeks|Pharmacokinetic of KBA1412 monotherapy (Part A & B) and KBA1412 in combination with pembrolizumab (Part C), area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of KBA1412 will be assessed in all participants, Approximately 24 weeks|Incidence and prevalence of anti-KBA1412 antibodies for KBA1412 monotherapy (Part A & B) and KBA1412 in combination with pembrolizumab (Part C), Development of antibodies (anti-drug antibodies) to KBA1412 will be evaluated for all participants, Approximately 24 weeks|Change in biomarkers for KBA1412 monotherapy (Part A & B) and KBA1412 in combination with pembrolizumab (Part C) pre- and post-dose in tumor tissue, Change in pharmacodynamic properties of KBA1412 pre- and post-dose in immune infiltration, activation and cytotoxicity assessed by Immunohistochemistry, Approximately 24 weeks
Patient interested in participation in a clinical study will be informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a 3-week screening period to determine their eligibility for entry in the study. Patients will receive KBA1412 or KBA1412 in combination with pembrolizumab.
