This is a Phase II, open-label, multicentre study of ABSK043 administered orally in combination with Firmonertinib to patients with EGFRm+ advanced NSCLC. The study has been designed to allow an investigation of the optimal combination dose and schedule whilst ensuring the safety of patients with intensive safety monitoring. There are two main parts to this study; Part A, dose escalation and Parts B Dose expansion. The expansion part will evaluate the efficacy of ABSK043 in combination with Firmonertinib as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutated at the one or more recommended dose.

Dose escalation:

• Post-line: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with systemic treatment

Dose Expansion:

• First-Line: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation, and without prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.
