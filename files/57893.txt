dose limiting toxicity (DLT) to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The DLT is defined as treatment related grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events or abnormal lab test that occurred in the first 28 days after start of study drug., continuous monitoring for the first 28 days after start of the study medication

The PK profile includes maximum blood concentration (Cmax) and time to reach maximum blood concentration (Tmax)., day 1 and day 15 at the following timepoints: pre-drug and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours after dose|Pharmacodynamics (PD) in terms of serine-threonine kinase phosphorylation inhibition in blood before and after dose, day 1 and day 15 at the following timepoints: pre-drug, 4 and 24 hours after dose|Antitumor activity by comparing baseline and post-treatment changes. Tumor assessment will be performed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), baseline and once every two months thereafter|urinary metabolic profiling - examination of the ratio of beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol, 24 hour urine collection on day 1
