Impact of Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on Mastectomy Rates
The primary goal of this study is to determine if preoperative breast MRI findings resulted in more extensive surgery, i.e., mastectomy than breast conserving surgery, i.e., lumpectomy in early stage breast cancers at Summa Akron City Hospital. Early stage breast cancer is defined as breast tumor size less than 5 cm.

The objectives are to:

* Review early stage breast cancer patient cases treated at Summa Akron City Hospital between 2006 and 2009 to evaluate clinical and pathological staging
* Determine the results of preoperative breast MRI and the impact on type of surgery performed
* Evaluate the decision to have mastectomy rather than lumpectomy, i.e., physician or patient decision and if this decision was based on breast MRI findings
Early Stage Breast Cancer
The primary goal of this study is to determine if preoperative breast MRI findings resulted in more extensive surgery than breast conserving surgery in early stage breast cancers at Summa Akron City Hospital., Review early stage breast cancer patient cases treated at Summa Akron City Hospital between 2006 and 2009 to evaluate clinical and pathological staging

Determine the results of preoperative breast MRI and the impact on type of surgery performed

Correlate the breast MRI findings with the final pathology results to determine if the breast MRI clinically upstaged the cancer., from 2006-2009
Correlate the breast MRI findings with the final pathology results to determine if the breast MRI clinically upstaged the cancer, 2006-2009
Early stage breast cancer cases between 2006 and 2009 will be identified by the Summa Akron City Hospital cancer registry. The cases will be reviewed and abstracted. The abstracted data will include results of physical breast examinations, mammograms, sonograms, breast MRI reports, biopsy procedure notes and pathology reports to illustrate the clinical stage. Definitive surgical pathology reports will be included in the abstracted data to demonstrate the final pathologic stage of the breast cancer.

A database will be developed to capture the abstracted data. Outcomes will be determined based on final pathology reports.
