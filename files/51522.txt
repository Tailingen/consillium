Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Weekly Intravenous (IV) Doses of BMS-906024 in Subjects With Acute T-cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia or T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of BMS-906024, either alone or in combination with Dexamethasone in subjects with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma who no longer respond to or have relapsed from standard therapies
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute T-cell|Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
DRUG: BMS-906024|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Weekly assessments until study discontinuation due to disease progression or unacceptable adverse events as well as an assessment 30 days after treatment discontinuation with an average time on study expected to be < 1 year.
Disease assessments in bone marrow & by computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Disease assessments at least every 8 weeks during treatment|Pharmacokinetics of BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557: maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics at multiple time points during the first 4 weeks of dosing|Pharmacokinetics of BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557: minimum observed concentration (Cmin), Pharmacokinetics at multiple time points during the first 4 weeks of dosing|Pharmacokinetics of BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557: area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Pharmacokinetics at multiple time points during the first 4 weeks of dosing|Pharmacokinetics of BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557: time to reach maximum observed concentration (Tmax), Pharmacokinetics at multiple time points during the first 4 weeks of dosing|Pharmacokinetics of BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557: terminal phase elimination half-life (T-Half), Pharmacokinetics at multiple time points during the first 4 weeks of dosing|Pharmacokinetics of BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557: accumulation index (ratio of AUC at steady state to AUC after first dose), Pharmacokinetics at multiple time points during the first 4 weeks of dosing|Pharmacodynamics (percent change from baseline in mRNA expression of Notch pathway-related genes in blood cells), Pharmacodynamic sampling: in blood during the first 8 weeks of dosing
