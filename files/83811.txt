The Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Colorectal Cancer Prevention Due to Delays in Diagnosis: a Global Study
Screening programs have been associated with a substantial reduction in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality through endoscopic resection of preneoplastic lesions and detection of early-stage invasive cancers.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared as a pandemic the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 have never stopped spreading, causing an unprecedented situation with highly restrictive considerations to be adopted by the majority of countries worldwide.

Health-care facilities have been making an enormous effort to assist patients affected by COVID-19, while adopting measures to maintain a safe environment for patients and healthcare professionals. As a result, the usual workflow in endoscopy departments changed dramatically, leading to an increase in cancelled procedures, probably increasing the future burden of Colorectal Cancer due to delays in diagnosis.
