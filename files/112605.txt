Comparison of Contrast Agents for MRI Perfusion Analysis in Brain Tumor Patients
This study will compare the use of two contrast agents to analyze blood flow characteristics of brain tumors.
Central Nervous System Neoplasms
Degree of contrast induced signal changes with dynamic imaging of brain tumors, Two contrast agents will be administered in different MRI imaging sessions. Will measure how the appearance of brain tumors change during dynamic first pass contrast administration., 2 weeks
Calculate differences in cerebral blood volume, ktrans and flow in brain tumors, Calculations will be made of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow or ktrans in brain tumors when different contrast agents are administered. These parameters reflect vasculature and angiogenesis in tumors., 2 weeks
This study will compare contrast agents, gadobenate dimeglumine and gadobutrol, for MRI perfusion analysis in brain tumor patients.
