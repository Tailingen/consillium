A Long Term Follow-Up Study for Subjects Who Have Received Q-Cells
This study is an observational study designed to obtain information on the long-term safety, tolerability, and continued activity of Q-Cells®. The study will follow the participants who previously received Q-Cells® for 10 years.

The goal of this observational study is to learn about the long term effects of Q-Cells® in people with transverse myelitis.

The main objectives the study is to evaluate the safety of patients who have received Q-Cells®.

The secondary goal of the study is to get data about the long-term activity of Q-Cells® over a period of 10 years.

Patients will complete exams, lab tests, imaging, and questionnaires to monitor their safety.
Transverse Myelitis

ECG findings that are determined to be potentially clinically significant will be summarized., through study completion, an average of 10 years (Baseline, 10 years)|Safety Endpoints: Clinical Laboratory assessments: chemistry, Descriptive statistics for raw values as well as change from baseline (entry into this protocol No. QLTFU-101) by original treatment group will be presented for each visit. The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically significant laboratory results will be tabulated by original treatment cohort and overall., through study completion, an average of 10 years|Safety Endpoints: Clinical Laboratory assessments: hematology, Descriptive statistics for raw values as well as change from baseline (entry into this protocol No. QLTFU-101) by original treatment group will be presented for each visit. The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically significant laboratory results will be tabulated by original treatment cohort and overall., through study completion, an average of 10 years
Exploratory Endpoints: Visual Analog pain Scale (VAS), Changes in pain will be assessed using VAS, a self-assessment where patients rank their current pain from 0-10.

Analysis of activities is considered exploratory and observational data from each patient will be recorded due to sample size.

Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values) and change from baseline will be summarized overall and by original treatment cohort and visit., through study completion, an average of 10 years|Neurological change: American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale, Neurological changes in muscle strength and sensation via the ASIA exam.

ASIA exam yields overall scores ranked alphabetically A through E where A is the most impaired and E is normal.

Analysis of activities is considered exploratory and observational data from each patient will be recorded due to sample size.

Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values) and change from baseline will be summarized overall and by original treatment cohort and visit., through study completion, an average of 10 years|Neurological change: National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Quality of Life Questionnaire: Lower Extremity Function (mobility), NIH PROMIS scale for Lower Extremity Function is a self-assessment where patients score their lower extremity function. Higher scores in this scale are related to better outcomes.

Minimum value: 95 Maximum value: 19

Analysis of activities is considered exploratory and observational data from each patient will be recorded due to sample size.

Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values) and change from baseline will be summarized overall and by original treatment cohort and visit., through study completion, an average of 10 years|Neurological change: National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Quality of Life Questionnaire: Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS), NIH PROMIS scale for NBSS is a self-assessment where patients score their bladder symptoms. Lower scores in this scale are related to better outcomes.
