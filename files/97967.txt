Tens and Rocabado Exercises on TMJ Dysfunction
72 patients who suffers from limited mouth opening and pain in the temporomandibular joint will be selected from oncology department in Zagazig and Cairo university hospitals: patients will be assigned randomly into three groups equal in number, 24 in each group: (group A) will receive Rocabado exercises plus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and traditional exercises .(group B) will receive Rocabado exercises and traditional exercises.(groub C) will receive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and traditional exercises.

. Vernier caliper:, The vernier, dial, and digital calipers give a direct reading of the distance measured with high accuracy . Vernier calipers commonly used in industry provide a precision to 0.01 mm (10 micrometres), or one thousandth of an inch. They are available in sizes that can measure up to 1,829 mm (72 in) (Agrawal et al., 2015)., 8 weeks|Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire:, The Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire is used to assess the limitation of oral function due to mandibular function impairment. Subjects will compelete this self-reported questionnaire that comprise 17 items encompassing the difficulty of chewing hard and soft foods, taking large bites, laughing, eating certain foods, engaging in social activity, and speaking. The items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The overall score is calculated by dividing the sum of the item scores by 68, with a possible range of 0 to 1. A higher score denotes a more serious functional impairment. An overall score of ≤0.3 denotes a low degree, 0.3 ≤ 0.6 denotes a moderate degree, and \>0.6 denotes a high degree of functional impairment( Stegenga et al.,1993)., 8 weeks
Visual Analogue Scale:, The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points, zero mean no pain and 10 mean sever pain (Reips and Funke,2008)., 8 weeks
Patients at group A: patients will receive Rocabado exercises plus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and traditional exercises For 8 weeks : Rocabado exercises form of 2 parts , 6×6×6 exercises and mobilization exercises part (1): 6×6×6 exercises are (1).The rest position of the tongue , (2). Shoulder retraction exercises, (3). Stabilized head flexion ,( 4). The axial extension of the neck , (5).Control of TMJ rotation , (6).Rhythmic stabilization technique .these 6 exercises are repeated 6 times a day for 20 minutes for each repetition.

part (2): Joint mobilization (non-thrust manipulation) includes Distraction, Distraction given with anterior glide, Distraction given with anterior and lateral glide right/left \& Lateral glide without distraction. . These mobilization exercises is done by the therapist 3 times a week for 20 min ,each mobilization is performed for 10-15 times and repeated for 5-6 times.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device(TENS):

TENS is used, with a maximum frequency of 120 Hz and an intensity range of 0 to 99.5 mA and the pulse width is between 50-200 microseconds.

TENS electrodes (diameter 35-52 mm) are placed bilaterally on mandibular elevator muscles, on the superficial masseter muscle above the gonial angle, and bilaterally on the upper back (Cacho et al.,2022).

The TENS will be applied for 20 min 2 sessions/week for 8 weeks.

Traditional exercises are passive , active Rom exercises and massage, these exercises are performed for 30 minutes and repeated 2 times daily.

1. Passive ROM exercises are done by stacked tongue depressors and number of tongue depressors are increased when improvement occur .
2. Active Rom exercises are mouth opening and closing ,side way movement and protrusion repeated for 10-15 times with holding for 5 seconds for each position.
3. Massaging for cheeks muscles for 2minutes .
