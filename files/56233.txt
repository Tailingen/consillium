PROpel is a phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone to patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have not received prior chemotherapy or new hormonal agents (NHAs) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (first-line setting).

Approximately 720 patients globally were planned to be randomized in PROpel in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either olaparib and abiraterone or placebo and abiraterone. Enrolment had completed with a total of 796 patients randomised. Following the completion of global enrolment, the China cohort will randomise approximately 108 additional patients at sites in China, also in a 1:1 ratio.

This cohort will enable standalone safety and efficacy analyses to support Chinese regulatory requirements. Patients from China will not be included in the Full Analysis Set for the global study analysis. In addition, all of the statistical analyses defined in this SAP will be performed using all patients randomised at sites in Asian countries (South Korea and Japan) excluding China, to be designated the Asian subgroup analysis.

Patients will receive oral treatment with olaparib 300 mg twice daily + abiraterone 1000 mg once daily or placebo twice daily + abiraterone 1000 mg once daily. Patients in both treatment groups will also receive either prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily.
