Study of Exercise to Manage Distress During Breast Screening
The breast cancer screening and diagnostic period is associated with heightened symptoms of anxiety and depression. Physical exercise has been found to effectively decrease these symptoms in healthy and diseased populations. This study aims to determine if a pre treatment exercise intervention can minimize symptoms of anxiety and depression in women undergoing screening for breast cancer.

BEHAVIORAL: Moderate intensity exercise training|BEHAVIORAL: Self Management of exercise
Symptoms of anxiety will be assessed using patient reported anxiety inventory, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Form (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, \& Lushene, 1970)., Change in baseline (within 1 week of breast biopsy) at Week 3 and at Week 6
Symptoms of subclinical depression will be assessed using a patient reported inventory, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977)., Within 1 week of breast biopsy, Week 3, Week 6|Exercise behaviour will be assessed using a patient reported inventory, Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin \& Shephard, 1985), Within 1 week of breast biopsy, Week 3, Week 6|Body composition: Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry scan (GE Lunar iDXA), Baseline (within 1 week of breast biopsy), Week 6|Self Efficacy: patient reported inventory assessing efficacy for self management of exercise, 1 week post breast biopsy, Week 3, Week 6|Optimism: patient reported inventory assessing dispositional optimism, Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R; Scheier, Carver, \& Bridges, 1994)., Baseline (within 1 week of core breast biopsy)|Symptoms of dispositional anxiety will be assessed using patient reported anxiety inventory, STAI - Trait Form, Within 1 week of breast biopsy
The breast cancer diagnostic process is associated with anxiety and depression. Physical exercise has emerged as an attractive non-pharmacologic approach to mitigating the psychological and physical sequelae of breast cancer and its treatments, however pre treatment interventions are not integrated into current practice. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a pre treatment exercise intervention in attenuating levels of anxiety and depression following breast biopsy and throughout the diagnostic period.
