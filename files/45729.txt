Pharmacoscopy for Patients with Refractory Primary Brain Tumors
Advanced technology of ex vivo drug profiling referred to as pharmacoscopy may allow to identify novel drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma and other refractory brain tumors at an individual patient level. This personalized therapeutic approach was developed and validated in pre-clinical glioma models. With the current research proposal, we seek to establish feasibility for a clinical interventional trial for patients with refractory primary brain tumors that is based on pharmacoscopy-guided selection of treatment.

DEVICE: Pharmacoscopy 1.0
To demonstrate the overall feasibility of pharmacoscopy-guided treatment for patients with refractory primary brain tumors, The feasibility is defined as:

80% success rate of generating a pharmacoscopy result within 10 days of surgery (32/40 patients), 50% success rate of placing patients on selected drug based on pharmacoscopy (16/32 patients)., 2 months
