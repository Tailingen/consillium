A Phase II Study by Using CICS-1 and SPM-011 Commissioned by CICS and STELLA PHARMA
The purpose of the study is to investigate efficacy and safety Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) by using CICS-1 accelerator-based neutron capture therapy device with lithium targets developed by CICS, and the SPM-011 boron compound for use in BNCT developed by STELLA PHARMA in the treatment of unresectable angiosarcoma.
Unresectable Angiosarcoma
RADIATION: BNCT
Response rate as assessed by the Independent Review Facility (IRF) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Percentage of patients with response (CR or PR) for target lesions within 90 days after BNCT, Baseline until Day90
