Multicentric Comparative Prospective Study of the Benefits and Risks of Biopsy Prostate Using Transrectal or Transperineal Procedure for the Prostate Cancer Diagnostic
The performance of prostatic biopsies is an essential element to confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer and to specify the characteristics of the tumor in terms of stage and grade.

The first route of prostatic biopsies is mainly transrectal with passage of a needle introduced into the guide fixed on the endorectal ultrasound probe. There is another possible access route, transperineal, with prostatic puncture by a needle introduced transcutaneously, guided by an endorectal ultrasound image. The first transperineal route would offer the first benefit for the patient, to reduce the infectious risk inherent in the endorectal way. It would also reduce the risk of rectal bleeding.

In addition, the transperineal pathway appears to be able to improve the detection threshold of prostatic tumours located on the anterior part of the gland due to the angle of penetration of the needle and its more anterior positioning relative to the prostate.

There is currently no randomized comparison study of the transperineal versus transrectal procedure on infectious risk. The aim of the project is to enable this comparative study, within our institution where experienced urologist surgeons practice.
Patients With Suspected Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Comparison of the rate of occurrence of biopsy-induced infection in both groups, Biopsy-induced infection are defined as :

* Positive post-biopsy urinary test result
* Clinical infection syndrome (T\>37.5Â°C fever)
* Signs of urogenital infection (cystitis/prostatitis/orchi-epididymitis)
* Hospitalization for hyperpyrexia
* Septic shock, 30 days after intervention
Comparison of the rate of rectal bleeding in both groups, 30 days after intervention|Comparison of the rate of urethral bleeding (hematuria and urethrorrhagia) in both groups, 30 days after intervention|Comparison of the percentage of negative biopsies in both groups, 30 days after intervention|Comparison of the percentage of positive biopsies on on anterior areas in both groups, 30 days after intervention|Comparison of the Percentage of underestimation of the stage of tumor development in both groups, Confrontation with the MRI result and the resected specimen of the radical prostatectomy, 3 months after intervention|Assess the pain (tolerance) felt by the patient according to the biopsy method used, EVA pain scale at J0, 1 day|Comparison of the Room occupancy time in both groups, 1 day|Comparison of the Procedure Time in both groups, Procedure time = Endorectal Ultrasound Probe Introduction Time - Probe Removal Time, 1 day|Comparison of the Average Length of Stay in both groups, 1 day
