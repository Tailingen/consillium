Reducing High Risk Primary Tumor Clinical Target Volumes (CTVp1) in Non-metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
To evaluate the long-term local control, survival rate, acute and late radiation related toxicities, quality of life after reducing high risk primary tumor clinical target volumes (CTVp1) in non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with IMRT.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy
RADIATION: Reduction CTVp1|RADIATION: Non-reduction CTVp1
Local Relapse-free Survival(LRFS), the time from randomization to documented local recurrence or death from any cause, 3 years|Incidence of hearing impairment worse than graded 2, audiometry and symptoms graded according to the CTCAE (version 5.0)., 3 years
Overall survival (OS), the time from randomization to documented death from any cause, 3 years|Regional Relapse-free Survival(RRFS), the time from randomization to documented regional recurrence or death from any cause, 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), calculated from randomization to documented distant metastasis or death, 3 years|Acute toxicities, Occur within 3 months after IMRT according Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0, 3 months|Late toxicities, 3 months after completion of radiotherapy graded according to both the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and the CTCAE (version 5.0), 3 years|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-H&N35), Patient reported quality-of-life data and higher scores indicated more severe symptoms, 3 years|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Patient reported quality-of-life data and higher scores indicated more severe symptoms, 3 years|radiation-induced otitis media with effusion (OME), Evaluated by tympanometry, 3 years|V60Gy, Volume that received at least 60Gy, 3 years
This phase 3, multicenter,randomized controlled clinical trial recruits patients with newly-diagnosed non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with IMRT. The intervention is delineating high risk primary tumor clinical target volumes (CTVp1) as GTV+5mm or GTV+5mm+whole nasopharynx. The objective is to compare the long-term local control, survival rate, acute and late radiation related toxicities between the two groups.
