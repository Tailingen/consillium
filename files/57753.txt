Predicting Tumor Origin Based on Deep Learning of Lymph Node Puncture Cytology
In this study, the investigators aimed to construct a deep learning diagnostic model that uses cytological images to predict primary unknown tumor origins in patients with tumors combined with lymph node metastases. After the model is constructed, the model will be validated by a large-scale test set to test the model performance. The investigators also propose to compare the performance of the constructed model in diagnosing cytology smears compared to human pathologists.
