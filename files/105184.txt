A Study of MSB0254 Injection in Advanced Solid Tumors
This study was an open, multi-dose dose escalation phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics of MSB0254 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, and to preliminarily measure its anti-tumor efficacy.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: MSB0254 Injection
Safety and tolerability of MSB0254, Measured by number adverse events that are related to treatment, Up to 90 days following the last dose|Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) or recommended phase2 dose（RP2D）, Measured by number of subjects experiencing DLT in each escalation cohort, Up to 90 days following the last dose
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for MSB0254, Changes in AUC over time in subjects with MSB0254, Up to 30 days following the last dose|Peak Plasma concentration (Cmax)for MSB0254, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration, Up to 30 days following the last dose|Time to the Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Tmax is the time in hours/days to reach Cmax following dosing, Up to 30 days following the last dose|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), The time required for the plasma level of the study drug to decrease by one-half during the terminal elimination phase, Up to 30 days following the last dose|The immunogenicity of MSB0254 injection, The immunogenicity of MSB0254 injection was evaluated by testing the production of anti-drug antibody (ADA)., Up to 30 days following the last dose|Objective response rate (ORR) as measured by RESISTv1.1, Objective response rate (ORR) as measured by RESISTv1.1, Up to 90 days following the last dose|Duration of response (DOR) as measured by RESISTv1.1, Duration of response (DOR) as measured by RESISTv1.1, Up to 90 days following the last dose|Progression-free survival (PFS) as measured by RESISTv1.1, Progression-free survival (PFS) as measured by RESISTv1.1, Up to 90 days following the last dose
