A Study of Revumenib in R/R Leukemias Including Those With an MLL/KMT2A Gene Rearrangement or NPM1 Mutation
Phase 1 dose escalation will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of revumenib in participants with acute leukemia.

In Phase 2, participants will be enrolled in 3 indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine the efficacy, short- and long-term safety, and tolerability of revumenib.

Phase 1: Oral revumenib; sequential cohorts of escalating dose levels of revumenib to identify the MTD and RP2D. Participants will be enrolled in one of six dose-escalation arms:

Arm A: Participants not receiving any strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor/inducers or fluconazole.

Arm B: Participants receiving itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, or voriconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitors) for antifungal prophylaxis.

Arm C: Participants receiving revumenib and cobicistat.

Arm D: Participants receiving fluconazole (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) for antifungal prophylaxis.

Arm E: Participants not receiving any weak, moderate, or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.

Arm F: Participants receiving isavuconazole (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) for antifungal prophylaxis.

In Phase 2, participants will be enrolled in 3 indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine the efficacy, short- and long-term safety, and tolerability of revumenib:

* Cohort 2A: Participants with KMT2Ar acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)
* Cohort 2B: Participants with KMT2A AML
* Cohort 2C: Participants with NPM1m AML
