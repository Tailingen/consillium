A Multicenter Trial On The Utility and Impact Of Computed Tomography and Serum CA-125 In the Management of Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of the research is to determine if blood tests and a CT scan done before surgery can predict how successful the surgery will be. In patients who have cancer of the ovary that has spread, it is hoped that the CT scan will be able to identify the various places where the cancer has spread so that additional surgeons can be available to help with the surgical procedure.

If you have confirmed stage 3 or 4 ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, you may undergo a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis after the surgery to compare how much cancer the surgeon thought was left after surgery to what is seen on CT scan. A CT scan of the chest will be done if your physician thinks it is necessary.
