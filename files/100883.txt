First in Human Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of a Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Netrin 1 in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
For most advanced solid tumors, current therapy is inadequate at improving quality of life, slowing progression of disease, prolonging survival, and providing a cure. Hence, there is a continuous need for innovative, safer and more effective anti-cancer therapies. Our study is based on the dependence receptor paradigm and the associated therapeutic strategy. In preclinical models, preventing Netrin-1 interaction with its receptors is sufficient to trigger Netrin-1-expressing tumor cell death in vitro as well as tumor growth and metastasis inhibition in vivo. This indicates that a therapeutic approach based on Netrin-1/Netrin-1 receptors interaction inhibition is both feasible and promising. NP137 is a "first-in-class" humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Netrin-1 ligand, a secreted protein recently described as a driver of tumor initiation and progression. NP137 demonstrated anti-tumor activity as a single agent in several pre-clinical models of cancer, including breast and lung cancer. Taken together, several studies strongly support the rational for preclinical development and clinical evaluation of a highly potent and selective anti-Netrin-1 antibody in cancer patients. The proposed study is an open label, multicenter, Phase I dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of NP137 administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) as single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This trial will be the First in Human (FIH) study for NP137; there is no clinical experience with this antibody in the clinic. The study consists of 3 parts:

Part 1) a dose escalation part to define the Maximum tolerated dose and the Recommended Phase II dose (MTD /RP2D) of NP137 as well as to research some PD biomarkers (Biological collection cohorts) - This part is now completed with Last Patient In on December 20th 2018 - Part 2) an expansion part#1 to investigate NP137 clinical activity as a single agent by collecting the 3-month objective response rate (ORR3m).

Part 3) an expansion part#2 to investigate NP137 clinical activity as a single agent by collecting the 3-month objective response rate (ORR3m) in RH+ patients with endometrial carcinoma.

DRUG: NP137 DL and RP2D
Part 1 (dose escalation part): DLT occurrence, Dose Limiting toxicities (DLTs) are any pre-defined toxicities graded by using NCI-CTCAE v4.0 occurring during the DLT period (i.e . 28 days) and assessed as related to study drug and any other study drug related toxicity considered significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the opinion of the investigators after discussion with the sponsor. Indeed, as a principle in this first in Man study, any toxicity that the investigator or the sponsor determines to be dose-limiting, regardless of the grade, may be considered as a DLT., At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 14 days)|Part 2 (expansion part #1): Objective response rate after 3 months, Objective response rate after 3 months (ORR3m) is defined as the rate of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after 3 months of treatment (measurements according to RECIST 1.1 criteria)., 12 weeks of treatment (=3 months)|Part 3 (expansion part #2): Objective response rate after 3 months in RH+ patients with endometrial carcinoma, Objective response rate after 3 months (ORR3m) is defined as the rate of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after 3 months of treatment (measurements according to RECIST 1.1 criteria)., 12 weeks of treatment (=3 months)

The dose escalation part (NP137 administered as a single agent by intravenous injection with 7 ascending dose levels) has been initiated with an accelerated dose titration with 1 patient per DL until the occurrence of a â‰¥ Grade 2 drug-related AE. Following the occurrence of such moderate toxicity, patients have been enrolled in a slower dose escalation design with at least 3 patients per DL using a Modified Continual Reassessment Method. Of note, in case no toxicity occurs up to the DL4, the classical 3+3 design has been initiated. Cohorts of patients with biopsable disease have been added in order to assess the impact of NP137 treatment on epithelial phenotype signature (assessed by RNAseq and subsequent bioinformatic profiling using published E vs M score). Up to 4 additional and independent cohorts of patients (n= up to 6 pts/ cohort) with biopsable disease have been enrolled. Starting from DL4, the enrolment in such cohort will be allowed at highest DL that has cleared its DLT assessment window. Such cohorts will allow to collect pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies in order to identify PD biomarkers correlated to NP137 clinical activity.

In expansion parts, patients are treated at the RP2D defined in Part 1 (14 mg/kg).

In both parts, NP137 will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent or patient willingness to stop the treatment.
