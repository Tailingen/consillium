A Study of Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab Versus Active Surveillance as Adjuvant Therapy in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma at High Risk of Recurrence After Surgical Resection or Ablation
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with active surveillance in participants with completely resected or ablated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are at high risk for disease recurrence.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), as Determined by IRF, RFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic HCC as determined by an IRF, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., Baseline up to approximately 33 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Baseline up to approximately 91 months|RFS as Determined by the Investigator, RFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic HCC as determined by an investigator, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., Baseline up to approximately 91 months|Time to Recurrence (TTR), TTR defined as the time from randomization to first documented occurrence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic HCC, as determined by the investigator and by an IRF., Baseline up to approximately 91 months|RFS Rate at 24 and 36 Months, as Assessed by the IRF, Randomization up to 24 months and up to 36 months|RFS Rate at 24 and 36 Months, as Assessed by the Investigator, Randomization up to 24 months and up to 36 months|OS Rate at 24 and 36 Months, OS rate defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced death from any cause at 24 and 36 months after randomization., Baseline to 24 and 36 months|Time to Extrahepatic Spread (EHS) or Macrovascular Invasion, Time to EHS or macrovascular invasion after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to the first appearance of EHS or macrovascular invasion, as determined by the investigator., Baseline up to approximately 91 months|RFS in Pd-L1-High Subgroup, RFS after randomization as determined by the investigator and by an IRF, among patients in the PD-L1-high subgroup., Baseline up to approximately 91 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Baseline up to approximately 91 months|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, Serum concentration of atezolizumab., Prior to any drug administration on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16, and 30 minutes after end of atezolizumab infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Atezolizumab, Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies to atezolizumab., Prior to any drug administration up to approximately 33 month
