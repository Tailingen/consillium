Medico-economic Evaluation Comparing the Use of Ultrasonic Scissors to the Conventional Techniques of Haemostasis in Thyroid Surgery by Cervicotomy
The aim of our study is to evaluate the ultrasonic scissors (Harmonic Focus Ethicon Endo-Surgery Laboratory) as a device of hemostasis in thyroid surgery (total thyroidectomy) by cervicotomy, and to show a decrease in transient hypoparathyroidism compared to conventional techniques of haemostasis (clips, ligatures, and bipolar coagulation). Secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of (i) recurrent nerve morbidity, (ii) postoperative bleeding, (iii) postoperative pain, (iv) cost of both techniques (microcosting), (v) the overall cost of the techniques at six months, (vi) a linking of costs and medical outcomes and (vii) an estimation of the potential impact of new technology on the organization of operating rooms (operating time).
