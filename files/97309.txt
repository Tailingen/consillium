Endometrial Cancer and Robotic-assisted Versus Traditional Laparoscopy
The aim of this study is to compare the robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery to the traditional laparoscopic surgery in endometrial cancer patients.

The study is prospective and the patients are randomised into two groups of 50 patients each. Randomisation is done with Minim-programme and patients age and Body mass index are taken into account.

The primary endpoint is the operation time. The number of patients in this study is based on the non-inferiority design. Presumption is that the operation time in robotic-assisted laparoscopy will be 25% longer.

Secondary endpoints include:

1. bleeding
2. complications
3. conversions
4. number of pelvic lymph nodes
