Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy in NSCLC With Targetable Genetic Alterations After Progression on Targeted Agents
Investigators hypothesize that addition of pembrolizumab will enhance the efficacy of carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC, or patients with other genetic alterations, and who have disease progression following appropriate targeted therapies.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
The Percentage of Patients That Respond to Treatment, The primary endpoint is Response Rate (RR) defined as the rate of complete and partial response. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10mm short axis). Partial Response (PR): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) but does not qualify for PD. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., 5.5 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS is defined as the duration of time from registration to time of progression. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., 5.5 years|Overall Survival (OS) Time, Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to time of death. If the patient is lost to follow-up, survival will be censored on the last date the patient was known to be alive., 5.5 years
