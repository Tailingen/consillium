Hormonal dietary intake, Daily dietary intake questionnaire was used to evaluate.Weekly intake of milk tea, coffee, beverage, etc, Within the past 1 year|Comparison of daily living habits, Sleep, exercise, and other basic information were assessed based on a daily habits questionnaire., Within the past 1 year
The incidence of endometrial polyps is closely related to daily diet and living habits. Due to the excessive use of food additives, the content of some common dietary hormones exceeds the standard, causing irreversible effects on female growth and development.

The daily diet structure is closely related to women's health, and the enrichment of estrogen in common drinks may cause adverse effects such as premature puberty in women, abnormal thyroid function, and changes in uterine structure. Therefore, the researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with endometrial polyps and normal women to compare the associations and differences between daily diet and disease.
