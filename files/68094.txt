Parenteral Nutrition for Patients Treated for Locally Advanced Inoperable Tumors of the Head and Neck
Prevention of critical weight loss. In patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) weight loss is a relevant clinical problem during radiotherapy and might result in higher treatment related toxicity and discontinuation of a potential curative treatment. Thus the investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of overnight parenteral nutritional (PN) support in patients with SCCHN treated with curative radiotherapy (RTX) in combination with Cetuximab (E) or Cisplatin (P).

Loss of body weight by more than 5% at the end of radiotherapy, Weekly body weight assessments - standardized method for all study sites, Difference between baseline and week 8 (after end of RTX)
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA): reduction of phase angle by > 10% during treatment/observation, Determination of parameters on functional nutritional status: fat-free mass (FFM), total body water (TBW), body fat and phase angle will be evaluated by BIA, Prior to and 1 year after start of RTX, within 7 days and 3 months after end of RTX
Assessment of physical strength, Handgrip strength measurement, mean value of three consecutive measurements, Prior to RTX, weekly during RTX, within 1 week and 3 months after end of RTX|Number of implanted PEG tubes, The number of implanted PEG tubes will be recorded, From start of RTX until 3 months after end of RTX|Acute toxicity during radiotherapy, Acute toxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.0.), During 7 weeks of radiotherapy, at end of radiotherapy and 3 months after radiotherapy|Chronic toxicity after treatment, Chronic toxicity evaluated according to RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group)/EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) - Toxicity Criteria, 3 months after end of radiotherapy|Dose and dose intensity of radiotherapy, Dose and dose intensity including delay of scheduled therapy and absolute dose of radiotherapy applied., At start and end of radiotherapy (duration of radiotherapy 7 weeks)|Progression-free (PFS), The study will be finished one year post RTX and clinical al data on PFS will be obtained. In addition, patient will be asked to agree to collection of information regarding PFS even after completion of the trial., From start until 3 months after end of RTX|Overall survival (OS), The study will be finished one year post RTX and clinical data on OS will be obtained. In addition, patient will be asked to agree to collection of information regarding OS even after completion of the trial., From start until 3 months after end of RTX
The investigators hypothesize that about 60% of patients receiving RTX without supplemental PN will suffer from critical weight loss of more than 5% during treatment - supplemental overnight PN might result in significant improvement of the nutritional status .
