T Cells in Predicting Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors predict whether patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant will develop acute graft-versus-host disease.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying T cells to see how well they help in predicting acute graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

Percentage of regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) at engraftment, percentage of Treg subsets present in patient's blood before they undergo stem cell transplant, day of stem cell transplant
Association between Treg subsets and acute graft-vs.-host disease outcomes, Identify gut homing and skin homing Treg lymphocyte subsets and compare and contrast them to determine links between the Treg subsets and gut and/or skin acute graft-vs.-host-disease incidence, stage/grade, target organ involvement, and responsiveness to therapy., at stem cell transplant and at day 28
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the association between regulatory T-lymphocyte (Treg) subsets present at engraftment and at day 28 with the incidence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
* To identify gut-homing and skin-homing Treg subsets and determine their role during engraftment and at day 28 as a predictor of gut and skin aGVHD, respectively.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection at the time of neutrophil engraftment prior to stem cell transplant (SCT) and post-SCT on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Blood samples are analyzed for T-cell subsets and for the percentage of regulatory T-lymphocyte (Treg) or other T-cell subsets expressing specific homing receptors for the gut or skin via flow cytometry.

Patients' medical records are also reviewed periodically.
