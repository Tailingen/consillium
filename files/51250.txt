A Study of Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in Native Chinese Participants With Advanced and/or Metastatic Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of the study drug known as abemaciclib in native Chinese participants with advanced and/or metastatic cancers.
Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Abemaciclib
Number of Participants With One or More Drug Related Adverse Events, Number of participants with one or more drug related adverse events. Clinically significant events were defined as serious adverse events, regardless of causality. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Baseline through End of Study (Up to 10 Months)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Abemaciclib and Its Metabolites Single Dose, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Abemaciclib and its Metabolites following a single oral dose., Cycle 1, Day(D)1; Predose, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48 Hours Postdose|PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Abemaciclib and Its Metabolites (Twice Daily Dosing), PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Abemaciclib and its Metabolites following a twice daily dosing., Cycle 1, Day(D) 31; Predose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 Hours Postdose|PK: Area Under Concentration Time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to 12 Hours (AUC [0-12]) of Abemaciclib and Its Metabolites Single Dose, PK: Area Under Concentration Time Curve (AUC) from Time Zero to 12 hours (AUC \[0-12\]) of Abemaciclib and its Metabolites following a single oral dose., Cycle 1, Day(D)1; Predose, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48 Hours Postdose|PK: AUC From Time Zero to 12 Hours (AUC [0-12]) of Abemaciclib and Its Metabolites (Twice Daily Dosing), PK: AUC from Time Zero to 12 hours (AUC \[0-12\]) of Abemaciclib and its Metabolites following twice daily dosing, Cycle 1, Day(D) 31; Predose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 Hours Postdose|PK: AUC From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of Abemaciclib and Its Metabolites Single Dose, PK: AUC from Time Zero to Infinity (AUC\[0-inf\]) of Abemaciclib and its Metabolites following a single oral dose., Cycle 1, Day(D)1; Predose, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48 Hours Postdose|Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), ORR was defined as the percentage of randomized participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria. Participants with unevaluable or unknown response status are considered nonresponders. Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Partial response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) and the 20% increase must be at least one lesion must increase by an absolute value of â‰¥5 mm to be considered progression., Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease (Up to 13 Months )
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of the study drug known as abemaciclib in native Chinese participants with advanced and/or metastatic cancers.
