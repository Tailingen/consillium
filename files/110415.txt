Role of Semaglutide in Restoring Ovulation in Youth and Adults With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Girls and women 12-35 years old with obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome who are on or off metformin, will receive a glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist intervention for 10 months to induce metabolic changes, weight loss and improve reproductive abnormalities.
PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) of Bilateral Ovaries|Obese
DRUG: Semaglutide Injectable Product (Wegovy and/or Ozempic)
Change in ovulation frequency before and after semaglutide in females with PCOS, The change in ovulation will be measured at baseline and 6-10 months post treatment with semaglutide from 4 months daily urinary progesterone metabolites, 14 months
Change in Whole Body Insulin Sensitivity, Participants will undergo a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test, and whole body insulin sensitivity will be expressed as Si, calculated via the oral minimal model using SAMM II software. This software uses participant weight, glucose and insulin concentrations at various time points during the oral glucose tolerance test to calculate the participant's insulin sensitivity. A positive Si value means an improvement in insulin sensitivity., Baseline and 10 months|Change in ovarian morphology, Participants will have an ovarian ultrasound performed to measure change in ovarian morphology: ovarian size and number of follicles pre/post treatment with semaglutide, Baseline and 10 months
Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common endocrinopathies in women, presents with anovulation in adolescence, and reproductive dysfunction is related to excess weight. After a 4-month observation period of either no medication or metformin treatment, females aged 12-35 years with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome will receive 10 months of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to induce metabolic changes, weight loss and improve reproductive abnormalities. We will assess the relationship between weight loss and reproductive function, as well as identify if age, hormonal and metabolic measures and such insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion predict the response to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy.
