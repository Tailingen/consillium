Comparison of Low and High Ligation in the Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the defecatory function when nerve fibers around the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA) and left colic artery(LCA) are preserved(so called low ligation ) or not(high ligation) in the rectosigmoid and rectal cancer surgery.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: preservation of nerve fibers around IMA|PROCEDURE: resection of nerve fibers around IMA
Assessment of bowel function, 1 year
comparison of leakage rate, 2 weeks
Fecal incontinence after anterior resection are often observed. Whether or not postoperative bowel function is influenced by the preservation of nerve fibers around the root of IMA and LCA (low ligation) is still unknown. So in this randomized controlled trial, we evaluate the efficacy of low ligation in terms of the bowel function.
