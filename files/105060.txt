Study of Pomalidomide to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety for Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Impaired Renal Function (POM Renal)
The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety for the combination of pomalidomide (POM) + low-dose dexamethasone (LD- DEX) in subjects with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) and impaired renal function.

The primary objective of the study is to determine the PK and safety for the combination of POM + (LD-DEX) in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function.

The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of POM + (LD_DEX) in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function.

This is a 3+3 dose escalation design, with one cohort each for patients with severely impaired renal function patients (CrCl \< 30 mL/min) requiring and not requiring dialysis respectively. There will also be one control cohort with normal renal function, these patients will receive 4 mg POM. Dosing will be 21 days out of a 28 day cycle.
