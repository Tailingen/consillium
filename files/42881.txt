Continuing Cetuximab Plus Chemotherapy After First Progression in Wild-type KRAS, NRAS and BRAF V600E Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuing cetuximab combined with chemotherapy after first-line progression in wild-type KRAS,NRAS and BRAF colorectal cancer.
Wild-type KRAS,NRAS and BRAF V600E Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab combind mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI
Progression-free survival(PFS), The time from randomization to documented disease progression or death from any cause, 2 years
Overall Survial(OS), The time from randomization to death from any cause, 2 years|ORR, The percentage of complete or partial responses, 2 years|Safety, assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[version 3.0\], 2 years
In addition to the sequential therapeutic schedule of offering maintenance therapy and reintroduction of chemotherapy regimens to patients with nonresectable mCRC, multiline treatment strategy of continuing bevacizumab after progression to first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated optimal clinical benefits in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) . Continuing cetuximab after progression to first-line cetuximab is also a promising strategy. The underlying hypothesis is that a sustained inhibition of EGFR signaling with cetuximab would continuously eliminate sensitive clones of RAS wild-type tumor. The present phase 2 clinical trial evaluated standard fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy combined with cetuximab among patients with wild-type KRAS, NRAS and BRAF V600E mCRC who had progressed after cetuximab plus standard chemotherapy in the first-line setting.
