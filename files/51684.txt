A Study of the Experience of Music Therapy in Cancer Patients With Delirium
The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the experience of music therapy by cancer patients with delirium, and the experience of music therapists working with these patients. The researchers are focusing on patients with delirium because of the challenging symptoms of this condition.

At MSK, music therapy is routinely used in patients with cancer. Music therapy sessions are done at the patient's bedside, where the music therapist plays live music on a guitar, keyboard, harp, or percussion instrument, sometimes as accompaniment to singing.
