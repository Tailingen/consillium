Hairy Cell Leukemia: Harnessing the Full Power of Extracellular Vesicles to Improve Patient Care Management
Check whether patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) of different status (at diagnosis, in complete remission \> 2 years or relapsed requiring therapy) have a 'signature' of altered immunity based on extracellular vesicles (EV)
Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL)
Extracellular vesicle characterization, Verify whether hairy cell leukemia patients at different status (at diagnosis, in complete remission \> 2 years, or relapsed meeting treatment indications) display specific extracellular vesicle-based signatures of immune failure., 2 years
Extracellular vesicles' functions and biomarker validation, Elucidate whether immune cells of hairy cell leukemia patients and of healthy donors show specific phenotype. Elucidate whether plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of hairy cell leukemia patients and of healthy donors affect the cross-talk between hairy cells and immune cells. Confirm the biomarkers identified by using bone marrow biopsy of hairy cell leukemia patients, at diagnosis or relapsed meeting treatment indications., 2 years
Extracellular vesicles are small particles detected within plasma and recognized as mediators of intercellular communication thanks to their cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. However, the composition of vesicles from Hairy Cell Leukemia patients, which may hold the key to unraveling their involvement and function within tumor microenvironment, is totally unknown. The aim of this study is to characterize these extracellular vesicles in order to identify biology-related and disease-specific biomarkers.
