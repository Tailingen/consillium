The start date is the date of first documented response of CR or PR (i.e. the start date of observed response, not the date when response was confirmed), and the end date is the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer., From the date of CR, PR until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study, approximately 2 years|[Stage 1 and Stage 2] Efficacy of HS-10502: progression free survival (PFS) (applicable for all solid tumors except prostate cancer), Time from the date of randomization or first dose (if randomization is not needed) to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed per RECIST v1.1., From the date of randomization or first dose (if randomization is not needed) until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study, approximately 2 years.|[Stage 1 and Stage 2] Efficacy of HS-10502: radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) (for prostate cancer only), Time from the date of randomization or first dose (if randomization is not needed) to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. rPFS will be assessed per RECIST v1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone)., From the date of randomization or first dose (if randomization is not needed) until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study, approximately 2 years|[Stage 1 and Stage 2] Efficacy of HS-10502: ORR evaluated by RECIST v1.1 and Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA-125 (for ovarian cancer only), Proportion of participants with BOR of confirmed CR or confirmed PR per both RECIST v1.1 and GCIG CA-125 criteria., From the date of first dose until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study, approximately 2 years|[Stage 2] Efficacy of HS-10502: overall survival (OS), Time from the date of randomization or first dose (if randomization is not needed) to the date of death due to any cause.
