Overexpression of HER2 is associated with increased incidence of brain metastases in breast cancer, accounting for about 20-50% of HER2 positive breast cancer. Treatment strategy ranged from local therapies to systemic anti-HER2 therapies, prognosis of patients with brain metastases remains poor. Previous clinical trials had demonstrated the efficacy of trastuzumab and TKIs for brain metastasis.

Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. We designed the study to explore the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with trastuzumab and abraxane in HER2-positive MBC with brain metastasis.
