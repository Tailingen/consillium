This is an open-label, single arm Phase II study designed to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential thoracic radiotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive small cell lung cancer with chemotherapy combined with approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
Extensive-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Thoracic Radiotherapy
progression-free survival rate at 6-month, PFS is defined as the period from the start of receiving the first line chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to disease progression., 12 months after last patient entry
This study a single arm prospective phase II study. All the enrolled patients will be patients with ES-SCLC who did not have PD after 4-6 cycle of platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with an PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
