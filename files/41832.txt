Early Rebiopsy to Identify Biomarkers of Tumor Cell Survival Following EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or BRAF TKI Therapy
A comparison of baseline tumor characteristics in oncogene-driven cancers to tumor characteristics after early response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) targeted treatment will allow identification of early adaptive mechanisms of cell survival. This will facilitate targeting and termination of these survival/ resistance pathways before they develop with rational combinations of therapeutic agents to improve outcomes.

gene expression changes, change from baseline of tumor gene expression profile at 2 weeks. Global gene expression data will be collected using RNAseq, baseline and 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) for each patient.|protein expression change, change from baseline of protein gene expression profile at 2 weeks as measured by multiplex protein assay (proteins to be assayed include: e-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD206, PDL1, and CSF1R), baseline and 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) for each patient.
