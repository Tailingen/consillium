Transperineal Versus Transrectal Prostate Biopsy
Background: Prostate biopsies are essential to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). Transrectal prostate biopsies (TR-PB) are commonly performed, however disadvantages include the requirement of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) and higher complication rates than transperineal prostate biopsies (TP-PB). Guidelines still recommend the use of AP for TP-PB due to the limited evidence regarding complication rates after their omission. However, the rising rates of antibiotic resistance is of concern. The aim of this study was to compare the complication and detection rates of freehand TP-PB without AP versus TR-PB with AP.

Methods: This single center retrospective study was performed in an academic hospital. TP-PB were introduced in 2019 and implemented as the main technique by late 2020. To compare the two techniques, data was collected for freehand TR-PB with AP between 2017-2018 and freehand TP-PB without AP between 2021-2022. The data from 2019 and 2020 were excluded to rule out the effects of the initial learning curve during the transition period. Primary outcome measure was post-biopsy complications occurring within 2 weeks, focusing on infectious complications. Secondary outcome measures were detection rates and upgrading/reclassification in the repeat biopsy in active surveillance (AS). Statistical analysis was performed using a Fisher exact or Chi-Squared test.
