A First Time in Human (FTIH) Study of GSK3745417 Administered to Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity and establish a recommended dose of GSK3745417 administered alone (Part 1A) or co-administered (Part 2A) with dostarlimab in participants with refractory/relapsed solid tumors. Both parts will consist of a dose escalation phase.
