Investigation of Anti-tumour Effect and Tolerability of the PARP Inhibitor 2X-121 in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Selected by the 2X-121 DRP
2X-121 is a small molecule targeted inhibitor of Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a key enzyme involved in DNA damage repair in cancer cells. The PARP inhibitor demonstrated clinical activity in a prior Phase 1 study in a number of solid tumors. 2X-121 has a novel dual-inhibitory action against both PARP 1/2 and Tankyrase 1/2. The molecule is also active in P-glycoprotein expressing cells, suggesting it may overcome some of the PARP inhibitor resistance.

The Phase 2 study is using 2x-121 DRP® biomarker in metastatic breast cancer patients to identify patients likely to respond to and benefit from treatment with 2X-121.
