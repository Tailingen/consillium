Regorafenib Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced or Spreading Liver Cancer Who Have Been Previously Treated With PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people diagnosed with liver cancer which may have spread to nearby tissue and is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC). Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical trials to better understand its safety and how it works.

In this trial, the researchers will learn more about the trial treatment, regorafenib, in a small number of participants. They will study the results when the trial treatment is taken with another cancer treatment called pembrolizumab.

There will be 2 parts to this trial. The part 1 (pilot phase) will include about 52 men and women. The part 2 (expansion phase) will include about 67 men and women. All of the participants will have HCC and will be aged 18 years or older. All of the participants will have tried other treatments that did not help their HCC. These other treatments (PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors) are designed to work by stopping the activity of certain proteins in the immune system thought to play a role in HCC.

During both parts of the trial, the participants will take regorafenib and receive pembrolizumab. In the pilot phase, there will be 2 groups of participants. The group that each participant joins will be based on the treatment they already received for their HCC. The researchers will review the results in each group to learn if regorafenib and pembrolizumab are helping one group of participants more than others. Outcome of this review will determine the population to be treated in the expansion phase.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 by Central Assessment, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR per RECIST 1.1 by independent central assessment is reported). RECIST 1.1: response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1, Up to 15 months. Data up to 38 months are now available and are also reported for full transparency.
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 by Investigator Assessment, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR by RECIST 1.1 investigator review is reported. RECIST 1.1: response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1, Up to 38 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 by Central Assessment and Investigator Assessment, Duration of response (DOR) for partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) was defined as the time from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever noted earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurs before progression was documented). DOR was defined for confirmed responders only, i.e., participants with a CR or PR. RECIST 1.1: response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1, Up to 38 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was considered as treatment-emergent (TEAE) if arising or worsening after start of first study intervention administration until 30 days after administration of any study intervention. In addition, any AEs qualifying as a serious adverse event (SAE) were collected for 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab, unless a new anti-cancer therapy had been initiated., Up to 38 months|Number of Participants With Safety-relevant Changes in Clinical Parameters, Number of participants with clinically relevant trends observed in laboratory data, ECG data, or ECOG performance status is reported., Up to 38 months|Percentage of Participants With Dose Modification, Dose modification included dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation., Up to 38 months
