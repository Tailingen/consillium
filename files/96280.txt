Study of Metformin Plus Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex for Pharmacologic Manipulation of AGE (Advanced Glycation Endproducts) Levels in Prostate Cancer Patients
The overall goal of this study is to identify a safe dose of metformin, in combination with oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC) for pharmacologic reduction of AGE levels in patients with prostate cancer.

AGEs (advanced glycation endpoints) are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the food. The AGE content in food is determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The purpose of this study is to identify safe pharmaceutical agents that can reduce the AGE levels in subjects with advanced cancer.
