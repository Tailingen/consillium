Neoadjuvant CCRT With Gemcitabine/Durvalumab (MEDI4736) Followed by Adjuvant Gemcitabine/Durvalumab(MEDI4736) in Resectable or Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
\<Research Hypothesis\> The dynamics of immune cells by CCRT/Durvalumab will be uncovered. The combination of Durvalumab with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT/gemcitabine)) as neoaduvant treatment in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is feasible and efficacious.

The combination of Durvalumab with cytotoxic chemotherapy (gemcitabine) as an adjuvant treatment is feasible and efficacious.

\<Objectives\> To assess the effect of Neoadjuvant CCRT with Gemcitabine/Durvalumab followed by adjuvant Gemcitabine/Durvalumab in resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer

Primary endpoint:

2 year-DFSR (disease-free survival rate) Secondary endpoints

* Efficacy: 2 year-OSR (overall survival rate), disease-free survival, overall survival, overall response rate (RECIST 1.1, ir response) after neoadjuvant CCRT, disease control rateEORTC QLQ-C30, the number of immune cells (TIL, macrophage, etc) in resected pancreatic tissue
* Safety: toxicity (CTCAE V), irAE,

Exploratory Objective(s):

* To evaluate baseline measures and changes of immune systems and regulations by neoadjuvant CCRT with gemcitabine/Durvalumab in peripheral blood and tumor tissues
* To collect and store DNA from blood (according to ethical procedures) for future exploratory research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (ie, distribution, safety, tolerability and efficacy) to study treatments and or susceptibility to disease (optional).
