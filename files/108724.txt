Number of patients with hematological relapse 6 months after start of treatment with azacitidin, 6 months after end of treatment
Number of occurrence or exacerbation of clinical relevant acute or chronic GvHD, 2 years follow-up after treatment|Number of patients with infectious SAEs (rate of SAE), 2 years follow-up after treatment|Rate of changes of methylation in CD34+ cells, 2 years follow-up after treatment|Relapse-free survival and overall survival, Relapse-free survival and overall survival 12, 24 and 30 months after start of treatment, 12, 24 and 30 months after start of treatment
Analysis of the effectiveness of azacitidine 6 months after start of therapy to prevent a hematological relapse in MDS or AML patients with significant residuals or an increase of minimal residual disease (MRD) which is defined as:

* decrease of CD34 donor chimerism (\<80%) after allogeneic related or unrelated HSCT in CD34+ or CD117+ MDS or AML or
* increase in the AML-specific molecular markers in the quantitative PCR for t(6,9), NPM1+ AML \>1% (ratio to reference gene) after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT or
* persistence of the (above) MRD level \>1% after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT
* tolerance of azacitidine
* quality of the response of the MRD (major vs. minor) and the relapse-free survival and overall survival 12, 24 and 30 months after starting treatment with azacitidine
* modulation of CD34+, NK- and T-cells of MDS and AML patients by azacitidine
