An Investigational Scan (Dual Energy CT) in Detecting Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumors
This trial studies the use of a special type of computed (CT) scan called dual energy CT in detecting gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. CT is an imaging technique that uses x-rays and a computer to create images of areas inside the body. Dual energy computed tomography is a technique used during routine CT scans to help obtain and process the image after the scan is complete. Doctors want to learn if dual energy computed tomography can help improve the detection of carcinoid tumors during routine CT scans.

PROCEDURE: Dual-Energy Computed Tomography
Sensitivity and specificity of dual energy computed tomography in detecting primary gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, through study completion, an average of 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate prospectively the sensitivity and specificity of dual energy computed tomography (CT) in detecting primary gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo one dual energy CT scan during scheduled CT scan.
