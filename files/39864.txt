Feasibility Study of Presurgical Hormone Therapy (Anastrozole) in Breast Cancer Patients
1. Women with operable breast cancer with a 2-8 week preoperative waiting period will accept preoperative therapy trials and specifically taking a standard drug for breast cancer such as anastrozole in this study
2. Short term anastrozole treatment will induce measurable changes in biomarker levels (ER, PR, Her2, Ki67) within the tumor.
3. Degree of response to short term anastrozole varies with a) duration of treatment and b) breast cancer subtype (based on initial pre-treatment biomarker status)
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Anastrozole
Percentage of patients who fit the eligibility criteria that consent to the study; withdraw after consent from the study., Participants are on study from the time their eligibility is confirmed until the time of their surgery which could be up to 8 weeks. This is a feasibility study and therefore once the study is closed to accrual the percent of women who signed consent and remained on study until their surgery versus those who withdraw will be determined., up to 18 months
Measure the changes in ER, PR, Her2 and Ki67 labelling index on pre- and post treatment tumor tissue, All biomarker results will be analyzed at study closure when participant #20 has received surgery., Up to 18 months
