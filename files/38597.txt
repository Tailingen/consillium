Oral Estramustine and Oral Vinorelbine in the Treatment of Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer
Purpose: This clinical trail will combine the chemotherapy drugs, Estramustine and Vinorelbine (Navelbine), on an intermittent therapy strategy based on PSA response in the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. The investigators will determine the tolerable dose of (oral) vinorelbine in combination with (oral) estramustine, and evaluate the efficacy of this treatment for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Estramustine|DRUG: Vinorelbine
Tolerable Dose of Vinorelbine in Combination with Estramustine, To determine the tolerable dose of oral vinorelbine in combination with oral estramustine on an intermittent schedule, and describe the toxicities of the regimen. The dose will not be escalated until at least 180 days of cumulative observation of acute toxicity in patients enrolled at a particular dose level., 180 days post dose
Hormone Refractory prostate cancer refers to advanced disease in which a patient no longer responds to conventional hormonal treatment. When hormone therapy is no longer successful, chemotherapy is a treatment option. However, current single-agent treatment has shown to have limited benefit. In this clinical trial, investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of combining two chemotherapy drugs, Estramustine and Vinorelbine (Navelbine), in the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Estramustine has been used in the treatment of prostate cancer for many years. Vinorelbine has shown activity in prostate cancer. In addition, the effect of this treatment on the quality of life of patients will be evaluated as measured using the FACT-P.
