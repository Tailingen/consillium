Respiatory Viral Infections in Patients with Multiple Myeloma
Respiratory viruses are known to be a major cause of morbodity in multiple myeloma patients but prospective long-term sudies are lacking. We analysed 219 multiple myeloma patients that had 554 nasopharingeal swabs with 58 documented viral episodes. Respiratory viruses studied were rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainflienza, respirator, syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, influenza A, influenza B. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively entered database, medical records were reviewed. We have prospectively studiend patients until May 2019 when we gathered survival data. Lastly because of Covid-19 pandemic when almost no other viral infections were isolated, we analysed clinical course of respiratory infections in patients with multiple myeloma after the pandemic.
