Gastroenterology Artificial INtelligence System for Detecting Colorectal Polyps (The GAIN Study)
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of the Computer-Assisted Detection (CADe) Device on Adenomas Per Colonoscopy and Positive Percent Agreement for routine colonoscopies. The control arm is colonoscopy performed with High Definition White Light Endoscopy (HD-WLE) per standard of care. The intervention arm is colonoscopy performed with HD-WLE per standard of care plus the Computer-Assisted Detection (CADe) Device.

DEVICE: Computer-Assisted Detection (CADe) Device
Difference in Adenomas Per Colonoscopy (APC), Difference in Adenomas Per Colonoscopy (APC) between the control and intervention arm, evaluated for superiority. APC is defined as the average number of histologically confirmed adenomas resected per colonoscopy., Day 1|Difference in Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Difference in Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) between the control and intervention arm, evaluated for non-inferiority. PPA is defined as the total number of histologically confirmed Clinically Significant Excised Lesions, divided by the total number of excisions., Day 1
Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR), The Adenoma Detection Rate is defined as the number of patients with at least one histologically confirmed adenoma divided by the total number of patients enrolled per study arm., Day 1|Number of False Alerts Per Procedure, A false alert is defined as a bounding box that persists on the screen (approximately 2-3 seconds per the judgment of the colonoscopist) that is then determined by the colonoscopist not to contain a polyp. The false alert rate is calculated as the number of false alerts per procedure conducted in the intervention arm of the study., Day 1|Mean Withdrawal and Inspection Time (MWT), The withdrawal time is defined as the time measured from the moment the withdrawal phase of the procedure begins (with the scope in the cecum) to the moment the scope is withdrawn from the patient. The Inspection time measurement will exclude washing and resection, and other peri-resection activity not deemed to be colonic inspection. Inspection times for both the control arm and intervention arm will be calculated retrospectively upon review of the video recordings., Day 1|Polyp Detection Rate (PDR), Polyp detection rate is defined as the proportion of patients with at least one histologically-confirmed polyp detected., Day 1|Proximal Adenoma Detection Rate (pADR), pADR is defined as the percentage of patients with at least one histologically-confirmed adenoma detected in proximal colon., Day 1|Flat Adenoma Detection Rate (fADR), fADR is defined as the percentage of patients with at least one histologically-confirmed non-polypoid adenoma detected., Day 1|Serrated Lesions Per Colonoscopy (SLPC), SLPC is defined as the number of histologically confirmed serrated lesions detected, divided by the total number of colonoscopies., Day 1|Serrated Lesions Detection Rate (SLDR), SLDR is defined as the percentage of patients with at least one histologically confirmed serrated lesion detected., Day 1|Adenoma Detection Rate Including Carcinoma (ADR*), ADR\* is defined as ADR, but also includes histologically-confirmed intramucosal carcinoma and adenocarcinoma., Day 1|Small Adenoma Detection Rate (sADR), sADR is defined as the percentage of patients with at least one adenoma 5mm or smaller detected., Day 1|Polyps Per Colonoscopy (PPC), PPC is defined as the total number of histologically-confirmed polyps found divided by the total number of colonoscopies performed, per study arm., Day 1|Advanced Adenoma Detection Rate (aADR), aADR is defined as the percentage of patients with at least one adenoma â‰¥ 10 mm, or any adenoma \< 10 mm, which was either of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or villous or tubulovillous., Day 1|False Positive Rate (FPR), FPR is defined as the proportion of colorectal lesions resected and biopsied and subsequently not histologically-confirmed to be clinically relevant colorectal polyps (e.g. a pathology finding of normal mucosa, inflammatory tissue, stool or debris, lymphoid aggregates)., Day 1
