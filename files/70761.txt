A Study of Adebrelimab in Combination with Chemo with or Without Bevacizumab Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable NSCLC
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, uncontrolled Phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of resectable Stage II-IIIB (T3N2) NSQ-NSCLC and to explore biomarkers associated with efficacy.
Resectable Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Adebellizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Platinum-based chemotherapy
Pathological complete response, Pathological complete response, pCR (primary tumor + lymph nodes).It refers to the proportion of subjects with no residual surviving tumor cells (including lymph nodes) in the postoperative specimen among the enrolled subjects, After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy(3 weeks per cycle), surgical resection was performed at intervals of 4-6 weeks. Pathological response assessment results were assessed within one week after surgery.
Major Pathological response, It refers to the proportion of subjects with residual surviving tumor cells of ≤ 10% in the postoperative specimen among the enrolled subjects., After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy(3 weeks per cycle), surgical resection was performed at intervals of 4-6 weeks. Pathological response assessment results were assessed within one week after surgery.|Overall response rate, It refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor shrinks to a certain extent and maintains it for a certain period of time, including CR and PR cases., After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy(3 weeks per cycle), before surgical resection was performed（at intervals of 4-6 weeks）.|event free survival, Defined as disease progression from randomization to imaging confirmation, local progression leading to inoperable tumors, unresectable tumors, local or distant recurrence, and death from any cause., from randomization to imaging confirmation, local progression leading to inoperable tumors, unresectable tumors, local or distant recurrence, and death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.|safety, Monitoring and recording of adverse events, including Incidence of serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest., Safety follow-up will be conducted 30 ± 7 days after the last use of bevacizumab/chemotherapy or 90 ± 7 days after the last use of adebrelimab/surgery (whichever occurs later) to track the relief of AE. Incidence of AE/SAE/TRAE will be recorded.
Neoadjuvant therapy with experimental treatment followed by surgery.
