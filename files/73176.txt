Aponermin-Based Bridging Therapy Prior to CAR-T Infusion in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients With Extramedullary Disease
This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aponermin-based bridging therapy prior to CAR-T infusion in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with extramedullary disease.

Overall response rate (ORR), The definition of ORR is the proportion of participants who achieve a PR or better as the best response according to the IMWG criteria., within 1 months after BCMA/GPRC5D CAR-T infusion
ORR before CAR-T cell infusion, ORR before CAR-T cell infusion is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed PR or better as the best response after conditioning treatment but prior to CAR-T cell infusion., before CAR-T cell infusion|Progression free survival(PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the start of Aponermin treatment to disease progression, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the start of Aponermin treatment to the date of the participant's death., Up to 2 year|Adverse events and serious adverse events, Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and assessments of clinical laboratory values, Up to 2 year
