A Phase 1b/2 Study of OMP-59R5 (Tarextumab) in Combination With Etoposide and Platinum Therapy
The study consists of a Phase1b lead-in portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OMP-59R5 (tarextumab) in combination with etoposide (EP) for 6 cycles followed a Phase 2, multi center, randomized, placebo-controlled portion comparing the efficacy and safety of OMP-59R5 in combination with EP for 6 cycles followed by single agent OMP-59R5 relative to EP alone for 6 cycles in subjects receiving first-line therapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
Stage IV Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: OMP-59R5|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Cisplatin or Carboplatin
Phase 1b: To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of OMP-59R5 When Administered With Etoposide and Cisplatin or Carboplatin (Number of Subjects With DLTs), To determine the MTD of tarextumab when administered on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle along with etoposide 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2 and 3, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 or carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) of 5 mg/mLâ€¢min on Day 1 in subjects with untreated extensive stage small cell lung cancer. DLT evaluable population includes all subjects who received at least 1 partial dose of OMP-59R5 during the Phase 1b dose escalation portion of the study including the carboplatin cohort and who had completed Day 21 cycle of 1 OMP-59R5 administration or had discontinued due to drug-related toxicity., Up to 1 year in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.|Phase 1b: Overall Response (Response Evaluable Population), The best overall response is defined as the best Investigator-assessed response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression in the following order of importance: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), Not Evaluable (NE). Response evaluable population includes subjects who received 1 partial dose of OMP-59R5 and at at least 1 post tumor assessment., Up to 1 year in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (ITT Population), To determine the improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) resulting from the addition of tarextumab to etoposide and platinum therapy (EP) in subjects receiving first-line therapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer. PFS is based on the Investigator-assessments of tumor response which is defined as the number of days from randomization until death or disease progression as defined by RECIST criteria for the ITT Population., Up to 1 year until disease progression or death.|Phase 2: Best Overall Tumor Response Based on Investigator Assessment (ITT Population), The response rate is the number of subjects per treatment arm who have either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for best overall response (according to RECIST criteria) divided by the number of subjects randomized to the respective arms., Up to 1 year in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression
The Phase 1b lead-in portion of the study was conducted to determine the MTD of OMP-59R5 administered along with EP. The Phase 2 portion of the study was multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled. Subjects who qualified for enrollment into the Phase 2 portion of the study were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study treatment of tarextumab along with EP (Arm A) or placebo along with EP (Arm B).
