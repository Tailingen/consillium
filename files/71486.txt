HRQoL in Patients with Solid Tumors Treated with Hadrontherapy
The Quality of Life of patients treated with hadrontherapy is still limited. Two cohorts are established, they will be receiving specific standardized questionnaires to be evalutaed in their results.
Head and Neck Cancer|Skull Base--Cancer|Brain Cancer
OTHER: questionnaires administration
investigate relation between quality of life and several socio- psycho- variables, quality of life in subjects treated with curative hadrontherapy investigated by global score according to Short-form-12-health-survey-questionnaire (SF-12) and compared to healthy population, 5 years follow uo after hadrontherapy
quality of life related also to psychological variables, socio-cognitive factors, resilience, quality of life in subjects treated with curative hadrontherapy investigated by global score according to EORTC QLQ-C30, before treatment and after 1 year from treatment completion
Since 2011, CNAO has been treating patients suffering from solid tumors with particle therapy (both protons and carbon ions). Hadrontherapy improves outcome of radioresistant tumors which normally do not benefit from conventional radiotherapy. The treated population is highly heterogenous in term of tumor site, histotype, treatment fields and doses however its common anatomical origin justifies a unified approach in evaluating a QoL in this setting. QoL of patients suffering from these tumors have been poorly investigated and there are still few studies on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and QoL following hadrontherapy. In this context, therefore, there is a need to generate data by designing distinct cohort studies, conceived within a single protocol, that will gather quality of life data by means of standardized questionnaires of patients along their oncological history. Thanks to this protocol design, the investigator will be facilitated, in the future, in adding new cohorts pending a study protocol amendment and ethical approval.
