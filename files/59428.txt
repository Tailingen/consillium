The Impact of Picture Narrative Format on Print Lung Screening Communication Outcomes
The purpose of this study is to test whether a picture narrative format is more successful, than text with pictures or text alone, in communicating lung screening information (primarily defined by positive attitudes towards the design and increase in knowledge) to people likely to be invited to lung screening where available.

BEHAVIORAL: Picture narrative information format|BEHAVIORAL: Text with pictures information format|BEHAVIORAL: Text-only information format
Participant Lung Cancer Screening Knowledge scores, Participants will be asked 6 multiple choice questions related to the lung screening information presented to the participants during the intervention, covering; Procedure, Eligibility - who, Eligibility - why, Benefits, Adverse effects, Potential results., Immediately post-intervention|Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility self-assessment, Concordance between self-reported personal eligibility for lung cancer screening and actual eligibility based on self-reported age and smoking behaviour., Immediately post-intervention|Participant Lung Cancer Screening Attitudes, Self-administered four-item lung cancer screening attitudes measure covering cancer fear, fatalism, benefits, and worry, previously used by Smits et al 2018., Immediately post-intervention
Participant Design appraisal ratings, Self-administered nine-item measure rating perceptions of appeal, enjoyment, interest, ease of use, trustworthiness, appropriateness, helpfulness, informativity.

Alongside a single item asking participants whether enough information was provided., Immediately post-intervention
Treatment compliance, Self-reported length of time spent reading the lung screening information., Immediately post-intervention
Population screening is key to detecting lung cancer early at a more treatable stage. Uptake of screening should be equitable (i.e., screening benefits all eligible members of the population and does not contribute further to health disparities) and informed (i.e., participants have been involved in the decision to take part and their decision aligns with their values and circumstances). Print decision support materials are the primary mechanism for encouraging engagement with cancer screening and supporting decision making. It is essential that we identify print communication techniques that are effective in informing invitees about lung screening.

The intervention, picture narrative information about lung screening, was previously developed through codesign and prototype testing with people likely to be eligible for lung screening (50 to 75 years old, past or current heavy smokers). Participants will be randomised to one of three groups: Picture narrative format, Text with pictures (control 1) or, Text-only (control 2). This study will assess whether presenting lung screening information in a picture narrative format can improve lung cancer screening knowledge, eligibility self-assessment and attitudes. It will also assess whether perceptions of the information designs can explain any impact of the intervention on these outcomes and whether there are differences across socioeconomic groups.
