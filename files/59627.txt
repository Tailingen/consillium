A Safety and Efficacy Study Evaluating CTX112 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CTX112â„¢ in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.
B-cell Lymphoma|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|B-cell Malignancy|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)|Follicular Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Large B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CTX112
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Incidence of adverse events, defined as dose-limiting toxicities, From CTX112 infusion up to 28 days post-infusion|Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion): Objective response rate, From CTX112 infusion up to 60 months post-infusion
Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DOR) will only be reported for subjects who have had CR/PR events, From date of first objective response of complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) until date of disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Duration of Clinical Benefit (DOCB), From date of first objective response of CR/PR until the relapse or death that followed the last response, assessed up to 60 months|Progression Free Survival, From date of CTX112 infusion until date of disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Overall Survival, From date of CTX112 infusion until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study of CTX112 in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. CTX112 is an is allogeneic CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy comprised of allogeneic T cells that are genetically modified ex vivo using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR associated protein 9) gene editing components (single guide RNA and Cas9 nuclease).
