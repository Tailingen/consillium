SciBase International Melanoma Pivotal Study
The purpose of this clinical investigation was to determine the safety and effectiveness of the SciBase III device (Test) designed to help distinguish between malignant melanoma and benign lesions, using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) relative to the histological gold standard (Reference).

The purpose of the study is to collect data to support a Pre-market Application(PMA) to obtain Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approval to market the SciBase III Electrical Impedance Spectrometer.
Malignant Melanoma
DEVICE: SciBase III Electrical Impedance Spectrometer
SciBase Sensitivity and Specificity, This study has two co-primary objectives, aiming to demonstrate the accuracy of SciBase device:

1. Sensitivity â‰¥ 0.90 to detect Melanoma
2. Sensitivity - (1-Specificity) \> 0.00

Sensitivity is the proportion of correctly identified cases of Melanoma. Specificity is the proportion of correctly identified cases of non-melanoma., Post data lock
Sensitivity and Specificity, Secondary confirmatory objective included two co-secondary endpoints that were defined similarly to the co-primary endpoints, but used the Secondary definition of dichotomous reference diagnosis.

Positive Reference Diagnosis: Melanoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Severe Dysplastic Nevus (High grade dysplasia)

Negative Reference Diagnosis: All other skin lesions., Post data lock
