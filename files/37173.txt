Celecoxib Treatment for Lung Cancer
This proposal evaluates cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition as a means to decrease T regulatory cell activities and thus augment immune responses against lung cancer. The broad goal focuses on understanding how COX-2 expression regulates the malignant phenotype in non small cell lung cancer in an effort to foster an informed approach for the use of COX-2 inhibitors in prevention and therapy for lung cancer.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Celecoxib
Measure bio-markers; safety measures, 2 years
