Perioperative Disitamab Vedotin Plus Toripalimab and XELOX in Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative Disitamab Vedotin plus Toripalimab and XELOX versus Disitamab Vedotin plus Toripalimab versus XELOX in subjects with HER2-expressing resectable locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: oxaliplatin|DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin|DRUG: Toripalimab
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, Proportion of patients with pCR. pCR is defined as no invasive disease within an entirely submitted and evaluated gross lesion, and histologically negative nodes (ypT0N0), Up to approximately 2 years
Objective remission rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation by the investigator will be performed)., Up to approximately 2 years|R0 resection rate, Percentage of patients with complete resection of tumor tissue without tumor cell infiltration at surgical margins, Up to approximately 2 years|Tumor regression grade (TRG) score, to evaluate tumor regression grade (based on postoperative pathological reports);, Up to approximately 2 years|Major pathological response (MPR), the proportion of patients with percentage of residual tumor cells in the tumor bed â‰¤10% after neoadjuvant therapy;, Up to approximately 2 years|Event free survival (EFS), the time from randomization to the first occurrence of the following events: radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1,local or distant recurrence, and death due to any cause;, Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Adverse events, to evaluate safety including adverse event rate and adverse event grade, Time Frame: Up to approximately 2 years
This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of perioperative Disitamab Vedotin plus Toripalimab and XELOX versus Disitamab Vedotin plus Toripalimab versus XELOX in subjects with HER2-expressing (immunohistochemical 1+, 2+, 3+) resectable locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
