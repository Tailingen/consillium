Trial Comparing Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Versus Epidural Anesthesia for Pain Management in Colorectal Surgery
The primary outcome for this study is the Numeric Pain Score (NPS) for elective patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery that have been randomized to transversus abdominis plane block or epidural anesthesia for the management of perioperative pain in elective colorectal surgery.

Adequate peri-operative analgesia is a vital component of post-operative management for patients undergoing colon and rectal surgery, affecting hospital length of stay, quality of life, and patient outcomes. There are many options for the peri-operative management of pain after elective colorectal surgery.

This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the transversus abdominis plane block using ExparelÂ® to epidural anesthesia for the enhanced recovery pathway perioperative management of pain for elective colorectal surgery.
