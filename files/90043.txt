A Study of Motexafin Gadolinium (MGd) in Combination With Docetaxel and Cisplatin for Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of the study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of motexafin gadolinium when administered with docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

A cycle consists of 3 weeks. During week 1, patients receive MGd, docetaxel, and cisplatin treatment followed by 2 weeks without treatment.

Eligible patients will receive 1 or 2 doses of MGd, depending on cohort, and a single dose of docetaxel and cisplatin at 75 mg/m² during the first week of each cycle. Additionally, tumor response will be evaluated at the end of even numbered cycles (2, 4, and 6). Patients may stay on the study a maximum of 6 cycles.
