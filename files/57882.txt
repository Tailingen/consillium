An Observational Study of CPT-11 Based Regimens and UGT1A1 Genotypes in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation between UGT1A1 genotypes and the efficacy of CPT-11 based regimens (FOLFIRI, CPT-11+S-1, CPT-11) for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
