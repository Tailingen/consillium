AML is also called
acute myelogenous leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from AML  in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 22,010.
Deaths: 11,090.
Based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data from 2014 to 2020, 31.9% of patients with AML were alive 5 years after diagnosis.[
2
]
Anatomy
Enlarge
Blood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.   
AML  is a heterogenous group of blood cancers that  result from clonal expansion of myeloid hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. Not only are circulating leukemia cells (also called blasts) seen in the peripheral blood, but granulocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are also common as proliferating leukemia cells interfere with normal hematopoiesis.[
3
] 
Clinical Presentation
The diagnosis of AML is uncommon before age 45 years; the median age at diagnosis is 69 years.[
2
] Patients may present with symptoms that include:
Weakness.
Fever.
Infection.
Pallor. 
Bleeding. 
The hampered production of normal blood cells due to leukemic infiltration of the bone marrow can also cause other symptoms and complications. Less commonly, patients have signs or symptoms related to the collection of leukemia cells in certain anatomical locations, such as central nervous system (CNS) or testicular involvement, or the presence of a myeloid sarcoma (also called chloroma). The symptoms of acute leukemia often arise over a 4- to 6-week period before diagnosis.[
3
]
Diagnostic Evaluation
The differentiation of AML from other forms of leukemia, in particular chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, has vital
therapeutic implications.  The primary diagnostic tool in this determination is flow cytometry to evaluate surface antigens on the leukemia cells. Simple morphology is not adequate in determining lineage and, at a minimum, special histochemical stains are needed. While a diagnosis can be made by evaluating peripheral blood, a bone marrow biopsy is used to evaluate morphology and cell surface markers, as well as provide material for cytogenetic and molecular analysis. A peripheral blood or bone marrow blast count of 20% or greater is required to make the diagnosis, except for cases with certain chromosomal abnormalities (i.e., t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16), or t(16;16)).[
4
]
Prognosis and Prognostic Factors
While the rates of new cases of AML have not changed significantly over the last decade, age-adjusted death rates have dropped.[
2
]   Treatment should be sufficiently aggressive to
achieve complete remission (CR) because partial remission offers no substantial
survival benefit.  Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with AML can be expected
to attain CR status after appropriate induction therapy. 
More than 25% of adults with AML (about 45% of those who attain CR) can be expected to survive 3 or more years and may be cured.
Approximately half of patients with AML will harbor chromosomal abnormalities; therefore, conventional cytogenetic analysis remains mandatory in the evaluation of suspected AML.[
5
,
6
] With the routine use of molecular diagnostics, the identification of recurrent somatic pathogenic variants in 
NPM1
, 
FLT3
, 
CEPBA
, 
RUNX1
, and other genes has become a routine part of determining prognosis. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses provide the strongest prognostic information
available,  predicting outcome of both remission induction and consolidation
therapy.[
7
] Cytogenic and molecular information has been combined to form distinct prognostic groups.
Additional adverse prognostic factors for AML include:
Age at diagnosis. Remission rates in adult AML are inversely related to age, with an expected
remission rate of more than 65% for those younger than 60 years. 
Data suggest that once attained, duration of remission may be shorter in older
patients.  Increased morbidity and mortality during induction appear to be
directly related to age.
  CNS involvement with leukemia.
Systemic infection at diagnosis.
Elevated white blood cell count (>100,000/mm
3
) at diagnosis.
Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms
, resulting from alkylating agents and radiation therapy.
History of myelodysplastic syndrome or another antecedent hematologic disorder.
Long-Term Effects of Cancer Treatment
The risk of developing any long-term effects depends on the type and dose of treatment that was used and the age at which the patient underwent treatment.
A study of 30 patients who had AML that was in remission for at least 10 years demonstrated a 13% incidence of secondary malignancies.[
8
] Of 31 female long-term survivors of AML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed before age 40 years, 26 resumed normal menstruation after completion of therapy. Among 36 live offspring of survivors, two congenital problems occurred.[
8
]
Most patients with AML who undergo intensive therapy are treated with an anthracycline. Anthracyclines have been associated with increased risk of congestive heart failure (CHF).[
9
] Anthracycline cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent. In one study, doxorubicin-related CHF was 5% at a lifetime cumulative dose of 400 mg/m
2
, rising to 26% at a cumulative dose of 550 mg/m
2
.[
10
] In many cases, heart failure can manifest as a late effect.[
11
] In an analysis of children who underwent  treatment for acute leukemia, the cumulative incidence of CHF at 10 years was 1.7% in ALL and 7.5% in AML.[
12
]
Patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant can experience a large number of long-term or late side effects of  treatment as a result of high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation, and as an effect of chronic graft-versus-host disease and immunosuppression. These side effects may include chronic fatigue, thyroid and gonadal dysfunction, infertility, chronic infection, accelerated coronary heart disease, osteopenia, cataracts, iron overload, adverse psychological outcomes, and second cancers.[
13
-
15
] 
In the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study, hematopoietic cell transplant survivors had accelerated aging and were 8.4 times more likely to be frail than their siblings (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0−34.5; 
P
 = .003). In a multivariable analysis, frailty was associated with a 2.76-fold increase in the risk of death, compared with a nonfrail state (95% CI, 1.7−4.4; 
P
 < .001).[

World Health Organization (WHO) Classification
The classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been revised by a group of pathologists and clinicians under the auspices of the WHO.[
1
]  While elements of the French-American-British (FAB) classification have been retained (i.e., morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and clinical features),[
2
,
3
] the WHO classification incorporates and interrelates morphology, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and immunologic markers, which construct a classification that is universally applicable and has prognostic and therapeutic relevance.[
1
,
3
,
4
]  Each criterion has prognostic and treatment implications but, for practical purposes, initial antileukemic
therapy is similar for all subtypes.
In 2001, the WHO proposed a new classification system that incorporated diagnostic cytogenetic information and  that more reliably correlated with outcome.  This classification system also decreased the bone marrow percentage of leukemic blast requirement for the diagnosis of AML from 30% to 20%. An additional clarification was made so patients with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities did not need to meet the minimum blast requirement to be considered  as having an AML diagnosis.[
5
-
7
]
In 2008, the WHO expanded the number of cytogenetic abnormalities linked to AML classification and, for the first time, included specific pathogenic variants (
CEBPA
 and 
NPM
) in its classification system.[
5
,
8
] With the addition of these gene variants, FAB subclassification no longer provided prognostic information for patients with a diagnosis of AML, not otherwise specified (NOS).[
9
]  
In 2016, the WHO classification underwent revisions to incorporate the expanding knowledge of leukemia biomarkers that are significantly important to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of leukemia.[
10
]   With emerging technologies aimed at genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, and immunophenotypic classification, AML classification will continue to evolve and provide informative prognostic and biological guidelines to clinicians and researchers.

AML With Recurrent Genetic Abnormalities
AML with well-defined genetic abnormalities is characterized by recurrent genetic abnormalities.[
10
]  The reciprocal translocations t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), t(15;17), and translocations involving the 11q23 breakpoint are the most commonly identified chromosomal abnormalities. These structural chromosome rearrangements result in the formation of fusion genes that encode chimeric proteins that may contribute to the initiation or progression of leukemogenesis.  Many of these translocations are detected by either reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) or fluorescence 
in situ
 hybridization (FISH), which has a higher sensitivity than metaphase cytogenetics.  Other recurring cytogenetic abnormalities are less common.
Molecular diagnostic platforms such as next-generation sequencing along with RT-PCR are used to identify recurrent molecular abnormalities in AML, helping to further refine diagnostic categories in the 2016 WHO classification system.[
10
]
AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), 
RUNX1
-
RUNX1T1
The translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) is one  of the most common chromosomal aberrations in AML and accounts for 5% to 12% of cases.[
11
]  Myeloid sarcomas (chloromas) may be present and may be associated with a bone marrow blast percentage of less than 20%.  
Common morphological features include: 
Large blasts with abundant basophilic cytoplasm, often containing numerous azurophilic granules. 
A few blasts in some cases show very large granules (pseudo Chediak-Higashi granules).
Auer rods, 
which may be detected in mature neutrophils. 
Smaller blasts, predominantly in the peripheral blood.
Promyelocytes, myelocytes, and mature neutrophils with variable dysplasia in the bone marrow.
Abnormal nuclear segmentation (pseudo Pelger-Huët nuclei) and/or cytoplasmic staining abnormalities.
Increased eosinophil precursors.
Reduced or absent monocytes. 
Normal erythroblasts and megakaryocytes.
Rarely, AML with this translocation presents with a bone marrow blast percentage of less than 20%.[
5
] Along with inv(16)(p13;q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22), AML with t(8;21) makes up a category known as core binding factor AML. This category of AML is associated with long-term survival when treated with high-dose cytarabine.[
12
-
15
]
The translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) involves the 
RUNX1
 gene, which encodes CBF-alpha, and the 
RUNX1T1
 (8;21) gene.[
5
,
16
]  The 
RUNX1
::
RUNX1T1
 fusion transcript is consistently detected in patients with t(8;21) AML. This translocation is usually associated with a good response to chemotherapy and a high complete remission (CR) rate with long-term survival when treated with high-dose cytarabine in the consolidation phase, as demonstrated in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CLB-9022 and CLB-8525) trials.[
12
-
15
]  Additional chromosome abnormalities are common, for example, loss of a sex chromosome and del(9)(q22).  Leukocytosis (i.e., white blood count >25 × 10
9
/L) is associated with an inferior outcome,[
17
] as is the presence of a 
KIT
 pathogenic variant.[
18
]   
AML with inv(16)(p13.1;q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22), 
CBFB
::
MYH11
The inv(16)(p13;q22) abnormality or t(16;16)(p13;q22) translocation is found in approximately 10% to 12% of all cases of AML, predominantly in younger patients.[
5
,
19
]  Myeloid sarcomas may be present at initial diagnosis or at relapse.  
Common morphological features include: 
Monocytic and granulocytic differentiation.
A characteristically abnormal eosinophil component with immature purple-violet eosinophil granules that may obscure cell morphology if present in great numbers.
Auer rods in myeloblasts.
Decreased neutrophils in bone marrow.
As is found in rare cases of AML with t(8;21), the bone marrow blast percentage in this AML is occasionally less than 20%.
Both inv(16)(p13;q22) and t(16;16)(p13;q22) result in the fusion of the 
CBFB
 gene at 16q22 to the smooth muscle 
MYH11
 gene at 16p13, thereby forming the 
CBFB
::
MYH11
 fusion gene .[
11
]  The use of FISH and RT–PCR methods is sometimes necessary to document this fusion gene because its presence is not always documented by traditional cytogenetics banding techniques.[
20
]   Similar to AML with t(8;21), patients with the 
CBFB
::
MYH11
 fusion gene achieve higher CR rates and long-term survival when treated with high-dose cytarabine in the consolidation setting.[
12
,
13
,
15
] Unlike AML with t(8;21), the prognostic relevance of 
KIT
 pathogenic variants is unclear.[
21
]
APL with 
PML
::
RARA
APL is defined by the presence of the PML::RARA fusion protein, typically a result of  t(15;17)(q22;q12), but can be cryptic or result from complex cytogenetic rearrangements other than t(15;17)(q22;q12). It is also an  AML in which promyelocytes are the dominant leukemic cell type.  APL exists as two subtypes, hypergranular or typical APL and microgranular or hypogranular APL.  APL comprises 5% to 8% of cases of AML and occurs predominately in adults in midlife.[
5
]  Both typical and microgranular APL are commonly associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).[
22
,
23
]  In microgranular APL, unlike typical APL, the leukocyte count can be very high with a rapid doubling time.[
5
]   
Common morphological features of typical APL include:
Kidney-shaped or bilobed nuclei.
Cytoplasm densely packed with large granules (bright pink, red, or purple in Romanowsky stains).
Bundles of Auer rods within the cytoplasm (faggot cells).
Larger Auer rods than in other types of AML.
Strongly positive myeloperoxidase (MPO) reaction in all leukemic promyelocytes.
Only occasional leukemic promyelocytes in the 
blood.
Common morphological features of microgranular APL include:
Bilobed nuclear shape.
Apparent scarce or absent granules (submicroscopic azurophilic granules).
Small number of abnormal promyelocytes with visible granules and/or bundles of Auer rods (faggot cells).
High leukocyte count in the peripheral blood.
Strongly positive MPO reaction in all leukemic promyelocytes.
In APL, the 
RARA
 gene on 17q12 fuses with a nuclear regulatory factor on 15q22 (
PML
 gene) resulting in a 
PML
::
RARA
 gene fusion transcript.[
24
-
26
]  Rare cases of cryptic or masked t(15;17) lack typical cytogenetic findings and involve complex variant translocations or submicroscopic insertion of the 
RARA
 gene into the 
PML
 gene, leading to the expression of the 
PML
::
RARA
 fusion transcript.[
5
]  FISH and/or RT–PCR methods may be required to unmask these cryptic genetic rearrangements.[
27
,
28
]  In approximately 1% of the patients with APL, variant chromosomal aberrations may be found in which the 
RARA
 gene is fused with other genes.[
29
]  Variant translocations involving the 
RARA
 gene include t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(5;17)(q32;q12), and t(11;17)(q13;q21).[
5
]
APL has a specific sensitivity to treatment with all-
trans
 retinoic acid (ATRA, tretinoin), which acts as a differentiating agent.[
30
-
32
]  High CR rates and long-term disease-free survival in APL may be obtained by combining ATRA treatment with chemotherapy,[
33
] or in a chemotherapy-free regimen with arsenic trioxide.[
34
] 
AML with t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3), 
MLLT3
::
KMT2A
AML with 11q23 abnormalities comprises 5% to 6% of cases of AML and is typically associated with monocytic features.  This type of AML is more common in children.  Two clinical subgroups who have a high frequency of AML with 11q23 abnormalities are infants with AML and patients with therapy-related AML, usually occurring after treatment with DNA topoisomerase inhibitors.  Patients may present with DIC and extramedullary monocytic sarcomas and/or tissue infiltration (gingiva, skin).[
5
]  
Common morphological features include: 
Monoblasts and promonocytes predominate in the bone marrow.
Monoblasts and promonocytes with strong, positive nonspecific-esterase reactions.
The 
MLLT3
 gene on 11q23, an epigenetic regulator, is involved in translocations with approximately 135 different rearrangements that have been identified.[
35
]  Genes other than 
MLLT3
 may be involved in 11q23 abnormalities.[
36
]  FISH may be required to detect genetic abnormalities involving the 
KMT2A
 gene (also known as 
MLL
).[
36
-
38
]  In general, risk categories and prognoses for individual 11q23 translocations are difficult to determine  because of the lack of studies involving significant numbers of patients; however, patients with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) have been reported to have poor outcomes.[
13
] 
AML with t(6;9)(p23;q34.1), 
DEK
::
NUP214
The t(6;9) translocation leads to the formation of a leukemia-associated DEK::NUP214 fusion protein and accounts for approximately 1% of AML cases.[
39
-
41
] NUP214 is a component of the nuclear pore complex. This subgroup of AML has been associated with a poor prognosis.[
39
,
42
,
43
] 
AML with inv(3)(q21.3;q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2),  
GATA2
, 
MECOM
The inv(3) abnormality or t(3;3) translocation occur infrequently and account for approximately 1% of all AML cases.[
41
] 
MECOM
 at chromosome 3q26 codes for two proteins, EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1, both of which are transcription regulators. The inv(3) and t(3;3) abnormalities do not lead to a fusion gene, rather they reposition the  distal GATA2 enhancer, resulting in overexpression of EVI1, and simultaneously confer GATA2 haploinsufficiency.[
44
,
45
]  These abnormalities are associated with poor prognosis.[
15
,
46
,
47
] Abnormalities involving MECOM can be detected in some AML cases with other 3q abnormalities and are also associated with poor prognosis.
AML (megakaryoblastic) with t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.3), 
RBM15
::
MKL1
The t(1;22)(p13;q13) translocation that produces the 
RBM15
::
MKL1
 fusion gene is an uncommon driver of pediatric AML (<1% of pediatric AML) and is restricted to acute megakaryocytic leukemia. For more information, see 
Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment
.
AML with 
BCR
::
ABL1
 (provisional entity)
This provisional entity was added by the WHO in 2016 in an effort to recognize that patients with the BCR::ABL1 fusion protein should be treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.[
10
] However, this entity is very difficult to distinguish from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast phase (BP-CML). Loss of IKZF1 and/or CDKN2A may help distinguish true cases of AML with 
BCR
::
ABL1
 from BP-CML.[
48
] For more information, see 
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treatment
.
AML with 
NPM1
 pathogenic variants
NPM1 is a protein that has been linked to ribosomal protein assembly and transport and is also a molecular chaperone involved in preventing protein aggregation in the nucleolus. Immunohistochemical methods can be used to accurately identify patients with 
NPM1
 pathogenic variants by the demonstration of cytoplasmic localization of NPM.[
49
] Abnormal NPM1 protein diminishes its nuclear localization and lead to impaired hematopoietic differentiation. They are primarily associated with a normal karyotype (50%), and less commonly seen in conjunction with an abnormal karyotype (<10%), or complex karyotype (<3%).[
50
-
52
] An 
NPM1
 pathogenic variant confers improved prognosis in the absence of 
FLT3
–internal tandem duplication (ITD) variants.[
50
,
53
,
54
] 
AML with biallelic 
CEBPA
 pathogenic variants
In adults younger than 60 years, 10% to 15% of cytogenetically normal AML cases have  
CEBPA
 pathogenic variants.[
53
,
55
]  The 
CEBPA
 gene is located on chromosome 19 and encodes a transcription factor that coordinates myeloid differentiation and cellular growth arrest.[
56
] 


Outcomes for patients with AML and 
CEBPA
 pathogenic variants are relatively favorable and similar to that of patients with core-binding factor leukemias.[
53
,
57
] Studies have demonstrated that AML with biallelic 
CEBPA
 variants  is independently associated with a favorable prognosis, while AML with monoallelic 
CEBPA
 variants is not.[
55
,
58
-
60
] These findings led to the WHO 2016 revision of this subtype definition to require biallelic variants.[
10
]

AML with 
RUNX1
 pathogenic variants (provisional entity)
AML with 
RUNX1
 pathogenic variants, which is a provisional entity in the 2016 WHO classification of AML and related neoplasms, denotes a distinct population of de novo AML without myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related features.[
61
] Variants in 
RUNX1
 are associated with a high risk of treatment failure.[
62
-
64
] 
AML With Myelodysplasia-Related Features
AML with myelodysplasia-related features is characterized by 20% or more blasts in the blood or bone marrow and dysplasia in two or more myeloid cell lines, generally 
including megakaryocytes.[
5
]   To make the diagnosis, dysplasia must be present in 50% or more of the cells of at least two lineages and must be present in a pretreatment bone marrow specimen or must have the presence of an MDS-related cytogenetic abnormality.[
5
]  AML with myelodysplasia-related features may occur de novo or after MDS  or a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap. The diagnostic terminology 
AML with myelodysplasia-related features evolving from a myelodysplastic syndrome
 should be used when an MDS precedes AML.[
5
] When 
NPM1
 variants or biallelic  
CEBPA
 variants are present, multilineage dysplasia alone will not classify a case as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.[
5
] For more information, see 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment
 and   
Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment
.
AML with myelodysplasia-related features occurs primarily in older patients.[
5
]  Patients with AML with myelodysplasia-related features frequently present with severe pancytopenia.  
Common morphological features include: 
Multilineage dysplasia in the blood or bone marrow.
Dysplasia in 50% or more of the cells of two or more cell lines.
Dysgranulopoiesis (neutrophils with hypogranular cytoplasm, hyposegmented nuclei or bizarrely segmented nuclei).
Dyserythropoiesis (megaloblastic nuclei, karyorrhexis, or multinucleation of erythroid precursors and ringed sideroblasts).
Dysmegakaryopoiesis (micromegakaryocytes and normal size or large megakaryocytes with monolobed or multiple separated nuclei).
Chromosome abnormalities observed in AML with myelodysplasia-related features are similar to those found in MDS and frequently involve gain or loss of major segments of certain chromosomes, predominately chromosomes 5 and/or 7. The probability of achieving a CR has been reported to be affected adversely by a diagnosis of AML with myelodysplasia-related features.[
65
-
67
]
Therapy-Related Myeloid Neoplasms
Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) include AML (t-AML) and MDS (t-MDS) that arise secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.[
5
]  The therapy-related (or secondary) MDS are included because of  their close clinicopathological relationships to therapy-related AML.  Although these therapy-related disorders can be distinguished by the specific mutagenic agents involved, this distinction may be difficult to make because of the frequent overlapping use of multiple potentially mutagenic agents in treating cancer.[
68
]    Because the associated cytogenetic abnormality, not the mutagenetic agent, determines prognosis and treatment it should be noted in the diagnosis.[
10
] 
Since t-MN have been associated with germline pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes, considering germline genetic testing or genetic counseling is warranted in those with strong family histories of cancer.[
69
] 
Alkylating agent-related t-MN
The alkylating agent/radiation-related acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes typically occur 5 to 6 years after exposure to the mutagenic agent, with a reported range of approximately 10 to 192 months.[
70
,
71
]  The risk of occurrence is related to both the total cumulative dose of the alkylating agent and the age of the patient.
Cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed in more than 90% of cases of t-MN and commonly include chromosomes 5 and/or 7.[
70
,
72
,
73
]  Complex chromosomal abnormalities (≥3 distinct abnormalities) are the most common finding.[
68
,
72
-
74
]  
Topoisomerase II inhibitor-related t-MN
Topoisomerase II inhibitor-related t-MN occurs in patients treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors.  The agents implicated are the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide and the anthracyclines doxorubicin and 4-epi-doxorubicin.[
70
] The mean latency period from the time of institution of the causative therapy to the development of t-MN is approximately 2 years.[
75
] 
As with alkylating agent/radiation-related t-MN, the cytogenetic abnormalities are often complex.[
68
,
72
-
74
] The predominant cytogenetic finding involves chromosome 11q23 abnormalities and 
KMT2A
 pathogenic variants.[
68
,
76
]  
AML, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)
Cases of AML that do not fulfill the criteria for AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, AML with myelodysplasia-related features, or t-MN fall within the category of AML, NOS.[
10
] As mentioned before, the subcategories of AML, NOS lack prognostic significance when it is unclear if 
NPM1
 and 
CEBPA
 pathogenic variants are present.[
9
]  Classification in this subset of AML is based on leukemic cell features of morphology, cytochemistry, and maturation (i.e., the FAB classification system) and include:[
5
]
	AML with minimal differentiation.
	AML without maturation.
	AML with maturation.
	Acute myelomonocytic leukemia.
Acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia.
	Pure erythroid leukemia.
	Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
	Acute basophilic leukemia.
	Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis.
Myeloid Sarcoma
Myeloid sarcoma (also known as extramedullary myeloid tumor, granulocytic sarcoma, and chloroma) is a tumor mass that consists of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells, occurring in an extramedullary site.[
5
]  Development of myeloid sarcoma has been reported  in 2% to 8% of patients with AML.[
77
]  Clinical features include occurrence common in subperiosteal bone structures of the skull, paranasal sinuses, sternum, ribs, vertebrae, and pelvis; lymph nodes, skin, mediastinum, small intestine, and the epidural space; and occurrence de novo or concomitant with AML or a myeloproliferative disorder.[
10
,
77
,
78
]
  Morphological and cytochemical features include:
Granulocytic sarcoma composed of myeloblasts, neutrophils, and neutrophil precursors with three subtypes based on degree of maturation (i.e., blastic, immature, and differentiated).
Monoblastic sarcoma preceding or occurring simultaneously with acute monoblastic leukemia.
Tumors with trilineage hematopoiesis occurring with transformation of chronic myeloproliferative disorders.
Myeloblasts and neutrophils that are positive for MPO.
Neutrophils that are positive for naphthol ASD chloroacetate esterase.
Immunophenotyping with antibodies to MPO, lysozyme, and chloroacetate is critical to the diagnosis of these lesions.[
5
]  The myeloblasts in granulocytic sarcomas express myeloid-associated antigens (CD13, CD33, CD117, and MPO). The monoblasts in monoblastic sarcomas express acute monoblastic leukemia antigens (CD14, CD116, and CD11c) and usually react with antibodies to lysozyme and CD68.  The main differential diagnosis includes non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the lymphoblastic type, Burkitt lymphoma, large-cell lymphoma, and small, round-cell tumors, especially in children (e.g., neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and medulloblastoma). When able, FISH for common chromosomal abnormalities should be completed, as well as molecular studies to refine diagnosis and aid in prognosis.
No unique chromosomal abnormalities are associated with myeloid sarcoma.[
77
,
79
]  The presence of myeloid sarcoma in patients with the otherwise good-risk t(8;21) AML may be associated with a lower CR rate and decreased remission duration.[
80
]  Myeloid sarcoma occurring in the setting of MDS or myeloproliferative disorder is equivalent to blast transformation (progression to AML).  In the case of AML, the prognosis is that of the underlying leukemia.[
10
]  Although the initial presentation of myeloid sarcoma may appear to be isolated, it is a partial manifestation of a systemic disease and should be treated with intensive chemotherapy.[

Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage
Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage are rare types of acute leukemia in which the morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic features of the blast population do not allow classification in myeloid or lymphoid categories; or the types  have morphological 
and/or 
immunophenotypic features of both myeloid and lymphoid cells or both B and T lineages (i.e., acute bilineal leukemia and acute biphenotypic leukemia).[

MPAL with t(v;11q23.3); 
KMT2A

The diagnosis of MPAL is made in leukemias with expression of antigens of more than one  lineage:[

Myeloid Lineage
MPO (flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or cytochemistry) or monocytic differentiation (≥	2 of the following: nonspecific esterase cytochemistry, CD11c, CD14, CD64, lysozyme).
T-cell Lineage
Strong cytoplasmic CD3 (with antibodies to CD3 epsilon chain) or surface CD3.
B-cell Lineage
Strong CD19 with ≥1 of the following strongly expressed: cytoplasmic CD79a, cCD22, or CD10; or weak CD19 with at least two of the following strongly expressed: CD79a, cCD22, or CD10.
Cytogenetic abnormalities are observed in a high percentage of acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.[
85
-
88
]  Approximately 33% of cases have the Philadelphia chromosome, and some cases are associated with t(4;11)(q21;q23) or other 11q23 abnormalities.  In general, the prognosis appears to be unfavorable. The occurrence of 11q23 abnormalities or 
BCR

Phases of Therapy
The treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is based on whether the disease is newly diagnosed (previously untreated), in remission, or recurrent. Also, the intensity of the treatment and the patient's overall health status are considered when choosing a treatment approach. Successful treatment of AML requires the control of
bone marrow and systemic disease, and specific treatment of central nervous
system (CNS) disease, if present.  The cornerstone of this strategy includes
systemically administered combination chemotherapy.  Because only 5% or fewer of
patients with AML develop CNS disease, prophylactic treatment is not
indicated.[
1
,
2
]
Newly diagnosed (untreated):
 Untreated AML is defined as newly diagnosed leukemia that has not been previously treated. The initial treatment for patients with newly diagnosed AML is often induction therapy that aims to induce a remission. In patients with AML, a complete remission (CR) is defined as a normal peripheral blood cell count (absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mm
3
 and platelet count >100,000/mm
3
)  and normocellular marrow with less than 5% blasts in the marrow and no signs or symptoms of the disease. In addition, no signs or symptoms are evident of CNS leukemia or other extramedullary infiltration.[
3
] 
Modifications to the definition of CR have been proposed because some responses are deeper than a CR, and others may not meet all the criteria for a complete response. In addition, most AML patients meeting the criteria for CR have residual leukemia.[
3
] 
Table 2. Treatment Response Categories for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Response Category
Definition
ANC = absolute neutrophil count; CR = complete remission; CRh = CR with partial hematologic recovery; CRi = CR with incomplete hematologic recovery;  CR
MRD−
 = CR without measurable residual disease; MLFS = morphological leukemia-free state; PR = partial remission; RT–qPCR = reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
CR
MRD−
If studied pretreatment, CR with negativity for a genetic marker by RT–qPCR, or CR with negativity by multicolor flow cytometry.
CR
Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 10
9
/L (1,000/microL); platelet count ≥100 × 10
9
/L (100,000/microL).
CRh
ANC ≥0.5 x 10
9
/L (500/microL) and platelet count ≥50 x 10
9
/L (100,000/microL); otherwise all other CR criteria met.[
4
]
CRi
All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (<1.0 × 10
9
/L [1,000/microL]) or thrombocytopenia (<100 × 10
9
/L [100,000/microL]).
MLFS
Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required.
PR
All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5 to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%.
No response
Patients evaluable for response but not meeting criteria for CR, CRh, CRi, MLFS, or PR are categorized as having no response prior to the response landmark. Patients failing to achieve response by the designated landmark are designated as having refractory disease.
In remission: 
When patients are in a remission after induction chemotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy is given, with the aim of deepening the response and consolidating the remission. Maintenance therapy is not included in most current
treatment protocols and clinical trials.  Consolidation therapy appears to be effective
when given immediately after remission is achieved.[
5
]
Persistent/recurrent disease:
 Despite intensive chemotherapy, some patients with newly diagnosed AML will not go into remission and have primary refractory disease. Also, some patients who are in a remission after induction and consolidation chemotherapy may have a return of their disease.[
3
] The rates of primary refractory disease and relapse vary with the age of the patient, genomic variants seen in the leukemia cells, and initial treatment given. 
Table 3. Treatment Response Categories for Persistent/Recurrent Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Response Category
Definition
CR = complete remission; CRh = CR with partial hematologic recovery; CRhMRD-LL =  CR with partial hematologic recovery and measurable residual disease at a low level; CRi = CR with incomplete hematologic recovery; CRiMRD-LL =  CR with incomplete hematologic recovery and measurable residual disease at a low level; CRMRD- = CR without measurable residual disease; CRMRD-LL = CR with measurable residual disease detection at a low level; MRD = measurable residual disease; MRD- = absence of measurable residual disease; MRD+ = presence of measurable residual disease; MLFS  = morphological leukemia-free state; PR = partial response; RT–qPCR = reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
Primary refractory disease
No CR, CRh, or CRi at the response landmark (i.e., after two courses of intensive induction treatment) or a defined landmark (e.g., 180 days after commencing less-intensive therapy).
Relapsed disease (after CR, CRh, or CRi)
Bone marrow blasts ≥5%; or reappearance of blasts in the blood in at least two peripheral blood samples obtained at least 1 week apart; or development of extramedullary disease.
MRD relapse (after CR, CRh, or CRi without MRD-)
Defined by one of the following:
 
Conversion from MRD- to MRD+, independent of method; 
or
 
Increase of MRD copy numbers ≥1 log
10
 between any two positive samples in patients with CRMRD-LL, CRhMRD-LL, or CRiMRD-LL by qPCR.

Either result should be rapidly confirmed in a second consecutive sample from the same tissue source.
Stable disease
Absence of CRMRD-, CR, CRi, PR, MLFS; and criteria for progressive disease not met.
Progressive disease
Evidence for an increase in bone marrow blast percentage and/or increase of absolute blast counts in the blood:

 
>50% increase in marrow blasts; 
or


 
>50% increase in peripheral blasts in the absence of differentiation syndrome; or

 
New extramedullary disease.
Supportive Care During Therapy
Because myelosuppression is an anticipated consequence of both the leukemia and
its treatment with chemotherapy, patients must be closely monitored during
therapy.  Facilities must be available for hematologic support with multiple
blood fractions, including platelet transfusions, and for the treatment
of related infectious complications.[
6
]  
Transfusion therapy
Supportive care during remission induction treatment should routinely include
red blood cell and platelet transfusions, when appropriate.[
7
,
8
]  Rapid marrow ablation
with consequent earlier marrow regeneration decreases morbidity and mortality.  
Randomized trials have shown similar
outcomes for patients who received prophylactic platelet transfusions at a
level of 10,000/mm
3
 rather than 20,000/mm
3
.[
9
]  The incidence of platelet alloimmunization was similar among
groups randomly assigned to receive pooled platelet concentrates from random
donors; filtered, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors; ultraviolet
B-irradiated, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors; or filtered
platelets obtained by apheresis from single random donors.[
10
]
No good evidence exists to support granulocyte transfusions in the treatment of AML. A multicenter randomized trial (
RING
 [NCT00627393]) was conducted to address the utility of granulocyte transfusions in the setting of infections.[
11
] There was no difference between the granulocyte and control arms for the composite primary end point of survival plus microbial response at 42 days after randomization. However, the power to detect a true beneficial effect was low because enrollment was half that of the planned study size.
Growth factors
The following growth factors have been studied in the treatment of AML:
Colony-stimulating factors:
 Granulocyte colony–stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor have been
studied in an effort to shorten the period of granulocytopenia associated with
leukemia treatment.[
12
]  If used, these agents are administered after administration
of chemotherapy.  Although the use of growth factors decreases the time to neutrophil recovery by 2 to 5 days, and decreases rates of febrile neutropenia and duration of hospitalization, randomized clinical trials have not shown an impact of growth factors on overall survival and their cost-effectiveness has been inconsistently reported.[
13
,
14
] Use of growth factors is not routinely recommended in the remission induction setting.
	Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents:
 Anemia associated with the diagnosis of AML and induction chemotherapy is managed primarily with red blood transfusions. Unlike myelodysplastic syndromes, there is no role for the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (e.g., epoetin alfa and darbepoetin) during the treatment of AML.
Thrombopoietin mimetics:
 Clinical trials have assessed the use of thrombopoietin mimetics in the treatment of AML. Eltrombopag as a single agent was tested in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase I/II trial of 98 patients with platelet counts less than 30 × 10
9
/L as a result of AML or MDS. No significant  improvements  in  platelet counts  were  recorded. Significant hemorrhage was reported in ten (16%) patients given eltrombopag and nine (26%) patients given placebo. No difference in disease progression or overall survival was observed.[
15
]
Eltrombopag appeared to hasten platelet recovery and reduce the number of platelet transfusions needed when added in an unblinded fashion to induction chemotherapy in older 
FLT3
-negative AML patients.[
16
] However, in a separate, randomized double-blind study of 148 patients, eltrombopag or placebo was added to high-dose induction chemotherapy.[
17
] The results of this study did not indicate any clinical benefit of eltrombopag over placebo. Given the minimal efficacy signal at this point, eltrombopag is not routinely recommended in the supportive care or remission induction setting.
Antimicrobial therapy
Empiric
broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy is an absolute necessity for febrile
patients who are profoundly neutropenic.[
18
,
19
]  Careful instruction in
personal hand hygiene, dental care, and recognition of early signs of infection are
appropriate in all patients.  Elaborate isolation facilities (including
filtered air, sterile food, and gut flora sterilization) are not indicated.[
20
,
21
]  Likewise, there are no advantages to eating a cooked neutropenic diet, as demonstrated in randomized trials.[
22
]  
Antibiotic prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone and antifungal prophylaxis with an oral triazole or parenteral echinocandin is appropriate for patients with expected prolonged, profound neutropenia (<100/mm
3
 for 2 weeks for profound neutropenia lasting >7 days).[
23
] Unlike patients undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, 
Pneumocystis jirovecii
 prophylaxis is not routinely employed.
Nucleoside analog-based antiviral prophylaxis, such as acyclovir, is appropriate  for patients who are seropositive for herpes simplex virus undergoing induction chemotherapy.[

Treatment of Newly Diagnosed AML


In This Section
Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed (Untreated; Remission Induction) AML
Chemotherapy
Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed (Untreated; Remission Induction) AML
Treatment options for newly diagnosed (untreated; remission induction) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) include:
Chemotherapy
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy for AML is divided into the following two general categories:
	Intensive remission-induction chemotherapy. 
	Nonintensive chemotherapy. 
One of the following combination chemotherapy regimens may be used as intensive remission induction therapy:
Cytarabine plus daunorubicin.[
1
,
2
]

Cytarabine plus idarubicin.[
3
-
6
]

Cytarabine plus mitoxantrone.[
7
]
Cytarabine plus anthracycline plus midostaurin.[
8
] 
	Cytarabine plus anthracycline plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin.[
9
] 
	Liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351).[
10
] 
Intrathecal cytarabine or methotrexate may be used to treat central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, if present.
The two-drug regimen of cytarabine given as a continuous infusion for 7 days and a 3-day course of anthracycline  (the so-called 7 + 3 induction therapy) results in a complete response rate of approximately 65%.  In most instances, there is no further clinical benefit when adding potentially non-cross−resistant drugs (such as fludarabine, topoisomerase inhibitors, thioguanine, mitoxantrone, histone deacetylases inhibitors, or clofarabine) to a 7 + 3 regimen. Cladribine, when added to 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy, showed improved remission rates [
11
] and survival rates [
12
] across two randomized controlled trials, but this regimen has not been widely adopted in the absence of confirmatory trials. The addition of midostaurin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin to intensive induction chemotherapy is discussed below.
The choice of anthracycline and the dose-intensity of anthracycline may influence the survival of patients with AML. Idarubicin appeared to be more effective than
daunorubicin, particularly in younger adults, although the doses of idarubicin and daunorubicin may not have
been equivalent.[
3
-
6
]  No significant survival difference between daunorubicin and
mitoxantrone has been reported.[
13
]
Selection of an anthracycline
 At present, there is no conclusive evidence to recommend one anthracycline over another. 
Evidence (anthracyclines):
In a systematic review and meta-analysis, 18 randomized controlled trials that included 6,755 patients assessed the use of idarubicin versus daunorubicin as part of induction chemotherapy.[
14
] 
The use of idarubicin led to improved outcomes, including overall survival (OS), when compared with daunorubicin (12 studies, 5,976 patients; hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84−0.96; 
P
 = .0008). However, there was an increased risk of death during induction (14 studies, 6,349 patients; relative risk [RR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01−1.36; 
P
 = .03) and mucositis (five studies, 2,000 patients; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04−1.44; 
P
 = .02) with idarubicin as compared with daunorubicin. Moreover, the survival benefit for idarubicin was no longer present if a daunorubicin dose of at least 180 mg/m
2
 was used (four studies, 2,867 patients; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82−1.00; 
P
 = .06).
In patients aged 60 years and younger, outcomes for those who received daunorubicin (90 mg/m
2
/dose, total induction dosing at 270 mg/m
2
) were superior to those who received more traditional dosing (45 mg/m
2
/dose; total dose = 135 mg/m
2
). The complete remission (CR) rate was 71% versus 57% (
P
 < .001), and the median survival was 24 months versus 16 months (
P
 = .003).[
15
]
No randomized comparison data between daunorubicin at 270 mg/m
2
 and daunorubicin at 180 mg/m
2
, or between daunorubicin at 270 mg/m
2
 and idarubicin, are available.  
Addition of an FLT3 inhibitor
Variants in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the 
FLT3
 gene are frequent in AML and are often associated with an inferior outcome.
Midostaurin
Evidence (midostaurin):
A multicenter, randomized, phase III trial (
NCT00651261
) included patients with 
FLT3
-altered AML. Patients received either the FLT3/multikinase inhibitor, midostaurin, or placebo in addition to cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy. The addition of midostaurin led to improved survival (median, 75 vs. 26 months; HR for death, 0.78; one-sided 
P
 = .009).[
8
]
The event-free survival (defined as the time from randomization to relapse, death from any cause, or failure to achieve protocol-specified CR) was improved for patients in the midostaurin arm (HR for event or death, 0.78; one-sided 
P
 = .002), and the survival benefit was consistent across all 
FLT3
 variant subtypes. The rates of CR (59% vs. 54%) and time to neutrophil count recovery were similar between the two arms.[
8
][
Level of evidence A1
]  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved midostaurin in combination with induction therapy for patients with AML and any 
FLT3
 variant.
Quizartinib
Evidence (quizartinib):
A multicenter, randomized, phase III trial (
NCT02668653
) included patients with 
FLT3
-ITD–altered AML. Patients received either the selective ITD-specific FLT3 inhibitor, quizartinib, or placebo in addition to cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy. The addition of quizartinib  led to improved survival (median, 31.9 vs. 15.1 months; HR for death, 0.78; 
P
 = .032).[
16
]
	The EFS (defined as the time from randomization to lack of CR within 42 days from the start of the last induction cycle, relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first) was similar for patients in the quizartinib and placebo arms (HR for event or death, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.75–1.11; 
P
 = .24). The rates of CR and time to neutrophil count recovery were similar between the two arms.[
16
][
Level of evidence A1
]
	The FDA approved quizartinib in combination with induction therapy for patients with AML and an 
FLT3
-ITD variant but not for patients with other 
FLT3
 variants, such as 
FLT3
-TKD.
The addition of an FLT3 inhibitor to induction chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with 
FLT3
-altered AML who are eligible for intensive chemotherapy. An ongoing study (
NCT03836209
) is evaluating which FLT3 inhibitor is best for patients with 
FLT3
-ITD AML receiving up-front chemotherapy. Additional studies are evaluating FLT3 inhibitors in combination with hypomethylating agents and venetoclax in patients who are not candidates for intensive therapy.
Addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin
Evidence (gemtuzumab ozogamicin):
In a meta-analysis of more than 3,000 patients, the addition of the CD33-directed immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin to cytarabine plus anthracycline or clofarabine plus anthracycline led to a small increase in the OS rate at 5 years (30.7% vs. 34.6%; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82−0.98; 
P
  = .01).[
9
]  
The improvement in the 5-year OS rate was seen across all ages, but this effect was greatest in patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics (55.2% vs. 76.3%; HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31−0.73; 
P
 = .0005), and to a lesser extent with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (34.1% vs. 39.4%; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75−0.95; 
P
 = .007). It was not seen in patients with an adverse-risk karyotype.[

] 
In contrast, gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not improve the 1-year survival rate of older patients who received low-dose cytarabine, although the CR rate increased from 17% to 30% (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32–0.73; 
P
 = .006).[
17
] 
The FDA  label for gemtuzumab ozogamicin includes a boxed warning about the risk of hepatotoxicity, including severe or fatal hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.
Liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351)
CPX-351 is a two-drug liposomal encapsulation that delivers cytarabine and daunorubicin at a fixed 5:1 synergistic molar ratio.
Evidence (CPX-351):
A multicenter trial investigated CPX-351 in patients aged 60 to 75 years with therapy-related AML, AML with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.[
10
] 
Compared with 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy, CPX-351 resulted in a better overall remission rate (47.7% vs. 33.3%; 
P
 = .016), and improved median OS (9.56 vs. 5.95 months; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52−0.90; 
P
 = .003).[

Level of evidence A1
] 
The rates of early mortality and toxicities were similar between the two arms. However, the median time to recovery of neutrophils and platelets was longer for CPX-351 (35.0 and 36.5 days, respectively) as compared with 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy (29 and 29 days, respectively).
Older adults or adults with significant comorbid conditions
Some patients may decline or be too frail for intensive induction chemotherapy. Low-dose cytarabine, decitabine, azacitidine, or best supportive care can be considered equivalently effective treatment approaches for older patients with AML who decline traditional 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy. Unlike a succinct course of 7 + 3 induction, these less-intensive therapies are continued indefinitely, as long as the patient is deriving benefit (i.e., until disease progression or significant toxicity occurs). 
One of the following chemotherapy regimens may be used as less-intensive therapy:
	Hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine).
	Low-dose cytarabine.
	Venetoclax plus hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine.
	Glasdegib plus low-dose cytarabine.
	Ivosidenib with or without azacitidine.
	Enasidenib.
	Intrathecal cytarabine or methotrexate may be used to treat CNS leukemia, if present.
Evidence (chemotherapy for patients who decline intensive remission induction therapy):
Hypomethylating agents: 
The hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine are used commonly in this population of older patients, particularly in the United States. Although approval of the drugs by the FDA is for an MDS  indication, the registration studies leading to approval included patients with 20% to 30% myeloblasts, or what would now be considered oligoblastic AML.[
18
,
19
]
	Azacitidine:
 An international phase III trial (
NCT01074047
) randomly assigned patients  with AML who were 65 years or older to receive either azacitidine or conventional regimens (7 + 3 induction, low-dose cytarabine, or best supportive care alone).[
20
] 
Azacitidine led to a median OS of 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0−12.7) as compared with 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.0−8.6) with conventional regimens (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69−1.03; 
P
 = .1009).[
20
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Decitabine: 
One phase III trial randomly assigned 485 patients with AML who were older than 65 years to receive either decitabine (n = 242) or their preferred choice (n = 243) of either supportive care (n = 28) or low-dose cytarabine (n = 215).[
21
]
Although rates of CR + CRp (CR with incomplete platelet recovery) were more than double in the decitabine arm (17.8%) compared with the treatment-choice arm (7.8%) (
P
 = .001), median OS was not significantly improved for patients receiving decitabine (7.7 months) compared with the treatment of choice (5.0 months) (HR for death for decitabine, 0.85; 95% CI, .69–1.04; 
P
 = .11).
Compared with treatment for 5 consecutive days, treatment for 10 consecutive days may lead to higher response rates, particularly in those with 
TP53
 variants and/or unfavorable cytogenetic features.[

Low-dose cytarabine: 
 Older adults who decline intensive remission-induction therapy or are considered ineligible for intensive remission-induction therapy may derive benefit from low-dose cytarabine, administered  twice daily for 10 days in cycles repeated every 4 to 6 weeks.[
23
] 
  The CR rate using this regimen was 18% compared with 1% for patients treated with hydroxyurea (
P
 = .006).
Survival with low-dose cytarabine was better than was survival with hydroxyurea (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; 
P
 = .009).[

Venetoclax plus hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine:
 The FDA approved venetoclax, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, in combination with low-dose cytarabine or a hypomethylating agent for the treatment of AML in patients aged 75 years or older, and those who cannot undergo 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy because of comorbidities. Approval was granted based on the results of two studies.
The first study (
NCT02203773
) was a nonrandomized, open-label, phase Ib clinical trial of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine.[
24
] 
In this study, 35 (61%; 95% CI, 47.6%−74.0%) of 57 patients had CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). The median duration of response for all patients with a response (CR + CRi + partial remission [PR]) was 8.4 months (range, 4.7−11.7; n = 36).
	The second study (
NCT02287233
) was a phase I/IIb study of venetoclax in combination with low-dose cytarabine in 82 patients with newly diagnosed AML, including patients with previous exposure to a hypomethylating agent for an antecedent hematologic disorder such as MDS.[
25
] 
In the 82 patients enrolled in the study, the CR/CRi rate was 54% (95% CI, 42%−65%), with a median duration of remission of 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.3−14.9 months). The median OS for all patients, irrespective of response, was 10.1 months (95% CI, 5.7−14.2 months). 
The most common adverse events with venetoclax combinations are gastrointestinal symptoms and myelosuppression, which may require delays between cycles, growth factor support, or decreased duration of venetoclax administration per cycle. Additionally, appropriate prophylactic measures are typically taken to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.[

Glasdegib plus low-dose cytarabine:
 Glasdegib, an oral inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, combined with low-dose cytarabine was compared with low-dose cytarabine alone in a randomized, phase II open-label study that included 116 patients with AML who were aged 75 years or older or who had severe comorbid conditions (cardiac disease, renal impairment, or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2).[
26
] 
Of the 78 patients with AML who received glasdegib plus low-dose cytarabine, 24% (n = 19) of patients had a CR or  CRi compared with 5%  (2 of 38) of patients who received low-dose cytarabine alone. The median OS was 8.3 months (80%; CI, 6.6–9.5) for patients who received glasdegib/low-dose cytarabine and 4.3 months (80%; CI, 2.9–4.9) for patients who received low-dose cytarabine alone in patients with AML (HR, 0.46; 80% CI, 0.35–0.62; 
P
 = .0002).[

Level of evidence A1
]
Similar to venetoclax, the FDA approved glasdegib  in combination with low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of AML in patients aged 75 years or older or who are unable to receive intensive induction chemotherapy.
	Ivosidenib:
 For older or frail patients with AML and 
IDH1
 variants, the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib is an option. The FDA approved ivosidenib alone or in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of AML that has a susceptible 
IDH1
 variant (detected by an FDA-approved diagnostic test) in adults aged 75 years or older with newly diagnosed AML or who have comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Within the context of a phase I study, 34 patients with newly diagnosed 
IDH1
-altered AML who were not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy were treated with single-agent ivosidenib.[
27
]
Differentiation syndrome was reported in 6 patients (18%), but did not require treatment discontinuation. 
The rate of CR plus CRi was 42.4% (95% CI, 25.5%−60.8%), with a median duration of response that was not reached (lower bound of the 95% CI was 4.6 months). 
For all 34 patients on the study, the median OS was 12.6 months (95% CI, 4.5−25.7).[
27
][
Level of evidence C3
]
The combination of azacitidine and ivosidenib was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML who were not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The intention-to-treat analysis included 72 patients treated with azacitidine and ivosidenib and 74 patients treated with azacitidine and placebo. A supplemental new drug application for ivosidenib in combination with azacitidine for patients with untreated 
IDH1
-altered AML is under priority review with the FDA.[
28
]
At a median follow-up of 12.4 months, the primary end point of EFS was improved in patients who received azacitidine and ivosidenib, compared with patients who received azacitidine and placebo (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16–0.69).
	The median OS was 24 months for patients who received azacitidine and ivosidenib and 7.9 months for patients who received azacitidine and placebo (HR for death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27–0.73).
	Differentiation syndrome occurred in 14% of patients who received azacitidine and ivosidenib and 8% of patients who received azacitidine and placebo. The incidence of bleeding events was 41% with azacitidine and ivosidenib and 29% with azacitidine and placebo. Infection of any grade was seen in 28% of patients who received azacitidine and ivosidenib and 49% of patients who received azacitidine and placebo.

] 
Of the 39 patients enrolled, seven (18%) had CR, one (3%) had CRi, and two (5%) had a PR.

Treatment of AML in Remission


In This Section
Chemotherapy
Maintenance Therapy
Midostaurin
Oral azacitidine
Hematopoietic Cell (Bone Marrow or Stem Cell) Transplant
Allogeneic HCT
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant
Current Clinical Trials
Although individual patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been reported to have long disease-free
survival  (DFS) or cure with a single cycle of chemotherapy,[
1
] consolidation therapy
is always indicated in therapy that is planned with curative intent.  In a
small randomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, all
patients who did not receive consolidation therapy experienced a relapse after
a short median complete remission (CR) duration.[
2
]  

Treatment options for AML in remission (consolidation phase) include:
Chemotherapy
 with short-term (3−4 cycles), relatively intensive chemotherapy
with cytarabine-based regimens similar to standard induction clinical trials
(consolidation chemotherapy) and consolidation chemotherapy with more
dose-intensive cytarabine-based treatment.
	Maintenance therapy
 (longer-term therapy at lower doses) has not been shown to benefit AML patients in a number of studies, but two strategies have shown a benefit:
 
Midostaurin
 in patients with 
FLT3
-altered AML. 
 
Oral azacitidine
.

Hematopoietic cell (bone marrow or stem cell) transplant
.
High-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue.
High-dose
marrow-ablative or reduced-intensity therapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
Chemotherapy
Nontransplant consolidation therapy using cytarabine-containing regimens has
treatment-related death rates that are usually less than 10% to 20% and has
reported long-term DFS rates from 20% to 50%.[
3
-
6
]  The optimal doses,
schedules, and duration of consolidation chemotherapy have not been determined.
The standard consolidation therapy for AML patients in remission is high-dose cytarabine; however, there exists some controversy about whether it benefits all younger AML patients in first complete response versus selected subgroups, such as those with core-binding factor abnormalities.[
7
-
11
]  The duration of consolidation therapy has
ranged from one cycle [
4
,
6
] to four or more cycles.[
3
,
5
]
Evidence (chemotherapy):
A large,
randomized trial  that compared three different cytarabine-containing
consolidation therapy regimens showed a clear benefit in survival to patients younger
than 60 years who received high-dose cytarabine.[
3
]
Intensification of
cytarabine dose or duration of consolidation chemotherapy with conventionally dosed cytarabine did not improve DFS or overall survival (OS) in patients aged 60 years or older, as evidenced in the Medical Research Council (MRC-LEUK-AML11) trial.[
12
,
13
]
Dose-intensive cytarabine-based chemotherapy can be complicated by severe
neurological [
14
] and/or pulmonary toxic effects [
15
] and should be administered
by physicians experienced in these regimens at centers that are equipped to
treat potential complications.  In a retrospective analysis of 256 patients
who received high-dose bolus cytarabine at a single institution, the most
powerful predictor of cytarabine neurotoxicity was renal insufficiency.  The
incidence of neurotoxicity was significantly greater in patients treated with
twice daily doses of 3 g/m
2
/dose when compared with 2
g/m
2
/dose.
Maintenance Therapy
While a number of older studies have included longer-term therapy at lower doses (maintenance), there has been no convincing evidence that maintenance therapy provides prolonged DFS or OS. However, maintenance therapy with midostaurin or oral azacitidine may improve outcomes.
Midostaurin
Evidence (midostaurin):
Variants in the tyrosine kinase domain and internal tandem duplications of the 
FLT3
 gene are frequent in AML and are often associated with an inferior outcome.
In the multicenter, randomized, phase III 
RATIFY
 trial (NCT00651261), the FLT3/multikinase inhibitor midostaurin plus cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy was compared with placebo in patients with 
FLT3
-altered AML.[
16
][
Level of evidence A1
]
	The addition of the FLT3/multikinase inhibitor midostaurin to cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy led to improved survival (median, 75 vs. 26 months; hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.78; one-sided 
P
 = .009).
Patients who remained in remission after completion of consolidation therapy entered a maintenance phase in which they received midostaurin or placebo, administered at a dose of 50 mg orally twice daily, for twelve 28-day cycles. A maintenance regimen was administered for the full 12 cycles in 120 patients (69 in the midostaurin group, and 51 in the placebo group). 
An ad-hoc landmark analysis from the end of maintenance revealed no difference in DFS between the two arms. Moreover, from the start of maintenance therapy there was no difference in OS between the two arms.[
17
] 
While maintenance was well tolerated in the RATIFY study, only a small subset of patients tolerated midostaurin as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy or transplant in a separate phase II study.[
18
]
	In the multicenter, randomized phase II 
RADIUS
 trial (NCT01883362), the addition of midostaurin to standard of care was compared with standard of care alone after allogeneic HCT.[
19
] Similar to the RATIFY trial, midostaurin was administered at a dose of 50 mg orally twice daily, for twelve 28-day cycles. Thirty patients were enrolled in each arm, but only half were able to complete the entire 12 cycles of therapy. 
The estimated 18-month relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 89% in the midostaurin arm and 76% in the standard of care arm (HR, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12−1.86; 
P
 = 0.27). The predicted relative reduction in the risk of relapse with the addition of midostaurin was 54%.[

Oral azacitidine
Evidence (oral azacitidine): 
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III 
QUAZAR AML-001
 trial (NCT01757535) provided the basis for regulatory approval of oral azacitidine as maintenance therapy for AML.[
20
] The study included 472 patients with AML who were aged 55 years or older, were within 4 months of first CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery after induction chemotherapy with or without consolidation treatment, and were not candidates for allogeneic HCT. Oral azacitidine or placebo was administered at 300 mg daily for 14 days every 28 days. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
For patients who received azacitidine, the median OS from randomization was 24.7 months (95% CI, 18.7−30.5) compared with 14.8 months (95% CI, 11.7−17.6) for patients receiving placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55−0.86; 
P

Allogeneic HCT
Allogeneic HCT, even with minimal conditioning chemotherapy, results in the lowest incidence of
leukemic relapse, even when compared with HCT from an
identical twin (syngeneic HCT).  This finding led to the
concept of an immunologic graft-versus-leukemia effect, similar to (and related
to) graft-versus-host disease.  The improvement in freedom from relapse using
allogeneic HCT as the primary consolidation therapy is
offset, at least in part, by the increased morbidity and mortality caused by
graft-versus-host disease, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, and
infection.  The DFS  rates using allogeneic
transplant in first complete remission have ranged from 45% to 60%.[

24
] 

The use of allogeneic HCT in adults requires either a HLA-matched
sibling donor, an HLA-matched unrelated donor, a haploidentical donor (“half HLA-matched”), or two well-matched umbilical cord blood units.  Including patients who underwent HCT from 2007 to 2017, the 3-year probabilities of survival after HLA-matched sibling transplant were 59% (±1%) for patients with early disease, 53% (±1%) for patients with intermediate disease, and 29% (±1%) for patients with advanced disease, according to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry.[
24
] The probabilities of survival after an unrelated donor transplant were 53% (±1%) for patients with early disease, 50% (±1%) for intermediate disease, and 27% (±1%)  for patients with advanced disease. [
Level of evidence C1
]
Because HCT can cure more than 30% of patients who
experience relapse after chemotherapy, some investigators suggested that
allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) can be reserved for early first relapse
or second CR without compromising the number of patients who
are ultimately cured.[
25
]  Clinical and cytogenetic information can
define certain subsets of patients with predictable better or worse prognoses
according to favorable- and adverse-risk factors in those using consolidation chemotherapy.[
26
]  
Favorable-risk AML:
 Favorable-risk factors include t(8;21),
inv(16), normal karyotype with an 
NPM1
 variant (in absence of an 
FLT3
 variant), and normal karyotype with double cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine (CCAAT)-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-alpha variants. Patients in the favorable-risk group have a reasonable chance of cure with intensive
consolidation chemotherapy, and it may be reasonable to defer transplant in that group
until early first relapse.  
Adverse-risk AML:
 Adverse-risk factors include deletion of 5q, 7q, 17p, inversion of 3 or t(3;3), abnormality of (17p), trisomy 8, t(6;9),
t(9;22), most translocations involving chromosome 11q23, 
KMT2A
 variants,  a complex or monosomal karyotype, a history of myelodysplasia or antecedent hematologic disorder, 
TP53
 variants, 
RUNX1
 variants, 
ASXL1
 variants, and normal karyotype with 
FLT3
 variants. 
The adverse-risk group is highly unlikely to be cured with
consolidation chemotherapy, and allogeneic BMT in first CR is a reasonable option for patients.  However, even with allogeneic stem cell transplant, the
outcome for patients with high-risk AML is poor (5-year DFS
rate of 8% to 30% for patients with treatment-related leukemia or
myelodysplasia).[
27
]
Normal cytogenetics:
 Patients with normal cytogenetics are in an intermediate-risk
group, and consolidation management should be individualized based on additional molecular markers, patient comorbid factors, and patient preference or, preferably, managed according to a clinical trial.

A common clinical trial design used to evaluate the benefit of allogeneic transplant as consolidation therapy for AML in first remission is the so-called 
donor-no donor
 comparison.  In this design, newly diagnosed AML patients who achieve a CR are deemed medically eligible for allogeneic transplant and undergo HLA typing.  If a matched sibling or matched unrelated donor is identified, the patient is allocated to the transplant arm.  Analysis of outcome is by intention to treat; that is, patients assigned to the donor arm who do not receive a transplant are grouped in the analysis with the patients who did actually receive a transplant.  RFS is the usual end point for this type of trial.  OS from the time of diagnosis is less frequently reported in these trials.  
  Investigators attempted to address this issue with a meta-analysis using data from 18 separate prospective trials of AML patients using the 
donor-no donor
 design, with data from an additional six trials included for sensitivity analysis.[
28
]   The trials included in this meta-analysis enrolled adult patients aged 60 years and younger from 1982 to 2006.  Median follow-up ranged from 42 months to 142 months.  Preparative regimens were similar among the different trials.  Allogeneic transplant was compared with autologous transplant (six trials) or with a variety of consolidation chemotherapy regimens, with high-dose cytarabine being the most common.
Treatment-related mortality ranged from 5% to 42% in the donor groups compared with 3% to 27% in the no-donor group.
Of 18 trials reporting RFS across all cytogenetic risk groups, the combined HR for overall RFS benefit with allogeneic transplant was 0.80, indicating a statistically significant reduction in death or relapse in a first CR.
Of the 15 trials reporting OS across all cytogenetic risk groups, the combined HR for OS was 0.90, again indicating a statistically significant reduction in death or relapse in a first CR.
In subgroup analysis according to cytogenetic risk , there was no RFS or OS benefit of allogeneic transplant for patients with favorable-risk AML (RFS: HR, 1.07; 95% CI,  0.83–1.38; 
P
 = .59; OS: HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.64–1.76; 
P
 = .81).  However, a transplant benefit was seen for patients with intermediate (RFS: HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.93; 
P
 < .01; OS: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71–0.99; 
P
 = .03) or adverse-risk  cytogenetics (RFS: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90; 
P
 < .01; OS: HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40–0.90; 
P 
= .01).[
28
][
Level of evidence B4
] The conclusion from this meta-analysis was that allogeneic transplant from a sibling donor in a first CR is justified on the basis of improved RFS and OS for patients with intermediate- or adverse-risk, but not favorable-risk, cytogenetics.
An important caveat to this analysis is that induction and consolidation strategies for AML among studies included in the meta-analysis were not uniform; nor were definitions of cytogenetic risk groups uniform. This may have resulted in inferior survival rates among chemotherapy-only treated patients. 
Most physicians who treat patients with leukemia agree that transplant should be offered to AML patients in first CR in the setting of adverse-risk cytogenetics  and should not be offered to patients in first CR with favorable-risk cytogenetics.[
26
] However, older patients with favorable-risk AML who are unlikely to tolerate intensive cytarabine-based consolidation therapy can be considered for allogeneic HCT as consolidation therapy.[
29
]
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant
The role of autologous transplant for AML patients has diminished over time because of the improvements in the nonrelapse mortality associated with allogeneic HCT,  as well as the advent of haploidentical and umbilical cord transplant expanding the potential donor pool so that nearly every patient has a donor.[
30
-
33
]  Autologous HCT can yield DFS rates
between 35% and 50% in patients with AML in first remission.  Autologous HCT has also cured a smaller proportion of patients in second
remission.[
34
-
40
]  Treatment-related mortality rates of patients who have had
autologous peripheral blood or marrow transplant range from 10% to 20%.

Chemotherapy
Intensive salvage chemotherapy
A number of intensive salvage chemotherapy regimens have  demonstrated efficacy in recurrent AML, including:
Fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG)
FLAG has shown antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed and refractory AML.
Evidence (FLAG):
A multicenter phase II study included 83 patients with relapsed or refractory AML or de novo refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. The primary end point was the rate of complete remission (CR) achieved after one or two courses of FLAG induction chemotherapy.[
3
] 
In patients with relapsed leukemia whose first remission lasted for 6 months or more, the CR rate was 81% (17 of 21 patients). 
In patients with AML whose first remission lasted less than 6 months, or in patients with primary refractory disease, the CR rate was 30% (13 of 44 patients).[

Myelosuppression and mucositis were common therapy-related toxicities.
Idarubicin has been added to this regimen as well (FLAG-Ida).[

Mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC)
Evidence (MEC):
A study evaluated  one course of MEC chemotherapy in 74 patients with AML and a poor prognosis. The population included 30 patients with relapsed AML, 28 patients with primary refractory AML, and 16 patients with secondary AML.[

A phase III randomized Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (E-2995) assessed 129 patients with one of the following disease statuses: relapsed AML less than 6 months after first CR; relapsed AML after allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplant;  second or greater AML relapse; primary induction failure; secondary AML; or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive MEC with or without valspodar, a multidrug resistance modulator.
The  complete response rate was only 17% to 25% in both arms.[

Treatment was successful in 50% to 60% of patients who
experienced relapse after initially obtaining a CR, with 62.5% of patients with AML in first relapse achieving M1 marrow.[

Reduced-intensity therapy, including targeted therapy
Patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo intensive therapy can be treated with reduced-intensity therapies.
Gilteritinib
Gilteritinib is an oral FLT3 inhibitor with activity in both internal tandem duplication (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) subtypes.  
Evidence (gilteritinib):
In a phase III trial, 371 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib or preselected salvage chemotherapy (MEC, FLAG-Ida, azacitidine, or low-dose cytarabine).[
16
,
17
]
With a median follow-up of 37.1 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.3 months for patients who received gilteritinib versus 5.6 months for patients who received chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.665; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.85). The estimated OS rate at 2 years was 20.6% (95% CI, 15.8%–26.0%) for patients who received gilteritinib and 14.2% (95% CI, 8.3%–21.6%) for patients who received chemotherapy.[
16
] Among those treated with gilteritinib, the median duration of complete response or complete response with partial hematologic recovery was 10 months (interquartile range [IQR], 2.08–not evaluable), and 23 months (IQR, 4.9–not evaluable) for just those achieving a complete response.[
17
] 
The rates of complete response and complete response with partial hematologic recovery were higher in patients who received gilteritinib than in patients who received chemotherapy (34% vs. 15.3%; HR, 18.6; 95% CI, 9.8–27.4). 
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were less common in patients who received gilteritinib when adjusted for exposure time.[
16
][
Level of evidence A1
] The most common adverse event of interest was increased liver transaminases for patients who received gilteritinib therapy. If liver transaminase levels (considered related to treatment) increase to more than 5 times the upper limit of normal, gilteritinib therapy is paused. When the enzymes return to less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, therapy can resume at a reduced dose of 80 mg once daily.[

Enasidenib
Enasidenib is an oral small molecule inhibitor with activity against the altered IDH2 enzyme.
Evidence (enasidenib):
In a phase I/II study, 214 patients with relapsed or refractory AML were treated with enasidenib.[
18
]
The overall response rate was 40.3% (95% CI, 33.0%–48.0%), with a median response duration of 5.8 months. 
This included 46 patients (26.1%) with a CR or a CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). 
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events included indirect hyperbilirubinemia (12%) and differentiation syndrome (7%). As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a 
boxed warning
 to enasidenib, which alerts prescribers that differentiation syndrome can occur.[

]
Ivosidenib
Ivosidenib is an oral small molecule inhibitor with activity against the altered IDH1 enzyme.
Evidence (ivosidenib):
In a phase I/II study, 179 patients with relapsed or refractory AML were treated with ivosidenib.[
19
]
The overall response rate was 39.1% (95% CI, 31.9%–46.7%) with a median duration response of 6.5 months (range, 4.6–9.3). This included 54 patients (30.2%) with a CR or a CRi.
Over one-third of patients who initially required transfusions became transfusion independent. 
Grade 3 or higher prolongation of the QT interval was seen in 14 patients (7.8%), and grade 3 or higher differentiation was seen in 7 patients (3.9%). The FDA added a 
boxed warning
 to ivosidenib, which alerts prescribers that differentiation syndrome can occur.[

Revumenib
Revumenib is an oral menin inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute leukemia with a 
KMT2A
 translocation in adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older.
	In the phase I/II 
AUGMENT-101
 study (NCT04065399), 104 patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia with a 
KMT2A
 rearrangement received revumenib. 	Patients had to have a corrected QT interval (QTc) using Fridericia's formula of less than 450 milliseconds at baseline.[
20
]
	The overall rate of CR plus CRh (complete remission with partial hematologic recovery) was 21.2% (95% CI, 13.8%–30.3%). The median duration of CR plus CRh was 6.4 months (95% CI, 2.7–not reached).[
20
][
Level of evidence C3
]
	Of the 83 patients who were dependent on red blood cell and/or platelet transfusions, 14% became independent of transfusions during a 56-day postbaseline period. 
	Revumenib has a 
boxed warning
 for differentiation syndrome, which was observed in 29% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 differentiation syndrome was observed in 13% of patients, and one patient died (0.7%). 
	Grade 3 or higher QTc prolongation was observed in 12% of patients. 
Because revumenib is metabolized by CYP3A4, the dose must be reduced in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. The standard dose for patients who weigh more than 40 kg is 270 mg orally twice daily, with a dose reduction to 160 mg orally twice daily for patients receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Furthermore, the dose is adjusted according to body surface area in patients who weigh less than 40 kg.
Hypomethylating agents
Evidence (hypomethylating agents):
In a retrospective analysis, 655 patients with relapsed or primary treatment-refractory AML received either azacitidine (57%) or decitabine (43%).[
21
]
Overall, 16% of patients achieved a CR or a CRi and experienced a median OS of 21 months.[

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin
The antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been evaluated in patients who had relapsed AML and expressed CD33.  
Evidence (gemtuzumab ozogamicin):
A pooled analysis of three open-label, single-arm, phase II studies included 277 patients.[
22
]
The overall response rate was 26%.  Thirty-five patients (13%) achieved a CR and 36 patients (13%) achieved a CR without platelet recovery.  It is unclear whether the inadequate platelet
recovery was the result of  megakaryocyte toxic effects of gemtuzumab or subclinical
residual leukemia.  [
22
]
The long-term outcomes of patients who receive gemtuzumab and achieve CR without platelet recovery
are unclear.  Gemtuzumab induces profound bone
marrow aplasia similar to leukemia induction chemotherapy and also has
substantial hepatic toxic effects, including hepatic veno-occlusive
disease.[

Clofarabine with or without cytarabine
Evidence (clofarabine with or without cytarabine):
Clofarabine, a purine nucleoside analogue, was studied as a single agent in 62 patients with relapsed or refractory AML.[
23
]
Eight of 19 patients who received treatment for their first relapse experienced a complete response.
 
Clofarabine was administered in combination with intermediate-dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.[

Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
When patients with relapsed disease are treated aggressively, they may have extended
disease-free survival (DFS); however, patients with relapsed disease can only be cured with HCT.[

Evidence (allogeneic HCT):
	Current transplant outcomes are reported by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry. The group reported the following outcomes for transplants done in the United States between 2008 and 2018:[

	The 3-year survival rate was 53% for patients with AML in second or subsequent CR versus 31% for patients with relapsed disease (or never in a CR) who underwent a matched sibling donor transplant.
The 3-year survival rate was 50% for patients with AML in second or subsequent CR versus 30% for patients with relapsed disease (or who never achieved CR) who underwent a matched unrelated donor transplant.
Allogeneic HCT can
be effective salvage therapy in some patients whose disease fails to go into remission with intensive
chemotherapy (primary refractory leukemia).  A number of retrospective studies have demonstrated the ability of allogeneic HCT to induce remission in primary refractory disease.[
28
]
Evidence (allogeneic HCT to induce remission):
 In one retrospective analysis of 168 patients with AML and primary refractory disease who underwent allogeneic HCT, the 5-year OS rate was 22%.[

Another analysis was conducted among patients enrolled in a prospective cooperative group trial, 
SWOG S0106
 (NCT00085709).[

] 
Of the 589 patients treated in the cooperative group trial, 150 (25%) had primary refractory disease.
Among the 64 patients with primary refractory disease who received an allogeneic HCT, the 4-year survival rate was 48% compared with 4% among the 86 patients who did not undergo transplant.[

Treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL)


In This Section
Treatment of Newly Diagnosed APL
ATRA plus ATO for low- to intermediate-risk disease
ATRA plus chemotherapy, followed by ATO-based consolidation therapy for high-risk disease
Treatment of Recurrent APL
ATO with or without chemotherapy
HCT
Current Clinical Trials
Special consideration must be given to induction therapy for APL.  Treatment is centered around the use of differentiating agents to clear the leukemic cells. Early mortality is related to bleeding, differentiation syndrome, or infection. High complete remission (CR) rates are very common across treatment regimens, and persistent disease or relapse is rare.
Treatment of Newly Diagnosed APL
Treatment options for newly diagnosed APL include:
 
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) for low- to intermediate-risk disease
.
	ATRA plus chemotherapy, followed by ATO-based consolidation therapy for high-risk disease
.
ATRA induces terminal differentiation of the
leukemic cells followed by restoration of nonclonal hematopoiesis. 
Administration of ATRA leads to rapid resolution of coagulopathy in most patients, and heparin administration is not required in patients
receiving ATRA.  However, randomized trials have not shown a reduction in
morbidity and mortality during ATRA induction when compared with chemotherapy. 
ATRA administration may result in the following conditions:
Differentiation syndrome:
 Administration of ATRA can lead to a syndrome of
respiratory distress, known as differentiation syndrome.  Prompt
recognition of the syndrome and aggressive administration of steroids can
prevent severe respiratory distress.[
1
]
Hyperleukocytosis:
 The optimal management of
ATRA-induced hyperleukocytosis has not been established. Hyperleukocytosis in APL is typically treated with the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Leukopheresis is not recommended because of an increased risk of complications such as bleeding events and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Studies performed in the 1990s demonstrated that overall survival (OS) rates improved in patients receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy.[
2
,
3
] ATO, an agent with both differentiation-inducing and apoptosis-inducing
properties against APL cells, is also used in the treatment of APL. Induction remission therapy for APL is determined by disease risk. Low- to intermediate-risk APL (white blood cell [WBC] count ≤10 × 10
9
/L) is treated without chemotherapy (ATRA and ATO), and high-risk is treated with a combination of ATRA and ATO plus chemotherapy.
ATRA plus ATO for low- to intermediate-risk disease
Evidence (ATRA plus ATO for low- to intermediate-risk disease):
	In a phase III, randomized controlled, multicenter trial in patients with APL classified as low-to-intermediate risk (WBC count, ≤10 × 10
9
/L) ATRA plus chemotherapy was compared with ATRA plus ATO.[
4
] 
	CR rates were equally high for both groups. CR occurred in all 77 patients (100%) who could be evaluated in the ATRA plus ATO group and in 75 of 79 patients (95%) in the ATRA plus chemotherapy group (
P
 = .12).
	With a median follow-up of 34.4 months, the 2-year OS rate was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96%−100%) in the ATRA plus ATO group, and 91% (95% CI, 85%−97%) in the ATRA plus chemotherapy group (
P
 = .02).
	The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was similarly low in both groups, 1% (95% CI, 0%−4%) in the ATRA plus ATO group and 6% (95% CI, 0%−11%) in the ATRA plus chemotherapy group (
P
 = .24).
	The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS) (defined as no achievement of hematologic CR after induction therapy, no achievement of molecular CR after three consolidation courses, molecular relapse, hematologic relapse, or death). The 2-year EFS rate was 97% for the ATRA plus ATO group and 85% in the ATRA plus chemotherapy group (
P
 < .001 for noninferiority).
The results of this chemotherapy-free regimen for low- to intermediate-risk APL were confirmed in a second, phase III, randomized controlled trial.[

ATRA plus chemotherapy, followed by ATO-based consolidation therapy for high-risk disease
Remission induction with a combination of anthracycline and ATRA is used for remission induction in patients with high-risk disease (WBC count, >10 × 10
9
/L).
Evidence (ATRA plus chemotherapy, followed by ATO-based consolidation therapy for high-risk disease):
The 
AIDA-2000
 study (NCT00180128)  combined oral ATRA until CR or for a maximum of 45 days and four doses of intravenous idarubicin (12 mg/m
2
) on days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Consolidation was then risk stratified so low- to intermediate-risk patients received additional cycles of anthracycline and ATRA, and high-risk patients also received cytarabine, etoposide, 6-thioguanine, and CHT chemotherapy (6-mercaptopurine plus methotrexate) as consolidation.[
6
]
	After induction, 420 of 445 patients (94.4%) treated on the AIDA-2000 protocol were in CR. The 6-year OS rate was 87.4% and the cumulative incidence of relapse rate was 10.7%.[
6
][
Level of evidence B4
]	
	In the phase II APML4 study, ATO was added to the ATRA-and-idarubicin remission−induction backbone.[
7
]  
	Of the 124 patients who could be evaluated, there were 4 (3.2%) early deaths and 118 (95%) hematologic CRs.
	The 2-year freedom-from-relapse rate was 97.5% (95% CI, 90.4%−99.4%),  the failure-free survival rate was 88.1% (95% CI, 80.7%−92.8%), and the OS rate was 93.2% (95% CI, 85.8%−96.8%).[
7
][
Level of evidence B4
]
An ATO-based regimen, which includes  gemtuzumab ozogamicin as the only cytotoxic drug, has been developed.
In a single-institution study, patients received ATRA plus ATO induction. They also received a dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (or idarubicin) if the WBC was greater than 10 × 10
9
/L on presentation or rose to more than 30 × 10
9
/L during induction.[
8
] Patients in remission received ATO and ATRA in alternating months for a total of seven cycles as consolidation; gemtuzumab ozogamicin was substituted if either ATO or ATRA were discontinued because of toxicity. 
	Of the 54 patients with high-risk disease treated on the protocol, one patient received both gemtuzumab ozogamicin and idarubicin (12 mg/m
2
 daily for 3 days) because of persistent leukocytosis despite receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
The CR rate was 96%, and five (9%) patients relapsed.
	The 5-year rates were  81% for EFS, 89% for disease-free survival (DFS), and 86% for OS, indicating that the responses are durable.
	Across the entire study population, the 5-year OS rate was similar among the 45 high-risk patients who received gemtuzumab ozogamicin (84%) compared with the seven patients who received a dose of idarubicin (100%, 
P
 = .453).[
8
][
Level of evidence B4
]
Long-term follow up from this study has been published.[
9
] 
It is important to note that most current regimens for the treatment of APL include some form of maintenance therapy.  A meta-analysis of randomized trials  has indicated that maintenance clearly improves DFS but not OS; however, these trials did not include ATO-containing regimens.
Treatment of Recurrent APL
Treatment options for recurrent APL include:
ATO with or without chemotherapy
.
Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
.
ATO with or without chemotherapy
ATO has high rates of second remission in patients with relapsed APL.[
10
] As a single agent, ATO can lead to complete response rates of 80% to 90% in patients with hematologic relapse, and 70% to 80% in patients with molecular remission.[
11
-
14
] The choice of salvage therapy is based on the previous  therapy and interval of time between first remission and relapse. 
	In patients with early relapse less than 6 months after ATRA and ATO, anthracycline-based regimens and ATRA as given for initial remission induction for high-risk disease should be considered.
	In patients who relapse less than 6 months after ATRA and anthracycline-based regimens (no previous ATO exposure), ATO-based regimens should be considered.
	In all patients with late relapse (>6 months), ATO-based regimens with or without anthracycline or gemtuzumab ozogamicin should be considered.

For patients receiving ATO as salvage therapy, a small randomized trial suggested that the addition of ATRA does not confer any benefit over ATO alone in patients who previously received ATRA.[
14
] In this 20-patient study, the complete response rate after one cycle of ATO with or without ATRA was 80%.
HCT
Some patients in second remission with ATO have experienced long-term DFS after autologous stem cell transplant,[
15
,
16
] and it can be considered in patients who are in molecular remission (negative quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR] on a marrow sample). Patients who do not go into remission or have evidence of measurable residual disease by quantitative PCR on a marrow sample after salvage therapy are considered for an allogeneic HCT.[
17
] A registry study reported a 3-year OS rate after transplant in second CR of 80% compared with 59% in patients without transplant (
P
 = .03).[
