feasibility of administering a functional assessment in clinical situation, Assessment of physical and cognitive function via a set of physical and congnitive tests, 72 hours of admission
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Test the feasibility of pre-treatment, bedside assessment of functional and cognitive status in older adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Secondary

* Obtain preliminary data regarding the predictive value of pre-treatment, bedside assessment of functional and cognitive status on overall survival, length of hospitalization and early death.

OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

At baseline, patients complete questionnaires including the Vulnerable Elders Survey (functional status), the Mini-Mental Status Exam (cognition), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression. Patients also undergo physical function testing via the Short Physical Performance Battery and hand grip strength. Further information parameters are obtained by periodic medical chart reviews.

Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
