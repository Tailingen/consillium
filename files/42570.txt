Venetoclax+Azacytidine+Modified BUCY Conditioning Regimen for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes Undergoing Allo-HSCT
The purpose of this prospective, open-label, single-center study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VEN-AZA (venetoclax and azacytidine) followed by modified BUCY (busulfan and cyclophosphamide) as conditioning regimen for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and high-risk or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is the only potentially curative therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, relapse remains a leading cause for treatment failure after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients, optimization of conditioning regimen can improve prognosis and decrease relapse. Abnormal gene methylation is common in AML and MDS patients. Azacytidine is a DNA methylation transferase inhibitor that can re-express tumor suppressor genes in leukemia cells. Venetoclax is a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, which has antitumor activity against a variety of hematological malignancies. The combination of the two drugs show a synergistic anti-tumor effect. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VEN-AZA regimen followed by Allo-HSCT in the treatment of high-risk MDS and high-risk or relapsed/refractory AML.
