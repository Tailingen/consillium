99mTc-H7ND SPECT/CT Imaging in NSCLC
To study the clinical application of 99mTc-H7ND SPECT/CT imaging in the efficacy evaluation and prediction of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
NSCLC
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 99mTc-H7ND SPECT/CT imaging performed
DCR, Comparison of DCR in groups of NSCLC patients with stable disease assessed by RECIST1.1., Repeat visits were performed 8-12 weeks and 12 weeks after the baseline assessment
PFS, The PFS of NSCLC patients with stable disease assessed by RECIST1.1, Repeat visits were performed 8-12 weeks and 12 weeks after the baseline assessment|OS, The OS of NSCLC patients with stable disease assessed by RECIST1.1, Repeat visits were performed 8-12 weeks and 12 weeks after the baseline assessment
This study was a prospective, controlled, single-center clinical study.

To evaluate the value of 99mTc-H7ND imaging in the evaluation of stable disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) assessed by RECIST1.1, and to predict the efficacy of subsequent treatment (second-line treatment).

Patients with NSCLC confirmed by cytology or pathology, who were unable to undergo radical surgery because of recurrence, metastasis, or their own conditions, and who had completed 2-4 cycles of first-line therapy and had RECIST1.1 assessment (SD) were divided into 2 groups:

Experimental group: 99mTc-H7ND SPECT/CT imaging performed Control group: 99mTc-H7ND SPECT/CT imaging was not performed
