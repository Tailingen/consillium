Feasibility of Holmium-166 Micro Brachytherapy in Head and Neck Tumors
The main objective is to establish the feasibility of 166-Holmium microspheres for intratumoral injections in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of the tongue.

Participants will receive intratumoral injections with a low radioactive 166-Holmium microspheres followed by surgical resection
Radioisotopes|Head and Neck Neoplasms
DEVICE: Holmium-166 (poly L lactic acid) microspheres
Total amount of activity leakage (in percentage) in the oral cavity rinsing fluid., upto 5 minutes after administration
Occurrence of (serious) adverse events, Between administration and resection of the tumor (max 12 days)|The biodistribution of Holmium-166 microspheres after intra-tumoural injection, SPECT Thorax and Abdomen Radioactivity in a blood and urine sample, upto 30 minutes after administration|The biodistribution of Holmium-166 microspheres after intra-tumoural injection, MRI, 1-2 hours after administration|The biodistribution of Holmium-166 microspheres after intra-tumoural injection, Radioactivity in blood and urine sample, 3 hours after administration
166-Holmium microspheres poly lactic acid microspheres are currently used in selective internal radiation therapy. These microspheres emits beta radiation. The majority of the radiation dose will be absorbed within 3.2 mm with a maximum penetration in tissue of 9 mm. Therefore this can result in a high local tumor ablative dose with minimal dose to healthy adjacent tissue.
