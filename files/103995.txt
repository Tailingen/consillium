A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Preliminary Efficacy of ABBV-399 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/1b open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-399 as monotherapy and in combination with osimertinib, erlotinib, and nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors likely to express c-Met. Enrollment is closed for the monotherapy arms, Arm A, and Arm D.
Advanced Solid Tumors Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Telisotuzumab vedotin|DRUG: Telisotuzumab vedotin|DRUG: Erlotinib
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to 24 Months|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) of ABBV-399 when Administered as Monotherapy and in Combination with Osimertinib, Erlotinib or Nivolumab, The RPTD of ABBV-399 when administered as monotherapy and in combination with osimertinib, erlotinib or nivolumab will be determined during the dose escalation phase of the study. RPTD will be determined using available safety and pharmacokinetics data., Up to 24 Months|Area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to the last measurable concentration AUC (0-t), AUC (0-t) = Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the time of the last measurable concentration., Up to 24 months|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)., Up to 24 months|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Time to Cmax (Tmax)., Up to 24 months|Terminal elimination half life, Terminal elimination half life., Up to 24 months
