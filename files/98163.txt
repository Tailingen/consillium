DRUG: Talquetamab|DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Daratumumab SC|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Pomalidomide
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with AEs by Severity, Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening, and Grade 5= Death related to AE., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Laboratory Parameters, Number of participants with clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory parameters such as hematology and serum chemistry will be reported., Up to 1 year and 6 months|Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be reported. The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher, clinical laboratory abnormalities, or hematologic toxicity., Up to 49 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve partial response (PR) or better according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria. Response to treatment will be evaluated by the investigator based on IMWG criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better Response Rate, VGPR or better response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a VGPR or better response (stringent complete response \[sCR\] + complete response \[CR\] +VGPR) according to the IMWG 2016 criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Complete Response (CR) or Better Response Rate, CR or better response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a CR or better response (sCR+CR) according to the IMWG 2016 criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Stringent Complete Response (sCR), sCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve an sCR according to the IMWG 2016 criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as time from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG 2016 criteria, or death due to disease progression, whichever occurs first., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the time between date of first dose of study treatment and the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant has met all criteria for PR or better., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Serum Concentration of Talquetamab, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of talquetamab., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Serum Concentration of Daratumumab, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of daratumumab for treatment regimens B and D., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies to Talquetamab, Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies to talquetamab will be reported., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies to Daratumumab, Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies to daratumumab will be reported for treatment regimens B and D., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies to Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 Enzyme (rHuPH20), Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies to rHuPH20 will be reported., Up to 1 year and 10 months
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of talquetamab when administered in different combination regimens and to identify the safe dose(s) of talquetamab combination regimens.
