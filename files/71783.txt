Proton Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to reduce the risk of radiation related side effects and complications by treating with radiation (protons or photons) that exposes less of normal organs to low dose radiation.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
RADIATION: Proton Radiation Plan|RADIATION: Conventional Photon Radiation Plan|RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Plan
Comparison of Normal Tissue Exposed to Greater Than or Equal to 4 Gy/CGE With Use of Proton Therapy Compared to Both Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Conventional Therapy., Immediately proceeding completion of each of the three treatment plans
Percentage of Participants Who Survived, Overall survival as assessed with the Kaplan-Meier product limit method., 4 years after beginning of radiation therapy|Percentage of Participants Who Did Not Have Disease Progression, Disease free survival as assessed with the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, 4 years after beginning of radiation therapy
3 treatment plans will be created to deliver between a total of 21-39.6 Gray (Gy)/Centigray Equivalents (CGE) to the planning target volume (PTV).

1. Proton Plan
2. Conventional Plan
3. Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) Plan

The patient will then receive the radiation modality with the lowest percentage of the body receiving 4 Gy (V4Gy/CGE)
