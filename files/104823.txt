Clofarabine and Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Minimal Residual Disease
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving clofarabine together with cytarabine may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This pilot phase II trial is studying how well giving clofarabine together with cytarabine works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia with minimal residual disease

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test the ability of clofarabine + ara-C (cytarabine) to eliminate minimal residual (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients whose bone marrows exhibit complete remission by morphology.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the duration of complete remission after this treatment to minimize MRD.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and cytarabine IV on days 2-5. Beginning approximately 1 month later, patients may receive one additional course of treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.
