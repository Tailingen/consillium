Phase IB Study of Gemcitabine, Docetaxel and Bevacizumab in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
1.1 To determine the recommended phase II dose for gemcitabine in combination with a fixed dose of docetaxel and bevacizumab.

1.2 To determine the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma 1.3 To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab in patients with soft tissue sarcoma
Sarcoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine, Docetaxel and Bevacizumab
Overall response rate (complete and partial responses)., Tumor response is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). ORR is the sum of the percentages of patients achieving complete and partial responses, 4 years
Because the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has shown impressive activity in soft tissue sarcoma, we hypothesize that the addition of an antiangiogenesis agent (bevacizumab) would enhance the anticancer activity, as shown in other tumor types.
