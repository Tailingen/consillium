Methotrexate Single-dose Treatment and Methotrexate/Actinomycin-D Single-dose Treatment in Low-Risk Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia
The investigators conducted a trial to determine whether methotrexate or methotrexate/dactinomycin single-course treatment work well as multiple courses of single methotrexate chemotherapy in low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. It is not yet known whether single-course of chemotherapy is as the same effectiveness as multicourse.
