Treatment for Relapsed/Refractory AML Based on a High Throughput Drug Sensitivity Assay
This clinical trial uses a laboratory test called a high throughput sensitivity assay in planning treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The aim is to try to identify drugs that may be effective in killing leukemia cells for those patients who will not be cured with conventional chemotherapy. This assay will test multiple drugs simultaneously against a patient's own donated blood sample. The goal is to use this laboratory assay to best match a drug to a patient's disease.

Achievability of Performing Individualized Drug Screening and Initiating Therapy Based on the Results of the Drug Screen for Poor Risk Patients With Relapsed or Refractory AML, Whether treatment was administered in the time frame based on the high throughput drug screen. Time from sample procurement to assay results., Up to 21 days
Rate of Complete Response, Defined by Criteria of Cheson et al., Number of patients who achieved a Complete Response (CR) with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), a Complete Response with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), or showed reduced blasts in their bone marrow by flow cytometry (Cytoreduction).

Cheson et al. defines a CR as: Bone Marrow blasts \<5%, absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods, absence of extramedullary disease, absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 10\^9/L, and platelet count \>100 x 10\^9/L. Cheson et al. defines a CRi as: all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 x 10\^9/L) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 x 10\^9/L)., Baseline up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To obtain results from a high throughput drug sensitivity assay within 10 days, procure drug within 14 days and initiate treatment within 21 days.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To achieve a response (cytoreduction or at least partial response) greater that than expected for comparable refractory patient populations with other salvage regimens.

OUTLINE:

A patient receives a drug intervention based on the results of a high throughput sensitivity assay. This assay best matches a drug to the patient's disease.
