MR-Linac Guided Adaptive FSRT for Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy and safety of MR-Linac Guided Adaptive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in patients with brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer.

This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy and safety of MR-Linac Guided Adaptive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in patients with brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer.

Patients will receive FSRT (30Gy in 5 fractions) on the MR-Linac treatment machine. The primary end point is 1-year intracranial progression-free survival. The secondary end points are objective response rate, 1-y PFS, 1-y OS, perilesional edema of brain metastases, quality of life, safety of treatment, dose coverage of targets and dose to normal organs.
