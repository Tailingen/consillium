Lenvatinib Plus Toripalimab for Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The investigators propose to initiate a study assessing the efficacy and safety of a lower initial dosage of lenvatinib combined with toripalimab in patients suffering from platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. The objective of this research is to offer a novel therapeutic approach for patients battling relapsed ovarian cancer with platinum resistance.
Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma
DRUG: Lenvatinib+Toripalimab.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), This term denotes the duration from the initiation of enrollment to the point of neoplasm progression or death., From the start of treatment to a minimum of 3 years
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival refers to the duration from the initiation of enrollment until death, regardless of the cause.For participants who have not succumbed, the data will be censored at the most recent date known for their survival., From the start of treatment to a minimum of 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of the proportions of complete and partial responses. This is achieved when there is a reduction in the neoplasm volume to a predetermined value, coupled with a decrease in serum CA 125 concentration by more than 50% post-treatment compared to pre-treatment levels, sustained for a minimum duration of 4 weeks., From the start of treatment to a minimum of 3 years
