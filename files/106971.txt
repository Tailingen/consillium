Treatment of Atezolizumab and Derazantinib in Patients With Advanced iCCA With FGFR2 Fusions/Rearrangements
The study trial is a open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial investigating the combined treatment of atezolizumab and derazantinib in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Derazantinib
Primary Objective: Assessment of Efficacy, Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be assessed every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, up to 4 years, at EOS
Secondary Objective: Assessment of Safety, All adverse events (including serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest) will be assessed for saftey of study treatment in accordance with CTCAE V 5.0, up to 4 years, at EOS|Secondary Objective: Assessment of Efficacy in relation to objection response rate at EOT, Objective response rate (ORR) according to investigator-based RECIST 1.1 assessment, defined as the proportion of allocated subjects with best response of complete or partial response within study treatment., up to 4 years, at EOS|Secondary Objective: Assessment of Efficacy in relation to progression free survival, The proportion of patients known to be alive and without confirmed objective disease progression at 6, 8 and 10 months after first administration of study treatment, respectively and time from first administration of study treatment until the date of first objective disease progression or death., up to 4 years, at EOS|Secondary Objective: Assessment of Efficacy in relation to overall survival, Time from first administration of study treatment until death of a patient due to any cause, 4 years, at EOS
Tertial Objective: Exploratory Biomarker Objective in Blood Samples, Blood samples for correlative studies will be drawn at baseline, during treatment and at time of progression and samples will be used to monitor immune cell population before and during therapy., 4 years, at EOS|Tertial Objective: Exploratory Biomarker Objective in Fecal Samples, Fecal samples will be collected at baseline (before administration of any study medication) and on C3D1 for microbiome analysis., 4 years, at EOS
The aim of this phase II study is to explore the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of atezolizumab and derazantinib in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, with ORR as the primary endpoint.

The primary endpoint is the Objective Response Rate (ORR \[assessed every 8 weeks (±7 days)\]):

Objective response rate (ORR) according to investigator-based RECIST 1.1 assessment, defined as the proportion of allocated subjects with best response of complete or partial response within 9 months after the date of first administration of study treatment.

The secondary endpoints are safety and efficacy and will be evaluated by

* Incidence, treatment relationship, seriousness, and severity of all AEs, SAEs, AESIs according to CTCAE V5.0
* ORR@EOT:

Objective response rate (ORR) according to investigator-based RECIST 1.1 assessment, defined as the proportion of allocated subjects with best response of complete or partial response within study treatment.

• PFSR@6, 8 and 10 months: The proportion of patients known to be alive and without confirmed objective disease progression at 6, 8 and 10 months after first administration of study treatment, respectively.

• PFS: Time from first administration of study treatment until the date of first objective disease progression or death.

• OS: Time from first administration of study treatment until death of a patient due to any cause
