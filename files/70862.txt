A Study to Investigate the Safety and Clinical Activity of Belantamab Mafodotin in Combination With Daratumumab, Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With One Line Therapy Who Are Lenalidomide Refractory
This is a phase 1/2, open label, single-center study designed to assess the safety and preliminary clinical activity of different belantamab mafodotin doses in combination with daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) previously treated with one line of therapy who are lenalidomide refractory.

This will be a 2-Part study. Part 1 will evaluate the safety of belantamab mafodotin in combination with DPd in 2 cohorts and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). In the dose expansion phase (Part 2) an expansion cohort will be treated with the RP2D. The expansion cohort will randomize participants (1:1) in two groups to evaluate two alternate dose modification guidelines for corneal AEs. Part 2 will further evaluate the safety and assess the preliminary clinical activity of the belantamab mafodotin RP2D in combination with DPd.

Overall, approximately 48 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participant follow-up will continue up to 3 years after the last participant is randomized. The estimated accrual period will be 12 months corresponding to an approximate total study duration of 4 years.

Part 1 and 2: Cumulative dose of belantamab mafodotin, Cumulative belantamab mafodotin dose of (DLT evaluable population, safety population) administered in combination with daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, i.e., the total dose of belantamab mafodotin that was administered., Up to 4 years|Part 1: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR and 95% CI as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population); ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed PR, VGPR, CR or sCR., Up to 4 years|Part 1: Very good partial response (VGPR), VGPR+ and 95% CI as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population);ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed VGPR, CR or sCR., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Time to response (TTR), TTR as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population). TTR is defined as the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the first evidence of confirmed response (PR or better) for participants who achieve a response (i.e., confirmed PR or better)., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Duration of Response, DoR as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population). DoR is defined as the time (months) from first evidence of confirmed PR or better until the earliest date of: documented disease progression (PD) per IMWG response criteria; or death due to PD among participants who achieved a response of PR or better. For alive and progression-free participants, data will be censored at the date of initiation of the subsequent line of treatment or at the last date of follow-up that the participant was known to be alive and progression-free., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population). CRR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR or sCR. The denominator will be the total number of participants in each population and group respectively., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate, MRD negativity rate (ITT population); defined as the number (percent) of participants who achieve MRD negativity (at or below the threshold of 10-5), assessed via NGF in participants with CR or better response. The denominator will be the total number of participants in each population group respectively., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better, VGPR or better as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population). VGPR or better rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed VGPR, CR or sCR. The denominator will be the total number of participants in each population, and group respectively., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population, Safety population). PFS is defined as the time (in months) from randomization until the earliest date of documented PD per IMWG, or death due to any cause. For participants who neither progress nor die, the PFS will be censored at the date of their last adequate disease assessment. For participants who start a new anti-myeloma treatment, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment before the start of the new treatment. For a randomized participant who does not have any post-baseline disease assessments and who has not died, PFS will be censored at the randomization date., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS (ITT population, Safety population).
