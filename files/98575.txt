Validity and Cost-Effectiveness of a New Screening Test for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is:

1. To establish and compare the diagnostic utilities for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening tests of (a) HS-AFP, (b) AFP + US,(c) AFP alone and (d) US alone (within HBV carriers between age 40 and 70 years);
2. To establish the cost-effectiveness of the screening tests;
3. To compare tumor sizes, resection rates, and survival rates up to 18 months between those who were screened by HS-AFP those of a historical control group that was not screened.
