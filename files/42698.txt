Longitudinal Performance of Epi proColon
This study will evaluate longitudinal performance of Epi proColon with respect to test positivity, longitudinal adherence to Epi proColon screening, adherence to follow-up colonoscopy and diagnostic yield, as well as assay failure rates.
Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Neoplasms
DEVICE: Epi proColon
The difference in test specificity between initial testing and repeat testing 1 year, * Subjects will be tested with blood-based Epi proColon assay at initial enrollment, and tested again 1 year later (positive or negative test results)
* Subjects with positive test results with Epi proColon assay are referred to colonoscopy. Colonoscopy outcomes will be recorded (no evidence of disease or CRC)
* The difference in test specificity between initial and follow-up visits will be recorded., Through study completion, expected at 60 months|Detection of colorectal cancer, Findings of colorectal cancer in subjects with a colonoscopy following a positive Epi proColon test will be recorded., Through study completion, expected at 60 months
Adherence to testing, The adherence to repeated Epi proColon testing by patients who had a negative initial Epi proColon result will be recorded., Through study completion, expected at 60 months|Adherence to colonoscopy, The rate of adherence to colonoscopy for patients with a positive Epi proColon result will be recorded, Through study completion, expected at 60 months|Diagnostic Yield, All procedure results will be recorded for patients who complete a colonoscopy evaluation following a positive Epi proColon test, Through study completion, expected at 60 months|Assay Failure Rate, The Epi proColon assay failure rate will be recorded during the duration of the study, Through study completion, expected at 60 months
Epi proColon is blood based screening test for colorectal cancer that is FDA - PMA approved. It is indicated for average risk patients who are unwilling or unable to be screened with other recommended screening tests, including colonoscopy or fecal occult blood tests.

The PERT study is designed to assess the test performance of Epi proColon when it is used annually for two consecutive years. Subjects enrolled in the study will be offered initial testing. Subjects with a positive result will be referred for colonoscopy. Subjects with a negative test result will be encouraged to be screened the following year. At the one year interval, test negative subjects will be reminded to be rescreened. Subjects with a positive test will be referred for colonoscopy, while subjects with a negative test will be be encouraged to participate in a screening program in subsequent years.
