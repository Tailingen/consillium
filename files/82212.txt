BCMA CAR-T Cell Therapy in High-risk NDMM Patients With Positive MRD After First-line ASCT
This study is a open-label, single-center Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA CAR-T Cell Therapy in High-risk NDMM Patients With Positive MRD After First-line ASCT. A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled into this study.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-BCMA CAR-T
Safety and Tolerability, The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 2 year|MRD-negativity rate, Achieving undetectable MRD, as determined by NGF/NGS 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion, 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion
Complete response rate (CRR), CR or better is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a CR response or Stringent Complete Response (sCR) response accoording to the IMWG criteria, 1 month after the CAR-T cell transfusion, after consolidation therapy|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of first documented PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of the participant's death., Up to 5 year
The CART cell duration in vivo, The copies of BCMA-CART DNA in peripheral blood with qPCR method, Up to 1 year
The study is a prospective, single-arm, single-centre, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA CAR-T Cell Therapy in High-risk NDMM Patients With Positive MRD After First-line ASCT. Patients with detectable MRD after undergoing ASCT MRD will be enrolled in this study.
