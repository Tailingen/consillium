A Phase 1 Study to Assess the Effect of Hepatic Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of Repotrectinib in Advanced Cancer Patients
This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on the PK of repotrectinib in patients with advanced cancer.
Locally Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: repotrectinib (TPX-0005)
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of repotrectinib, AUC0-t: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration, Within 22 days of first repotrectinib dose|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of repotrectinib, Cmax: Evaluate the maximum plasma concentration, Within 22 days of first Repotrectinib dose
Evaluate safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of repotrectinib in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function following single and multiple dose administration of repotrectinib assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 28 days after last dose of repotrectinib
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, multiple-dose, open-label, nonrandomized study to evaluate the effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on the PK of repotrectinib following single and multiple dose administration of repotrectinib in patients with advanced cancer. This study will enroll 8 patients each with moderate hepatic impairment, severe hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function.
