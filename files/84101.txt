A Study of Niraparib Combined With Bevacizumab Maintenance Treatment in Participants With Advanced Ovarian Cancer Following Response on Front-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
Niraparib is an oral inhibitor of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-2. This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of niraparib combined with bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in participants with advanced (stage IIIB-IV) ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab. Eligible participants who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or no evidence of disease (NED) following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in addition to bevacizumab will be enrolled in the study and will receive maintenance treatment with niraparib (for up to 3 years) combined with bevacizumab (for up to 10 months during the maintenance phase or up to a total of 15 months inclusive of the approximately 5 months of bevacizumab received with chemotherapy) or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant withdrawal, Investigator's decision, or death, whichever comes first. Participants who have not progressed after 3 years of niraparib maintenance treatment may continue with niraparib beyond 3 years if they are benefiting from treatment, upon consultation with Sponsor.
Ovarian Neoplasms
DRUG: Niraparib|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate, PFS rate at 18 months is defined as the percentage of participants who have not progressed or died within 18 months after niraparib combined with bevacizumab treatment initiation. Progression was assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 criteria per Investigator assessment and defined as a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the diameter of target lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Survival rate is the percentage of participants without progression assessed by RECIST v1.1 or death by the landmark timepoint. Confidence intervals was constructed using exact method., At 18 months
Progression Free Survival by RECIST v 1.1, Data is not reported as participants response is still ongoing at the time of primary analysis., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Data is not reported as participants response is still ongoing at the time of primary analysis., Up to 3 years|RECIST or Cancer Antigen (CA)-125 Progression Free Survival, Data is not reported as participants response is still ongoing at the time of primary analysis., Up to 3 years|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI), Data is not reported as participants response is still ongoing at the time of primary analysis., Baseline and up to 3 years|Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST), Data is not reported as participants response is still ongoing at the time of primary analysis., Up to 3 years|Time to Second Subsequent Therapy (TSST), Data is not reported as participants response is still ongoing at the time of primary analysis., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants With Non-serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAE is defined as any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment. Number of participants with non-serious TEAEs with 5% threshold are reported., Up to a maximum of 33.68 months|Number of Participants With TEAEs Leading to Niraparib Treatment Discontinuation, TEAE is defined as any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment. Number of participants with TEAEs leading to Niraparib treatment discontinuation are reported., Up to a maximum of 33.68 months|Number of Participants With TEAEs Leading to Niraparib Dose Reductions, TEAE is defined as any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment. Number of participants with TEAES leading to Niraparib dose reductions are reported., Up to a maximum of 33.68 months
