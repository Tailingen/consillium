CR required: blood lymphocytes \< 4 x 10\^9/Liter (L), absence of lymphadenopathy (≤ 1.5 centimeter (cm) in long axis by Computed Tomography), no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, absence of disease, Neutrophils \> 1.5 x 10\^9/L, Platelets \> 100 x 10\^9/L, Hemoglobin \>11 g/dL, bone marrow normal and lymphoid nodules absent. CRi was CR with incomplete marrow recovery. PR required: 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count, 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy, 50% reduction of liver and/or spleen enlargement if enlarged at baseline, Neutrophils \> 1.5 x 10\^9/L or \> 50% of pretreatment value, Platelets \> 100 x 10\^9/L or 50% of pretreatment value and Hemoglobin \> 11 g/dL or \> 50% of pretreatment value., Week 32
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the randomization to the first occurrence of progression or death, whichever occurred first., Up to 4 years, 5 months|Duration of Response, Up to 4 years, 5 months|Number of Participants Surviving at End-of-Study, Up to 4 years, 5 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE), An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. A SAE was any AE that was one of the following: fatal, life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the investigational product or considered a significant medical event by the investigator. Additional information about AEs can be found in the Adverse Event Section., Up to 4 years, 5 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events of Interest, Adverse Events of interest for this study were: serious infusion related reactions during or within 24 hours of infusion, serious neutropenia, serious infection, tumor lysis syndrome and Hepatitis B reactivation., Up to 4 years, 5 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Study Discontinuation, An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution., Up to 4 years, 5 months|PK Parameter: Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax), Blood was collected for Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter Cmax after dose administration on Day 1 of Cycle 8. Serum samples were sent to a central lab and were analyzed for obinutuzumab using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured in micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL)., Day 148 (at end of infusion)|PK Parameter: Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve Between Dosing Interval Tau (AUCt ), Blood was collected for PK Parameters before and after dose administration on Day 1 of Cycle 8. Serum samples were sent to a central lab and were analyzed for obinutuzumab using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured in day times micrograms per milliliter (day\*μg/mL)., Day 148 (pre-infusion, at end of infusion, 5, 8 and 12 days after start of infusion)|PK Parameter: Clearance at Steady State (CLss), Blood was collected for PK Parameters before and after dose administration on Day 1 of Cycle 8. Serum samples were sent to a central lab and were analyzed for obinutuzumab using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CLss is reported in milliliters per day (mL/day)., Day 148 (pre-infusion, at end of infusion, 5, 8 and 12 days after start of infusion)|PK Parameter: Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss), Blood was collected for PK Parameters before and after dose administration on Day 1 of Cycle 8. Serum samples were sent to a central lab and were analyzed for obinutuzumab using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vss is reported in liters., Day 148 (pre-infusion, at end of infusion, 5, 8 and 12 days after start of infusion)|PK Parameter: Terminal Half-Life (t1/2), Blood was collected for PK Parameters before and after dose administration on Day 1 of Cycle 8. Serum samples were sent to a central lab and were analyzed for obinutuzumab using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T1/2 was reported in Days., Day 148 (pre-infusion, at end of infusion, 5, 8 and 12 days after start of infusion)|PK: Serum Concentrations of Obinutuzumab (Follow-Up Visits), Blood serum samples were sent to a central lab and were analyzed for obinutuzumab using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measured in micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL)., Months 3, 6, 9, and 12|Pharmacodynamics: Number of Participants With Peripheral Blood B-cell Depletion, Blood was sent to a central laboratory for the evaluation of cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) by flow cytometry. B-cell depletion was defined as a CD19 result \< 0.07 × 10\^9/L after at least one dose of study drug has been administered., Up to 4 years, 5 months|Pharmacodynamics: Number of Participants With Peripheral Blood B-cell Recovery, Blood was sent to a central laboratory for the evaluation of cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) by flow cytometry. B-cell recovery was defined as a CD19 result ≥ 0.07 × 10\^9/L, where CD19 was previously depleted. B-cell recovery was only considered possible following the last dose of study treatment. The number of participants with B-cell recovery from End of Treatment to 6 months of Follow-up is reported in two categories: Recovery with Progressive Disease (PD) \[PD before B-cell recovery or PD within 45 days after recovery\] or Recovery without PD. PD required one of the following: 50% increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes, Appearance of new palpable lymph nodes, 50% increase in the longest diameter of any previous site of lymphadenopathy, 50% increase in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen or Transformation to a more aggressive histology., Up to 4 years, 5 months
