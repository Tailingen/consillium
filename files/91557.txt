A Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of IBI322 in Subjects With Hematologic Malignancy
This is a phase I study evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of IBI322 in subjects with hematologic malignancies who have failed standard treatment.

This Phase 1a/1b study will be conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of IBI322 in China. Phase 1a is a dose escalation and plans to enroll approximately 39-102 subjects with hematologic malignancies who have failed standard treatments. Phase 1b is a dose expansion and plans to enroll approximately 80 subjects with hematologic malignancies.
