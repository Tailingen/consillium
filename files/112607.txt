A Study of MRG002 in the Treatment of Patients With HER2-low Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (BC)
The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG002 in patients with HER2-low locally advanced or metastatic BC.
Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: MRG002
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee(IRC), ORR was defined as the proportions of subjects with a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). ORR will be assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (12 months)

ORR will be assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|6-month and 12-month Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR), The proportions of subjects surviving without progression from the start of treatment to 6-month and 12-month duration., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR was defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the first onset of CR or PR in tumor evaluation., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR was defined as the duration from the initial recording of objective disease response to the first onset of tumor progression, or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportions of subjects achieving CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (12 months)|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed based on NCI-CTCAE v5.0., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter for MRG002: concentration-time curve, Concentration-time curve will be depicted based on pharmacokinetics concentration set (PKCS)., Baseline to 14 days after decision to discontinue treatment|Immunogenicity, The incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis will be summarized for all patients who received at least one cycle study treatment., Baseline to 14 days after decision to discontinue treatment
The study will be conducted in two parts. The first part is efficacy exploration and the second part is efficacy verification. During the course of efficacy exploration, 33 subjects will be enrolled to preliminarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRG002. The second part will be adjusted according to the result of the first part. 29 subjects are planned to be enrolled. Considering the dropout rate of 10%, approximately 33 subjects are planned to be enrolled. A total of 66 subjects are planned to be enrolled in efficacy exploration and verification.
