A Follow-up Colonoscopy Examination in Patients Who Had Previously Undergone Screening Colonoscopy
* To determine the prevalence of colonic neoplasm in patients who had previously undergone screening colonoscopy
* To determine the optimal time interval for re-screening in average risk individuals
* To determine potential baseline characteristics that predicts adenoma recurrence
Colonic Cancer
PROCEDURE: colonoscopy
The prevalence of advanced colonic adenoma in the re-screening population, 5 year from index colonoscopy
The time to adenoma adenoma development according to different baseline characteristics of patients and colonoscopy findings, 5 years from index colonoscopy
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second commonest cancer in Hong Kong, and tends to be increasing. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the cancer incidence and mortality by detecting early lesions. However, the best interval for a follow up colonoscopy, particularly for those with normal baseline colonoscopy, remains largely unknown.

This study aim to determine the prevalence of colonic neoplasm in average-risk patients who had previously undergone screening colonoscopy and the optimal time interval for re-screening.
