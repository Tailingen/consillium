RELIEVE: Research on Effectiveness of Surgery and Radiotherapy on Relieving Spine Tumor Pain in Patients with Vertebral Metastases
This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study focusing on assessing and managing pain in patients with metastatic spinal tumors. Pain from spinal metastases adversely impacts quality of life, function, and treatment outcomes. Advances in surgical techniques have shown significant benefits. However, previous studies either lacked nuanced differentiations or simply categorized pain as mechanical or non-mechanical; explaining the highly variable pain outcome measurements in these studies. This study employs the AO Spine Cancer-Related Pain Classification to better categorize neoplastic spinal pain by etiology.
Spinal Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Surgery
Pain intensity on the Brief Pain Inventory Intensity Scale of four different types of pain caused by the index spinal metastasis, measuring pain on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning no pain and 10 meaning as bad as one can imagine., The primary study outcome is the intensity of the four different types of pain caused by the index spinal metastasis, ie, the index pain(s):

* Axial non-triggered pain
* Axial triggered/mechanical pain
* Radicular non-triggered pain
* Radicular triggered/mechanical pain, Baseline and 3 months
Patient Reported Outcome Measure: Michigan Body Map measuring pain location, The following Patient Reported Outcome Measure will be measured: Michigan body map. The Michigan Body Map is used to record the location and number of painful body regions. At baseline, patients will use the map to indicate the locations of each index pain experienced. At 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, patients will use the map to indicate any new locations of pain, apart from the locations of the index pain, since the index treatment., Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months|Patient Reported Outcome Measure: PainDETECT measuring neuropathic pain, The following Patient Reported Outcome Measure will be measured: PainDETECT Questionnaire. The PainDETECT Questionnaire was initially developed as a screening tool to detect neuropathic pain component in patients with chronic low back pain. The questionnaire consists of seven items describing neuropathic pain symptoms, with item responses ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (very strongly), as well as one item each describing temporal pain patterns (four patterns with scores ranging from -1 to +1) and presence of radiating pain (if yes, score of +2). The total score ranges from 0 to 38, with higher score indicating higher likelihood of a neuropathic pain component.

This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Patients with metastatic spinal tumors and one symptomatic metastatic site (ie, the index metastasis) that is causing at least one type of pain (ie, the index pain) of interest to this study that has at least "moderate" pain in intensity (numeric rating scale \[NRS\] \> 4) will be enrolled from participating sites. Four types of neoplastic pain in the AO Spine Cancer-Related Pain Classification are of interest to this study.

1. The axial non-triggered pain is hypothesized to be secondary to periosteal stretching and/or release of nociceptive cytokines; it is mostly associated with osteoclastic activity but can be sometimes associated with reactive sclerosis. This pain may show a diurnal variation with increased severity at night and typically responds to steroids or opioid medications.
2. The axial triggered/mechanical pain is nociceptive pain secondary to inability of osseous spinal structures to support physical loads. It is typically associated with osteoclastic activity but can also be due to periosteal nerve stimulation from frank fractures or microfractures. This pain typically does not respond well to the medical treatments and if the pain is severe, progressive, or debilitating, may benefit from stabilization.
3. Radicular non-triggered pain is a result of persistent compression of a nerve root which can be due to tumor or bone expansion. This type of neurologic pain follows a specific nerve root distribution with a correlative compression lesion. It may be resolved with decompression or potentially with nonoperative measures such as radiotherapy or systemic treatments.
4. Radicular triggered/mechanical pain is a result of transient compression of a nerve root caused by mechanical instability. This type of neurologic pain also follows a specific nerve root distribution with a correlative compression lesion. It may be relieved in certain position such as recumbency and often benefits from stabilization surgery with or without decompression.

Patients will be treated (ie, the index treatment) with surgery alone, surgery with postoperative radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone for the index metastasis. Day 0 is defined as: 1) for patients receiving surgery only, the day of the surgery (or the first stage of surgery in the case of staged surgery), 2) for patients receiving radiotherapy only, the day of the first session of radiotherapy, or 3) for patients receiving both surgery and radiotherapy, whichever treatment day that comes earlier. Patients will be followed up at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after Day 0. The primary study outcome is the intensity of the four different types of pain caused by the index spinal metastasis. The study will delineate how these kinds of pain respond to treatment over time. Secondary objectives investigate factors predictive of pain relief and the relationship between pain and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
