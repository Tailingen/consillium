Low-Cost, Portable Flexible Nasopharyngoscope in Head & Neck Cancers in Low Resource Settings - Optimization Phase
This study aims to develop and evaluate a low-cost, portable, flexible nasopharyngeal scope (FNS) used to assess head and neck cancers (HNC) in low resource settings. The FNS will be compared to an endoscope that is used as standard of care (SOC) in terms of ease of use, image quality, and perceived pain. The ultimate goal is to compare the ease of use between the FNS to what is used in SOC.
Head and Neck Cancer|Oral Cancer
DEVICE: Nasopharyngoscope
Number of Participant Exams in Which Providers Reported the FNS (Flexible Nasopharyngoscope) is Easy to Use, Measured using a 5 point scale, with 1=Very hard, 2=Harder, 3=Same, 4=Easier and 5=Very Easy., up to 15 minutes
Image Quality of the Standard of Care (SOC) Scope as Measured on a 5-point Scale, Measured using a 5 point scale where 1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=very good, and 5=excellent. Reported here is the number of participant exams in which providers scored the image quality of the SOC scope at each value., Day 1|Image Quality of the Flexible Scope as Measured on a 5-point Scale, Measured using a 5 point scale where 1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=very good, and 5=excellent. Reported here is the number of participant exams in which providers scored the image quality of the flexible scope at each value., Day 1|Number of Patients Who Experienced an Adverse Event Following the Use of the Flexible Scope, Day 1|Number of Patients Who Experienced More, the Same, or Less Pain/Discomfort With the Flexible Scope Compared With the Standard of Care (SOC) Scope, Comparison made using a 3 point scale where 1=much more, 2=about the same, and 3=much less., Day 1
