Observational Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Zanubrutinib in Participants With Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
This is a hybrid (retrospective and prospective) non-interventional registry study to further describe the clinical profile of zanubrutinib in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) participants with and without specific mutations and from racial and ethnic minority groups. Data collected from this registry study will be used to better understand the clinical benefit and safety of zanubrutinib for the treatment of participants in these populations.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
DRUG: Zanubrutinib
Major Response Rate (MRR), MRR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving either complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator using an adaptation of the response criteria updated at the Sixth International Workshop on WM (IWWM), Up to approximately 4 years
VGPR+ Rate, VGPR+ rate is defined as the proportion of participants achieving either CR or VGPR, Up to approximately 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving either CR, VGPR, PR, or minor response (MR), Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of response (CR, VGPR, or PR) until first documentation of or death, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Up to approximately 5 years
