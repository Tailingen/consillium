Active Surveillance on Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma
The study is a multi-center prospective cohort study of active surveillance in papillary thyroid cancer with low risk. The purpose of the study is to observe natural course of low risk papillary thyroid cancer in Korean population, and comparison of prognosis between active surveillance group and conventional surgery group. Patient will be well informed about their choice of active surveillance or surgery.
Thyroid Cancer|Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma
Rate of Progression of Thyroid Papillary Microcarcinoma, rate of progression: tumor size increase of ≥3 mm in at least one dimension, tumor size increase of ≥2 mm in at least two dimensions, suspected organ involvement during the follow-up, such as trachea, esophagus, nerves, vessels, or muscles in imaging study including high-resolution ultrasonography, or pathological diagnosis of lymph node/distant metastasis, 5 years
Comparison of Progression Rate between Active Surveillance and Surgery Group, Which group had higher progression rate; progression defined as whether tumor size increases more than 3 mm in diameter, or tumor involves new lymph nodes, or metastasis occurs, 5 years
