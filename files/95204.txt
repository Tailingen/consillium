Neoadjuvant Electrochemotherapy for Colorectal Cancer - a Randomized Controlled Trial
This is a randomized controlled trial investigating efficacy of electrochemotherapy for early colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Electrochemotheraoy|PROCEDURE: Electroporation with saline (placebo)
Tumor stage, Preoperative tumor stage will be compared with pathological assessment of the surgical specimen and comared between the two study arms using TNM stage, 6 months
Gene expressional changes in the tumor microenvironment, Biopises are collected before the intervention and compared with the surgical specimen using NanoString technology. The PanCancer IO 360 gene panel will be used, a predefined panel of 770 genes., 6 months|Composition of fusobacterium, To characterize the spatial distribution and organization of bacteria in situ, some of the samples will be assessed microscopically. Confocal laser scanning microscopy will be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of both diseased and normal tissue. This will allow us to investigate treatment affects the bacterial composition of fusobacterium., 6 months|PD-1/PD-L1, Immunohistochemical staining for PD-1/PD-L1, 6 months|CD3, Immunohistochemical staining for CD3, 6 months|CD8, Immunohistochemical staining for CD8, 6 months|CD28, Immunohistochemical staining for CD28, 6 months|VAR2, Immunohistochemical staining for VAR2, 6 months
This is a phase 2 randomized controlled trial. The study is blinded. The aim of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of treating patients with early colorectal cancer with electrochemotherapy, compared with electroporation alone, as a down staging and immune-response enhancing treatment prior to intended curative surgery. The study involves recruitment of patients with histologically verified rectal and sigmoid colon cancer with no indication for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (experimental or standard care based) prior to intended curative surgery. In total the study will involve 24 patients, of these, 12 patients are treated with electrochemotherapy (bleomycin) and 12 patients with electroporation alone (placebo)

In relation to the intervention, clinical examination, blood samples, biopsies and questionnaires will be collected to evaluate safety, tumor respons and immunologic response to the treatment.

Patients will be followed for one month after the elective surgery.
