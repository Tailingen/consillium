Recent years, neoadjuvant therapy have emerged as a promising treatment option for the treatment of locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the efficacy of current neoadjuvant regimens is still unsatisfactory. Novel treatment with higher efficacy and safety are urgently needed. Recently, immunotherapy has achieved significant therapeutic effects in the treatment of a series of cancers, and chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has been recommended as the standard first-line treatment for gastric cancer. Moreover, several phase I/II studies have explored the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor in the neoadjuvant treatment for gastric cancer, the results of which indicate that chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy can significantly improve the pCR rate and R0 resection rate of gastric cancer. In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with Cadonilimab（AK104） (a PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody) in the neoadjuvant therapy for resectable locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
