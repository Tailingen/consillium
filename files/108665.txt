For patients affected by metastatic breast cancer RH+/HER2-, the conventional treatment is hormonotherapy. But, when patients don't react no recommendations exist.

Estramustine phosphate is currently prescribed for prostate cancer. The estramustine phosphate is an active anti-tumoral agent by oral route, associating a nitrogenous mustard with the estradiol, it settles on membrane receptor and the cytotoxic component acts essentially by dismantling microtubules inhibiting the mitosis.

Estramustine could be a therapeutic option when currently therapy are exhausted for patients reactive to hormonotherapy previous lines or chemotherapy.
