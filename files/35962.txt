Octreotide Efficacy and Safety in First-line Acromegalic Patients
Primary Acromegaly is a clinical and metabolic disease caused by growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion from a pituitary adenoma and is an insidious, chronic disease that is associated with bony and soft tissue overgrowth. Goals of therapy are to eradicate the tumor, suppress GH secretion, normalize IGF-I levels, and preserve normal pituitary function.

This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide as primary therapy for the treatment of acromegaly and as therapy for patients with acromegaly and a pituitary macroadenoma or microadenoma.
