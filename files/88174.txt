Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth
Male Breast Cancer|Recurrent Breast Cancer|Stage IV Breast Cancer
DRUG: imatinib mesylate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Objective tumor response (CR + PR), as determined by the RECIST criteria, Up to 2 years
Incidence of adverse events, Up to 2 years|Time to progression, Reported using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals indicated., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, Reported using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals indicated., Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the efficacy of STI571 in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that demonstrates expression of CD117 (c-kit) and/ or PDGFR.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the clinical activity of STI571 in MBC with expression of CD117 (ckit) and/ or PDGFR by evaluating progression-free survival (PFS).

II. To determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of STI571 in patients with MBC.

III. To define serum, tissue and imaging surrogate endpoints of activity of STI571 in MBC.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Treatment continues for at least 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
