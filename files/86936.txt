RCT Comparing ESPB Solutions in Breast Surgery
The object of our research is to investigate the relative efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine administered via an Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block as compared to our standard of care medication solution of (bupivacaine mixed with epinephrine, dexamethasone, and clonidine) for pain management in subjects undergoing bilateral surgical intervention for breast cancer. This will be an investigator-initiated, double-blind, patient-controlled, randomized control trial comparing pain scores at 48 hours after injection.
