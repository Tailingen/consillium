Ipilimumab +/- Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Unresectable or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Research Hypothesis: Ipilimumab (an antibody that blocks negative signals to T cells) administered alone or in combination with a pancreatic cancer vaccine (allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene), has an acceptable safety profile in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Primary Objective: To determine the safety profile of ipilimumab alone or in combination with a pancreatic cancer vaccine in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Secondary Objectives:

* To estimate overall survival (OS) which will serve as the primary efficacy signal.
* To explore an association of T cell responses and immunological responses with OS in patients receiving treatment.
* To estimate overall response rate (ORR), immune related best overall response rate (irBOR), progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response in patients receiving treatment.
* To explore an association between immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) and ORR.
* To measure tumor marker kinetics (CA 19-9) in patients receiving treatment.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine
Percent of Patients Experiencing an Unacceptable Toxicity, Unacceptable toxicity is defined as drug related \>grade 4 AEs or grade 3 AEs including IRAEs not improving to \< grade 2 under therapy within 2 weeks. In addition, \> grade 2 eye pain or reduction of visual acuity that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to \< grade 1 severity within 2 weeks of starting therapy, or requires systemic therapy is an unacceptable toxicity., 4 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from date of randomization until death or end of follow-up (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis)., 4 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) during the first 6 months of treatment. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 6 months|Immune Related Best Overall Response Rate (irBOR), Immune Related Best Overall Response (BOR) is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the disease progression/recurrence based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 6 months
