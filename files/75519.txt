Multicenter Pilot-study for the Therapy of Medulloblastoma of Adults
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of a radiochemotherapy (vincristin) and a following maintenance chemotherapy (vincristin, cisplatin and CCNU) in adult patients with medulloblastoma is tolerable.
Medulloblastoma
DRUG: maintenance chemotherapy (vincristin, cisplatin and CCNU)|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
feasibility of the adjuvant chemotherapy, The main objective is the feasibility of the adjuvant chemotherapy which has gained the best results when combined with radiotherapy so far.

The present protocol is primarily to determine the number of interruptions of the maintenance chemotherapy due to toxicity and the kind of toxicity ., participants will be followed for the duration of chemo therapy, an expected average of 1 year
Number of performable cycles in chemo therapy, It should be determined how many cycles in the maintenance chemotherapy are feasible., participants will be followed for the duration of chemo therapy, an expected average of 6 months|3 and 5 years progression-free survival, The 3 and 5-years rate of progression-free survival (pfs) should be determined for adult patients., participants will be followed for the duration of chemo therapy and in the follow-up periode, an expected average of 3 to 5 years|event-free survival, The event-free survival (efs) should be determined for adult patients., participants will be followed for the duration of chemo therapy and in the follow-up periode, an expected average of 3 to 5 years|overall survival, The overall survival (os) should be determined for adult patients., participants will be followed for the duration of chemo therapy and in the follow-up periode, an expected average of 3 to 5 years|course of cognitive performance/QoL, The course of the cognitive performance and the quality of life should be observed., participants will be followed for the duration of chemo therapy and in the follow-up periode, an expected average of 3 to 5 years
As medulloblastoma in adult patients are very rare (1.1% of all brain tumors), adults are often treated in the scope of expanded access treatments or within pediatric studies; although, it is not known whether medulloblastomas act in the same way in adulthood and in childhood. This is the first study to investigate the significance of a combination of a radiochemotherapy (vincristin) and a following maintenance chemotherapy (vincristin, cisplatin and CCNU) in adult patients with medulloblastoma with the purpose to have a starting point for the development of chemotherapeutical protocols in adults.
