A Phase II Study of HMPL-504 in Lung Sarcomatoid Carcinoma and Other Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter study of Savolitinib administered orally once per day(QD) to locally advanced/metastatic PSC patients and other NSCLC patients with MET Exon 14 mutation. The targeted population is the patients with MET Exon 14 mutation who have failed prior systemic therapy (ies), or are unwilling or can not tolerate to receive chemotherapy. Pathological diagnosis will be confirmed retrospectively by the central pathological laboratory.
Lung Sarcomatoid Carcinoma
DRUG: Savolitinib
To assess objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response. The confirmation of response for patients who has PR or CR at first time should be performed by at least 4 weeks and in this study, it could be performed by the scheduled tumor assessment 6 weeks later, 1year
Progression free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the Progression free surviva of patients with complete response or partial response or stable disease. In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks., 1year|Safety Assessment Parameter, The safety will be assessed using the following safety outcome measures: incidence of adverse events, physical examinations,vital signs and laboratory tests (including hematology, clinical chemistry, urine tests and other indicators)12-ECG parameters and echocardiogram., 1year
Savolitinib will be administrated 600mg or 400mg once per day (QD). The treatment will be discontinued for the patients who experience disease progression, death or experience unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 21 days of continuous dosing.
