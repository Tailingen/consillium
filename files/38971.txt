Endodontic Microsurgery With the Use of L-PRF Block
This study evaluates the effect of leucocyte and platelet rich fibrin Block (L-PRF Block) during endodontic microsurgery (EMS) on patient's post-operative comfort and periapical bone healing in large peri-apical lesions.
Apical Periodontitis|Apical Periodontal Cyst
PROCEDURE: Endodontic Microsurgery
Amount of peri-apical bone healing, Amount of periapical bone healing in time: measured with Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)., 1 year
Patient related outcomes, Pain assessed with a Visual Analogue Scale ranging from 0 to 10 each day during the first 7 days post-op., 7 days|Patient related outcomes, Pain assessed with a questionnaire asking about analgesics usage each day during 7 days post-op., 7 days|Patient related outcomes, Discomfort assessed with a Visual Analogue Scale ranging from 1 to 5 each day during the first 7 days post-op., 7 days|Bone or scar tissue healing, Bone or scar tissue healing: Volumetric analysis using Cone-Beam Computed Tomography. Pre-operative CBCT data will be matched with the post-op CBCT scans in order to assess the volumetric changes during 1 year., 1 year|Success & survival rate, Success \& survival rate, 1 year|Dentinal defects, Dentinal defects: in the apical root before and after resection. Potential cracks and fractures that occur during the follow-up period will be assessed on CBCT en reported., 1 year
This study evaluates the effect of leucocyte and platelet rich fibrin Block (L-PRF Block) during endodontic microsurgery (EMS) on patient's post-operative comfort and periapical bone healing in large peri-apical lesions. The trial design is an open randomized controlled clinical trial with two groups. Half of the participants will receive EMS with L-PRF Block (experimental group), the other half without (control group).
