A Study of the Use of AirXpanders AeroForm in Patients Undergoing Post-Mastectomy Radiation Therapy
This study seeks to to determine the efficacy and side effect profile following radiation therapy for participants with the AeroForm device placed. The AeroForm device is FDA approved.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: AirXpanders AeroFormtissue expander
Rate of successful reconstructions following radiation therapy, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement
Rate of implant success at 6months following replacement., up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Rate of reconstruction revisions from Aeroform placement throughout study., up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Time to implant exchange from Aeroform placement., up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy following initial surgery (when applicable)., up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Time to initiation of radiation therapy following initial surgery, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Cosmetic outcomes per the aesthetics scale, 13-question assessment with scores ranging from 13 - 65, higher scores indicating better aesthetics, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Quality of life based on the BREAST-Q scales, Full name BREAST-Q- Reconstruction Module version 2.0, higher is better outcome, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Quality of life based on the Breast satisfactions scales, Full name BREAST-Q- Reconstruction Module version 2.0, higher is better outcome, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Number of participants who experience acute toxicity per CTCAE version 4.0, See AE/SAE section, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement|Chronic toxicity per CTCAE, Baker scoring, Full name CTCAE Toxicity/Baker Capsular Contracture, Higher- worse CTCAE and Baker, up to 6 months following permanent implant placement
Primary objective:

To assess the proportion of successful initial phase of tissue expander/implant based breast reconstructions (no reconstruction failure or unexpected return to the operating room) following post-mastectomy radiation therapy in participants with AeroFormplaced.

Secondary objectives:

* To evaluate the rate of successful exchange of tissue expander for implant
* To evaluate the rate of reconstruction revisions
* To evaluate CTCAE acute and chronic toxicity rates, infections and cosmetic outcomes
* To evaluate dosimetry to treatment targets as well as organs at risk (heart, lungs) with AeroFormas compared to traditional reconstruction techniques.
* To evaluate time to initiation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
* To evaluate clinical outcomes-local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases, survival
* To evaluate participant breast reconstruction related QOL with the AirXpander AeroFormdevice

This is a phase II trial evaluating the use of the intervention in participants with breast cancer undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy in order to define the toxicity profile and associated subsequent successful surgical reconstruction rate
