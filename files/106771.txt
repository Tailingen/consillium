Prognostic Models for HCC Based on Tumor Micronecrosis
The heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) leads to the unsatisfying predicting performance of current staging systems. HCC patients with pathological tumor micronecrosis have immunosuppressive microenvironment. We aimed to develop novel prognostic models by integrating micronecrosis to more precisely predict the survival of HCC patients after hepatectomy.
