Epione速 Post-Market Clinical Follow-up Study
Post-Market Clinical Follow-up study in order to consolidate performance and safety data of the EPIONE速 device when used for percutaneous procedures in the abdomen
Cancer Abdomen
DEVICE: EPIONE速 CT-Guided Percutaneous procedures
Technical Success, Number of targets reached ; the target is considered to have been reached when the needle is positioned accurately enough to allow the planned procedure to be performed., through study completion up to 36 months
Needle placement accuracy, accuracy of the needle placement: deviation between the planned and actual needle position once inserted, through study completion up to 36 months|Number and nature of needle adjustments to reach the target, Detail of the number/nature of adjustments performed after the initial insertion of the needle, through study completion up to 36 months|Post-intervention ablation success, Minimal Ablation Margin(s) measure(s) if applicable (mm), through study completion up to 36 months|Local tumor recurrence, Evaluation of the local tumor progression following the ablation (if applicable), through study completion up to 36 months|Operator satisfaction, 5-point Likert scale: very Dissatisfied/dissatisfied/neutral/satisfied/highly satisfied, through study completion up to 36 months|Adverse Events related to device or procedure, Safety of the device, through study completion up to 36 months|Device dysfunction, Evaluation of the device dysfunction, through study completion up to 36 months
The objective of this PMCF study is to compile data on the routine use of the EPIONE速 device in subjects undergoing CT-guided percutaneous procedures in the abdomen.

The objectives are:

1. to evaluate the technical success of the device
2. to evaluate performance parameters (accuracy measures, adjustements, post-intervention ablation success, local tumor recurrence, operator satisfaction) and the safety of the device

55 patients are planned in this post-market study.
