A Phase II Study of Radiation Therapy, Paclitaxel Poliglumex, and Carboplatin in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is intended to evaluate the role of paclitaxel poliglumex and carboplatin in the treatment of unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer along with radiation therapy in a multi-institutional trial. Consolidation chemotherapy with paclitaxel poliglumex and carboplatin will follow the completion of chemoradiation.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Paclitaxel poliglumex|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: External beam radiation therapy
Overall Survival (OS) Rate, * OS = time from patient registration to death of all causes
* Estimated using Kaplan Meier, 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS = time from patient registration to death of all causes, Completion of follow-up (follow-up ranged from 3 months to 6 years)
Failure-free Survival (FFS) Rate, * The time between patient registration and a failure event (progression, relapse, or death of all cause, whichever is first)
