Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Treatment of Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
This is a feasibility single-center study to investigate the tolerability, toxicity, quality of life, morbidity, mortality of the HIPEC treatment following cytoreductive surgery for treatment of recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers.

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality; it is in 75% of cases detected at advanced stages. The standard treatment is cytoreductive surgery with removal of macroscopic tumor, and intravenous chemotherapy. Three randomized trials observed survival gain for ovarian cancer patients that received intraperitoneal chemotherapy after the optimal cytoreduction, however catheter-related complications made the procedure not feasible. A "one-time" hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, HIPEC, is an established for peritoneal carcinosis in colorectal cancer, and recently two phase III randomised clinical studies observe survival gain also for ovarian cancer patients after surgery with HIPEC.

Here the investigators, plan to investigate the HIPEC procedure following cytoreductive surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer, a progressed disease without any standard treatment established.
