Effect of Longer-term Adrenal Suppression Using Low Dose Hydrocortisone on Androgen Overproduction
This study will test whether longer-term suppression of adrenal function can ameliorate androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight early pubertal girls with androgen excess. The investigators hypothesize that suppression of nighttime adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) production by 12 weeks of evening oral hydrocortisone administration will improve androgen levels in girls with adrenal androgen overproduction. Specifically, this intervention will improve androgen levels after adrenal stimulation testing with ACTH or ovarian stimulation testing with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG).
