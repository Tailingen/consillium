A Novel Adaptive Anastomotic Technique for Left-sided Colonic Resection
The goal of this pilot clinical trial is provide preminary evidence of the effectiveness of the C-REX device, developed by CarpoNovum AB, in preventing anastomotic leak and improving anastomosis healing after sigmoid or high rectal resection in patients with colon neoplasia. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the rate of anastomotic leak in patients receiving the study device within 90 days from the surgical procedure.

Despite technological advancements, the rate of anastomotic leak after left colon and high rectal resection remains high, around 20%. The device C-REX, developed by CarpoNovum, may help the anastomosis construction and promote its healing. This may lead to reduced anastomotic leak rate and severity. This study aims to collect preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of C-REX to develop a future larger multicentric trial. This pilot study will collect preliminary data on the rate and severity of 90-day anastomotic leak in patients receiving the C-REX device.
