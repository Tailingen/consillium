Trial for Local Ablative Treatment (LAT) Optimization in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cells Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Presenting an Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Rearrangement Treated by Brigatinib
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the treatment by systemic Brigatinib (ALUNBRIG®) associated to local ablative therapy (LAT) treatment is improved if administered when the brigatinib works best in participants presenting an advanced non-small cells lung cancer with an ALK gene anomaly (this anomaly produces a defective protein that is responsible for the multiplication of cancer cells).

This clinical trial is expected to involve 45 participants in several sites in France.

Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants with ALK rearrangements treated with brigatinib in first line of non-curable setting will be screened.

If the disease assessment done between 3 to 9 months after initiation of brigatinib shows:

* a tumor response or stabilization (according to RECIST 1.1)
* a disease which meets the definition of an oligometastatic disease (five metastatic lesions or less and a maximum of two lesions per organ)
* all tumor targets are accessible to a local ablative therapy (confirmed by an expert panel of clinicians before inclusion): surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). For liver, adrenal, or other metastases, percutaneous thermal ablation will be accepted.

Participants will be asked to visit the clinic:

* for eligibility criteria assessment prior to LAT
* for LAT
* every 8 weeks for checkups and tests the first year after LAT
* and then every 12 weeks, for a maximum period of 3 years.

Eligible patients will benefit from local ablative therapy with continuation of brigatinib.

BIOLOGICAL: Blood samples for Hematology|BIOLOGICAL: Blood samples for Chemistry|BIOLOGICAL: Blood sample for liver function tests|BIOLOGICAL: Pregnancy test|PROCEDURE: Tumour assessment|PROCEDURE: Local Ablative Therapy (LAT)
Progression free survival (PFS) centrally assessed, PFS is defined as the time from Brigatinib initiation until tumor progression or death from any cause according to RECIST v1.1, evaluated by the expert panel.

Radiological evaluation of the target lesions(s) will be performed at the following time points: Screening, then every 8 weeks during the first year then every 12 weeks thereafter.

An expert panel of blinded clinicians will anonymously review the radiological evaluations and confirm/infirm the Investigator's assessment. Each Investigator must provide all the documents necessary to assess the various endpoints.

Progression occurring before 2 years will be considered for the endpoint. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the last radiological assessment., From the start date of treatment up to the disease progression as per central reading or for a maximum of 3 years.
Progression free survival (PFS) locally assessed, PFS is defined as the time from Brigatinib initiation until tumor progression or death from any cause according to RECIST v1.1, evaluated by the investigators.

Radiological evaluation of the target lesions(s) will be performed at the following time points: Screening, then every 8 weeks during the first year then every 12 weeks thereafter.

If a Computed Tomography (CT) scan for tumor assessment is performed in a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner or CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full-contrast diagnostic CT scan.

Response will be assessed by the Investigator at each center using RECIST v1.1. Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.

Progression occurring before 2 years will be considered for the endpoint. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the last radiological assessment., From the start date of treatment up to the disease progression as per local reading or for a maximum of 3 years.|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival defined as the time from Brigatinib initiation until death or lost of follow up.

Patients alive will be censored at the date of last news or data cutoff. The patient's status (dead, alive or censored) will be determined at the same time points as PFS (Screening, then every 8 weeks during the first year then every 12 weeks thereafter) in order to evaluate OS. In addition, OS will be determined during the Post-study Follow-up Period via in-person or phone contact every 3 months., From the start of treatment until death or lost of follow-up or for a maximum of 3 years|Median PFS, Median PFS defined as the time from Brigatinib initiation until death or lost of follow up.

Patients alive without progressive disease will be censored at the date of last news or data cutoff., From the start of treatment until death or lost of follow-up or for a maximum of 3 years|Safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability : proportion of patients with any adverse event (AE), serious AEs (SAEs) and all AEs of grade ≥3 according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v5.0 criteria.

Participants will be monitored for AEs from the time the informed consent form is signed until 90 days after the last administration of radiotherapy or until 60 days after the last surgery / thermal ablation. Safety assessments may include monitoring of any or all of the following parameters: clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings, results of physical examination, or results of other tests and/or procedures.

Any later SAE, i.e. occurring after the end of the reporting period, which is considered to be related to the trial intervention(s) or to the research (protocol required diagnostic procedures and examinations carried out during the research) must be reported without any limitation in terms of deadline., From the enrolment of the participant up to until 90 days after the last administration of radiotherapy or until 60 days after the last surgery / thermal ablation|Duration of Treatment (DOR), Duration of treatment, defined as the time from the first Brigatinib treatment administration until the date of last treatment administration. Dates of first and last treatment administration will be recorded for each treatment to calculate the duration of treatment., From the start date of treatment up to stop date of treatment or for a maximum of 3 years
