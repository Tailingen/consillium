Protocol in Acute Myeloid Leukemia With FLT3-ITD
This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study in adult patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and FLT3-ITD as defined in inclusion/exclusion criteria.

The primary efficacy object is to evaluate the impact of midostaurin given in combination with intensive induction, consolidation including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and single agent maintenance therapy on event-free survival (EFS) in adult patients with AML exhibiting a FLT3-ITD.

Sample size: 440 patients

The treatment duration of an individual patient is between 18 and 24 months. Duration of the study for an individual patient including treatment (induction, consolidation \[chemotherapy or allogeneic SCT\], maintenance and follow-up period: Maximum 8 years

DRUG: Midostaurin|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Daunorubicin
Event-free Survival, To perform two predefined subgroup analyses in the age-groups 18-60 years and 61-70 years evaluating the impact of midostaurin given in combination with intensive induction, consolidation including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and single agent maintenance therapy on event-free survival (EFS) in adult patients with AML exhibiting a FLT3-ITD., 8years
Rate of complete remission (CR), Two months|Relapse-free survival, 8 years|overall survival, 8 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse, 8 years|cumulative incidence of death in CR, 8 years|Target (FLT3) inhibition by measuring the FLT3 plasma inhibitory activity, Evaluation of target (FLT3) inhibition by continuous dosing of midostaurin, 8 years|Quality of life, Quality of life assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), supplemented by information on self-assessed concomitant diseases, late treatment effects, and demographics initially, in first CR, after one year,3 and 5 years after initial diagnosis., 5 years|Rate of early deaths and hypoplastic deaths (ED/HD), two months|Death in CR, 8 years|Toxicities, Type, frequency, severity (graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] Version 3.0), timing and relatedness of hematological and non-hematological toxicities observed during the different treatment cycles, between 18 and 24 months|Impact of allogeneic HSCT, Assessment of the relative impact of allogeneic HSCT analyzed as time-dependent variable on survival endpoints., 8 years
