Pre-operative Immuno-Nutrition in Radical Cystectomy
This study will evaluate the effect of preoperative oral immunonutrition on postoperative complications in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Patients receiving preoperative immunonutrition will be compared to controls receiving a standard high-calorie, high-protein oral nutritional supplement.

Radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and urinary reconstruction is a major surgical procedure performed for bladder cancer. The literature reports an incidence of 50-88% and 30-42% for any grade complications (Clavier-Dindo grade I-IV) and severe complications (Clavier-Dindo grade ≥III), respectively. Nutritional status prior to radical cystectomy has been shown to be a strong predictor of 90-day mortality. The term "immunonutrition" refers to the oral or enteral administration of specific substrates such as omega-3 fatty acids, arginine, and nucleotides. These substrates have been shown to upregulate the host immune response, modulate inflammatory responses and improve protein synthesis after surgery, with a favorable impact on postoperative infection rates and length of hospital stay in major abdominal surgery. Data on patients undergoing radical cystectomy are scarce, mainly due to the small sample size of the studies. However, the available evidence suggests a potential beneficial effect of this nutritional intervention in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Several aspects remain largely unclear, including the dosage and timing of immunonutrition and the impact of preoperative malnutrition risk on the efficacy of immunonutrition. This study will evaluate the effect of 7 days of preoperative immunonutrition on postoperative complications compared to patients receiving standard high-calorie, high-protein oral nutritional supplements.
