In Vitro Drug Sensitivity Testing of Fresh Human Samples
Hematological malignancies gather several various pathologies included myeloproliferative disorders (as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)) and lymphoproliferative disorders (as chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM)) .

Over the last decade, the treatments have evolved significantly but the overall survival remains limited, especially for the AML and MM patients. There's an ongoing imperative to continue in-vitro and in-vivo studies to better evaluate the anti-cancer drugs sensitivity and therefore improving the response to treatments and open new fields of application. The healthy control group will be contributing to produce some pertinent and significant data for the results of the index cases group.

The investigators aim to analyze 10 differents drugs, common use in chemotherapy or immunotherapy and evaluate by 2 ways the sensitivity: first, Flow cytometry (cells apoptosis by Annexine V and propidium iodide) on fresh samples and in a second time, monitoring of the blasts in the mouse's blood after injection.
