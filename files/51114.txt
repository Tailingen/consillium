Non-invasive Diagnostics and Monitoring of MRD and Clonal Evolution in Waldenstr√∂m's Macroglobulinemia and in IgM-MGUS
Multicenter retrospective and prospective observational study including patients with WM or IgM-MGUS evaluated at the time of diagnosis and during the disease course using highly sensitive techniques.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
OTHER: MRD and clonal evolution
Rate of mutation, To demonstrate that the rate of mutations of MYD88 (L265P) and/or CXCR4 (S338X) detected in peripheral blood and/or urine show a negligible difference with the rate of mutations detected in bone marrow samples (BM, gold standard), 22 months
Multicenter retrospective and prospective observational study including patients with WM or IgM-MGUS evaluated at the time of diagnosis and during the disease course using highly sensitive techniques such as flow cytometry, real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), digital droplet PCR (dd-PCR) and NGS, in order to: evaluate the mutational status on genomic DNA or cell-free DNA and compare the results to assess the most reliable source for mutation studies; perform and compare molecular and flow cytometry analyses on bone marrow, peripheral blood (both analyses), plasma and urine samples (only molecular analysis) to assess the best source for diagnosis and MRD monitoring.
