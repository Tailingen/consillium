Contrast-enhanced MRI in Detecting Benign and Malignant Liver Lesions
This clinical trial studies contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting nonmalignant and malignant liver lesions. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help find and diagnose nonmalignant and malignant liver lesions. Contrast agents, such as gadoxetate disodium and gadobutrol, may help doctors to see MRI images more clearly.

PROCEDURE: Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging|DRUG: Gadobutrol|DRUG: Gadoxetate Disodium
Specificity of combining gadoxetate disodium and gadobutrol in diagnosing tumor lesions radiologically using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Summary statistics of sensitivity, specificity, true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives will be provided for gadoxetate disodium and gadoxetate disodium + gadobutrol method. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value will be estimated along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the two methods. Comparison between the two methods will be made following method by Obuchowski. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 4 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the specificity of contrast enhanced MRI using a liver specific agent Eovist (gadoxetate disodium) versus the combined use of Eovist and an intravascular-extracellular agent Gadavist (gadobutrol) for the radiologic detection and characterization of liver lesions via clinical stability and follow up imaging.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive gadoxetate disodium intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and undergo MRI. Patients then receive gadobutrol IV over 1 minute at the 20 minute mark during MRI.
