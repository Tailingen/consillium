CC-4047 With Gemcitabine for Untreated Advanced Carcinoma of the Pancreas
Because the activity of CC-4047 addresses numerous mechanisms of carcinoma growth inhibition - including, but not limited to anti-angiogenesis - CC-4047 has been selected for development as part of induction chemotherapy regimens for solid tumors. This study in pancreatic cancer is designed to determine the appropriate CC-4047 dose and regimen in combination with gemcitabine.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The Dose of Study Drug(s) Which Causes <33% of Patients Treated to Experience Unacceptable Side Effects, Unacceptable side effects or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as follows:

* Inability to Complete cycle 1 of therapy due to drug-related toxicity.
* \> Grade 3 non-hematological drug-related toxicity (excluding alopecia) despite optimal supportive care
* Febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \<1,000/μL and fever \>101° F (38.5° C))
* Grade 4 neutropenia that occurs prior to day 21. (Grade 4 neutropenia that occurs after day 21 but resolves within 7 days of the scheduled cycle 2, will not be considered DLT)
* Platelet count \< 25,000/μL
* Inability to initiate Cycle 2, Day 1 therapy within 7 days of scheduled start (i.e. cannot delay the start of Cycle 2 by more than 7 days following the normal 7 day recovery period) due to drug-related toxicity., 6 months|The Safety and Tolerability of Protocol Treatment, Defined as the Percentage of Patients Experiencing Severe or Life-threatening Side Effects Per CTCAE Version 3.0, The relative incidence of Grade 3/4 adverse events from protocol treatment as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), 24 Months
Phase I

Primary:

• To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety profile of oral CC-4047 given on days 1-21 in combination with gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days in subjects with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

Secondary:

• To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of CC-4047 and gemcitabine as combination therapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

Phase II

Primary:

• To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of CC-4047 on days 1-21 and gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days in subjects with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

Secondary:

• To evaluate the safety profile of the combination of CC-4047 and gemcitabine as combination therapy in subjects with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.
