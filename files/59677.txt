Study of Safety and Tolerability of BCA101 Monotherapy and in Combination Therapy in Patients With EGFR-driven Advanced Solid Tumors
The investigational drug to be studied in this protocol, BCA101, is a first-in-class compound that targets both EGFR with TGFÎ². Based on preclinical data, this bifunctional antibody may exert synergistic activity in patients with EGFR-driven tumors.

This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label study, which consists of dose escalation parts (Part A) followed by expansion cohorts (Part B) for both single agent BCA101 and combination BCA101 plus pembrolizumab.

The study population in dose escalation (Part A) of single agent BCA101 consists of subjects with EGFR-driven advanced solid tumors refractory to standard of care or for whom no standard of care is available. Dose escalation (Part A) of combination BCA101 and pembrolizumab consists of subjects with either Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (HNSCC) or Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal (SCCAC) whose tumors are refractory to standard of care or for whom no standard of care is available.

Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended dose (RD) of single agent BCA101 is determined, the study will continue with expansion cohorts (Part B) with select tumor types. Expansion cohorts for single agent BCA101 will include cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Planned expansion cohorts for the combination of BCA101 and pembrolizumab include: 1) HNSCC and 2) SCCAC.
