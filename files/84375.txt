A Single-Arm, Phase â… b Study of Golidocitinib Combined With Anti-PD-1 for the Treatment of Previously Treated NSCLC
This study is a phase Ib, single-center, single-arm exploratory clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Golidocitinib in combination with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 in combination with or without platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens.
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
DRUG: Golidocitinib in combination with anti-PD-1
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To assess Golidocitinib overall response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as the proportion of subjects who have a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), Time from first dose to last dose, or up to 24 month
Progression-free survival (PFS), To assess progression-free survival of patients treated by Golidocitinib according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as first dose to first documented disease progression assessed by investigator or death due to any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Duration of Response (DoR), To assess duration of response for subjects with CR or PR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator , defined as the time from the first documented CR or PR to disease progression or death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Overall survival (OS), To assess overall survival, define as first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, From first dose until 28 days after the last dose, up to 24 month
This study is a phase Ib, single-center, single-arm exploratory clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Golidocitinib in combination with PD-1 monoclonal antibody in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with PD-1 monoclonal antibody in combination with or without platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. The purpose of this part is to obtain the safety profile of the Golidocitinib in combination with PD-1 monoclonal antibody regimen in subjects with NSCLC who have failed treatment with first-line PD-1 monoclonal antibody in combination with or without platinum-containing chemotherapeutic regimens, and the recommended dose of the combination. The study will enroll 30 patients receiving Golidocitinib administered once daily (orally) at a starting dose of 75 mg up to a maximum dose of 150 mg; PD-1 monoclonal antibody at a clinically standardized dose (e.g., 200 mg IV Q3W), until the patients experienced disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or met the criteria for discontinuation of the trial drug. The primary endpoint was ORR, and secondary endpoints included PFS, DCR, OS, and safety. The study is expected to commence recruitment in mainland China in about Dec 2024. It is expected that the trial will end in July 2027.
