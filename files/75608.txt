Comparison of 7-day PPI-based Standard Triple Therapy and 10-day Bismuth Quadruple Therapy for H. Pylori Eradication
In this randomized controlled trial, we investigate the effect of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy in comparison with that of 7-day PPI-based standard triple as 1st line treatment for H. pylori.

Current Helicobacter pylori management guidelines recommend proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy as 1st line treatment. However, in Korea, eradication rates of PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy have been decreased to less than 80% due to increased clarithromycin resistance. In areas of high clarithromycin resistance (resistance rate more than 15%), guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy as a 1st line treatment for H. pylori eradication. Clarithromycin resistance rates reported from 15.7% to 42.1% in Korea, thus, bismuth quadruple therapy may be better 1st line treatment than PPI-Clarithromycin containing triple therapy. However, only one limited study was performed to compare effects of the both treatment regimens in Korea. Thus, studies evaluating the effect of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy as the first line treatment for H. pylori infection.
