A Phase II Study of Loncastuximab Tesirine as Consolidation Strategy in Patients With LBCL in PR After CAR T-cell Therapy
To learn if loncastuximab tesirine (called "lonca" in this informed consent form) can help to control large B-cell lymphoma that is relapsed or refractory after receiving CAR T-cell therapy. The safety and possible effects of the study therapy will also be studied.
Large B-cell Lymphoma|Lymphoma
DRUG: Loncastuximab Tesirine
Rate of conversion to complete response, through study completion and or average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

-To evaluate the efficacy of lonca as consolidation therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL who achieve PR after CAR T-cell therapy.

Secondary Objectives:

-To evaluate safety and tolerability of lonca as consolidation therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL who achieve PR after CAR T-cell therapy.

Exploratory Objective:

-To determine the pharmacodynamic effects and investigate biomarkers of response and resistance of this novel consolidation therapy.
