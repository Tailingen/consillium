Real-world Treatment Patterns and Associated Outcomes in Patients With Resectable Early-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multicentre, retrospective study designed to determine the treatment patterns and associated survival rate in patients with primary stage IA to IIIB resectable NSCLC diagnosed between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 and followed until at least 31 December 2020 The main objective of this study is to describe the treatment patterns and determine their associated 3-year survival rate according to clinical and pathologic staging in patients with resectable early-stage (IA to IIIB as per AJCC seventh edition) NSCLC.

Effectiveness outcomes rwDFS defined as time from the date of surgery to recurrence or death, Effectiveness outcomes will be determined for each treatment modality as; rwDFS defined as time from the date of surgery to recurrence or death due to any cause; rwDFS rate at predefined landmark timepoints (overall, per clinical, and pathologic staging) for evaluation of primary treatment, 3 Years|Effectiveness outcomes rwEFS rate at predefined landmark timepoints, Effectiveness outcomes will be determined for each treatment modality as; rwEFS rate at predefined landmark timepoints (overall, per clinical and pathologic staging) for evaluation of primary treatment, 3 Years|Effectiveness outcomes rwPFS defined as time from local or distant relapse to disease progression or death, Effectiveness outcomes will be determined for each treatment modality as; rwPFS defined as time from local or distant relapse to disease progression or death due to any cause for evaluation of subsequent treatment ie, first, second, and third LOTsa, 3 Years
This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multicentre, retrospective study designed to determine the treatment patterns and associated survival rate in patients with primary stage IA to IIIB resectable NSCLC diagnosed between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 and followed until at least 31 December 2020. This study will also determine the prevalence of EGFR mutations and PD-L1 expression, and the clinical outcomes as per the treatment patterns and clinico-pathological staging. Data will be collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records from the date of initial diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC (index date) to the end of follow up ie, until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest. The data on treatment modalities, sociodemographic, clinico-pathological characteristics, and exposure and outcome variables (ie, medical and treatment history, disease staging, biomarker assessments, radiological findings, concomitant medications, survival), factor(s) for prescribing neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment and reason(s) for discontinuation will be extracted from patients' medical records.
