TNF-Inhibitor as Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor for Advanced MELanoma
This is a Phase 1b, open-label study of immune checkpoints inhibitors Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with the anti-TNF-α either Infliximab or Certolizumab, in patients with advanced melanoma.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Nivolumab+Ipilimumab in combination with Anti TNF-α Certolizumab|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Nivolumab+Ipilimumab in combination with Anti TNF-α Infliximab
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) incidence, in part 1 of the study., For each patient, DLT incidence will be evaluated during the Part 1 of the study: 12 weeks after the initial dose of study drug., 12 weeks per patient (part 1)
Safety and tolerability according to the classification of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.03., The assessment of safety and tolerability will be based on the incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events, AEs leading to discontinuation, and death. In addition, clinical laboratory test abnormalities will be examined. Tolerability will be evaluated by collecting dose interruptions and dose delays., 15 months per patient|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from inclusion until progression or deaths; patients alive at last follow-up news are censored at this date., 24 months per patient|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of patients with Best Overall Response divided by the number of included patients in each cohort., 24 months per patient
The study will be conducted in 2 consecutive parts:

* Part 1 with 2 parallel cohorts (Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with anti-TNF-α Certolizumab (Cohort 1) and Nivolumab+Ipilimumab administered in combination with anti-TNF-α Infliximab (Cohort 2)). 6 patients will be included in each cohort.
* Part 2 (expansion phase) will then be scheduled after the most promising combination has been confirmed; the choice of the combination will be based on safety, efficacy, and PD data observed in both cohorts during the Part 1 of the study.
