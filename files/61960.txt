Neoadjuvant Adebrelimab With Dalpiciclib for Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinomas
The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and feasibility of anti-programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) immunotherapy, Adebrelimab, combined with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 blockade, Dalpiciclib, as a new neoadjuvant treatment regimen for patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Adebrelimab|DRUG: Dalpiciclib 100mg|DRUG: Dalpiciclib 150mg
Safety of combination adebrelimab and dalpiciclib as assessed by number of participants who experience adverse events, Number of participants who experience grade 1 or higher adverse events, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., up to 15 weeks|Feasibility of combination adebrelimab and dalpiciclib as assessed by number of participants who experience adverse events, Patients proceed to surgery without experiencing prolonged treatment-related delays. An extended treatment-related delay will be considered if it exceeds 37 days from the initially scheduled surgery date. In terms of feasibility, if there is any treatment toxicity of any grade that could adversely impact prognosis, as judged by the investigators, the planned operative date should be re-evaluated., up to 15 weeks
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of dalpiciclib as determined by number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by the maximum dose at which the least number of participants experience dose-limiting toxicity. The dose limiting toxicity is defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., up to 15 weeks|Major Pathologic Response, Major Pathologic Response (MPR) was defined as fewer than 10% viable tumor cells., up to 15 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of participants with measurable disease at baseline and have been re-evaluated after at least 1 cycle of therapy with observed reduction in tumor burden as defined by RECIST and iRECIST criteria after 2 doses of Proportion of participants with measurable disease at baseline and have been re-evaluated after at least 1 cycle of therapy with observed reduction in tumor burden as defined by RECIST and iRECIST criteria after 2 doses of Adebrelimab and Dalpiciclib, up to 15 weeks|Progression free survival(PFS), Proportion of participants who achieve progression free survival post treatment, Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Proportion of participants who achieve survival post treatment, Up to 2 years
