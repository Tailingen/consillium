Randomized Controlled Trials Comparing Clinical Outcomes of 3D Versus 2D Laparoscopic Surgery for Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of 3D Laparoscopic Surgery for Gastric Cancer. The patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (cT1-4aN0-3M0) were studied.
Stomach Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: 3D Laparoscopic Surgery|PROCEDURE: 2D Laparoscopic Surgery
Operating time, Operating time, 1 day
Intraoperative situation, The number of lymph node dissection, the number of positive lymph nodes, intraoperative lymph node dissection time(regional analysis: infrapyloric area lymph node, suprapancreatic area lymph node, splenic hilar area lymph node, cardial area lymph node), intracavitary anastomosis time(patients who undergo totally laparoscopic surgery are analyzed), intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative injury, the amount of use of titanium clip, the rate of conversion to laparotomy, 1 day|Postoperative recovery course, Time to first ambulation, flatus, liquid diet and soft diet, duration of postoperative hospital stay and postoperative pain are used to assess the postoperative recovery course.Visual analog pain score method is used to evaluate the difference of postoperative pain degree., 10 days|Complication, Early complications occurred within 30 days after operation: pulmonary infection, incision complication, intestinal obstruction, abdominal infection, anastomotic bleeding, anastomotic fistula, gastric emptying; Long-term complications (30 days later after operation): anastomotic stenosis, intestinal obstruction, dumping syndrome, 30 days;36 months|The postoperative pathology, The postoperative pathological type and pTNM stage., 7 days|Inflammatory and immune response, The daily highest body temperature before discharge and the values of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, prealbumin and relevant immune cytokines including T cell percentage, T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+) percentage, T-suppressor lymphocytes (CD8+) percentage, natural killer (NK) cells percentage from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded., 7 days|Morbidity and mortality, The early postoperative complication and mortality are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery, while the time frame for late complication is the period from postoperative day 31th to the end of month 36th., 30 days;36 months|Hospitalization expenses, The cost from admission to discharge, 1 months|3-year disease free survival rate, Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to the time of recurrence or death from any cause, 36 months|3-year overall survival rate, Overall survival was defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause, 36 months|5-year disease free survival rate, Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to the time of recurrence or death from any cause, 60 months|5-year overall survival rate, Overall survival was defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause, 60 months|Recurrence patterns, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type., 60 months
A prospective randomized comparison of 3D and 2D laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical experience for the extensive application of the 3D laparoscopic technique. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year/5-year survival and recurrence rates.
