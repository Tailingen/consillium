The effectiveness of seven over-the-counter remedies for dry mouth as determined by amount of saliva output and a brief questionaire., 8-10 weeks
Xerostomia (dry mouth) is the most common late complication of radiation therapy for head and neck cancers. When patients are cured or survive for several years, xerostomia often becomes quite bothersome; it affects their quality of life. This study compares the effectiveness of seven over-the-counter remedies, 2 rinses, 3 sprays and 2 chewing gums. A computer program will make random assignments so that the patient nor the physician will choose the order in which the products are tried. The remedies will be used for one week each and at the end of each period the patient will fill out a questionaire.
