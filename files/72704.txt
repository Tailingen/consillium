Comparative Low and High Dose of Dexmedethomidine in Pituitary Tumor Removal by Transphenoid Approach
Transnasal transsphenoidal (TNTS) resection of pituitary tumors involves wide fluctuation in hemodynamic parameter and causes hypertension and tachycardia due to intense noxious stimuli during various stages of surgery. None of routinely used anesthetic agents effectively blunts the undesirable hemodynamic responses, and therefore usually there is a need to use increased doses of anesthetic agents. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) an Î±-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, because its sympatholytic and antinociceptive properties may ensure optimal intraoperative hemodynamic stability during critical moments of surgical manipulation. In addition, DEX reduced the anesthetic requirement with rapid recovery at the end of surgery. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of DEX on perioperative hemodynamics, anesthetic requirements
Pituitary Tumor
DRUG: high dose dexmedethomidine|DRUG: low dose dexmedethomidine
Comparative Low and High Dose of Dexmedethomidine in Pituitary Tumor Removal by Transphenoid Approach, Low dose is 0.2microgram/kg/hr High dose is 0.5 microgram/kg/hr what is the dose proper and hemodynamic changes. Hemodynamic change means BP is lower than 20% of baseline more than 10minute, 24 hours
Comparative Low and High Dose of Dexmedethomidine in Pituitary Tumor, Low dose is 0.2microgram/kg/hr High dose is 0.5 microgram/kg/hr how much dose blood loss, 24 hours
DEX as an anesthetic adjuvant improved hemodynamic stability and decreased anesthetic requirements in patients undergoing TNTS resection of pituitary tumor. In addition, DEX provided better surgical field exposure conditions and early recovery from anesthesia
