A Study of Belzutifan (MK-6482) in Participants With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-6482-013)
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of two doses of belzutifan in participants with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cell component after prior therapy.

The primary hypothesis is that the higher dose of belzutifan is superior to the standard dose in terms of objective response rate (ORR).
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Belzutifan
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR as assessed by blinded independent central review based on RECIST 1.1 was presented., Up to approximately 27 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review was presented., Up to approximately 27 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrated a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review was presented., Up to approximately 27 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or stable disease (SD: Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.) ≥6 months per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants with CBR will be presented., Up to approximately 27 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experienced one or more AEs was presented., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE was presented., Up to approximately 26 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Belzutifan, Blood samples were obtained at designated time points for the determination of the Cmax of belzutifan., Weeks 1 and 3 on Day 1: predose and 1, 2, and 4 hours. Week 5 on Day 1: predose only|Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Belzutifan, Blood samples were obtained at designated time points for the determination of the Ctrough of belzutifan., Weeks 1 and 3 on Day 1: predose and 1, 2, and 4 hours. Week 5 on Day 1: predose only
