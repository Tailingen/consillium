TCR-engineered T Cells in Solid Tumors (ACTengine IMA201-101)
The study purpose is to establish the safety and tolerability of IMA201 in patients with solid tumors that express melanoma-associated antigen 4 and/or 8 (MAGEA4/8).
Solid Tumor|Cancer|Recurrent Solid Tumors|Refractory Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: IMA201 Product|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: IMADetectÂ®
Incidence of adverse events (AE), up to 3 years post-treatment|Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), until 21 days post treatment
Duration of infused T cells over time (Persistence of T cells), up to 3 years post-treatment|Tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), up to 12 months
SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening and the biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA201 product.

MANUFACTURING: IMA201 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days before the IMA201 infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA201 stays in the body.

After IMA201 infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given twice daily for a period of time.

Patients will be closely monitored for safety and for a total of 3 years post IMA201 infusion.
