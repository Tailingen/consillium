Study of JK08 in Patients with Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, first-in-human, dose escalation and cohort expansion study evaluating multiple doses and schedules of subcutaneously administered JK08 in patients with unresectable locally, advanced or metastatic cancer.

This Phase 1/2, open label, dose escalation and cohort expansion study is designed to evaluate and characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of JK08 administered subcutaneously (SC) on a once weekly (QW) schedule in patients with unresectable locally, advanced or metastatic cancer.

The study consists of a Dose Escalation phase to determine the MTD/OBD of JK08, followed by a Cohort Expansion phase to further define the safety and initial efficacy of JK08 monotherapy or in combinations.
