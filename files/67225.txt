A Phase 1 Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of AGS-8M4 in Subjects With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
This is the first in human study of AGS-8M4 given every 2 weeks to subjects with advanced ovarian cancer. AGS-8M4 will be administered as an IV infusion until the disease worsens.

BIOLOGICAL: AGS-8M4
Incidence of adverse events, Throughout the treatment|Assessment of PK variables, Weeks 1-3, week 5, week 7 week 11, every 2 weeks during extension period, 2 and 3 months after last dose
Incidence of anti-AGS-8M4 antibody formation, Week 1, week 7, week 11, week 15 (extension only), 2 and 3 months after last dose|Changes in tumor status per RECIST, Week 9, and every 8 weeks during the extended treatment period|Changes in CA-125 levels, Week 9, and every 8 weeks during the extended treatment period
All Subjects will receive AGS-8M4 treatment. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of the 4 planned dose cohorts according to a standard dose escalation study design. A disease assessment will be performed at study week 9 (+/- 3 days). The assessment will be based on clinical signs and symptoms, changes in radiographic images, and changes in CA-125 levels. Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive AGS-8M4 during the extended treatment period at the dose and schedule of their assigned cohort until disease progression intolerability of AGS-8M4 or consent withdrawal. For subjects that continue dosing, disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended treatment period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last infusion of AGS-8M4.
