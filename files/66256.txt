A Trial of SHR3680 in Prostate Cancer Patients Who Are Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy
The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR3680 plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs. placebo plus ADT in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer using pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and metastasis-free survival (MFS).
Patients With High-risk Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Who Are Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy
DRUG: SHR3680|DRUG: Placebo
pCR rate (assessed by pathology BICR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with no residual tumor detected in prostatectomy specimens by H\&E staining and ancillary immunohistochemistry (if necessary) as assessed by pathology BICR., 36 months since the first subject will be enrolled.|MFS (assessed by imaging BICR)., Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first occurrence of BICR-confirmed radiographic distant metastasis, accidental pathologic finding of distant metastasis, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), regardless of whether the subject reveives any other anti-tumor therapy or has missing (or unevaluable) tumor assessments., 84 months since the first subject will be enrolled.
MFS (investigator-assessed)., Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first occurrence of investigator-assessed radiographic distant metastasis to the bone or soft tissue, accidental pathologic finding of distant metastasis, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), regardless of subsequent anti-tumor treatment or missing (or unevaluable) tumor assessments., 84 months since the first subject will be enrolled.|PSA response rate., Defined as the proportion of subjects with a ≥ 90% decrease in PSA levels from baseline on Day 1 of Cycle 4., 25 months since the first subject will be enrolled.|PSM rate., Defined as the proportion of subjects without tumor cells detected in the margin of prostatectomy pathological specimens following H\&E staining and ancillary immunohistochemistry (if necessary), as assessed by local pathologists., 31 months since the first subject will be enrolled.|Time to BCR., Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the time of BCR (i.e. two consecutive PSA rise ≥ 0.2 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy)., 42 months since the first subject will be enrolled.
