Gluteal Squeeze for Left Colon Distension
Good distension of the colon during colonoscopy is essential to detect polyps. Gas sometimes escapes the colon through the anus resulting in compromised distension. Pressure on gluteal muscles when the colonoscope tip is in the left colon might help preventing this and thus increase visibility. No previous study looked at this.
