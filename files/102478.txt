Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Radiotherapy for Treating Prostate Pelvic Nodes
The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical feasibility and efficacy of uing IMRT to escalate the biologically effective dose to the pelvic lymph nodes in a short course of radiation therapy. An increased total and biologically effective dose will be delivered to the pelvic lymph nodes (56 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction). The prostate will receive standard "short course" IMRT of radiation (70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction).
