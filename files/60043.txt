Phase I Open Label Trial to Assess Safety of BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) in Combination With Herceptin® in Patients With HER2-positive Advanced Breast Cancer.
Study to determine the Maximum Tolerated dose of BIBW 2992 given in combination with Herceptin®
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: BIBW 2992
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Number of participants with DLT in the first cycle (28 days) for the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Important Limitations and Caveats are provided in the respective section., 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Afatinib in Combination With Herceptin(R), The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experienced DLT. It was determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort design. To confirm the MTD, the MTD cohort was to be expanded to 18 patients with no more than 3/18 patients experiencing a DLT. Please refer to CAVEATs and Limitations., 28 days
Number of Patients With Objective Response (OR), Objective tumor response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd cycle until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.|Number of Patients With Best Overall Response, Best overall response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Best overall response is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or not evaluable., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd cycle until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from randomisation to disease progression or death whichever occurs first. Assessed by central independent review according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1). Median time results from unstratified Kaplan-Meier estimates., Baseline until disease progression, death or data cut-off.|Summary of Concentration of Afatinib in Plasma, Pre-dose Concentrations of Afatinib in Plasma at Steady State on Days 8, 15 and 29 (Cpre,ss,8, Cpre,ss,15 and Cpre,ss,29) and Maximum Concentration of Afatinib in Plasma at Steady State (Cmax,ss)., 0.05 hours (h) before dosing and 0.5-1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h after dosing|Time From Dosing to the Maximum Concentration of Afatinib in Plasma at Steady State (Tmax,ss), tmax,ss represents the time from dosing to the maximum concentration of afatinib in plasma at steady state, 0.05 hours (h) before dosing and 0.5-1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h after dosing|Summary of Concentration of Herceptin in Plasma, Pre-dose Concentrations of Herceptin in Plasma on Days 8, 15 and 29 (Cpre,8, Cpre,15 and Cpre,29) and Maximum Concentration of Herceptin in Plasma on Days 1, 15 and 29 (Cmax,1, Cmax,15 and Cmax,29)., 0.05 hours (h) before dosing and 0.5-1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h after dosing
