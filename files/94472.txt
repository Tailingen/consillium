Thermal Ablation Followed by Immunotherapy for HCC
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy toripalimab (anti-PD-1 mAb) combined with thermal ablation in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
PROCEDURE: Thermal ablation|DRUG: Toripalimab
Progression free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 3 years
Overall response rate, Treatment evaluation will be done using mRECIST, Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival, From random date to death for any reason., Up to approximately 3 years|Disease Control Rate, Defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease, Up to approximately 3 years|Number of participants with adverse events, Evaluation will be done using NCI-CTCAE (version 4.03)., Up to approximately 3 years|Tumour marker response, Percentage of AFP variation, Up to approximately 3 years|The time to deterioration of quality of life, Repetitive decreases of 10 points or more from the baseline of the EORTC QLQ-C30 for two consecutive assessments or a decrease of 10 points or more in a single assessment followed by death from any cause within three weeks., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of response, the time from first documented complete or partial response to disease progression or death) according to investigator-assessed and independently-assessed mRECIST criteria, Up to approximately 2 years|The general health status, The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) was applied to assess the general health status of the patients., Up to approximately3 years
1.1 Primary Objective \& Hypothesis Determine the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA)/microwave ablation (MWA) followed by toripalimab for advanced HCC by establishing the rates of toxicity that occur within 6 months after ablation. Hypothesis: Thermal ablation followed by toripalimab will have similar toxicity to toripalimab monotherapy. Thermal ablation enhances antitumor immune response and improves the best overall response rate compared to historical controls with toripalimab alone.

1.2 Secondary Objectives and Hypotheses Estimate the progression-free survival, and overall survival. Hypothesis: Disease control and survival will be better than that observed with toripalimab monotherapy.

1.3 Exploratory Objectives Explore changes in inflammatory biomarkers (including, but not limited to CD8+/Treg ratio, total CD4+ counts, total lymphocyte count) in pretreatment and on-treatment serially collected peripheral blood samples. Hypothesis: Changes in inflammatory biomarkers after thermal ablation may correlate with a more favorable response to immunotherapy.
