Study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 In Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The primary objective of this study was to compare the two alternate primary endpoints of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with progressive prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received 177Lu-PSMA-617 in addition to best supportive/best standard of care (BSC/BSoC) versus patients treated with best supportive/best standard of care alone.

DRUG: 177Lu-PSMA-617|OTHER: Best supportive/best standard of care
Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic disease progression based on the central review assessment per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or death due to any cause. Patients who were alive without radiographic progression at the analysis data cut-off were censored for rPFS at the time of their last evaluable radiographic assessment. Date of censoring for rPFS: 1) The censoring date was the date when the last evaluable radiographic assessment (CT/MRI/bone scan) determined a lack of progression; 2) If there were no evaluable assessments, censoring occurred at the date of randomization; 3) Patients who had 2 or more consecutive missed tumor assessments immediately prior to PD or death were censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to those missing tumor assessments., From date of randomization until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 32 months (Primary Analysis cut-off date = 27-Jan-2021)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, then OS was censored. The censoring date was date of the last study visit, or contact, until the cut-off date. The cut-off date was not used for last contact date, unless the patient was seen or contacted on that date.

Final OS was analyzed at the time of Primary analysis (Primary Analysis cut-off date = 27-Jan-2021) and an updated descriptive analysis of OS was re-run at the time of final analysis (Final Analysis cut-off date 14-Dec-2023)., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 32 months (Primary Analysis cut-off date = 27-Jan-2021) and up to 66 months (Final Analysis cut-off date = 14-Dec-2023)
Number of Participants With Randomized/Study Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), In the Main Study, "randomized treatment" refers to the investigational arm (AAA617+BSC/BSoC) and the control arm (BSC/BSoC).

EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions. A utility score was obtained by using a weighted combination of the levels of the five dimension-scales. The weights were based on value sets which were country-specific for the U.K. Utility scores ranges from the lowest possible score for a living patient of -0.594 (when all responses are '5') to 1 (when all responses are '1').If a patient died, he was assigned a score of 0 on the date of death., Baseline (BL), Cycle 2 to Cycle 13 (Week 1 Day 1), End of Treatment (EoT) (cycle duration for Cycle 1-6 = 6 weeks and for Cycle 7 and beyond = 12 weeks)|Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life (EuroQol) - 5 Domain 5 Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) EQ-VAS, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life.

The study for each participant consisted of a Screening period, a Treatment period and a Follow-up period.

Sub-study A dosimetry, PK and ECG sub-study was conducted in a non-randomized cohort (AAA617+BSC/BSoC) of 30 patients at sites in Germany to provide a more complete assessment of the safety aspects of AAA617. Aside from additional assessments to collect data for dosimetry, PK, urinary metabolites and ECG, patients in the sub-study were screened for eligibility, treated and followed up similarly to the AAA617+BSC/BSoC (investigational arm) patients in the main study.

Screening and randomization:

During the screening period of up to 28 days before starting randomized treatment, each participant was assessed for PSMA positivity by gallium (68Ga) gozetotide imaging PET/scan per the pre-defined read rules, by the Sponsor's central reader. Only patients with PSMA-positive metastatic PC and meeting all other inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus BSC/BSoC or BSC/BSoC only. Randomized patients were stratified on the following factors: LDH level (=\< or \> 260 UI/L), presence of liver metastases (Yes or No), eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) score (0-1 or 2) and inclusion of NAAD in the BSC/BSoC (at time of randomization (Yes or No)). Protocol- specified BSC/BSoC for each patient was initiated by the investigating physician prior to patient randomization and maintained throughout the study. On-study changes to BSC/BSoC were allowed and at the discretion of the investigating physician.

Randomized treatment:

"Randomized treatment" in this study refers to AAA617+BSC/BSoC (investigational arm) and BSC/BSoC only (control arm). For the sub-study, "study treatment" refers to AAA617+BSC/BSoC (also referred to as the investigational arm), as no randomization occurred in the sub-study. When discussing aspects of the study which are applicable to both the main and sub-study, the term 'randomized treatment' will be used throughout this document. The term 'study treatment' will be used only when specifically referring to the sub-study.

Patients randomized to the investigational arm began AAA617 dosing within 28 days of randomization. These patients received BSC/BSoC and 7.4 GBq (+/-10%) AAA617 once every 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles.

After the Cycle 4 treatment and prior to Cycle 5 treatment, the Investigator had to determine if:

* The patient showed evidence of response (i.e. radiological, PSA, clinical benefit)
* The patient had signs of residual disease on CT with contrast/MRI or bone scan
* The patient had shown good tolerance to the AAA617 treatment

If the patient met all of the criteria above and agreed to continue with additional treatment of AAA617 the investigator could administer a further 2 cycles. A maximum of 6 cycles of radioligand therapy was allowed. If the patient did not meet any of the criteria or did not agree to additional AAA617 treatment, then no additional doses of AAA617 were administered after Cycle 4. After the last cycle of AAA617, patients continued BSC/BSoC alone, as long as the investigator felt they were clinically benefiting or until they required a treatment regimen not allowed in this study. For both treatment arms, the cycle duration for Cycle 1-6 was 6 weeks and for Cycle 7 and beyond, 12 weeks. From Cycle 7 onwards, all patients from both treatment arms only received BSC/BSoC.

End of treatment:

An End of Treatment (EOT) visit was scheduled approximately 30 days after the last dose of AAA617 or the date of the BSC/BSoC end of treatment decision (whichever occurred later), but before the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment, outside of what was allowed on study. Once a patient discontinued the randomized treatment part of the study for any reason, an EOT visit was scheduled.

Long-term follow-up:

Patients on the active part of the study at the time of the final analysis of OS had an EOT visit at the next planned visit after implementation of V5.0/5.1 of the protocol and moved into long-term follow-up, unless they specifically withdrew consent from long-term follow-up of the study.

Patients who consented to be followed for long-term status updates, entered the long-term follow-up period after the EOT visit. The long-term follow-up period included the collection of rPFS (if the patient discontinued for reasons other than radiographic progression), OS, information about new treatments along with the patient's response to these treatments, AE assessment, and results of hematology and chemistry testing. During the follow-up, patients were contacted every 3 months (+/-1 month) via phone, email, or letter until a long-term follow-up study became available, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first.
