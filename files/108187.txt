Effect of an Oral Nutritional Supplement on Muscle Mass During Anticancer Treatment
Malnutrition and low muscle mass (sarcopenia) are common problems in patients with cancer. However, a low muscle mass is associated with negative clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. Therefore, it is very important to maintain muscle mass in this population. This study aims to investigate the effect of an oral nutritional supplement on skeletal muscle mass during anti-cancer treatment.
