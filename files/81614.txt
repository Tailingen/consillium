BP-C1 in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
This study is an open label, non-randomized phase I single-armed study in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have previously undergone all available standard chemotherapy regimens. The purpose of the study is to estimate the pharmacokinetics (PK) after single dose and multiple dose of BP-C1, investigate interleukin levels during BP-C1 treatment and assess treatment response according to RECIST criteria.

Change in number of target lesions from baseline to Day 32 of treatment will be presented in shift tables, baseline to Day 32 of treatment|Treatment response, In accordance with RECIST v1.1 the treatment response will be classified as 'complete response', 'partial response', 'stable disease' or 'progressive disease': Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum might also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions will also be considered progression. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study, baseline to Day 32 of treatment
BP-C1, solution for injections 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent.

Active substance of the product, which is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for intramuscular administration, is а cis-diammineplatinum(II) complexed with a polymer containing benzene polycarboxylic acids derived from lignin.

The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear and significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin), additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients:

* injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;
* can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;
* has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;
* demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin (in-vitro; in-vivo data);
* exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

In this study six female patients with MBC who have previously undergone at least third line therapy will be enrolled. Each included patient will participate in a screening period (maximum duration of 21 days) following by 32-day treatment period and 28-day follow-up period.

The patients will be treated with BP-C1(daily intramuscular injections) for 32 consecutive days. The study is undertaken to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and treatment effect of BP-C1.
