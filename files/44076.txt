Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients
This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients undergoing PET/computed tomography (CT). Diagnostic procedures, such as PET/MRI, may help doctors diagnose cancer or help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment

DEVICE: magnetic resonance imaging with positron emission tomography scanning
Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) on PET/CT Compared to PET/MRI, SUVs for various normal tissues such as liver, cardiac blood pool, and bone will be used. Selected lesions will be assessed as well. Maximum and mean SUVs will be measured for each imaging device. The SUVs and tumor/background ratios will be measured., After PET/MRI|Individual Quality Scores, Comprised of Various Qualities of the Image and Include Contrast, Brightness, Resolution, Etc., A Likert five point scale will be used. Quality scores will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test., After PET/MRI|Comparison of Quality Scores (PET/CT vs PET/MRI), Comprised of Various Qualities of the Image and Include Contrast, Brightness, Resolution, Etc., A Likert five point scale will be used. Quality scores will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test., After PET/MRI
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To acquire PET/MRI scans of 100 patients which will be compared with PET/CT scans of the same subjects. The PET/CT scans will be used to provide the gold standard for evaluating the image quality and quantitative performance of the PET/MRI scans. After comparison and evaluation of the imaging capabilities and performance of the sequential PET/MRI imaging system for these 100 subjects, a second cohort of hundred consecutive subjects may be necessary and again comparisons made to the current standard of PET imaging, PET/CT. This validation of the attenuation correction methods and quantitative accuracy of the PET/MRI device compared to PET/CT will be a continuous iterative process that will result in optimized performance of the PET/MRI and will be a key step in its becoming available to other clinical research projects both within the Seidman Cancer Center as well as in other institutions.

OUTLINE:

After undergoing standard PET/CT, patients undergo PET/MRI.
