Neoadjuvant Chemo-immunotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy and Immunotherapy in LACC
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy -immunotherapy followed by ICI maintenance was proved to improve the PFS by the Keynote-A18 in the LACC patients, and still more than 30% progressed. Neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in LACC resulted in higher pCR rate. This prospective single arm study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and consolidative immunotherapy in LACC patients.
