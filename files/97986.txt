A Phase I, Open Label, Non Randomized, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Clinical Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability of OPB(Otsuka Pharmaceutical Biwa)-111077 in Subjects With Advanced HCC(Hepatocellular Carcinoma)
This is a Phase I, open label, non randomized, multicenter study designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of OPB-111077 administered orally, once daily in subjects with advanced HCC.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: OPB-111077
Safety of OPB-111077, Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Within the first cycle [24 days]|To investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OPB-111077, â€¢ The highest dose that does not lead to discontinuation of dose escalation is defined as the MTD., Within the first cycle [24 days]
Pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of OPB-111077 and its metabolites., The following PK parameters (Cmax (maximum observed concentration), AUC(area uder the concentration time curve from zero), tmax (Time to maximum plasma concentration), etc.) will be determined using a non-compartmental methods., Within the first cycle [24 days]|Tumor response measured by RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor) 1.1, Assessment will be conducted at Screening, end of Cycle 1, end of Cycle 2, end of every 2 cycles thereafter, at the Early Termination (discontinuation) Visit., Approximately 3-18 weeks depending on tumor response|Biomarker of OPB-111077, Change from baseline on predictable biomarker specified in the protocol, Within the first cycle [24 days]
This is a Phase I, open label, non randomized, multicenter study designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of OPB-111077 administered orally, once daily in subjects with advanced HCC.
