A Study of Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (VRd) Followed by BCMA CAR-T Therapy in Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia
This is a single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VRD-based regimen combined with BCMA CAR-T in transplant-ineligible patients with primary plasma cell leukemia
Plasma Cell Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: anti-BCMA CAR-T|DRUG: VRD-based regimen
Safety and Tolerability, The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 2 year|MRD-negative rate, achieving MRD-negative, as determined by NGS/NGF after consolidation treatment, within 1 week after consolidation treatment
Complete response rate (CRR), CR or better is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a CR response or Stringent Complete Response (sCR) response accoording to the IMWG criteria, within 1 week after induction therapy, 1 month after the CAR-T cell transfusion, within 1 week after consolidation therapy|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of first documented PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of the participant's death., Up to 5 year|Duration of Remission(DOR), Duration from the first evaluation of at least partial remission (PR) to the onset of disease progression or death due to disease progression (whichever occurs first), Up to 2 year
The duration of CART cell in vivo, The copies of BCMA-CART DNA in peripheral blood with qPCR method, Up to 1 year|Change from Baseline in Physical status assessed by International Myeloma Working Group Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (IMWG-CGA) scores, The IMWG-CGA was calculated by combining age, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL (IADL), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), which ranges from 0 to 5 with higher scores indicating worse physical condition and greater weakness., Baseline up to 5 years|Change from Baseline in Physical status assessed by activities of daily living (ADL) scores, The ADL includes 4 items (transfer, bed mobility, toileting, and eating), which range from 0 to 6 scores. A higher score represents worse physical condition and greater weakness., Baseline up to 5 years|Change from Baseline in Physical status assessed by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scores, The IADL includes 5 items (cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, and managing finances), which range from 0 to 8 scores. A higher score represents worse physical condition and greater weakness., Baseline up to 5 years|Change from Baseline in Physical status assessed by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), The CCI estimates the number and the severity of comorbidities, including nineteen diseases with a score varying from 1 to 6 for each of them in accordance to their severity. The score can range from 0 to 37. A higher score represents more severe comorbidities., Baseline up to 5 years
The study is a prospective, single-arm, single-centre, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with VRD-based regimen combined with BCMA CAR-T in transplant-ineligible patients with primary plasma cell leukemia. Patients received 3 courses of induction therapy with VRD-based regimen followed by infusion of BCMA CAR-T cells. Patients then received 3 courses of VR consolidation therapy, followed by VR maintenance therapy.
