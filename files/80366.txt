Velcade, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone and Panobinostat Treatment and Panobinostat Maintenance in Multiple Myeloma
Velcade (bortezomib), thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTD) has been demonstrated to be a highly effective combination in both patients with previously untreated and those with relapsed multiple myeloma. In previously untreated patients VTD demonstrated clear superiority to TD as induction therapy prior to planned tandem autologous stem cell transplant.

The rationale of this trial is to combine a 'gold standard' antiMM combination with the HDAC inhibitor Panobinostat. There is emerging data to support the concept of clinical synergy between BTZ and HDACi's.

The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and estimated response rates of panobinostat, administered in combination with VTD, in subjects with relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Thalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Panobinostat
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), The number of participants experiencing DLTs within the first cycle of VTD-pano will be presented, with descriptive summaries of the specific DLTs observed. Summaries will be presented for each dose level., From cycle 1 day 1 up to the administration of cycle 2 day 1 (up to 22 days)|Proportion o f participants achieving at least partial response, The proportion of participants achieving at least a partial response within 16 cycles of VTD-pano will be presented, with corresponding 80% and 95% confidence intervals, within 16 cycles of therapy (an expected average of 48 weeks)
Safety and toxicity, The proportion of participants experiencing DLTs and other toxicities, overall and by cycle as graded by CTCAE V4.0., Throughout the trial, expected to be 3 years|Proportion of patients with each maximum response category, The number and proportion of participants in each response category within 16 cycles of VTD-pano will be presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals., within 16 cycles of therapy (an expected average of 48 weeks)|Time to maximum response to therapy, Time to maximum response is defined as the time from registration until the patient achieves any of the categories CR, VGPR, PR, MR or SD as their maximum response. Median time to maximum response will be presented., from registration until the participant achieves any of the categories CR, VGPR, PR, MR or SD as their maximum response (up to 100 weeks - 48 weeks of treatment plus 52 weeks maintenance)|Progression free survival, A progression-free survival curve will be calculated using the Kaplan Meier method and median PFS estimates will be presented., from registration to first documented evidence of disease progression or death (up to 100 weeks)|Compliance to therapy, Compliance to therapy will be summarised descriptively, including number of doses missed and number of dose reductions throughout the treatment period., from initial treatment received as per protocol until treatment withdrawal (up to 100 weeks)|Feasibility of panobinostat maintenance, The duration of maintenance and reasons for stopping will be summarised, up to 12 months|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) curves will be calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. Median OS, and OS estimates at 12 months, will be presented, if appropriate., from registration to date of death|The proportion of participants mobilising sufficient stem cells for transplant(out of those undergoing mobilisation), To be determined by the satisfactory collection of sufficient numbers of stem cells to support high-dose chemotherapy., up to 16 cycles of therapy (an expected average of 48 weeks)
