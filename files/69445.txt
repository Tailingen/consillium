A Study on the Pathogenesis and Determinants of Intravenous Leiomyomatosis
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the impact of HPV infection in women with intravenous leiomyomatosis(IVL). The main question it aims to answer is:

Does HPV infection promote the development of IVL from uterine leiomyoma? Surgical sections and HPV-DNA test results will be collected in participants diagnosed with IVL or uterine leiomyoma.

Previous proteomic studies have demonstrated that HPV infection-related proteins are more highly expressed in intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) compared to uterine leiomyoma (uML). Consequently, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between HPV and the development of IVL. We recruited adult patients diagnosed with either IVL or uML, collected their medical histories, surgical specimens from various sites, and HPV-DNA test results from cervical exfoliated cells, and performed subsequent statistical analyses and mechanistic investigations.
