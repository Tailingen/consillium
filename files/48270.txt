Study of Vorinostat (MK0683), an Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitor in Combination With Bortezomib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MK-0683-095)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after at least 2 prior treatment regimens. The primary objective is to define the objective response rate (RR) associated with the administration of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib to patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after at least 2 prior treatment regimens. The primary hypothesis of the study is the administration of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib will result in a clinically meaningful rate of objective response.

Objective Response Rate (RR), Objective RR was defined as percentage (%) of participants with complete response (CR: disappearance of original monoclonal (M) paraprotein from blood \& urine on at least 2 determinations for at least 6 weeks (WKs) by immunofixation studies, \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow on at least 1 determination, no increase in size/number of lytic bone lesions (LBLs) \& disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas (STP) for at least 6 WKs on skeletal survey (SS) if available) or partial response (PR: ≥50% reduction in serum M protein for at least 2 determinations 6 WKs apart, if present, reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion by ≥90% or ≤200 mg for at least 2 determinations 6 WKs apart, ≥50% reduction in STP size for at least 6 WKs, \& no increase in size/number of LBLs on SS if available) as assessed by Independent Adjudication Committee (IAC) per European Blood \& Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria.

To report the median TTP (in months) and associated 95% CIs Kaplan-Meier method was used., Up to approximately 30 months (through Final Analysis data cut-off of 16-May-2011)|TTP as Assessed by Investigator Per EBMT Criteria, TTP was defined as the time from allocation to the first documented PD as assessed by investigator per EBMT criteria or death due to myeloma, whichever occurred first. PD: \>25% increase in level of serum Mparaprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 5g/L (500 mg/dL) and confirmed on a repeat investigation or 25% increase in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 200mg/24hour and confirmed on a repeat investigation or \>25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine biopsy, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 10% or definitive increase in size of existing LBLs or STP or development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L not attributable to any other cause). To report the median TTP (in months) and associated 95% CIs Kaplan-Meier method was used., Up to approximately 30 months (through Final Analysis data cut-off of 16-May-2011)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by IAC Per EBMT Criteria, PFS was defined as the time from allocation to the first documents PD as determined by IAC per EBMT criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD: \>25% increase in level of serum M-paraprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 5g/L (500 mg/dL) and confirmed on a repeat investigation or 25% increase in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 200mg/24hour and confirmed on a repeat investigation or \>25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine biopsy, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 10% or definitive increase in size of existing LBLs or STP or development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L not attributable to any other cause). To report the median PFS (in months) and associated 95%CIs Kaplan-Meier method was used., Up to approximately 30 months (through Final Analysis data cut-off of 16-May-2011)|PFS as Assessed by Investigator Per EBMT Criteria, PFS was defined as the time from allocation to the first documents PD as assessed by investigator per EBMT criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

To report the median survival (in months) and the associated 95%CIs were reported using Kaplan-Meier method was used. Participants without documented death at the time of final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow up., Up to approximately 40 months (through End of Trial data cut-off of 09-Apr-2012)
The protocol has been amended to indicate that the Final Analysis is designated as the time when the primary endpoint of 29 responders has been met, or the time when all participants have discontinued treatment or have been enrolled in the study for at least 6 months (if the primary endpoint is not reached by this time). Following the Final Analysis, participants will be allowed to continue study treatment in an extension as long as they have not met the criteria for discontinuation, and will be followed for overall survival and serious AEs.
