Computer-aided Detection of Colorectal Polyps
In this observational pilot study, we assess the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence sytem for automated detection of colorectal polyps.
Adenoma Colon|Polyp of Colon
DEVICE: Artificial Intelligence System for Detection of colorectal polyps
Feasibility to use the AI System in vivo during colonoscopy, As a Primary outcome, whether the AI System is capable of detecting colorectal polyps in vivo during colonoscopy, 4 month
Diagnostic Performance of the AI System for detecting colorectal polyps, As a secondary outcome, we assess the diagnostic Performance of the AI System for detecing colorectal Polyp in real time, 4 month
During standard colonoscopy, a substantial number of colorectal polyps can be missend. As shown in a recent meta-analysis, miss rates for adenomas can reach up to 26%. In this study, it is tested whether an artificial intelligence system that highlights colorectal polyps during screening or surveillance colonoscopy in real time can lead to an increased detection of colorectal polyps during the examination.
