Trastuzumab-pkrb Combined With Modified FOLFOX-6 in Biliary Tract Cancer Patients Progressed on First Line Therapy
Trastuzumab is approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer. The recent study showed that HER2 overexpression or amplification is noted about 5-15% of total biliary tract cancer patients and have shown efficacy in small basket trials. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in the combination of mFOLFOX for gemcitabine+cisplatin refractory biliary tract cancer patients.
HER2 Positive Advanced/Metastatic/Nonresectable Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: HERZUMA+mFOLFOX
Objective response rate (ORR), rate of patients with complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) based on RESIST1.1., up to 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time interval from cycle 1 day 1 to tumor progression/death/last follow-up, up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is rate of patients with CR, PR, or SD per RECIST 1.1., up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time interval from cycle 1 day 1 to tumor death/last follow-up., up to 2 years|Incidence of treatment related adverse events (TRAE), Incidence of treatment related adverse events (TRAE) will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v5.0 and tabulated and reported., up to 2 years
This phase II study is designed to see whether trastuzumab-pkrb+FOLFOX is active as 2nd or 3rd line treatment for HER2-positive biliary tract cancer patients.
