Acellular Dermal Matrix in Breast Reconstruction
Allogenic acellular dermal matrix has been used in burn injuries or abdominal walls reconstructions. However, it is solely used in breast reconstructions after breast carcinoma amputation. The efficacy of such allogenic dermal matrix can be advantageous when compared to current treatment options, however, this has to be proved.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Acellular dermal matrix implantation
Number of complications in patients receiving acellular dermal matrix evaluated at 6 months after primary implantation, All patients between January 2010 and June 2014 undergoing primary ADM implantation will be evaluated at 6 months after implantation for early ex-plantations, inflammation, deformities of the implants, allergic reactions will be observed in patients undergoing primary ADM implantation at 6 months until second permanent implantation is performed., 6 months
Histologic evaluation of ADM implants upon planned explantations, All patients between January 2012 and June 2014 after primary ADM transplantation will be evaluated. Analysis of cell composition, leukocytes at place, vessel formation and dysplasias will be performed, 6 months|Satisfaction with breast reconstruction outcome evaluated by Breast-Q questionnaire, Physical and psychical as well as sexual well-being with outcome will be evaluated by specifically for this purpose developed questionnaire (The Breast-Q questionnaire) after permanent breast implant implantation at 2 years, 2 years
This is a prospective study, where patients undergoing breast reconstruction surgery using acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with expander use in first phase of reconstruction will be included. The permanent breast implants will be implanted approximately half year during second surgery. Acellular dermal matrix is a soft tissue graft that is formed by decellularization, however with intact extracellular dermal matrix. Such structure is able to re-create adequate skeleton for host cells with subsequent incorporation and revascularization. The safety and appropriateness of such ADM in breast reconstruction surgery will be analyzed.
