Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) in Seborrheic Keratosis Optimization Study
Primary study objective is to evaluate the optimization of Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) energy settings for lesion clearance of Seborrheic Keratosis (SKs) from off-facial areas of healthy adults.
Lesion Skin|Seborrheic Keratosis|Skin Lesion|Benign Skin Tumor
DEVICE: Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS)
Clearance Rate of SK Lesions, Degree of Clearance of SK lesion treated with NPS as rated by investigators., 90 days post-last treatment
* Evaluate lesion clearance rate of SKs in off-face locations post-treatment versus baseline using multiple sized treatment tips with microneedles.
* Evaluate the clearance of the treated SKs using multiple energy settings at various time points initial procedure, compared baseline.
* Evaluate skin effects and adverse event rate.
