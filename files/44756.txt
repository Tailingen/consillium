A Study of hSTC810 With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors (STCUBE-001)
The Purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of hSTC810 monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: hSTC810
Incidence of DLTs, Number and percentages of subjects with DLTs, 4 weeks|Incidence of AEs, SAEs, and abnormalities in Lab, Number and percentages of subjects with Adverse Event, serious AEs, and abnormalities in lab parameters, from signing ICF to 90 days after last dose
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration of hSTC810 to evaluate the PK parameters, Up to 2 years|Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), Minimum blood plasma concentration of hSTC810 to evaluate the PK parameters, Up to 2 years|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), Time to reach Cmax of hSTC810 to evaluate the PK parameters., Up to 2 years|Area under the plasma concentration - time curve (AUC0-t), AUC up to the last measurable concentration of hSTC810 to evaluate the PK parameters, Up to 2 years|Incidence of ADA, Number and percentages of subjects with positive ADAs, Up to 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with confirmed CR and confirmed PR determined by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Up to 2 years|Best overall response (BOR), the best response designation as determined by RECIST and iRECIST. The BOR will be categorized as a CR, PR, SD, or PD, Up to 2 years|Clinical Benefit rate (CBR), Percentage of Participants With confirmed CR, confirmed PR or SD with a duration of at least 6 months determined by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), Time from initial response of confirmed CR or PR to disease progression or death determined by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Up to 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), The period from the first dose to the documented disease progression or death determined by RECIST v1.1 or iRECIST, Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), The period from first dose to the day of death from any cause., Up to 2 years
The study consists of a dose-escalation phase that will evaluate 6 dosing schedules of hSTC810. The first cohort will be single participant cohort. Subsequent escalation cohorts will use a standard 3+3 design, with the ability to backfill up to an additional 6 patients in each dose cohort.
