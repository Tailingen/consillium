Dietary Practices and Locally Advanced Lung Cancer (LUNGDIET)
In recent years, fasting or the use of special diets (ketogenic, high protein, etc.), whether or not associated with food supplements, have increased substantially, particularly in oncology with the idea of improving for some of them, the tolerance of the proposed treatments, in particular emetogenic chemotherapy, or even to improve the prognosis. Although there are preclinical data on cell cultures and in rats, the clinical data supporting these practices are very fragmented, with few trials carried out and only including small cohorts, mainly in the context of breast cancers. It is therefore very difficult to respond objectively to patients asking the question of the merits of these changes in dietary practices in the management of their cancer.

The investigators want to carry out an inventory of the dietary practices of participating patients and their potential interest in fasting or special diets by means of a self-administered survey completed by the patient at diagnosis before treatment. This semi-quantitative self-administered survey (answers in never / sometimes / regularly / systematically) was developed by the nutrition and radiotherapy team of the Georges-Pompidou European Hospital because there was no validated medical questionnaire on fasting or the use of special diets in oncology
