Ovarian Aging in Low Grade Glioma (LGG) Treated With Temozolomide
The purpose of this study is to look at how a chemotherapy treatment (Temozolomide, also called Temodar) affects the process of ovarian aging which is measured by a decline in ovarian follicle count, in patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG). It is important to know if different patient factors and Temozolomide influence the rate of ovarian aging in women with LGG who have good long-term survival rates. This will allow better counseling about the effects of this particular chemotherapy agent on fertility in women.
Low Grade Glioma
Ovarian Aging (AFC and Hormones), Transvaginal Ultrasound will be use to measure Antral Follicle Counts (AFC) and blood will be drawn to measure hormones (FSH, LH, estradiol, estrone, AMH, SHBG, testosterone, and inhibin B)., Every 3 months for 1 year
Understanding how Temozolomide influences ovarian aging would be important information for physicians to predict the possibility of infertility (the inability to become pregnant) following recovery from Temozolomide treatment. Physicians would like to provide better individualized recommendations for cancer patients regarding timing of planned treatment and future pregnancy.

We will do this by comparing data from the women being treated for Low Grade Glioma with Temozolomide to a similar group of women who have been unaffected by cancer or cancer treatment.
