This is a two-phase, open-label Phase Ib clinical trial. The first phase plans to enroll 6-12 patients as two cohorts to explore the safety and of TQB3823 tablets combined with abiraterone and prednisone and the recommended dose of phase II of TQB3823. Subjects involved in cohort one accepts TQB3823 treatment during cycle one and then TQB3823 combined with abiraterone and prednisone from cycle two till the disease progression. The second phase plans to enroll a total of 40-60 subjects, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TQB3823 tablets combined with abiraterone and prednisone.
