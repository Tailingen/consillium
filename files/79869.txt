Carmustine in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: carmustine in ethanol|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) in patients with unresectable recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)
* Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Assess the activity of this regimen in these patients.
* Estimate peripheral blood carmustine levels in these patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

Patients receive carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) intratumorally over 5 minutes during stereotactic biopsy or open craniotomy.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTI-015 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)

Additional patients then receive treatment with DTI-015 at the recommended phase II dose.

Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then every 1-3 months until disease progression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients were accrued for phase I of this study and approximately 14-18 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)
