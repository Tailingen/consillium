Open-Label, Multicenter, Two-Part, Phase 1 Study to Characterize Effects of a Moderate CYP3A Inhibitor on PK of Tazemetostat, Effects of Tazemetostat on PK of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 Substrates, and Effect of Increased Gastric pH on PK of Tazemetostat in B-cell Lymphoma or Advanced Solid Tumor Patients
This is a Phase 1, open-label, two-part, safety, PK, and activity study designed to characterize the DDI potential of tazemetostat. Tazemetostat will be taken orally BID continuously in 28-day cycles in both study parts.
