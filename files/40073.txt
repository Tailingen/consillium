Oncolytic Virus (OVV-01) Injection in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Phase Ia: To investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of OVV-01 injection in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors (OVV-01 single dose gradient exploration).

Phase Ib: To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of OVV-01 injection combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) or atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors (OVV-01 combined with PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody dose gradient exploration);

Phase Ic: A cohort expansion of Phase Ib to further analyze the efficacy and safety of OVV-01 injection combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor injection in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.

Phase Ia:

This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study plans to enroll in 1 \~ 3 study sites nationwide about 9 \~ 18 patients with advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to conduct a phase Ia study, i.e., the First in Human (FIH) trial of OVV-01 injection, using the traditional "3 + 3" approach for dose gradient exploration.

Phase Ib:

This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study plans to enroll in 1 \~ 3 study sites nationwide about 12 \~ 24 patients with advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to conduct a phase Ib study, using the traditional "3 + 3" approach and based on the phase Ia results, 2 dose gradients of OVV-01 are used in combination with pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, respectively, to explore the efficacy and safety.

Phase Ic:

This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study plans to enroll in 1 \~ 3 study sites nationwide about 15 \~ 20 patients with advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to conduct a phase Ic study.
