Endothelial Function, Arterial Stiffness and Components
Specific Aim: Compare the endothelial function, arterial stiffness and components of metabolic syndrome of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) survivors to healthy sibling controls. Plan: A cross sectional study comparing ALL survivors to sibling controls including measures of endothelial function and arterial stiffness obtained form a peripheral artery tonometry device, height, weight, waist circumference, fasting lipid, glucose and insulin.
