Safety of LEO 43204 for Actinic Keratosis Applied on Face/Chest, Scalp and Trunk/Extremities, Respectively
The objective of the trial is to investigate the Safety of LEO 43204 0.018%, 0.037% and 0.1% for actinic keratosis applied once daily for three consecutive days on face/chest, scalp and trunk/extremities, respectively.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: LEO 43204
Number of Participants Experiencing DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicities) Based on LSRs (Local Skin Reactions), For face/chest, a DLT was defined as one or more of the following three LSRs:

* Crusting Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 4
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 4

Or two or more of the following five LSRs:

* Erythema Grade 4
* Crusting Grade 3
* Swelling Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 3
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 3

For scalp a DLT was defined as erosion/ulceration Grade 4

For trunk/extremities a DLT was defined as one or more of the following three LSRs:

* Crusting Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 4
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 4

Or two or more of the following four LSRs:

* Crusting Grade 3
* Swelling Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 3
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 3, 8 days / From baseline (Day 1) to Day 8
Percent Reduction in AK Count Excluding Lesions Identified at Baseline as Hypertrophic/Hyperkeratotic, The number of clinically visible actinic keratosis lesions (AKs) identified in the treatment area was recorded at baseline (Day 1), Week 4, and Week 8. This analysis excluded lesions identified at baseline as hypertrophic/hyperkeratotic., 4 weeks and 8 weeks / From baseline to Week 4, and Week 8|Percent Reduction in AK Count of Lesions Identified at Baseline as Hypertrophic/Hyperkeratotic, Hypertrophic/Hyperkeratotic lesions were identified at baseline (Day 1), Week 4 and Week 8., 4 weeks and 8 weeks / From baseline to Week 4, and Week 8|Percentage of Participants With Complete Clearance of AKs, Complete clearance was defined as no clinically visible AKs. This analysis excluded lesions identified at baseline as hypertrophic/hyperkeratotic., 8 weeks
