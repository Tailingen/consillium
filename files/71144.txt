Safety And Efficacy Study Of Sunitinib Malate As First-Line Systemic Therapy In Chinese Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
To investigate safety and efficacy of single agent sunitinib malate as first-line systemic therapy in Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Sunitinib Malate (SU011248)
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time in weeks from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease \[PD\]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was "Death")., Baseline, Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4 and even cycles thereafter until disease progression or every 2 months until death (up to 88 weeks)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), Percentage of participants with OR based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed response were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non target). PR were those with at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions, with non target lesions not increased or absent., Baseline, Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4 and even cycles thereafter until disease progression or every 2 months until death (up to 88 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS), Time in weeks from the start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (the death date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 7. Death was determined from adverse event data (where outcome was death) or from follow-up contact data (where the participant current status was death)., Baseline, Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4 and even cycles thereafter until disease progression or every 2 months until death (up to 88 weeks)|One Year Survival Probability, One year survival probability was defined as the probability of survival at one year after the first dose of study treatment., Baseline, Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4 and even cycles thereafter, every 2 months until death (up to 1 year)
