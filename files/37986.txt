A Study With BIBF 1120 in Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of BIBF 1120 (250 mg twice daily versus 150 mg twice daily) in an exploratory manner. Safety, quality of life and pharmacokinetic parameters on a sub-sample of 20 patients were also analysed for the two different doses.
