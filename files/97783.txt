Treatment Patterns and Key Healthcare Resource Use in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) With or Without FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase-3 (FLT3) Mutation Study Based on Retrospective Chart Review
The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the treatment patterns and AML-related key healthcare resource use among AML patients, stratified by FLT3 mutation status, intensive chemotherapy (IC) eligibility, and relapsed or refractory (R/R) status.

The current study is a retrospective non-interventional study using real-world data collected from existing medical records to evaluate descriptively the treatment patterns and key healthcare resource use among AML patients with or without FLT3 mutation. The current study relies on secondary use of existing data, and there is no intervention involved. Patients who received the first AML treatment after the initial diagnosis, or were classified as relapsed/refractory (R/R), between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015 will be randomly selected to be included in this study, and the data from their existing medical records will be extracted. Eligible patients will be grouped based on FLT3 mutation status, intensive chemotherapy (IC) eligibility, and R/R status.

For newly diagnosed patients, the index date will be defined as the initiation date of the first AML treatment following initial diagnosis. For the R/R patients, the index date will be defined as the date of the patient being classified as R/R. The study period will be the period from the index date to last follow-up date or death, whichever comes earlier. The endpoint measurements of this study are treatment patterns and key AML-related healthcare resources used during the study period.
