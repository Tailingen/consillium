Gut Microbiome in Colorectal Cancer
This is a pilot feasibility study designed to investigate the alterations in the gut microbiome that occur during the course of treatment for colorectal cancer
Gastrointestinal Microbiome|Neoplasm, Colorectal
Recruitment rate rate (percentage of patients approached that consent to participate), Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed by evaluating percentage of patients approached that consent to participate, Up to 2 years|Reasons for nonparticipation/non-continuation of the study and adherence of submission of stool specimens, Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed by evaluating reasons for nonparticipation/non-continuation of the study and adherence of submission of stool specimens, Up to 2 years|Dietary Assessment Questionnaires, Baseline questionnaires regarding bowel habits and dietary history. Patients will complete a 3-day diet record (Automated SelfAdministered 24-Hour (ASA24Â®) Dietary Assessment Tool or on paper) at the beginning of each treatment cycle when stool is collected. For mid-cycle or toxicity-related stool collections, patients will complete a 24-hour diet recall using the ASA24 system, Baseline, Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, at discontinuation of treatment (an average of 6 months)|Acceptability of specimens for analysis, Specimens collected via Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) card method will be verified as evaluable defined as patients with two analyzable stool samples including a baseline sample and at least one on-treatment sample to be used in endpoint analysis., Up to 6 months
Change in gut microbiome diversity, Changes in the gut microbiome will be assessed by comparing the bacterial diversity present in the baseline pre-treatment stool sample to the designated initial treatment cycle midpoint for each of the three patient cohorts, Up to 2 years|Change in relative abundance of following gut bacteria that occur with oral fluoropyrimidine therapy, Changes in relative and absolute abundance of specific bacteria from the Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas genus, and the species Bacteroides fragilis will be assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and genus-specific primers, Up to 2 years
This is a pilot feasibility study designed to investigate the alterations in the gut microbiome that occur during the course of treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). Three patient cohorts will be followed. Cohort A: patients treated with oral fluoropyrimidine CAP as part of standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Cohort B: patients treated with TAS-102 including those receiving it in combination with Y-90 radioembolization as part of a clinical trial. Cohort C: patients receiving CAP plus immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and bevacizumab as part of a clinical trial. Investigators will replace participants as needed to ensure a minimum of 10 evaluable participants per cohort (or minimum total of 30 evaluable patients). Evaluable participants are defined as patients with two analyzable stool samples including a baseline sample and at least one on-treatment sample to be used in endpoint analysis
