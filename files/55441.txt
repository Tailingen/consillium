Dose-Finding, Safety and Efficacy Study of RX-0201 Plus Everolimus in Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of RX-0201, up to a target dose of 250 mg/m\^2/day, when given in combination with everolimus (Stage 1), and to assess the safety and efficacy of RX-0201 plus everolimus, in subjects with metastatic renal cell cancer (Stage 2).
Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer
DRUG: RX-0201
Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) (Stage 1), Incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities defined as dose-limiting toxicities, after 1 cycle (3 weeks) of treatment with RX-0201 and everolimus|Progression Free Survival (Stage 2), Median PFS. Progression determined by RECIST v1.1, 4 months of treatment with RX-0201 and everolimus
Steady State Concentration (Css) of RX-0201 (Stage 1), Css of RX-0201 at the beginning and end of the 14 day continuous infusion, predose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours after start of Cycle 1 RX-0201 infusion, and then immediately prior to the end of Cycle 1 infusion (Day 15), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours after infusion is stopped|Incidence of Adverse Events, Changes in Clinical Laboratory Tests and Vital Signs Over Time (Stage 1 and Stage 2), safety of RX-0201 was evaluated through reporting using the grading system in the CTCAE version 4.03 for adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. All statistical methods for safety were descriptive in nature., up to 24 weeks of treatment with RX-0201 plus everolimus and at least 30 days of safety follow up|Best Overall Response as Determined by RECIST v1.1., Best overall response as determined by RECIST v1.1. Not Evaluable included the subjects who had completed at least one treatment cycle but no overall response evaluation. Not Done included the subjects who dropped out from the study without completing any treatment cycle and overall response evaluation. The best overall response for each subject from all post-baseline time point overall responses was used. The best overall response was the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence, or occurrence of intolerable toxicity, whatever came first., Baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24
Biomarker Concentrations in Blood, Exploratory analysis of AKT pathway biomarkers, tumor apoptosis biomarkers and other biomarkers in blood or tumor samples, Baseline and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24|RX-0201 Concentration in the Blood (Stage 2 Only), Exploratory analysis of plasma concentrations of RX-0201 at the end of infusion, After 2 weeks of treatment
This multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group study of RX-0201 in combination with everolimus, versus everolimus alone to treat subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma will be conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 will be an open-label, dose-escalation study of RX-0201 to identify a safe and tolerable dose of RX-0201 up to a target dose of 250 mg/m\^2/day when given in combination with everolimus. Stage 2 will be a randomized, open-label, 2-arm study of RX-0201 in combination with everolimus versus everolimus alone. Subjects will receive RX-0201, at the dose identified in Stage 1, in combination with everolimus or everolimus alone, for up to 8 cycles to determine safety and efficacy of the combination.
