Breast Cancer|Recurrent Breast Cancer|Breast Carcinoma
DEVICE: Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters Therapy (DaRT)
Feasibility -DaRT seed placement, Feasibility will be determined according to the Rate of successful placement of DaRT seeds via imaging, immediately following the insertion procedure|Safety- Adverse events, Safety will be determined according to the overall incidence of device related SAE'sgraded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, From Day 0
Efficacy - Control evaluation, To evaluate efficacy, as determined by local control evaluation according to RECIST v1.1, 3,6,12 and 24 months
This is a Prospective Open label Single arm multi-center interventional study. The study is designed to evaluate the Feasibility and Safety of DaRT seeds for the treatment of newly diagnosed or Recurrent Breast Carcinoma in frail or elderly patients.

The study will be comprised of a screening period, DaRT insertion visit, acute follow-up phase of 4- 8 weeks and a long-term follow up phase of 24 months. The total duration of the study will be 24 months from the DaRT insertion procedure.

A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled from all breast cancer subtypes (HR+/HER-2-, HR+/HER-2+, HR-/HER-2-, and HR-/HER-2-.). No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.

Eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (as assessed during the screening period) will be invited to the site for the procedure of DaRT seeds insertion. The patients will be monitored for a period of 24 months post insertion
