Phase III, double-blind, randomised study assessing the efficacy of capivasertib + fulvestrant vs placebo + fulvestrant for the treatment of patients with locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer following recurrence or progression on or after AI therapy.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup, Progression-Free Survival by investigator assessment (in accordance with RECIST 1.1), The time from date of randomisation to the date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier, up to approximately 51 months
Overall Survival (OS) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup., Overall Survival (OS) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup, The time from date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause up to 51 months|Investigator assessment of PFS2 in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup., PFS2 - time from randomisation to second progression by investigator assessment, The time from the date of randomisation to the date of progression subsequent to the first subsequent therapy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier, up to approximately 51 months|Response Rate (ORR) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup., percentage of patients with at least one investigator-assessed visit response of complete or partial response (as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1), Up to Approximately 51 months|Duration of Response (DoR) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup., time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression (as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1) or death in the absence of disease progression, Up to Approximately 51 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup., number of patients with complete or partial response or with stable disease maintained â‰¥24 weeks after randomisation (as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1), Up to Approximately 51 months|ocurrence/frequency of AEs and its relationship to study drugs (safety and tolerability) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup, AEs graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI CTCAE), Up to Approximately 51 months|plasma concentration of capivasertib, plasma concentration of capivasertib pre-dose and post-dose (C1h and C4h) in the overall population, Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), plasma concentration 1 hour post-dose (C1h) and 4 hours post-dose (C4h) during cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|EORTC QLQ BR23(European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire breast cancer specific module) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup where applicable, The self-administered instrument includes 23-items and yields 5 multi-item scores (body image, sexual functioning, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, and systemic therapy side effects). Items are scored on a 4-point verbal rating scale: "Not at All," "A Little," "Quite a Bit," and "Very Much". Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores indicate better unctioning, better HRQoL, or greater level of symptom, Up to Approximately 51 months|The EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items) in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup where applicable, 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), and global health status/QoL scale, along with 5 individual item symptom scores (appetite loss, dyspnoea, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhoea. The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual (Fayers et al. 2001). Higher scores on the global measure of health status and functional scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/scores represent greater symptom severity, Up to Approximately 51 months|Time to definitive deterioration of the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered subgroup where applicable, Time from randomisation to the earlier of the date of the first definitive deterioration or death due to any cause. Deterioration is defined as a 1-point decrease in ECOG score from baseline, and the deterioration is considered definitive if no improvements in the ECOG performance status are observed at a subsequent time of measurement during the treatment period, or at no further assessments following the time point where the deterioration is observed, Up to approximately 51 months
