Heuristics, Algorithms and Machine Learning: Evaluation & Testing in Radiation Therapy
The Hamlet.rt study is a prospective data collection and patient questionnaire study for patients undergoing image-guided radiotherapy with curative intent.

The aim of the study is to use novel machine learning and mathematical techniques to build a model that can predict the risk of significant side effects from radiotherapy treatment for an individual patient: using calculations of normal tissue dose from radiotherapy treatment planning and patient baseline characteristics derived from image and non-image data, continuously updated as the patient is reviewed both during and after treatment.

A secondary goal of the project is to facilitate research in machine learning and medical image processing for radiation therapy through the creation of a discoverable and shared data resource for research use.
