Study of INBRX-105 and INBRX-105 With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Solid Tumors Including Head and Neck Cancer
This is a first-in-human, open-label, nonrandomized, four-part trial to determine the safety profile and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of INBRX-105 and INBRX-105 in combination with Pembrolizumab. INBRX-105, a next generation bispecific antibody, targets the human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) receptor and the human 4-1BB receptor. INBRX-105 provides localized conditional T-cell co-stimulation through 4-1BB agonism.
