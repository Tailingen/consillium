Clinical Study on the Re-irradiation of Lateral Pelvic Recurrences of Gynecological Malignancies
The study aims to obtain a local control rate in patients with lateral pelvic relapses of gynecologycal cancers previously irradiated. High LET (Linear Energy Transfer) particles as carbon ions can guarantee a biologic advantage compared to photons in radioresistant neoplasms, given to their higher biological efficacy (RBE).

Primary aim: estimate the effect, in terms of clinical response, of carbon ion treatment (CIRT) in patients with lateral pelvic recurrences of gynecological malignancies.

Secondary aims:

1. To describe the safety profile of carbon ion therapy.
2. To estimate the effect, in terms of survival, of carbon ion treatment
