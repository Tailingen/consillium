Study of Tumor Metabolism by Isotopic Tagging in Patients With High-grade Glioma (CARBONOMIC)
The purpose of the study is to follow tumoral proteins metabolism by in vivo no radioactive isotopic tagging (carbon 13 and nitrogen 15).
High-grade Glioma
DRUG: C13 N15 Valine
Mass spectrometry measurement of C13 labelled proteins, during 30 hours
The project aims to study protein turnover in glioblastoma using mass spectrometry after 13C-valine incorporation. This will allow to identify proteins in circulation secreted by tumor which could be diagnostic and pronostic biomarkers in patients With High-grade Glioma.
