Preliminary Safety and Tolerability of CD19x22 CAR T Cells in Adolescent and Adult R/R B-NHL Patients
This open-label, single arm phase 1/1b trial aims to determine the safety and tolerability of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 chimeric antigen receptor-expressing (CAR) T cells (CD19x22 CAR T) in adolescents and adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL). Phase 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of CD19x22 CAR T cells using a standard 3+3 trial design. Phase 1b is an expansion phase designed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CD19x22 CAR T in CAR-treated and CAR-naïve patients.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: CD19x22 CAR T Cells
Phase 1: Overall Tolerability of CD19x22 CAR T Therapy in CAR-naive Subjects as Assessed by Type, Frequency, and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), All AEs, including laboratory abnormalities, will be graded using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grading criteria., 12 Months Post Infusion|Phase 1: Determine the Phase 1b Dose Level, Incidence and frequency of Grade 3-5 toxicity occurring within the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period post CD19x22 CAR T infusion. Grades 3-5 adverse events (AEs) are defined as Severe, Life-Threatening, and Fatal., 30 Days Post Infusion|Phase 1b: Establish Evidence of Tolerability of CD19x22 CAR T Cells in a Broader Sample of CAR-naive Subjects Versus Those who have Previously Received CD19 CAR T Cell Therapy, Frequency and severity of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). All AEs and SAEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grading criteria., 12 Months Post Infusion|Phase 1b: Evaluate the Clinical Efficacy of CD19x22 CAR T through Calculating Proportion of CR, PR, SD, and PD., Efficacy of treatment will be quantified by calculating the proportion of subjects who achieved a response, such as a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) at Day +90, 6 months, and 1 year., 12 Months Post Infusion|Phase 1b: Evaluate the Clinical Efficacy of CD19x22 CAR T through Reporting ORR, PFS, DOR, and OS, Reporting of overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) at 1 year., 12 Months Post Infusion
Percentage of Patients for Whom the Desired Dose of CAR T Cells was Successfully Produced, The feasibility of manufacturing the desired dose of anti-CD19x22 CAR T cells will be established using the percentage of patients for whom the desired dose of CAR T cells was successfully produced., Day 0 (Infusion)|Evaluate Clinical Efficacy of CD19x22 CAR T, Clinical efficacy is defined through Lugano response criteria at Day +90, 6 months, and 1 year. Efficacy in the phase 1b portion will be stratified based on prior receipt of CD19 CAR T cell therapy., 12 Months Post Infusion|Percentage of Study Participants who Receive CD19x22 CAR T Cell Infusion without Infusion Reaction, 30 Days Post Infusion
Phase 1: To determine the safety and tolerability of infusing CD19x22 CAR T, generated using a bicistronic vector, in adolescents and adults with R/R B-NHL, and to determine the Phase 1b recommended dose.

Phase 1b (expansion phase): To acquire additional evidence of safety and efficacy of-CD19x22 CAR T infusion in CAR-treated and CAR-naïve R/R B-NHL patients.

Secondary objectives for all subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 1b include: 1) Feasibility of manufacturing and infusion, 2) Safety of infusion and 3) Efficacy: Descriptive characterization of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) at Day +90. As well, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of remission (DOR) and overall response rate (ORR) will be determined. Efficacy will be descriptively stratified based on prior receipt of CAR-T cell therapy.
