A Pharmacokinetics Study to Investigate the Effect of Vemurafenib on Digoxin in Patients With BRAFV600 Mutation-Positive Metastatic Melanoma
This open-label, multi-center, three-period, one sequence study will investigate the effect of vemurafenib on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in patients with unresectable BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma or other malignant tumor type that harbors a V600-activating mutation of BRAF without acceptable standard treatment options. Patients will receive multiple doses of vemurafenib in Periods B and C and a single dose of digoxin in Periods A and C. Eligible patients will have the option to continue treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study (NCT01739764). The anticipated time on study treatment is approximately 36 days.
