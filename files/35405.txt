A Study of DT2216 in Relapsed/Refractory Malignancies
A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose Escalation, and Cohort Expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Clinical Activity of DT2216, an Antiapoptotic Protein Targeted Degradation Compound, in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Malignancies
Solid Tumor|Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: DT2216
The number of subjects with adverse events based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Evens (CTCAE) v5.0 following treatment with DT2216., The incidence of adverse events will be the number of subjects with an adverse event divided by the total number subjects., 28 days|The number of subjects with adverse events of different grades based on the CTCAE v5.0, The severity will be based on the grading of adverse events as described in the CTCAE v5.0, 28 days|The number of subjects with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of DT2216., DLT's will be defined by any of the following:

Any Grade 5 toxicity on the CTCAE CTCAE v5.0 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant hemorrhage CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \>7 days Febrile Neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<1000/mm3 with a single temperature of \>38.3°C (101°F) or a sustained temperature of \>38°C (100.4°F) for \>1 hour Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that is clinically uncomplicated and lasting ≥7 days. CTCAE Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity of any duration CTCAE Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, except nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea lasting ≤3 days or laboratory abnormalities that return to baseline within ≤3 days with or without medical intervention Changes in liver enzymes consistent with Hy's law indicative of drug-induced hepatocellular injury, 28 days
The measurement of Cmax of DT2216 following intravenous administration, The Cmax will be based on blood levels following intravenous administrration of DT2216., 28 days|The measurement of the half-life of DT2216 following intravenous administartion, The half-life will be based on blood levels of DT2216 following intravenous administration., 28 days|The measurement of the clearance of DT2216 following intravenous administration., The clearance of DT2216 will be based on blood levels of DT2216 following intravenous administration, 28 days|The measurement of levels of BCL-XL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Levels of BCL-XL will be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 28 days|The measurement of platelet counts following administration of DT2216, Platelet counts will be determined at various time points after administration of DT2216, 28 days|The number of subjects who have oncological responses to DT2216 based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria., The response rate to DT2216 will be determined at various time points following administration of DT2216 based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1., One year
This study is an open-label, first-in-human, dose escalation study in subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic malignancies who are no longer responsive to approved or accepted standard-of-care interventions. The study will consist of a dose escalation phase followed by confirmation of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Potentially eligible subjects will undergo screening evaluations (up to 28 days prior to study therapy) and those who meet all protocol-defined eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. Subjects who fail screening may be re-screened one time following correction or mitigation of the condition that caused the screen failure; there is no time limit on when a subject may be re-screened. Enrolled subjects will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of study drug on Days 1 and 4 weekly for at least 4 weeks, with each cycle consisting of 28 days. Treatment duration for an individual subject may continue for a maximum of 1 year, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdrawal, Investigator's decision for a change in treatment strategy for the individual subject, or death. Longer therapy may be considered for individual subjects upon consultation with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor and overall assessment of benefit:risk. Subjects will be followed for safety for 28 days following the administration of the last study treatment.
