Measurement of Gemcitabine Metabolites in Blood and Urine as Predictors of Response to GemX Bladder Radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell and urine levels of Gemcitabine and its metabolites, 30 mins or 2 hours post infusion, predict response to GemX chemoradiation at first check cystoscopy, 3 months from the end of radiotherapy.

Does response at Cystoscopy correlate with results of sample analysis, To test the hypothesis that plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell and urine levels of gemcitabine and its metabolites, 30 mins or 2 hrs post-infusion, predict response to GemX chemoradiation at first check cystoscopy, 3 months from the end of radiotherapy. Gemcitabine will be measured in plasma by HPLC-MS using a published validated method. We have developed an assay for intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate which should determine levels in PBMCs from 10 - 15 ml blood. Response at Cystoscopy is measured as either complete response, superficial disease or muscle-invasive disease., 3 months following the end of GemX chemoradiation
cause-specific and overall survival rates, 3 years|acute and late toxicities as assessed by RTOG and LENT SOM scales, Toxicity is measured using LENT-SOMA (patient-reported) and CTCAE v4.0 (clinical assessment) during treatment and at follow up., 3 years
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell and urine levels of Gemcitabine and its metabolites, 30 mins or 2 hours post infusion, predict response to GemX chemoradiation at first check cystoscopy, 3 months from the end of radiotherapy.
