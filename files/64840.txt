Yoga for Young Adults Affected by Cancer
Yoga may enhance physical and psychological outcomes among young adults affected by cancer. Yet, yoga has rarely been studied in this population. We developed and piloted a yoga program, which is now ready for implementation and evaluation. This single-group, mixed-methods project will explore effectiveness and implementation of the yoga program.
