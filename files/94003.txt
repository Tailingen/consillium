A Study of FT-2102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Gliomas With an IDH1 Mutation
This Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of FT-2102 as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in patients with advanced solid tumors and gliomas.

The study is divided into two parts: single agent FT-2102 followed by combination therapy.

Part 1: A single agent, open-label study in up to five cohorts (glioma, hepatobiliary tumors, chondrosarcoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and other IDH1 mutant solid tumors) that will include a Phase 1 dose confirmation followed by a Phase 2 investigation of clinical activity in up to 4 cohorts. During the dose confirmation, additional doses or altered dose schedules may be explored.

Part 2: An open-label study of FT-2102 in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Patients will be enrolled across 4 different disease cohorts, examining the effect of FT-2102 + azacitidine (glioma and chondrosarcoma), FT-2102 + nivolumab (hepatobiliary tumors), and FT-2102 + gemcitabine/cisplatin (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). There will be a safety lead-in followed by a Phase 2 evaluation in up to four cohorts of patients.

For Cohorts 2-5, ORR is defined as CR+PR as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., While on treatment
