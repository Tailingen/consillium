The Effectiveness and Safety of Ultrasound Elastography Guided Pleural Biopsy in the Differential Diagnosis of Benign and Malignant Pleural Effusion
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the diagnostic effcacy and safety of ultrasound elastography guided pleural biopsy in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pleural effusion. The main question it aims to answer are: the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound elastography guided pleural biopsy in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pleural effusion.

Participants will undergo ultrasound elastography guided pleural biopsy or traditional ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy.
