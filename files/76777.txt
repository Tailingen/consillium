Tazemetostat Plus CHOP in 1L T-cell Lymphoma
This research is being done to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy as a possible treatment for peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL).

The name of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Tazemetostat (a type of inhibitor for Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2))
* Standard of care CHOP therapy:

  * Cyclophosphamide (a type of alkylating agent)
  * Doxorubicin (a type of anthracycline antibiotic)
  * Vincristine (a type of vinca alkaloid)
  * Prednisone (a type of corticosteroid)
* Standard of care BEAM conditioning regimen for autologous stem cell transplant:

  * Carmustine (a type of alkylating agent)
  * Etoposide (a type of Topoisomerase II inhibitor)
  * Cytarabine (a type of antineoplastic)
  * Melphalan (a type of alkylating agent)

Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR rate was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved CR during the first six cycles of treatment., Up to 18 weeks
Median Overall Survival (OS), OS based on Kaplan-Meier methodology is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., Up to 5.5 years|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse as assessed or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier. Confirmation of progression by biopsy is preferred., Up to 1.5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of overall response is defined as the time from first documentation of PR to CR until first documentation of progression or relapse by clinical or radiology parameters. Confirmation of progression by biopsy is preferred. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation., Up to 1.5 years|Grade 3-5 Treatment-Related Toxicity Rate, The percentage of participants who experienced a maximum grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event based on the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse events Version 5.0 (CTCAEv5) as reported on case report forms., Up to 3.5 years|Transplant Rate, Transplant rate defined as the proportion of participants who are deemed transplant eligible and nominated by the treating investigator before initiation of protocol therapy to undergo consolidation transplant, who receive at least one dose of protocol-based therapy, and who then successfully proceed to transplant., Up to 1.5 years|Mobilization Success Rate, Mobilization success rate is defined as the proportion of participants nominated by the treating investigator before initiation of protocol therapy to undergo consolidation transplant, in whom stem cell mobilization is attempted and who mobilize a sufficient number of stem cells to proceed to stem cell transplant irrespective of actually proceeding to transplant. Mobilization success will be determined by institutional standards for absolute number of CD34+ cells necessary for transplant., Up to 1.5 years
This is a phase 2 open-label study of Tazemetostat plus CHOP chemotherapy to find out if the addition of Tazemetostat is more beneficial than the usual approach for PTCL, which is CHOP or CHOEP (CHOP with Etoposide) with a potential standard-of-care autologous stem cell transplant. Tazemetostat works to slow down and decrease specific proteins that may be overactive in PTCL.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved tazemetostat for Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma but it has been approved for other uses cancers including a different type of lymphoma called Follicular Lymphoma.

The FDA has approved CHOP as a treatment option for PTCL.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, blood tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (Echos), Positron Emission (PET) scans, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, tumor biopsies, and bone marrow biopsies and aspirations.

It is expected that about 24 people will take part in this research study.

Ipsen is supporting this research study by providing the study drug, tazemetostat and funding.
