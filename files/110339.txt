Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Stage II/III Thymoma After Complete Resection
This study is designed to investigate whether adjuvant radiotherapy after complete resection has a better survival for stage II or III thymoma.

It is confirmed by many studies that patients of thymoma with complete resection have better prognosis than those with either incomplete resection or without surgery. However,whether patients with stage II or III thymoma could benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy after complete resection remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether adjuvant radiotherapy after complete resection can improve survival for stage II or III thymoma.
