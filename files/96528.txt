Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood draw
To evaluate plasma ghrelin levels in patients with pancreatic cancer and compare with age matched controls, prior to treatment
To investigate the role of ghrelin in pathophysiology of cancer cachexia, prior to treatment|To generate hypotheses for future studies and treatment based on the findings, prior to treatment
The primary outcome measure for this study is plasma ghrelin level, and the two primary comparison are:

* Patients with cachexia versus patients without cachexia
* Patients with cachexia versus healthy controls
