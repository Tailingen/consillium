Obesity and weight gain are significant concerns for breast cancer survivors. Given the adverse consequences of weight gain after diagnosis, continued efforts to identify appropriate weight management interventions aimed at promoting overall health and long term survivorship are needed. In this study, the investigators will examine whether adding acupuncture to a nutrition education program for weight loss could improve short and long term weight loss among breast cancer survivors post treatment with chemotherapy.
