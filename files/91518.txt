Efficacy of Lentinula Edodes-Derived Supplement (AHCC®) in Promoting Negativity of Persistent HPV Infection
This retrospective, multicenter clinical study evaluates the efficacy and safety of an AHCC®-based supplement derived from Lentinula edodes in promoting the negativity of persistent HPV infection lasting more than six months. The study involves three groups: unvaccinated participants receiving AHCC®, vaccinated participants receiving both AHCC® and the HPV vaccine, and vaccinated participants receiving only the HPV vaccine.

The study investigates the ability of AHCC® (Active Hexose Correlated Compound) to support immune modulation and promote negativity of persistent HPV infections, which are associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. Participants are categorized into three groups based on vaccination and supplement use. Outcomes include the proportion of participants achieving HPV negativity and the safety and tolerability of the supplement over a 4-6 month period. The study aims to evaluate the potential of AHCC® as a complementary approach for managing persistent HPV infection.
