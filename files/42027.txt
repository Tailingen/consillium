Omission of SLNB in CN0 Early Breast Cancer
The OMSLNB trial adopts a prospective, single-arm, non-inferiority, phase-II, open-label study design. Patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer （tumor ≤3cm） and assessed as cN0 will be eligible for inclusion, enrolled patients are required to complete 2 or more imaging tests including axillary ultrasound assessed as axillary lymph node negative, and other tests including MRI, PET-CT, \[18F\]-FDG PET-MRI, eligible patients will avoid axillary surgery but will undergo breast surgery, which is not limited to breast-conserving surgery (BCS). So as to decrease the edema of upper arm, and finally improve the quality of life of the patients.

PROCEDURE: Omit SLNB
invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS), Time interval from the surgery to invasive local-regional recurrence, distant metastasis, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or death from any cause., 3 years
Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL), Objective evaluation of breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) by arm circumference measurements and bioelectrical impedance technology. In our study, BCRL is diagnosed in two ways：① Relative Volume Change (RVC ) \>10% in the affected upper extremity. ②Bioelectrical impedance technology: the impedance ratio is defined as the ratio of the impedance of the healthy upper limb to the impedance of the affected upper limb, and BCRL is diagnosed when the patient's impedance ratio is higher than the mean + 2 standard deviations (SD) of healthy controls, and BCRL will be diagnosed by meeting one of them., 3 years|Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), Patients will be followed up with questionnaires using the FACT-B (Version 4.0) and Quick DASH at baseline, 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postoperatively, and the FACT-B scale will be used to assess changes in QoL from baseline to 3 years after surgery, and the Quick DASH scale will be used to assess changes in arm morbidity from baseline to 3 years after surgery., 3 years|Locoregional Recurrence (LRR), This includes both local and regional recurrences. Local recurrence is defined as recurrence in the ipsilateral breast, chest wall, skin or surgical scar. Regional recurrence is defined as recurrence in the affected lymphatic drainage area, including the axilla, supraclavicular region, subclavicular region, and internal mammary node area., 3 years|Local Recurrence (LR), Local recurrence is defined as recurrence in the ipsilateral breast, chest wall, skin or surgical scar., 3 years|Regional Recurrence (RR), Regional recurrence is defined as recurrence in the affected lymphatic drainage area, including the axilla, supraclavicular region, subclavicular region, and internal mammary node area., 3 years
