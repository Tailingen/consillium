Evaluation of Xaluritamig in High-Risk, Biochemically Recurrent, Non-metastatic Castrate-sensitive Prostate Cancer
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of xaluritamig monotherapy in adult participants with high-risk biochemical recurrent (BCR) nonmetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC).

DRUG: Xaluritamig
Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Events categorized as adverse events (AEs) starting on or after first dose of investigational product (xaluritamig) as determined by the flag indicating if the AE started prior to the first dose on the Events Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and including 30 days after the last dose of investigational product (xaluritamig) or end of study date, whichever is earlier., Up to approximately 2 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-related Adverse Events (TRAEs), A TRAE is any TEAE that per investigators' review has a reasonable possibility of being caused by the investigational product (xaluritamig) determined by the flag indicating an event may have been caused by the investigational product (xaluritamig) on the Events eCRF. In the unlikely event that the flag is missing, the TEAE will be considered related., Up to approximately 2 years
