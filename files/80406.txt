New MRI Biomarkers in Head and Neck Cancers
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic technique that takes pictures of organs of the body. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves that cannot be felt. This makes specific organs, blood vessels, or tumors easier to see. Diffusion MRI lets us measure the motion of water in the tumor.

The purpose of this study is to see if new MRI methods can give us more information about the tumor.

For group 1: number of patients that have biomarkers that maybe early response to therapy indicators, The study is designed to determine if the MRI will provide quantitative imaging biomarkers to predict or assess early treatment response in R/M head and neck cancers. The MR data will be compared with clinical follow-up data. Additional sequence parameters., 1 year|For group 2: number of patients response to treatment, will be assessed using ROC curves with RECIST with the RECIST version 1.1 response as the gold standard and change in DW-MRI and image feature metrics as predictors., 1 year
