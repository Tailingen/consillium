Feasibility of Treatment of Cancer Involving the Liver With High Dose Radiation
A study is being conducted by the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) in which patients with liver cancer will be treated with high dose conformal radiation therapy. This type of radiation uses new techniques which aim the radiation to the sites of disease allowing the tumor to receive a high dose and the surrounding normal liver tissue to receive a low enough dose that the normal tissue should remain free from injury.

The purpose of the study is to determine if the conformal radiation therapy is safe, tolerable and effective in treating liver cancer and to determine the side effects caused by this treatment. A second objective is to determine if the levels of a special type of protein (called cytokines) found in the blood are related to this treatment.
