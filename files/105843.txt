Efficacy of EPA-enriched Supplement in Malnourished Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergone Surgery
The purpose of this study is to study the effects of EPA-enriched supplement compared with conventional supplement in malnourished head and neck cancer patients undergone surgery. Primary outcome is perioperative weight changing.

To study the effects of EPA-enriched supplement compared with conventional supplement in malnourished head and neck cancer patients undergone surgery. The patients are divided into 2 groups receiving the different formula supplements. The both supplements are isocaloric. The patients receive the supplement for 3 weeks (1 week prior to surgery and 2 weeks post surgery) Primary outcome is perioperative weight changing. Secondary outcomes are body compositions, hospital stay days, complication and co-morbidity.
