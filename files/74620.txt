Study of Current Practice Which Compare the Rate of Prostate Cancer by Using 2 Kind of Transrectal Biopsies: 3 by IRM-echography Image Fusion and 12 Systematized Guided Echographies.
The purpose of the study is to show that 3 targeted biopsies on the suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with the Koelis ® system, will get no lower rate of cancer detection than those obtained by 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: systematic biopsies|PROCEDURE: Targeted biopsies guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images
Carcinomatous invasion on biopsies samples, The presence of carcinomatous invasion on biopsies samples, Day 15
Tissue length of biopsy invaded by the detected cancer, Maximal tissue length of biopsy invaded by the detected cancer, Day 15|Biopsy Gleason score of the detected cancer, Maximal biopsy Gleason score of the detected cancer, Day 15|Respective duration of each biopsy protocol, Day 0
The act of current practice evaluated by this research is the act of prostate biopsies : the patient will have to undergo 12 systematized transrectal echography guided biopsies of the prostate and 3 additional biopsies targeted on the suspicious lesion detected with MRI, which are both done in current practice.

* A first operator is not informed of the location of the target. He will perform a series of 12 systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate.
* Immediately after the second operator will perform 3 additional targeted biopsies on the suspicious image detected by IRM, guided by a fusion of MRI and ultrasound- images with the Koelis ® system

Act added by the research: Using a fusion of MRI - ultrasound images software system (Koelis ®).
