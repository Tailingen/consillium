Acalabrutinib Study in Indian Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia & Relapsed and Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This study is plan to assess the safety and efficacy of Acalabrutinib in Indian patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Relapsed and Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Acalabrutinib capsule
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) Including Arrhythmias (Atrial Fibrillation), Anaemia, Hypertension, Bleeding, Infections, The AESIs for acalabrutinib, including arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation), anaemia, hypertension, bleeding, and infections, are presented., Throughout study completion, approximately 198 days (from the Screening Phase [Day 0], Treatment Phase [Days 1-170], and until the Follow-up Phase [28 days after Day 170])|Second Primary Malignancies, The safety of acalabrutinib was investigated by determining the number of second primary malignancies., Throughout study completion, approximately 198 days (from the Screening Phase [Day 0], Treatment Phase [Days 1-170], and until the Follow-up Phase [28 days after Day 170])
Objective Response to Treatment, The efficacy of acalabrutinib was assessed by measuring the participants' objective response to treatment.

Objective response = Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + Partial Response with lymphocytosis (PRL)., Visit 5 (Day 85) and Visit 8 (Day 170)|Health Related Quality of Life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 [EORTC QLQC30] Questionnaire), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that measures quality of life in cancer patients. It is divided into several scales: Functioning Scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social), Symptom Scales (Fatigue, Pain, Nausea/Vomiting), Dyspnoea, Sleep Disturbances, Appetite Loss, Diarrhoea, Constipation, Financial Difficulties, and Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale. Scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better health related quality of life.

The total scores were calculated from the mean of the 13 QLQ-C30 scales (Global Quality of Life Scale and Financial Impact Scale were excluded). Prior to calculating the mean, Symptom Scales were reversed to obtain a uniform direction of all scales. The total score was only calculated if all of the required 13 scale scores were available using scale scores based on the completed items, provided that at least 50% of the items in that scale were completed., From Visit 1 (Day 0), during Visit 5 (Day 85), and at Visit 8 (Day 170)
A prospective, multi-centre, phase IV clinical trial of Acalabrutinib capsules in Indian adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). As per recommendation from Indian health authority, the current phase-IV study is planned with the aim to assess the safety and efficacy profile of Acalabrutinib in Indian patients with CLL/SLL, and patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. The data obtained from the study will help to understand the safety and efficacy profile of Acalabrutinib in Indian patients. Patients will be monitored throughout the study period for Adverse Events of Acalabrutinib
