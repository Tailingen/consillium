A Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate in Children With Refractory or Recurrent Neuroblastoma Expressing Somatostatin Receptors.
This study is a multicenter, open label phase I dose escalation trial designed to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 177Lu-DOTATATE in children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma.

177Lu-DOTATATE will be delivered intravenously for 2 cycles, 6 weeks apart.

The duration of study participation of each patient will be 5 months.
