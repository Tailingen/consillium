Perioperative Management in Gynaecological Carcinoma Surgery
This study is to determine the effect of perioperative treatment with intravenous iron and tranexamic acid on the reduction of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions in gynaecological carcinoma patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Radical abdominal surgery often leads to intraoperative bleeding frequently exceeding 1000 ml and approximately 50% of women undergoing this surgery require blood transfusion. Perioperative blood transfusions have been shown to increase of length of stay, surgical complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality. There are a few data on the reduction in red blood cell count (RBC) transfusions using perioperative management with intravenous iron and tranexamic acid in women with gynaecological carcinoma surgery. This study is to determine the effect of perioperative treatment with intravenous iron and tranexamic acid on the reduction of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions in gynaecological carcinoma patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
