Laboratory and Ultrasound Findings and Response to Letrozole in PCOS Patients
The goal of this observational study is to compare laboratory and ultrasound findings between letrozole-resistant and letrozole-sensitive PCOS patients in Egypt. The study will include women aged 18-40 years diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam criteria, who are undergoing ovulation induction with letrozole for the first time.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

What are the baseline laboratory and ultrasound differences between letrozole-resistant and letrozole-sensitive PCOS patients? What factors can predict letrozole resistance in PCOS patients? Researchers will compare letrozole-resistant and letrozole-sensitive PCOS patients to determine whether specific laboratory markers and ultrasound findings can predict resistance to letrozole.

Participants will:

Undergo baseline clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound assessments before starting letrozole treatment.

Receive letrozole treatment with dose escalation up to 7.5 mg/day over a maximum of three cycles if ovulation is not achieved.

Be monitored through serial transvaginal ultrasounds to assess follicular development.

Have ovulation confirmed via mid-luteal serum progesterone levels. The study aims to improve the understanding of predictors of letrozole resistance to guide personalized ovulation induction strategies in PCOS patients.
