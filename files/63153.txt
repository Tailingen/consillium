Genetic Analysis in Blood and Tumor Samples From Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Estrogen Receptor Positive and HER2 Negative Breast Cancer Receiving Palbociclib and Endocrine Therapy
This research trial studies genetic profiles in blood and tumor samples from patients with estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body who are receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy. Examining the genetic changes associated with the cancer and comparing the genetic material from the cancer tissue with the genetic material found in the blood may help doctors to develop customized treatment for breast cancer.
Advanced Breast Carcinoma|Locally Advanced Breast Carcinoma|Metastatic Breast Carcinoma|Recurrent Breast Carcinoma|Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIA Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIB Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IIIC Breast Cancer AJCC v7|Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7
PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Bioinformatics analysis, Next-generation sequencing data will be used to identify variants associated with the progression free survival. Pathology analysis will also be performed., Up to 3 years
Ki67 and TK1 changes, Spearman rank correlation coefficients will be used to assess the relationship between tumor ki67 levels and serum TK1 levels prior to the start of treatment and after 2 months of treatment with palbocic., after 2 months of treatment|Changes in EMT markers (including Vimentin, SLUG and E-cadherin) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (including CD8, PD-L1, and FOXP3), Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to assess the fold changes in EMT and TILs after 2 cycles of treatment. Benjamini-Hochberg procedure will be used to control false postive rate., after 2 months of treatment|Changes in serum TK1 levels, Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to assess whether a given element of the CD44high/CD24/low/estrogen receptor (ER) low cancer stem cell-like phenotype differ between those whose TK1 levels fell below 200 after 2 cycles of treatment and those whose TK1 levels remained above 200 after 2 cycles of treatment., After 2 months of treatment|Change in phenotype of Ki67 and serum TK1 levels, The parameter estimates from fitting a univariate Cox model to these data will be used to obtain an estimate of the hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval., After 2 months of treatment|Differences between those with and without a blood draw taken, A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to assess whether baseline TK1 levels differ among those who discontinue treatment prior to the 2 month blood draw and those who do not., After 2 months of treatment
