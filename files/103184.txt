Immunophenotyping of Blood Cells in the Diagnosis Work-up of Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematological malignancies characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia in one or more major myeloid cell lines and progression to acute leukemia. Morphological analysis of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) remains the cornerstone of the diagnosis. Preliminary studies identified Flow Cytometry (FC) markers on red cells, platelets and circulating leukocytes that are expressed differently in MDS and in controls. However, these markers have been evaluated separately. The investigators propose to test in a large cohort of patients these markers, and to combine the most relevant ones in order to define a PB FC-based diagnosis score that would discriminate between MDS and non-clonal hematopoiesis and would avoid useless bone marrow samples in elderly

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Flow cytometry
identification of the most relevant combination of FC markers, The main objective is to identify the most relevant combination of FC markers to discriminate between already diagnosed MDS patients and non-MDS patients., 0 days
prospective validation of a diagnostic score using pre-identified markers, The secondary objective is to build prospectively a diagnostic score using markers identified, 0 days
