Phase 2 Study of WGI-0301 for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to determine the MTD of WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib for advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and assess its safety and efficacy in adults with advanced unresectable HCC who have previously received PD-1 / PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: WGI-0301 at MTD/RP2D dose IV infusion, QW|DRUG: WGI-0301 at MTD/RP2D -1 dose IV infusion, QW|DRUG: Sorafenib 400 mg PO, BID continuously|DRUG: Sorafenib 400 mg PO, BID
Efficacy of WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on ORR per RECIST 1.1., ORR is defined as the percentage of patients documented to have a confirmed CR or PR., through study completion, an average of 2 year
Safety of each dose group., Determined by number of AEs, SAEs, number of participant with changes in safety relevant clinical parameters, number of participants with dose modifications., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Tolerability of each dose group., Determined by number of AEs, SAEs, number of participant with changes in safety relevant clinical parameters, number of participants with dose modifications., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Anti-tumor activity if WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on ORR., ORR is defined as the percentage of patients documented to have a confirmed CR or PR., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Anti-tumor activity if WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on DCR., DCR is defined as the percentage of patients documented to have a confirmed CR or PR or SD., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Anti-tumor activity if WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on DoR., DoR is defined as the time from date of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective PD or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Anti-tumor activity if WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on PFS., PFS is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to the date of PD or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Anti-tumor activity if WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on TTP per RECIST 1.1., TTP is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to first documented PD., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Anti-tumor activity if WGI-0301 in combination with Sorafenib based on OS., OS is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to death due to any cause., through study completion, an average of 2 year
This study will include a two-stage design: Stage 1 (dose escalation) to determine the MTD/RP2D of WGI-0301 combined with Sorafenib. Stage 2 (dose expansion) with two different dose levels of WGI-0301 in combination with standard dose Sorafenib, or standard dose Sorafenib alone.
