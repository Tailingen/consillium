Palbociclib in Molecularly Characterized ER-positive/HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
This international, multicenter, prospective single arm Phase II biomarker discovery clinical trial with the primary objective of assessing the association of PFS with gene mutations, gene copy number aberrations and gene signatures in post-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative metastatic or locally relapsed breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior adjuvant endocrine therapy or one line systemic treatment, i.e., endocrine treatment or chemotherapy, administered for metastatic disease.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Number of Participants With and Without Progression Free Survival (PFS) Events, Time from treatment initiation until documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 or death, whichever occurs first, Maximum 36 months
Best Overall Response, Best overall response is based on RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) 1.1 criteria and is defined as best response recorded from enrollment across all time points until disease progression. Confirmation of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) by an additional scan was not requested in this trial (rationale: initially because of randomized placebo-controlled design; subsequently because no hypothesis testing of progression-free survival, PFS, distribution relative to an historical control)., From date of enrolment until patient's end of treatment visit (or a maximum of 12 months after EoT in the absence of tumor progression), assessed up to 48 months.|Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD), Disease control is defined as best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (or non-CR/non-PD, progressive disease, in the case of non-measurable disease only) lasting for at least 24 weeks, measured from enrollment until first documentation of progressive disease, From date of enrolment until patient's end of treatment visit (or a maximum of 12 months after EoT in the absence of tumor progression), assessed up to 48 months.
Patients will be treated with the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant. The primary objective is to assess the association of the primary endpoint progression-free survival (PFS) with potential markers.

The trial is included in the AURORA program conducted by the Breast International Group (BIG), an international study aiming to collect and characterize biological samples, including metastatic tissue, from patients with advanced breast cancer.

The primary aim of the PYTHIA study is to discover potentially innovative biomarkers for the selection of patients to Palbociclib/Fulvestrant treatment. The strength of the trial lies in its conduct in conjunction with the AURORA study, which systematically evaluates a panel of biomarkers in tissue and blood, in a certified central lab. Stemming from this association, an abundance of molecular profiling information will become available for different biological samples. Additional molecular and functional imaging assessments performed within the context of the PYTHIA study increase its scientific merit, since it will represent a prospective, systematic effort to identify biomarkers for patient stratification, integrating several molecular profiling assessments.
