Clinical, Histological and In-depth Molecular Characterization as Well as Experimental Models of Liver Metastasis From Patients With Breast Cancer in Order to Identify New Potential Treatment Avenues.
The goal of this observational study is to learn about breast cancer liver metastasis in patients who met the following criteria:

* female;
* be ≥ 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent;
* confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer liver metastases. Newly diagnosed patients with de-novo liver metastases are eligible;
* be planned for liver surgery.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. To characterize the tumour cells and their microenvironment in the liver metastases at the transcriptomic and protein single-cell level;
2. To determine the levels and patterns of immune infiltrates in liver metastases from BC patients;
3. To identify biological features associated with the histopathological growth patterns in liver metastases.
4. To create patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids (PDO) from liver metastases isolated from patients with BC;
5. To perform a histopathological and molecular comparison of liver metastases, PDX and PDO isolated from the same patient

Participants will be willing and able to provide written informed consent for this study and tissue samples for research purposes.
