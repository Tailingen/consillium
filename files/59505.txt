Measuring Surgical Recovery After Radical Cystectomy
The intent of this study is to establish a registry of post-surgical outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy at MD Anderson Cancer Center and the collaborating institutions. The goals of this initiative are to obtain a detailed baseline of multiple patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (CRO) as well as various presenting conditions associated with them, so that future quality improvement interventions can be evaluated accurately as to their relative contribution to improved outcomes.
