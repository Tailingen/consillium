Phase I/II Study of Intratumoral Injection of CPG 7909, a TLR9 Agonist, Combined With Local Radiation for Patients With Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides.
This is a single institution phase I / II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral CpG injections combined with local radiation in patients with mycosis fungoides. Patients will receive low-dose radiotherapy to a single tumor site on days 1 and 2 (2 Gy each day). CpG injections will be administered into the same tumor site within 24 hours before or 24 hours after each radiation treatment. Weekly doses of (intratumoral or peritumoral injections) CpG will be then administered subcutaneously in the region of previous injections for 23 additional doses. The total treatment duration is 24 weeks.
