A Study of CBP-1008 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
The primary objective of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CBP-1008, a bi-specific ligand conjugated drugs in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: CBP-1008
Incidence and severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Assessed by number of patients with AE, Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), serious adverse event (SAE), and discontinuation of study drug due to AE., up to 12 months|To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.03. MTD is defined as the previous dose level at which 2 out of 3 participants or 2 out of 6 participants experienced DLT., Up to 28 days after the first dose of CBP-1008
Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of CBP-1008, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of CBP-1008 will be investigated., up to 12 months|Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of CBP-1008, Tmax of CBP-1008 will be investigated., up to 12 months|Elimination half-life (T1/2) of CBP-1008, T1/2 of CBP-1008 will be investigated., up to 12 months|AUC0-t of CBP-1008, AUC0-t is defined as area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration., up to 12 months|Clearance (CL) in the serum of CBP-1008 per unit of time, CL in the serum of CBP-1008 per unit of time will be investigated., up to 12 months|6. The percentage of participants with anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive after dosing CBP-1008, Incidence and titer of ADA against CBP-1008 will be evaluated., up to 12 months|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK data collected during the dose escalation study of CBP-1008., up to 12 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants, who had a CR or PR. The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR is evaluated by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. The DOR is evaluated by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., up to 12 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR was defined as the percentage of participants, who had a CR, PR or SD. The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR, PR or SD is evaluated by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., up to 12 months|Progression-free survival rate (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of CBP-1008 to the first date of either disease progression or death, which will be evaluated by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., up to 12 months|Overall survival rate (OS), 12 months OS will be evaluated by investigator according to RECIST 1.1., up to 12 months
This phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter study has two stages. The Ia stage is a dose-escalation study that will focus on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, MTD and RP2D. Patients with advanced solid tumor who failed from previous standard treatment or without standard therapy exists will be enrolled in the phase Ia study. DLT observation period is 28 days.

Patients in phase Ib part will be recruited into certain tumor cohorts and receive RP2D CBP-1008 iv infusion every two weeks. Primary efficacy of ORR, DCR, PFS, etc., will be evaluated. The correlation between tumor response and the receptors will be explored. Safety information will be collected in phase Ib stage.
