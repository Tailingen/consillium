Calcium Phosphate Cement Registry (CPC Registry)
CPC REGISTRY is a multi-center, international, prospective, open-label, observational study on the use of injectable calcium phosphate cements for the treatment of bone defects in adults. All patients will be treated with any of the two injectable calcium phosphate bone substitutes (GRAFTYS®HBS/GRAFTYS®Quickset or their private labels) according to standard clinical practice and according to the information provided by GRAFTYS manufacturer in respective device Instructions For Use (IFU).

The questionnaires concern the degree of difficulty (level of function) that the patient experienced in performing usual daily activities and higher level activities due to his bone defect. Therefore, the type of functional score depends on the skeletal region impacted by the bone defect:

* Hand/wrist/ elbow/shoulder: Quick-DASH score (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder \& Hand).
* Knee: KOOS-PS (Knee Injury \& Osteoarthritis Outcome Score- Physical function Short form)

The objective of this observational prospective study is to collect safety and performance data relating to the use of injectable Calcium Phosphate Cements "GRAFTYS®HBS/GRAFTYS®Quickset (or their private labels)" in routine clinical practice from various international hospitals. Therefore this observational study will allow to support data about risk management (established at the end of the product development); and to enhance the current clinical evaluation of products with new clinical data (for longer follow-up). The collected data of this observational study will be "non-identifying data". The patient must have signed a Written Consent Form (for data collection) prior to any data being entered into the electronic Case Report Form.

Patients will be followed as per local standard medical practices of the center for two years. Five follow-up visits/phone calls will be collected (at 3 months (+/-14 days), 6 months (+/- 14 days), 9 months (+/-21 days), 12 months (+/- 30 days) and 24 months (+/-60 days)). Each visit/phone call includes the collection of Adverse Events, the measurement of health status (quality of life and functional scores) and the X-ray scoring (if X-ray imaging is available). No additional exams (other than the routine clinical practice) are requested. The surgeons have to follow their usual practices (e.g. X-Rays have to be performed only if they are scheduled in the routine clinical practice).

All Adverse Events will be collected and monitored at each follow-up visit or follow-up phone call. All Serious Adverse Events must be described via a Serious Adverse Event form in e-CRF and all Adverse Device Effects must be described via a "Product Complaint Form" in e-CRF.

Descriptive analyses will be performed in order to describe: nature of adverse events, their distribution and frequency. Moreover, all factors which may appear predictive for the rate of adverse events will be analyzed (age, sex, amount of CPC injected, delivery system used, diabetes history, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, concomitant treatments/diseases...). For all time-dependent events, life-tables will be able to calculate using the Kaplan Meier estimate method, for a period starting on the date of the procedure up to and including the 24-months follow-up visit.
