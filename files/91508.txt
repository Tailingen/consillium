Safety and Tolerability of BION-1301 in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM)
This is a Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BION-1301 in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after 3 or more prior systemic therapies.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: BION-1301
Safety (Phase 1), Number of patients reporting treatment-related adverse events that qualify as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of BION-1301 as a single agent, 28 days following first administration of BION-1301|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (Phase 1), Recommended Phase 2 Dose RP2D of BION-1301 when administered as a single-agent, Approximately 2 years|Biomarkers (Phase 1 and 2), Biomarkers such as soluble a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL; TNFSF13); soluble B cell maturation antigen (BCMA; TNFRSF17), Baseline and approximately 2 years|Bioanalytical Measures (Phase 1 and Phase 2), Relative change in serum and urine M-protein levels defined as the maximum reduction from baseline, Baseline and approximately 2 years|Safety Profile (Phase 2), BION-1301 safety profile based on incidence of TEAEs (treatment emergent adverse events), changes in safety parameters, and unacceptable toxicities, 28 days|Response Rate (Phase 2), Objective response rate (ORR) based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR), Approximately 30 months|Progression-Free Survival (Phase 2), Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as time from first dose of study drug to date of first tumor progression or death due to any cause, Approximately 30 months|Overall Survival (Phase 2), Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from first dose of study drug to date of death due to any cause, Approximately 30 months
An open-label, multi-center, dose-selection Phase 1/2 study (also referred to as ADU-CL-16) evaluating BION-1301, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against APRIL for the treatment of relapsed or refractory MM. This first-in-human study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and initial clinical activity of BION-1301 administered as a single agent.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Phase 1 is dose escalation and seeks to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Once an RP2D is identified, Phase 2 of the study will open and continue to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of BION-1301 administered at selected dose level(s).

The population for this study will consist of adults with relapsed or refractory MM whose disease has progressed after at least 3 prior systemic therapies. BION-1301 will be administered in 28-day cycles; the dosing interval will be once every two weeks (Q2W).
