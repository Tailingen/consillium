Safety Study of Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 in Hematologic Malignancy
The purpose of this study is to determine the side effects of treatment with the monoclonal antibody anti-PD-L1 (BMS-936559) in subjects with compromised bone marrow function and the dose that should be recommended for use in future studies.
