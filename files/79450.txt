To determine the safety and efficacy of Gleevec as a single agent in patients with BCR-negative myeloproliferative disorders including myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 3 years|to determine the biologic activity of Gleevec in patients with BCR-negative myeloproliferative disorders including myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 3 years
Gleevec will be administered at a dose of 400 mg orally once daily.

Patients will continue to receive the drug until either drug progression or the development of intolerable side effects.

Patients will be assessed with a complete blood count weekly for the first 8 weeks and will have monthly physical examinations and bone marrow examinations every 3 months.
