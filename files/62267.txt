GENETIC: Mutation Burden cfMB analysis
Comparing the mutational burden in a person genetically predisposed to cancer with that of a non-predisposed relative, Measurement and quantification of genomic signature on circulating DNA (mutational burden) derived from whole blood in a carrier of the genetic mutation and in her non-carrier first-degree relative., At the enrollment in the study (one point)
Mutation profiling, COSMIC-type signature generation, Evaluate mutational signatures on circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in correlation with hereditary predisposition linked to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, At the enrollment in the study (one point)|Identify and evaluate complementary or alternative molecular signatures, Study of epigenetic biomarkers, such as circulating histone methylation, At the enrollment in the study (one point)
This proof-of-concept trial will be conducted with family members being monitored for a predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer linked to a BRCA1/2 gene mutation.

The study will be proposed to two sisters from the same sibling:

* one is a carrier of the genetic mutation
* and the other not,

Blood tests will evaluate the Mutation Burden cfMB
