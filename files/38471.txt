To Evaluate Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD), Safety and Efficacy of CPI-613Â® (Devimistat) Plus Hydroxychloroquine in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Clear Cell Sarcoma of Soft Tissue
The goal of this trial in Phase I is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine in combination with devimistat in patients with relapsed or refractory Clear Cell Sarcomas of the Soft Tissue and to describe the full toxicity profile. In Phase II, the goal is to evaluate the response rate \[Complete Rate (CR) + Partial Rate (PR)\] of the combination of devimistat and hydroxychloroquine in patients with relapse or refractory Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Soft Tissue and to evaluate the PK and PK/PD profiles for efficacy and safety of the combination of devimistat and hydroxychloroquine.
Sarcoma, Clear Cell
DRUG: CPI-613 + Hydroxychloroquine
MTD (Phase I), To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine in combination with devimistat in mg/m2 based on patient body weight in patients with relapsed or refractory fusion-positive sarcomas and relapsed or refractory clear cell sarcoma., 6 months|Toxicity (Phase I), Dose-limiting toxicities assessed in order to be able to establish the maximum tolerable dose for the combination of CPI-613 and Hydroxychloroquine therapy. Using the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 for adverse event reporting (Grade 1 (Mild) - 5 (Death) as well as expectedness (unexpected/expected) and attribution (definitely related to study treatment to unrelated to study treatment)., 6 months|ORR (Overall Response rate): CR +PR (Phase II), Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a best overall response complete response or partial response during or following study treatment, 12 months
DOR (Duration of Response), It is the interval from date of initial documented response (CR or PR) to the first documented date of disease progression or death., 12 months|PFS (Progression Free Survival), It is defined as the duration from the date of enrollment to the date of progressive disease or death from any cause., 12 months|OS (Overall Survival), Defines as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause., 12 months
