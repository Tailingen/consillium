TORCH: A Study of Tarceva or Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare first-line erlotinib followed at progression by second-line chemotherapy vs. first-line chemotherapy followed at progression by second-line erlotinib in the treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: erlotinib|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: erlotinib
overall survival, one year|progression free rate of first-line treatment with erlotinib, after 9 weeks of treatment
toxicity, every 3 weeks during treatment, and every 3 months thereafter|progression-free survival, one year|quality of life during the first-line therapy, every 3 weeks during first-line therapy|prognostic biologic indicators, end of study|resource utilization, every 6 weeks during first-line therapy|response rate, at 9 and 18 weeks from treatment initiation
Chemotherapy for patients affected by advanced NSCLC has demonstrated only modest improvement in survival rates over best supportive care: the prognosis of patients remains poor and the side effects are considerable. Therefore, novel agents are urgently needed for this disease. One way to improve effectiveness of therapies is to use non-chemotherapeutic agents that act on biological targets and cause fewer systemic side effects. Erlotinib(Tarceva)is a biological therapy that in recent clinical trials has shown promise in first- and second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

In this trial, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment strategies:

- erlotinib taken by mouth daily; and, if disease progression occurs, to be followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine at standard doses for 6 cycles

OR

- chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine given intravenously at standard doses for 6 cycles; and if disease progression occurs to be followed by erlotinib taken by mouth daily

The study is conducted with the partial support of Roche, S.p.A.
