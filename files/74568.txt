DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Microscopic examination
Eosinophil cell count, Each tissue slide is retrieved and examined to count the eosinphils in the submucosa, positive cases revelaed more than 90% eosinophils of the whole inflammatory cells, 1 day
A pooled 22 patients diagnosed with eosinophilic cystitis on microscopic examination in our hospital during four years were retrospectively studied.We explored the potential etiology, clinical and histopathology presentation of the eosinophilic cystitis cases, clinically mimicking urothelial neoplasia.
