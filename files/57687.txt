Genotype Guided Chemotherapy in Gastric Cancer Patients
In gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU and cisplatin, higher tumor TS levels were associated with a less favorable response (29% vs. 68%; p=0.024). Similarly, in a study in which patients were treated with high dose 5-FU, patients with high TS expression had a response rate of only 12.5%. Conversely a response rate of 92.9% was observed in patients with low tumor TS expression. A longer but not statistically significant survival advantage was observed in patients with the TSER\*2 allele compared with the TSER\*3/\*3 patients. Additionally, a review by Patel et al. identified approximately 20 gastric cancer studies that have found a positive association between TSER genotype and clinical response (in either direction). Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to prospectively genotype patients, select patients with "good risk" TSER genotypes (TSER\*2\*/\*2 or \*2/\*3) and treat them with a standard 5-FU containing regimen (FOLFOX) in order to improve clinical outcomes, while randomize patients with the "poor risk" TSER genotype (\*3/\*3) to either the standard 5-FU containing regimen or another non-5-FU-based regimen (docetaxel/cisplatin).
Metastatic Gastric Cancer
GENETIC: TSER
disease control rate, Determine whether the disease control rate (DCR) at 6 and 12 weeks in TSER\*3/\*3 patients with metastatic gastric cancer will be increased by using a non fluoropyrimidine containing regimen compared to fluoropyrimidine-containing regimens., 6 and 12 weeks after the first chemotherapy
time to progression, TTP is defined in this study as: "The length of time from the date of the start of treatment for gastric cancer until the disease starts to get worse or spread to other parts of the body.", 2 years maximum|median overall survival, median overall survival is defined in this study as: "The length of time from the start of treatment for a disease that half of the patients in a group of patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive.", 2 years maximum
drug toxicities, Drug toxicities will be recorded and evaluated by NCI CTCAE v3.0., 2 years maximum
