Each cycle is 28 days.|Evaluate the efficacy of BMS-986489 vs durvalumab by Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)., Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of participants with BOR of CR or PR, or participants with SD lasting at least 180 days (i.e., â‰¥6 months) according to RECIST v1.1., Every 2 cycles (8 weeks) from Cycle 1 Day 1, for the first 6 months, then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) until disease progression or death, up to 3 years. Each cycle is 28 days.|Evaluate the efficacy of BMS-986489 vs durvalumab by Disease Control Rate (DCR)., Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants with BOR of CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST v1.1, Every 2 cycles (8 weeks) from Cycle 1 Day 1, for the first 6 months, then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) until disease progression or death, up to 3 years. Each cycle is 28 days.|Evaluate the efficacy of BMS-986489 vs durvalumab by Duration of Response (DoR)., Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the duration from the first documented response (Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD), according to RECIST v1.1) to the date of first documented disease progression or death., Every 2 cycles (8 weeks) from Cycle 1 Day 1, for the first 6 months, then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) until disease progression or death, up to 3 years. Each cycle is 28 days.|Evaluate the efficacy of BMS-986489 vs durvalumab by Time to Progression (TtP)., Time to Progression (TtP) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression, according to RECIST v1.1., Every 2 cycles (8 weeks) from Cycle 1 Day 1, for the first 6 months, then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) until disease progression or death, up to 3 years. Each cycle is 28 days.|Evaluate the efficacy of BMS-986489 vs durvalumab by time to development of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis., Time to development of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented CNS metastasis., Every 2 cycles (8 weeks) from Cycle 1 Day 1, for the first 6 months, then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) until disease progression or death, up to 3 years. Each cycle is 28 days.|Evaluate the number of participants with adverse events following administration of BMS-986489., Adverse Events to be evaluated per CTCAE v5.0 criteria from first dose of BMS-986489 to 100 days after the last dose of BMS-986489., From Cycle 1 Day 1 to 100 days after the last dose of BMS-986489. Each cycle is 28 days.
This is an open-label, randomized study of BMS-986489 (atigotatug + nivolumab fixed-dose combination) vs durvalumab as consolidation therapy following chemoradiotherapy in participants with limited-stage (LS)-small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Participants will receive concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to standard guidelines for treatment of LS-SCLC without progressive disease prior to randomization. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either BMS-986489 (atigotatug + nivolumab as a fixed-dose combination; Arm A) or durvalumab (Arm B) as consolidation therapy. Atigotatug is a first-in-class, fully human IgG1 antibody being developed for the treatment of SCLC. Atigotatug specifically binds to fuc-GM1 on the tumor cell. Nivolumab is a monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody. Combining atigotatug with another immunotherapy may provide enhanced antitumor effects.
