A Study of Changes to Prostate Procedures
The purpose of this study is to look whether using local anesthesia during a transperineal prostate biopsy, while put to sleep by IV sedation, helps reduce the number of people who feel significant pain in the recovery room. The researchers will also look at how local anesthesia affects the amount of pain medication used, how quickly people can go home after the biopsy, and how well they recover after leaving the hospital.
