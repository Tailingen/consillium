PK/PD Study of Netupitant and Palonosetron in Pediatric Patients for Prevention of Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting
This study is Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) dose-finding study of oral netupitant administered concomitantly with oral palonosetron in pediatric cancer patients for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy. Two different netupitant dosages will be tested in patients aged from 3 months to \< 18 years: 1.33 mg/kg up to a maximum of 100 mg, and 4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 300 mg. All netupitant doses in all age classes will be concomitantly administered with palonosetron 20 μg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1.5 mg) which is the IV palonosetron dose approved by USA FDA for the pediatric population. The primary objective is to investigate the PK/PD relationship between netupitant exposure (AUC, Cmax) and antiemetic efficacy (CR in delayed phase) after a single oral netupitant administration, concomitantly with oral palonosetron in pediatric cancer patients receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) or Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) cycles. Efficacy parameter to be used in the correlation is the proportion of patients with Complete Response (CR i.e., no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) during (\> 24-120 h after the start of chemotherapy on Day 1).

The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability after single oral administration of netupitant given concomitantly with a single oral administration of palonosetron; to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (AUC, Cmax, tmax and t1/2) of oral palonosetron at the fixed dose of 20 μg/kg in pediatric patients with the concomitant administration of netupitant. A total of 92 pediatric cancer patients receiving either HEC or MEC will be enrolled in the study.

Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Netupitant, Mean values of area under the plasma Concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf) of netupitant after a single oral netupitant administration, concomitantly with oral palonosetron, in pediatric cancer patients receiving HEC or MEC cycles. AUC estimates are obtained by non-compartmental analysis of population model-predicted individual plasma concentration-time profiles., within 168 hours after netupitant administration. A sampling windows approach will be used by collecting a single blood sample from each patient in one of these time windows: from 2 to 8 h, from 24 to 48 h, from 72 to 96 h and from 120 to 168 h.|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Netupitant, Mean values of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of netupitant after a single oral netupitant administration, concomitantly with oral palonosetron, in pediatric cancer patients receiving HEC or MEC cycles. Cmax estimates are obtained by non-compartmental analysis of population model-predicted individual plasma concentration-time profiles, within 168 hours after netupitant administration. A sampling windows approach will be used by collecting a single blood sample from each patient in one of these time windows: from 2 to 8 h, from 24 to 48 h, from 72 to 96 h and from 120 to 168 h|Exposure - Response Analysis for Netupitant, Exposure - Response analysis for netupitant performed by assessing the relationships between exposure parameters AUC0-inf and Cmax with the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e., the CR in the delayed phase.

Graphical exposure-response analysis for netupitant performed by assessing the relationship between individual exposure parameters (AUC0-inf) and Cmax) with the primary efficacy endpoint, i.e the CR in the delayed phase., > 24-120 hours after the start of chemotherapy on Day 1
Percentage of Pediatric Patients With Complete Response During the Delayed Phase, Percentage of Pediatric Patients with complete response (CR, i.e., no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) during the delayed phase (\> 24 to 120 h after the start of chemotherapy on Day 1) after a single oral netupitant administration, concomitantly with oral palonosetron, in pediatric cancer patients receiving HEC or MEC cycles., > 24-120 hours after the start of chemotherapy on Day 1
