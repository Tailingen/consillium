Study of Performance of Confocal Endomicroscope With Fluorescein Imaging Agent in the Colon
The overall aim of this research project is to evaluate the imaging performance of a confocal endomicroscope. Fluorescein, an FDA-approved topical fluorescent dye, will be used to provide topical mucosal contrast. The purpose of this instrument is to provide real-time endoscopic "histology" to guide endoscopic biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the patient study group. This endomicroscope probe will be used during colonoscopies in subjects with colonic dysplasia, known colonic adenomatous polyps scheduled for endoscopic resection, or suspected dysplasia in subjects with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

DEVICE: confocal endomicroscope|DRUG: Fluorescein
Depth-imaging capability of the confocal endomicroscope using an imaging contrast agent, fluorescein, The test product efficacy will be assessed by evaluating the fluorescence intensities measured from suspicious regions of colonic mucosa where the agent is administered compared to adjacent normal mucosa., five minutes
The device is being tested in small groups of individuals: generally less than 10 for each of a variety of histologically different colonic lesions or diseases (eg. IBD, adenomas, sessile seriated adenomas (SSAs), hyperplastic polyps, normal tissue).
