Phase 1 Study of ATR-101 in Subjects With Advanced Adrenocortical Carcinoma
This first-in-human study is designed to establish the safety and tolerability of ATR-101 in patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma whose tumor has progressed on standard therapy. Information will also be collected to determine how long ATR-101 stays in the blood, and if any effect on tumor progression is seen. Biomarkers (blood and urine tests) will determine if any effects on production of steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen and testosterone) are seen.
Adrenocortical Carcinoma|Adrenal Cancer|ACC
DRUG: ATR-101
Frequency of dose-limiting toxicity and determination of maximum tolerated dose, Adverse events will be recorded and tabulated by grade and system organ class according to CTCAE v 4.03. Laboratory measures and ECGs will be assessed., Occurrence of DLT at 28 days
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of ATR-101, Plasma levels of ATR-101 will be assessed after daily oral dosing and pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated., Day 1 and Day 22|Change in plasma cortisol levels, Baseline and day 22|Change in objective measurement of tumor size, CT or MRI scans will be read according to RECIST 1.1, Baseline and 8 weeks
