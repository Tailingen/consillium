PET/CT Scan as a Tool to Rationalize the Treatment of of Advanced NSCLC Patients Undergoing First Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to test whether an early metabolic response, measured by PET/CT scan after the first cycle of chemotherapy, is able to predict which patients with advanced NSCLC have a better prognosis.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIB
PROCEDURE: PET/CT
change from baseline in highest value SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake values in PET/CT scan), To validate as prognostic factor, in terms of overall survival,early metabolic response, defined as a reduction of more than 50% of the highest value of SUVmax recorded at PET/CT scan after one cycle of chemotherapy, compared to the highest value of SUVmax recorded baseline examination, one year
Change from baseline in SUVmaxsum, TLGmax and TLGmaxsum, to describe and validate early metabolic response as a prognostic factor (in terms of overall survival), using the sum of the SUVmax (SUVmaxsum) , the highest value of TLG (TLGmax), the sum of TLG ( TLGmaxsum)., one year|correlation among SUVmax, SUVmaxsum, TLGmax, TLGsum with progression-free survival, prognostic role of early metabolic response (defined according the above reported 4 parameters) in terms of progression free survival after a first line chemotherapy, one year|correlation among SUVmax, SUVmaxsum, TLGmax, TLGsum with objective response, To describe the association between early metabolic response (defined according the above reported 4 parameters) and objective response according RECIST criteria, measured after 3 cycles of chemotherapy, 3 months|overall survival, one year|progression free survival, 12 months|objective response, 3 months
The purpose of this study is to test whether an early metabolic response, measured by PET/CT scan after the first cycle of chemotherapy, is able to predict which patients with advanced NSCLC have a better prognosis.
