Study Evaluating Biomarkers In Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Solid Tumors
This is an open label, two-part study of temsirolimus given as a 60-minute intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly to pediatric subjects with advanced solid tumors.

Part 1 is an ascending-dose study to evaluate the safety of IV temsirolimus given once weekly to subjects ages 1 to 21 years with advanced solid tumors disease that is recurrent or refractory to standard therapy or for whom standard therapy is not available. (enrollment completed) Part 2 will be conducted in three groups of children with refractory or relapsed pediatric solid tumors. Subjects with the following tumor types will be enrolled: neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and high-grade gliomas. Subjects will receive IV temsirolimus once weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (recruiting)
