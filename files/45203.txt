Data Collection in Lutetium Treated Prostate Cancer: Recording of Progression and Tumor Characteristics
This prospective study aims to collect data and blood biomarkers from patients undergoing Lu-PSMA therapy at the Erasmus MC. In doing so, it will provide real-world efficacy and safety data on the drug, gather dosimetry data and explore putative biomarkers to identify patients who most benefit from Lu-PSMA treatment.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood draw for ctDNA and circulating tumor cell collection.
Overall survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time from inclusion to death from any cause., 44 months
Progression free survival, Progression free survival will be defined as clinical, radiological or PSA progression according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) or death, whichever occurs first., 44 months|Heterogeneity of PSMA-positivity, Exploring heterogeneity of PSMA-positivity in circulating tumor cells (CTC) prior to treatment with Lutetium-PSMA., 44 months|Effect of CTC PSMA expression on response to treatment., Exploring whether there is an association between the fraction of PSMA positive CTCs and response to Lutetium-PSMA treatment., 44 months|Effect of biomarkers in blood on response to treatment., Exploring the association between biomarkers in blood and response to treatment, 44 months|PSMA-PET scan data and response to treatment., Exploring associations between PSMA-PET and therapy scans and response to treatment., 44 months
