The Study of Vidicizumab Combined With Tirelizumab in the Treatment of Breast Cancer With Low HER2 Expression
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vidicizumab combined with tirelizumab in the treatment of early high-risk or locally advanced breast cancer with low HER2 expression
Breast Cancer|Neoadjuvant Therapy
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin combined with Tislelizumab
Pathological complete remission (pCR) rate, 16 weeks
Studies have shown that vidicizumab has good efficacy and safety in advanced HER-2 low expression breast cancer. Vidicizumab combined with immunotherapy may be a new adjuvant treatment option for HER-2 low expression breast cancer patients. Therefore, we plan to carry out a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of vidicizumab combined with tirelizumab during neoadjuvant therapy, in order to provide new treatment options for patients with breast cancer with HER-2 low expression in neoadjuvant therapy, improve their prognosis and improve their quality of life
