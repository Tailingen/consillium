Olaparib, Durvalumab and UV1 in Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II maintenance study is evaluating the efficacy of UV1-olaparib-durvalumab combination as maintenance therapy after platinum combination therapy for BRCAwt patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.

STUDY DESIGN This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II maintenance study is evaluating the efficacy of UV1-olaparib-durvalumab combination as maintenance therapy after platinum combination therapy for BRCAwt patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.

Number of total subjects to be included in the trial:

184 patients will be enrolled in the study.

Patients are randomized into one of the three treatment arms, (A:B:C), in a 1:1:2 randomization:

* Arm A (olaparib): 46 subjects
* Arm B (olaparib plus durvalumab): 46 subjects
* Arm C (olaparib plus durvalumab plus UV1): 92 subjects

Patients are stratified according to:

* HRD status
* Previous use of PARP inhibitor (yes/no)

Primary objective:

â€¢ To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib (arm A) to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 (arm C)

Secondary objectives:

* To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib plus durvalumab (arm B) to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 (arm C)
* To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib plus durvalumab to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 according to stratification factors
* To evaluate Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in treatment arms
* To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment according to PD-L1 status
* To evaluate safety in treatment arms

Exploratory objectives:

* To describe genetic, molecular, and immunological mechanisms in blood and tumor of maintenance treatment.
* To explore the efficacy of maintenance treatment in the molecular subgroups based on homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status.
