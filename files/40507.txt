Intraoperative Assessment of Surgical Margins Using Confocal Microscopy in Comparison With Reference Extemporaneous Examination
Study to evaluate the use of confocal microscopy for detecting resection margins in patients undergoing surgery for basal cell carcinoma of skin and squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck|Basal Cell Carcinoma of Skin
OTHER: microscopy confocal (Histolog Scanner)
Sensitivity and Specificity of Confocal Microscopy Diagnosis Compared to Gold Standard, The concordance of intraoperative diagnosis between the two methods will be assessed by the condition of the margins of surgical specimens. Diagnostic accuracy will be measured by the sensitivity and specificity of confocal microscopy, using conventional histology reports from extemporaneous examination as the gold standard.
