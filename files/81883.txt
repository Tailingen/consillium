EUS-guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA) Versus EUS-guided Fine Needle Biopsy (EUS-FNB) for Diagnosis of Subepithelial Tumors
Background: Preoperative pathologic diagnosis of subepithelial tumor (SET) can improve clinical decision making. Although EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is currently considered the standard method for sampling SET, its diagnostic yield is generally suboptimal. EUS-guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) of SET is safe and feasible with adequate histology obtained.

Objective: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB.
Gastrointestinal Subepithelial Tumors
PROCEDURE: Device: 22G FNA needle|PROCEDURE: Device: 20G FNB needle
Diagnostic accuracy (proportion of correctly classified subjects (ture positive + true negative) among all subjects ) , compared to the gold standard diagnosis, Gold standard diagnosis is defined as;

1. in operated patients; histological assessment of the surgical resection specimen
2. in non-operated patients; based on the conclusions of the diagnostic work-up (combined outcomes of FNA and FNB samples and imaging studies), 12 months
