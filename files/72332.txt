Post-line Treatment with Teniposide for C-Myc-driven Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The study is being conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of teniposide in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who have failed standard treatment and with high expression of the c-Myc-driven FBXW2/MYC gene. Based on the results, the study will explore the correlation between the expression of FBXW2/MYC and the efficacy of teniposide.
