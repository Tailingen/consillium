Resistant Ovarian Cancer, Olaparib and Liposomal Doxorubicin
Impact of the combination of Olaparib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin on improvement of progression-free survival at 6 months in patients with platinum resistant advanced ovarian cancer.
Advanced Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin
Progression-free Survival, Proportion of pacients with no progression of disease at 6 months after start of treatment with Olaparib plus PLD, 6 months
Objective Response Rate, Proportion of patients with tumor size reduction. Response duration is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression. The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of partial responses plus complete responses according to RECIST 1.1., 20 months|Disease Control Rate, Proportion of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease of 8 or more months according to RECIST 1.1, 20 months|Response to treatment Rate according CA-125 levels, Proportion of patients who have achieved a response according to CA-125: and it has occurred if there is at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pretreatment sample., 20 months|Progression-free survival, Time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the date of objective disease progression or death (in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the subject withdraws from study treatment or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., 20 months|Overall survival, Time from inclusion until death of any cause., 20 months|Health related quality of life, Change in patient's quality of life during the study, using the self-reported European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EORTC ovarian cancer module (EORTC-OV-28). Both scores will be combined to report a final outcome., 20 months|Activity of tumor based on the growth modulation index (GMI), The GMI is the ratio of time to progression with the nth line (TTP(n)) of therapy to the TTP(n)(-1) with the n-1th line. GMI \>1.33 is considered as a sign of activity in phase II trials., 20 months
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Frequency, nature and number of patients developing adverse events throughout follow up, 20 months|DNA damage, BRCA pathway and defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR) Phosphorylation of Î³H2AX as a marker of DNA damage., 20 months
The combination of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors with PLD may provide a synergistic effect in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, especially those with Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), because of the decreased ability to repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. Preclinical studies with PARP inhibitors have shown potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents and a recent phase I study has shown the tolerability of the combination and efficacy in recurrent ovarian cancer. In this study, encouraging efficacy results were seen in ovarian cancer patients and were not limited by Germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA) Mutations status or sensitivity to platinum therapy.
