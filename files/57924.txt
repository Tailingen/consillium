Relationship of Endometrial Cancer and Serum Soluble L1CAM Level
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of serum soluble L1CAM (sL1CAM) on the diagnosis and prognosis of endometrial cancer. This prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted in patients who have undergone endometrial biopsy and whose pathology results are reported as benign endometrial changes, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. The sL1CAM level between groups will be compared. The relationship between prognostic factors and serum sL1CAM will be evaluated in patients with endometrial cancer.
