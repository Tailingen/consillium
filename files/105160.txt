Saliva mRNA Expression Profiling for Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Screening
This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of using gene expression from saliva to identify patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary objective of this study is to compare gene expression profiles from saliva from healthy controls and patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

To be eligible, patients with non-small cell lung cancer, must not yet have received treatment for their cancer (surgical removal, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy). Health control participants may participate if they meet eligibility criteria listed below.

Eligible enrollees will be asked to submit a one time saliva sample and complete a study questionaire.
