Sexual Steroids: Relationship Between Serum and Prostatic Tissue Level
Patients followed in the Foch Hospital Urology Department (Suresnes): Patients justifying a prostatectomy.

* Patients justifying prostatectomy together with the bladder (radical cystectomy for bladder cancer).
* Patients with benign prostate hyperplasia who justified a prostatectomy. Compare serum sexual steroid concentrations and intra-tissue on healthy prostates and prostate adenoma, assess concentrations intra-tissue sex steroids on cancer metastasis prostate specific blood sample under study (30mL) will be performed preoperatively in Patients followed in Foch Hospital Urology Department (Suresnes), and a Removal of a fragment of prostate tissue or metastasis will be analyze.

Aim is to compare serum concentrations of sexual steroids and intra-tissue on healthy prostates and prostate adenomas compared to concentrations measured in patients operated for prostate cancer.
Urinary Bladder Neoplasms|Prostate Hyperplasia
BIOLOGICAL: steroids concentrations determination
Serum concentrations of sexual steroids and intra-tissue on healthy prostates, A bio-informatical analysis will be performed to compare steroids concentrations profiles in both arms., 30 minutes
Steroids concentration will be determined using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analyzed steroids are :

FSH :Mul/ml LH: mUI/ml SHBG: µg/ml BT: ng/ml TT: ng/ml DHT: ng/ml DHEA: ng/ml D5: ng/ml D4: ng/ml E1: pg/ml E2 : pg/ml DHEA-S : µg/dl
