TAS 102 in Combination With Ramucirumab in Advanced, Refractory Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of TAS 102 and Ramucirumab is safe and effective in patients with advanced, refractory gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: TAS 102|DRUG: Ramucirumab 10 MG/ML Intravenous Solution [CYRAMZA]
Overall Survival, Overall survival defined as the time from starting on trial to date of death from any cause., 6 months
Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event, Number of participants with at least one adverse event., 4 weeks after end of study participation, an average of 6.5 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever comes first. Progression is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0). Progressive Disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.), 6 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0). Complete Response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., up to 12 months
