Study of Mivavotinib (CB-659) in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
Study CX-659-401 is a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study of mivavotinib to evaluate the single-agent activity of mivavotinib in patients with relapsed/refractory non-GCB/ABC DLBCL, incorporating ctDNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify DLBCL patients harboring MyD88 and/or CD79B mutations within the study. This goal of this strategy is to evaluate its activity both in the cell-of-origin subgroup of non-GCB/ABC DLBCL and in the genetically defined subgroups of MyD88/CD79B-mutated and wild type DLBCL.

DRUG: Mivavotinib
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent radiology review committee (IRC) according to the 2014 International Working Group (IWG) Lugano Criteria (Cheson, 2014)., Overall response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR is the proportion of participants who have overall responses., Start of treatment up to 21 months|Safety as measured by type, incidence, severity, seriousness, and study drug-relatedness of adverse events per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5, Type, incidence, severity, seriousness, and study drug-relatedness of AEs assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Start of treatment up to 21 months
Duration of Response (DOR) Rate as assessed by an IRC according to the 2014 International Working Group (IWG) Lugano Criteria (Cheson, 2014)., DOR per IRC. DOR will be calculated as the time between the first documentation of partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) to the first documentation of progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first., Start of treatment up to 21 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by an IRC according to the 2014 International Working Group (IWG) Lugano Criteria (Cheson, 2014)., PFS per IRC. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the IRC or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Start of treatment up to 21 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate as assessed by an IRC according to the 2014 International Working Group (IWG) Lugano Criteria (Cheson, 2014)., CR rate per IRC according to the 2014 IWG Lugano criteria (Cheson, 2014), Start of treatment to 21 months
Approximately 50 patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of two dose/schedule cohorts: one with a continuous dosing schedule (100 mg QD) and one with an induction dosing schedule (120 mg QD x 14 days, then 80 mg QD starting Day 15). Patients will receive treatment with mivavotinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death.
