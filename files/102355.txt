Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Enoblituzumab Plus Retifanlimab, Investigator-assessed ORR. defined as the percentage of patients in the response evaluable population who achieve the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR),per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 criteria..

CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions, Tumor assessment is conducted 6 weeks after the first dose, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, up to 16.5 months.|Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs) Receiving Enoblituzumab Plus Tebotelimab, Throughout the study, up to 16.5 months.|ORR of Enoblituzumab Plus Tebotelimab, Investigator-assessed ORR. ORR, defined as the percentage of patients in the response evaluable population who achieve the a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST, version 1.1 criteria.

CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions, Tumor assessment is conducted 6 weeks after the first dose, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, up to 16.5 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from the first dose date to the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, evaluated by cohort, Tumor assessment is conducted 6 weeks after the first dose, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, up to 16.5 months|Disease-control Rate (DCR), Percentage of response-evaluable patients with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 3 months, evaluated by cohort, Tumor assessment is conducted 6 weeks after the first dose, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, up to 16.5 months|Duration of Response, Time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, evaluated by cohort, Tumor assessment is conducted 6 weeks after the first dose, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, up to 16.5 months|Overall Survival, Time from the first dose date to the date of death from any cause, evaluated by cohort, up to 16.5 months|Best Overall Response (BOR), The participants best response to treatment during their study participation. Responses are categorized as CR, PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), or not evaluated (NE), per RECIST 1.1 criteria CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and non-PD in non-target lesions PD is defined as at least a 20% increase from nadir in the sum of diameters of target lesions or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions SD is defined as non-PD in target and non-target lesions, Tumor assessment is conducted 6 weeks after first dose, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, up to 16.5 months|Number of Patients With AEs Receiving Enoblituzumab Plus Retifanlimab, Throughout the study, up to 16.5 months.|Maximum Drug Concentration or Drug Concentration of Enoblituzumab at the End of Infusion of Enoblituzumab (Cmax), The highest measured concentration of enoblituzumab in the bloodstream., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-infusion, end of infusion (EOI [2 hours]), 4 hours after EOI; Cycle 1 Days 2, 3, 8 and 15 at any time; On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Pre-infusion and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum Drug Concentration or Drug Concentration of Tebotelimab at the End of Infusion of Tebotelimab (Cmax), The highest measured concentration of tebotelimab in the bloodstream., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-infusion, end of infusion (EOI [1 hour]), 4 hours after EOI; Cycle 1 Days 2, 3, 8 and 15 at any time; On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Pre-infusion and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum Drug Concentration or Drug Concentration of Retifanlimab at the End of Infusion of Enoblituzumab (Cmax), The highest measured concentration of retifanlimab in the bloodstream., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-infusion, end of infusion (EOI [1 hour]), 4 hours after EOI; Cycle 1 Days 2, 3, 8 and 15 at any time; On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Pre-infusion and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Trough Concentration of Enoblituzumab (Ctrough or Cmin), The amount of enoblituzumab left in the bloodstream before the next dose is given., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-infusion, end of infusion (EOI [2 hours]), 4 hours after EOI; Cycle 1 Days 2, 3, 8 and 15 at any time; On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Pre-infusion and EOI (each cycle is 21 days|Trough Concentration of Tebotelimab (Ctrough or Cmin), The amount of tebotelimab left in the bloodstream before the next dose is given., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-infusion, end of infusion (EOI [1 hour]), 4 hours after EOI; Cycle 1 Days 2, 3, 8 and 15 at any time; On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Pre-infusion and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Trough Concentration of Retifanlimab (Ctrough or Cmin), The amount of retifanlimab left in the bloodstream before the next dose is given., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-infusion, end of infusion (EOI [1 hour]), 4 hours after EOI; Cycle 1 Days 2, 3, 8 and 15 at any time; On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Pre-infusion and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Patients Who Develop Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) to Enoblituzumab., Prior to treatment (baseline) and at the beginning of every 3-week cycle of treatment (post baseline) up to 16.5 months|Number of Patients Who Develop ADA to Tebotelimab, Prior to treatment (baseline) and at the beginning of every 3-week cycle of treatment (post baseline) up to 16.5 months|Number of Patients Who ADA to Retifanlimab, Prior to treatment (baseline) and at the beginning of every 3-week cycle of treatment (post baseline) up to 16.5 months
