Study In Women And Men With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Have Overexpression Of ErbB2
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase III study to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of Lapatinib + Paclitaxel versus Placebo + Paclitaxel in men and women with ErbB2 amplified metastatic (Stage IV) breast cancer who had not received prior therapy for metastatic disease.
Neoplasms, Breast
DRUG: Lapatinib (GW572016) oral tablets|DRUG: Paclitaxel infusion|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS) at 53 Months, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 53 months (Primary OS analysis cut-off date = 18-Jun-2010)
Overall Survival (OS) at 190 Months, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 190 months (Final OS analysis cut-off date = 23-Nov-2021)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Investigator Assessment, Progression-free survival (PFS) during the randomized phase was defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of randomization and the earlier of date of disease progression (radiological or clinical assessment of symptomatic progression), or date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 190 months (Final analysis cut-off date = 23-Nov-2021)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator Assessment, Overall response rate (ORR) during the randomized phase was evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR). Participants with unknown or missing responses were treated as non-responders., From date of randomization until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 190 months (Final analysis cut-off date = 23-Nov-2021)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the percentage of subjects with evidence of CR or PR or stable disease (neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of \>=1 new lesions\], taking as reference the smallest sum LD since treatment start) of \>=24 weeks, based on confirmed responses from the investigator assessment of best overall response during the randomized phase., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 53 months (Primary analysis cut-off date = 18-Jun-2010)|Duration of Response (DOR), For subjects who show CR or PR, duration of response (DOR) was defined to be the time from first documented evidence of PR or CR until the first documented sign of disease progression (radiological or clinical assessment of symptomatic progression) or death due to any cause, if sooner during the randomized phase., From date of confirmed CR or PR until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 190 months (Final analysis cut-off date = 23-Nov-2021)|Number of Participants With a CR or PR at Weeks 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 72, The original outcome measure to be analyzed was Time to response (TTR) during the randomized phase defined as the time from randomization until first documented evidence of PR or CR (whichever status was recorded first); however, data were presented as the number of participants with a response at each nominal visit. Responses were based on the investigator's assessment, and only participants with a confirmed CR or PR were included in this analysis., Weeks 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 72|Number of Tumors Evaluable for PIK3CA Mutations, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway deregulation (that is PIK3CA mutations and/or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss) was studied to evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN low in HER2-positive patients receiving first-line treatment with paclitaxel alone or in combination with lapatinib. A PIK3CA mutation test kit was used to assess mutation status on genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from tumor tissue., Baseline|Number of Participants With Tumors Evaluable for PTEN, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway deregulation (that is PIK3CA mutations and/or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss) was studied to evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN low in HER2-positive patients receiving first-line treatment with paclitaxel alone or in combination with lapatinib. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in an analytically validated assay was used in the assessment of PTEN protein expression on tumor tissue. Staining intensity was allocated a score of 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+. Tumors scored IHC 0 were considered as exhibiting an absence of PTEN expression whereas those scored ICH 1+, 2+ or 3+ were considered as exhibiting any PTEN expression, being 3+ the highest expression., Baseline|Predictive Effect of PIK3CA Mutations Status on Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was evaluated per RECIST v1.1 and defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either CR or PR.

Subjects were randomized to receive either Lapatinib (1500 mg once daily) + Paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks) or Placebo (once daily) + Paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks).

Subjects who progressed while on study and were on the placebo+paclitaxel arm were permitted to enter an extension phase of open label monotherapy therapy with lapatinib or open label combination therapy with lapatinib+paclitaxel and followed for response, progression and survival.

Based on the positive results in the primary analysis, Protocol Amendment 02 (dated 09 May 2011) discontinued further entry into the lapatinib monotherapy extension phase, and ongoing subjects taking placebo were permitted to replace it with open label lapatinib therapy (with or without continued paclitaxel therapy).

Following the primary Overall Survival (OS) analysis and subsequent implementation of Protocol Amendment 03, subjects who were still receiving active treatment entered the Long-term follow-up (LTFU) phase of the study. Reporting requirements in the LTFU phase were limited to Adverse events of special interest (AESI), Serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy, and the subjects continued to receive treatment until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression (as determined by the investigator) or permanent withdrawal from treatment for any reason. Subjects who were no longer receiving active treatment were withdrawn from the study.
