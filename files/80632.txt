Exploring the Association of Imaging and Tumor Microenvironment in Urologic Cancer Using Radiogenomic Approach（Radiogenomics-Urinary）
This is the prospective, observational cohort study (Radiogenomics-Urinary), which aims to explore the relationship between the imaging information of urologic cancer patients, tumor microenvironment and the prognosis of urologic cancer patients.
Urologic Cancer
Correlation analysis of sequencing results and body composition, Conducting correlation analysis between body composition and results of multi-omics sequencing., 0.5 year|Correlation analysis of sequencing results and tumor radiomic features, Conducting correlation analysis between radiomic features and results of multi-omics sequencing., 0.5 year
Constructing tumor microenvironment prediction model, Constructing radiomic model to predict tumor microenvironment. The indicator is the area under the curve (AUC) of the prediction model, 2 years|Constructing a multi-dimensional prognostic prediction model, A high-dimensional model was constructed to predict the prognosis of patients through multi-omics sequencing data, body composition, and tumor radiomic features. The indicator is the area under the curve (AUC) of the prediction model., 3 years
