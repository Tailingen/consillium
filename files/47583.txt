Diagnostic Endoscopic Exploration for Pancreatic Head Mass
This study is being done to find out if an endoscope passed down the throat, through the stomach, and into the abdomen can quickly and accurately examine the organs and tissue of the abdomen and take biopsies if needed.
Pancreatic Head Mass
PROCEDURE: Transgastric diagnostic endoscopic peritoneoscopy
Endoscopically visualize the abdominal cavity to determine absence or presence of metastatic lesions to successfully stage pancreatic head malignancies and direct surgical treatment., Intraoperatively
Comparison of laparoscopic exploration (retrospectively) to endoscopic exploration., 1 year|Ability to obtain peritoneal biopsies when appropriate during transgastric endoscopic procedures., Intraoperatively
This study is being done to find out if an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera mounted on the end) passed down the throat, through the stomach, and into the abdomen can quickly and accurately examine the organs and tissue of the abdomen and take biopsies if needed. We wish to determine if this endoscopic route is as fast and efficient as the laparoscopic route, which is the current standard of care.
