Investigation of a Therapeutic Vaccine (ACIT-1) in Cancer
This study evaluates four different doses of ACIT-1 for safety and for the ability to raise effective anti-cancer immune responses in patients with pancreatic and other cancers. Approximately half of the patients will have pancreatic cancer and the other half will have other cancers.

Immune responses, Changes in tumour antigen specific immune responses in the blood compared to baseline, Baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 20
The immune system has an important role in helping prevent cancer by destroying early cancer cells. When cancer does develop antigen-specific immune (T) cells are still present in the blood but are either not responding or are not effective. Vaccines stimulate these T cells to respond and kill cancer cells.

ACIT-1 is designed to stimulate tumour antigen-specific T cells to respond and kill cancer cells.
