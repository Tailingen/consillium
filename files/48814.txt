mDCF + Avelumab in Resectable Esophago-gastric Adenocarcinoma (EGA)
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, Simon 2-stage, phase II trial in up to 55 patients with a potentially resectable, histologically-proven, adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction (EGJ), or lower third of the esophagus.

Patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy consisting of 4 cycles of avelumab added to the modified chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin, 5- fluorouracil. Following surgery, pathologic response will be assessed. Patients will then receive adjuvant therapy consisting of 4 cycles of mDCF + avelumab. Patients will be followed to assess two-year disease-free survival rates.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect on pathologic complete response rate (pCR) of adding avelumab to an mDCF regimen. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the safety of adding avelumab to an mDCF regimen and assess its effect on two-year disease-free survival.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: mDCF + Avelumab
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), Assessment of the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate after preoperative (neoadjuvant) treatment. pCR has been shown to correlate with long-term outcomes.For the purpose of this study, pCR is considered to represent grade 0 and grade 1 responses, defined by the criteria of the College of American Pathologists., 30Â±4 weeks
Two-Year Disease Free Survival (DFS), Analysis of two-year disease-free survival (DFS) following treatment., 104 weeks|Safety Assessment of Adding Avelumab to mDCF, Measurement of the incidence of grade 3 or 4 avelumab-related adverse events following treatment., 104 weeks
