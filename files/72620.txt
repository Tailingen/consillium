DAREONᵀᴹ-8: A Study to Test How Well Different Doses of BI 764532 in Addition to Standard of Care Are Tolerated by People With Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is open to adults with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The study is in people with advanced cancer that are eligible for standard of care including chemotherapy and anti-PD-L1 (Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1) immunotherapy.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 764532 that people can tolerate when taken together with standard of care. BI 764532 is an antibody-like molecule that may help the immune system fight cancer. Participants get BI 764532 and different standard treatments as infusions into a vein.

If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given for the entire duration of the study. During this time, participants visit the study site regularly. The visits also depend on the response to the treatment. At the study visits, the doctors check the health of the participants, take necessary laboratory tests, and note any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment.
