Study of LOXO-305 (Pirtobrutinib) Versus Investigator's Choice (Idelalisib Plus Rituximab or Bendamustine Plus Rituximab) in Patients With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
This is a study for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have previously received treatment with at least a BTK inhibitor. The main purpose is to compare LOXO-305 to idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab. Participation could last up to four years, and possibly longer, if the disease does not progress.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Pirtobrutinib|DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, as evaluated by an IRC according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) 2018., Randomization to Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 29 Months)
PFS Assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of PD or death from any cause, as evaluated by an investigator according to iwCLL 2018., Randomization to Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 36 Months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause., Randomization to Death from Any Cause (Up to 36 months)|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT was defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), therapy of pirtobrutinib for Arm B patients, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization to Subsequent Anticancer Therapy, Therapy of Pirtobrutinib or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 36 Months)|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of:

* Documented disease progression per iwCLL 2018 criteria as assessed by Investigator; or
* Initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy for CLL/SLL; or
* Unacceptable toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation as assessed by the Investigator; or
* Death (due to any cause)., Randomization to Disease Progression, Subsequent Anticancer Therapy, Unacceptable Toxicity Leading to Treatment Discontinuation, or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 36 Months)|Percentage of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR) Assessed by Investigator, ORR according to investigator-assessed best overall response (BOR) based on iwCLL 2018 is defined as the number of participants who achieve a BOR of complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR) or partial response (PR) at or before the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy divided by the total number of participants randomized to each treatment arm., Randomization to Subsequent Anticancer Therapy, Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 36 Months)|Time to Worsening (TTW) of CLL/SLL Related Symptoms, TTW was defined as a change in score greater than the meaningful within-person change for worsening in score. Scores were furthermore required to be sustained. To meet the requirement for sustained change, the assessment following the first observation of a meaningful worsening of the score (event date) was also required to show a meaningful worsening compared to baseline. The event date was defined as the first of these consecutive events. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Item Library 87 was used, which is scored from 0-100, with higher scores reflecting more symptoms.

The time to sustained patient-reported outcome (PRO) deterioration was calculated using all on-treatment assessment time points up to the Week 25 (Arm A \& Arm B - Idelalisib plus Rituximab) and up to Week 21 + Safety follow-up of up to 5 weeks (Arm B - Bendamustine plus Rituximab) assessment time point prior to disease progression., Baseline up to Week 25 (Arm A and Arm B - Idelalisib plus Rituximab) & Baseline up to Week 21 + Safety Follow-Up of up to 5 Weeks (Arm B - Bendamustine plus Rituximab)|Time to Worsening (TTW) of Physical Function, Time of worsening was defined as a change in score greater than the meaningful within-person change for worsening in score. Scores were furthermore required to be sustained. To meet the requirement for sustained change, the assessment following the first observation of a meaningful worsening of the score (event date) was also required to show a meaningful worsening compared to baseline. The event date was defined as the first of these consecutive events. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Item Library 87 was used, which is scored from 0-100, with higher scores reflecting more symptoms.

The time to sustained PRO deterioration was calculated using all on-treatment assessment time points up to the Week 25 (Arm A and IdelaR) and up to Week 21 + Safety follow-up (BR) assessment time point prior to disease progression., Baseline up to Week 25 (Arm A and Arm B - Idelalisib plus Rituximab) & Baseline up to Week 21 + Safety Follow-Up of up to 5 Weeks (Arm B - Bendamustine plus Rituximab)
This is a Phase 3 global, randomized, open-label study comparing LOXO-305 (Arm A) to investigator's choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab (Arm B) in CLL/SLL patients who have been treated with at least a covalent BTK inhibitor (BTKi). Patients may have discontinued the prior covalent BTKi due to disease progression (PD) or intolerance. Patients who have received venetoclax are eligible for the study. Eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B.
