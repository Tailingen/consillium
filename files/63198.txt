Efficacy and Safety of Romidepsin CHOP vs CHOP in Patients With Untreated Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
Primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of romidepsin when administered with CHOP versus CHOP alone in subjects with previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) assessed according to Response criteria for malignant lymphoma 1999 by a Response Adjudication Committee (RAC).
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Romidepsin + CHOP|DRUG: CHOP
The primary efficacy endpoint is Progression Free Survival, The primary efficacy endpoint is Progression Free Survival (PFS) using the response criteria for malignant lymphoma (1999) by a Response Adjudication Committee, 60 months
This is a randomized multi-center phase III study, to compare efficacy and safety of Ro-CHOP with standard CHOP regimen in patients with previously untreated, histologically proven PTCL. Given the nature of the experimental agent, this study is an open-label study. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive either (Arm A) cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) administered in 3 week cycles for 6 cycles \[22\] or (Arm B) romidepsin CHOP (Ro-CHOP) administered in 3 week cycles for 6 cycles. In the Ro-CHOP arm, romidepsin will be administered at a dose of 12 mg/mÂ² IV on day 1 and day 8 every 3 weeks. In this study, patients will advance through three phases of the study: screening phase, treatment phase and follow-up phase. Patients will receive study drug(s) for up to 6 cycles, or until unacceptable toxicity will develop or progression or voluntary withdrawal. Patients will be followed for survival until the earliest of either 80% of patients have died or 3 years from the last patient randomized. Three years after the primary analysis an update of the database will be done and a rerun of the analysis will be performed.
