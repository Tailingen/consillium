Evaluation of the Inflammation-based Index as a Predictive Marker of Clinical and Radiological Response in Patients Treated With Lu-177 Oxodotreotide for Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumour
This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the Inflammation Based Index (IBI) score as a marker for predicting clinical and radiological response in patients treated with Lu-177 oxodotreotide for inoperable or metastatic, progressive, grade 1 or 2 intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.

This IBI score will be assessed on the basis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin values, and will be defined as follows:

* IBI = 0: Low mortality risk (if CRP and serum albumin values are considered normal in the investigator's judgment).
* IBI \> 0, including: IBI = 1: Intermediate risk of mortality (if one of the two values is considered abnormal and clinically significant according to the investigator's judgment (either hypoalbuminemia or elevated CRP)); IBI = 2: High mortality risk (if both values are considered abnormal and clinically significant according to the investigator's judgment (hypoalbuminemia and elevated CRP)).

Patients were followed up for 36 months.

A total of 150 patients should be included in this study.
