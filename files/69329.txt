A Phase 1a/1b Study to Evaluate the Safety of EZN-4176, in Adult Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This study will evaluate an experimental drug called EZN-4176 to determine the anticancer effects when it is given to patients with an advanced form of prostate cancer called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Goals of this phase I study include finding out the dose of EZN-4176 that can be safely given without serious side effects and to determine the amount of EZN-4176 that should be given in future studies.
Prostatic Neoplasm
DRUG: EZN-4176
Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of EZN-4176 administered as a weekly 1-hour IV infusion., Evaluate incidence, severity and duration of adverse events using National Cancer Institute \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\], Version 4.0, during first cycle., 2012
Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of EZN-4176, Incidence, severity and duration of adverse events using National Cancer Institute \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\], Version 4.0, during all cycles; Objective response, as assessed per recommendations of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2)., 2013
This study will be conducted in two phases:

* Phase 1a will involve dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be determined on the basis of the results from the safety evaluation.
* Phase 1b will involve cohort expansion at one or more dose levels to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. The recommended Phase 2 dose, which may differ from the MTD, will be determined on the basis of results from safety, activity, and pharmacologic and correlative studies.
