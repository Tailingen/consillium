Prospectively Predict the Efficacy of Treatment of Gastrointestinal Tumors Based on Peripheral Multi-omics Liquid Biopsy
To vertify the function of EV-score on predicting \& monitoring immunotherapeutic outcomes of GC
Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Immunotherapy
DEVICE: EV-array
EV-Score, EV-Score was calculated by the expression level of four tumor-associated proteins on plasma EV, EV-Score was detected, analysis and reported at the baseline of the treatment.
Survival significance of EV-Score, Analysis patients' survival with different EV-Score., up to 3 years
Our previous work identified four plasma EV-derived proteins and combined them to generate a signature score that robustly predicting immunotherapeutic outcomes at baseline and dynamically monitoring disease progressions along with the whole treatment.

Hence in this stuty, we plan to recruit a prospective cohort to support our conclusions, and provide possible method to realize predicting and monitoring immunotherapeutic outcomes of GC.
