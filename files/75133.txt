Evaluation of PET-CT Scanner Performances to Detect Infra-centimetric Lesions in Patients With Cancer
Prospective, monocentric study aiming to evaluate the PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography) scanner performances to detect infra-centimetric lesions in two groups of patients with cancer and of different BMI (Body Mass Index) classes (BMI ≤ 25 and BMI \> 25).

For each patient, two consecutive PET-CT scanner will be performed using the "Discovery MI" and "Discovery IQ" PET-CT scanner systems.

Virtual lesions will then be created on images obtained. Images will be interpreted by two independent observers.

The study participation of each patient will be a maximum of 24 hours.
