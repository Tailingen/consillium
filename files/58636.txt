Efficacy and Safety of Idelalisib (GS-1101) in Combination With Rituximab for Previously Treated Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of idelalisib to rituximab on progression-free survival (PFS) in adults with previously treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).

An increased rate of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) among participants with front-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and early-line iNHL treated with idelalisib in combination with standard therapies was observed by the independent data monitoring committee (DMC) during regular review of 3 Gilead Phase 3 studies. Gilead reviewed the unblinded data and terminated this study in agreement with the DMC recommendation and in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Idelalisib
Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from randomization to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) disease progression or death from any cause. PFS was to be assessed by an independent review committee (IRC).
Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response or partial response (or very good partial response or minor response for participants with Waldenstrom's). ORR was to be assessed by an IRC.|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve â‰¥ 50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of index lesions. Lymph node response rate was to be assessed by an IRC.|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response. Complete response rate was to be assessed by an IRC.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause.
