Expanded Access Program for Epcoritamab
The purpose of this program is to provide investigational epcoritamab, an antibody also known as GEN3013 (DuoBody-CD3xCD20), in an expanded access setting for eligible patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) who have a high unmet medical need with no other treatment options. It is a requirement that patients do not qualify for an ongoing epcoritamab clinical program or are unable to participate due to logistical reasons.

Access to investigational epcoritamab can be requested by contacting preapprovalaccessprograms@genmab.com.
