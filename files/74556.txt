Avelumab in Combination With AVB-S6-500 in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of avelumab and AVB-S6-500 and see what effects (good and bad) this combination treatment has on patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Avelumab|DRUG: AVB-S6-500
Safety and Tolerability, To investigate the safety and tolerability of the study drug combination for Avelumab with AVB-S6-500, up to 2 years
Progression Free Survival, period from the time of patient enrollment until disease progression, death, or date of last contact or to the date of censoring (dropout, end of study or death), up to two years|Clinical Benefit Rate, proportion of patients with complete or partial response, or stable disease per RECIST 1.1 on treatment with avelumab and ABV-S6-500, up to two years|Duration of Response, defined as the period from the date of confirmed tumor response until disease progression, death, or date of last contact or to the date of censoring (dropout, end of study or death), up to two years|Overall Survival, the period from patient enrollment until death, or date of last contact or to the date of censoring (end of study), up to two years|Investigator assessed Objective Response Rate, To evaluate the antitumor efficacy of avelumab and AVB-S6-500 as measured by the objective response rate assessed by the investigator, up to 2 years
Patients will have tests and exams to see if they are eligible for the clinical trial. If found eligible, the patient will receive treatment with avelumab and AVB-S6-500 by vein once every two weeks.

This study has two parts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AVB-S6-500. If the patient is enrolled on the first dose level, the patient will be treated at a higher dose every two weeks with AVB-S6-500. If the patient is enrolled on the second dose level, the patient will be receive AVB-S6-500 only once a week at a lower dose. The patient would continue to receive avelumab twice weekly at the same dose.

Patients will receive the study treatment as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing or spreading and they are not having any unacceptable, bad side effects.

Patients will be monitored during treatment with tests and exams and after treatment completion for up to one year.
