Supplemental Screening for Women With Extremely Dense Breast Tissue: the DENSE-2 Trial
Women with extremely dense breasts (nearly all glandular and connective tissue, little fatty tissue) have a 3-6 times higher risk of breast cancer than women with very low breast density. Moreover, due to the masking effect of the dense tissue, any breast tumours present are more difficult to detect in these women. With the results of the DENSE trial, the investigators showed that among women with extremely dense breasts, a combination of MRI and mammography could detect tumours earlier than mammography only. As the implementation of MRI in the screening program induces considerable costs and capacity requirements, the Dutch Ministry of Health would like to investigate whether cheaper and acceptable alternatives can be implemented more easily. In the DENSE-2 study, proposed here, we will investigate contrast-enhanced mammography and an abbreviated form of MRI as alternatives, in a large-scale randomized trial, within the current population-based screening program.

Women with extremely dense breast tissue have a higher risk of developing breast cancer and at the same time, mammography has limited value for these women. Currently, these women are not offered supplemental screening. Therefore, the investigators of the DENSE-2 trial will study supplemental CEM and AB-MRI screening in women with extremely dense breast tissue within the population-based breast cancer screening program because these modalities are expected to have higher diagnostic accuracy than tomosynthesis and ultrasound. In addition, these modalities are expected to be less expensive and require less capacity than a full MRI protocol as examined in the DENSE trial. For both CEM and AB-MRI, no results are currently available from a prospective screening study. The DENSE-2 trial is a randomized controlled trial comparing two intervention arms (CEM \[intervention arm A\] and abbreviated MRI \[intervention arm B\]) each with mammography \[control arm C\].
