A Study to Examine the Safety of Different Doses of BG-68501 Given to Participants With Advanced-Stage Tumors
This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1a/1b study of BG-68501, a cyclin-dependent kinase-2 inhibitor (CDK2i), to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-68501 in participants with advanced, nonresectable, or metastatic solid tumors as monotherapy and in combination with fulvestrant with or without BGB-43395, a selective CDK4 inhibitor, in adults with hormone receptor positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC). The study will also identify a recommended dose for expansion (RDFE) for BG-68501 as monotherapy and in combination for subsequent disease directed studies.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation and safety expansion, including evaluation of food effect) and Part 2 (dose expansion).

Part 1: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 30 days after the last dose; approximately 6-12 months|Part 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) of BG-68501, MTD is defined as the highest dose evaluated for which estimated toxicity rate is the closest to the target toxicity rate. MAD is defined as the highest dose administered if MTD is not reached., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1: Recommended dose(s) for Expansion (RDFE) of BG-68501 monotherapy in participants with solid tumors, RDFE of BG-68501 alone will be determined based upon the MTD or MAD., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1: RDFE of BG-68501 in combination with fulvestrant and BGB-43395 in participants with HR+/HER2- BC, RDFE of BG-68501 in combination with fulvestrant and BGB-43395 will be determined based upon the MTD or MAD., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR and PR that is confirmed by repeat assessments, as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to approximately 20 months
Part 1: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR or PR. CR and PR that is confirmed by repeat assessments, as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 20 months|Part 2: Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory assessments., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 30 days after the last dose; approximately 6-12 months|Parts 1 and 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first confirmed objective response by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression after treatment initiation or death, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 20 months|Parts 1 and 2: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the treatment initiation to the first determination of overall response by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 20 months|Parts 1 and 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with the best overall response, of a CR, PR, and stable disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 20 months|Parts 1 and 2: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease lasting â‰¥ 24 weeks assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 20 months|Part 1: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) for BG-68501 and BGB-43395, 2 times in the first 2 months|Part 1: Observed plasma trough concentration (Ctrough) for BG-68501 and BGB-43395, 5 times in the first 2 months|Part 1: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for BG-68501 and BGB-43395, 2 times in the first 2 months|Part 1: Half-life (t1/2) for BG-68501 and BGB-43395, 2 times in the first 2 months|Part 2: Plasma concentrations for BG-68501 and BGB-43395, 5 times in approximately 3 months
