Pembrolizumab in Combination With Salvage Chemotherapy for First-relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
The aim of this trial is to develop an effective and well-tolerated regimen for treatment of r/r cHL by introducing the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab and adding it to well-established chemotherapy regimens (ICE, DHAP). Synergistic effects of conventional agents with checkpoint inhibition may facilitate a highly effective therapy with limited toxicity, which might eventually substitute the very toxic high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT).
