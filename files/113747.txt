A Safety and Efficacy Study of Bevacizumab, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin Compared to Avastin速 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BEV-III/2022 is a double-blind randomized multicenter clinical trial comparing efficacy of bevacizumab (manufactured by Mabscale, LLC) and paclitaxel plus carboplatin to Avastin速 and paclitaxel plus carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous NSCLC. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (manufactured by Mabscale, LLC) to Avastin速. Study includes pharmacokinetics assessment.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Objective Response Rate (ORR) at Week 18, Objective response rate was assigned for a subject if the subject displayed either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST version 1.1 at Week 18, as assessed by independent radiological review committee (IRC)., 18 weeks from randomisation
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent confirmed progression per RECIST version 1.1, or death (whichever occurred first), measured in weeks and months. For PFS assessment clinical progression (i.e., treatment discontinuation due to progression of disease) was also considered as an event., At week 18 and 42 from randomisation|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to subsequent death, measured in weeks and months., At week 18 and 42 from randomisation|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of responce was defined as the time from responce to treatment till progression or death., 48 weeks
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody currently being developed by Mabscale LLC, as a proposed biosimilar to Avastin速, which is approved as first line treatment in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. This randomized equivalence study is designed to meet the regulatory requirement for approval of a biosimilar product.
