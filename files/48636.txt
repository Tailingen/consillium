Usefulness of Smartphone Application for Improving Nutritional Status of Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Malnutrition of hospitalized patients is reported in the range of 20-60% according to the definition and assessment method of malnutrition.

In particular, the incidence of malnutrition in cancer patients is high up to 30-85%.

Gastrointestinal disease is related to the digestion and absorption of nutrition therefore malnutrition rate of those patients is relatively high. Careful management of nutrition support is needed.

Malnutrition causes dysfunction of the mesenteric membrane, immune function impairment, decreased function of major organs such as liver, kidney and heart and alteration in pharmacodynamics. It could also increase infection rate and complications of chemotherapy, delay recovery time, so that increase morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay.

Proper nutrition management reduces malnutrition prevalence and medical costs of hospitalized patient, therefore nutrition screening and evaluation is necessary. The recent spread of smartphones has made it easier to record and evaluate meals, which are used in the diet market for weight loss through meal records and feedback based on smartphone applications. This approach is also expected to benefit patients with gastrointestinal cancer, where proper nutrition and feedback are important. In particular, pancreatic cancer, the worst intractable cancer of mankind, is digestive cancer with the most severe muscle mass reduction and nutritional deterioration after diagnosis.

PG-SGA(Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment), A patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) for oncology patients has been developed by Ottery. This tool has two sections-a medical history section that is completed by the patient, and a physical assessment section that is completed by nursing, medical, or dietetic staff. The medical history section includes additional questions regarding the presence of oncology nutrition impact symptoms., 12 weeks|EORTC Questionnaires - Quality of Life, The European Organization for Research and Treatment(EORTC) questionnaire was designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of 5 multiitem scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning) and 9 single items(pain, fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life)., 12 weeks
Skeletal muscle index change, Cross-sectional skeletal muscle area (SMA, cm2) at this level is highly correlated with total body skeletal muscle mass. Adjustment of SMA for height2 results in skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm2/m2), a measure for relative muscle mass. Using skeletal muscle index change we evaluated sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer patients., 8 weeks
