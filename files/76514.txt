Longterm Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence-assisted Colonoscopy on Adenoma Recurrence
We hypothesize that AI-assisted colonoscopy can reduce post-colonoscopy neoplasia incidence after 3 years, over standard colonoscopy. Moreover, this protective effect may allow surveillance intervals to be lengthened, by modifying long-term outcome of high-risk subgroup.

Between April 2021 and July 2022, our group completed a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in Hong Kong. \[ENDOAID-TRAIN study; NCT04838951\] 856 subjects undergoing colonoscopies were randomized 1:1 to receive colonoscopies with CADe (ENDO-AID, Olympus Co., Japan) or standard colonoscopies (control). Our study proved that AI-assisted colonoscopies could increase the overall ADR, especially small-to-medium size adenomas. It remains questionable whether the increased detection and removal of these non-advanced adenomas can be translated into any sustained long-term benefit. The impact of this AI-driven intensive surveillance on general population and healthcare system is also largely unknown. In this research project, we aim to assess the long-term effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy on adenoma recurrence and PCCRC prevention, by conducting a real-world, prospective study with longitudinal extension from a randomized trial.
