High-density EEG in Neurological Disorders
The purpose of the study is to use a new method of high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) recording to map brain areas important for movement, sensation, language, emotion, and cognition.

This study will measure brain waves using high-density EEG. Participants will be asked wear a cap with electrodes attached to it. During the recording, participants may be asked to rest, sleep, or complete a task. The tasks involve viewing pictures, answering questions, speaking, or moving an arm or leg. Recordings generally last between 60-120 minutes.\*
