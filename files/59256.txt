A Study of Docetaxel Monotherapy or DOXIL and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the time to progression for the DOXIL and docetaxel combination therapy group was superior to that of the group treated with docetaxel monotherapy in participants with advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: DOXIL
Time to Progression, Time interval in months between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death due to progression, whichever occurred first., From date of randomization until date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, until approximately 485 events of disease progression or death were observed, as assessed approximately 15 months after the last patient was enrolled
Overall Survival, Time interval in months between the date of randomization and the participant's death from any cause., From the date of randomization until the participant's death from any cause, as assessed until approximately 485 death events were observed which is assessed approximately 25 months after the last patient was enrolled|Response Rate: Number of Participants in the Evaluable Population Who Achieved a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), Number of participants in the evaluable population who achieved a CR or PR as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions and PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Response was assessed by Computed Tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)., Up to 30 to 42 days after last dose of study medication
This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by a random order), active control (study medication will be compared with available standard care of treatment), parallel-group (each treatment group will be treated simultaneously at the same time and each participant only receives one treatment regimen as assigned), open-label (both the investigator and the participant know the intervention received by the participant), multicenter study designed to determine if women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who were previously treated with prior anthracycline therapy in the neoadjuvant (administration of treatment before surgery) or adjuvant setting (administration of treatment after surgery), and who also had a disease-free interval of at least 12 months since the end of their last cytotoxic therapy, would benefit from the addition of DOXIL to docetaxel therapy. Approximately 751 participants will be randomly assigned to either receive docetaxel monotherapy or DOXIL in combination with docetaxel therapy. Treatment is to continue until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related toxicity. Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse events which will be recorded from the first study related procedure until 30 days after the last dose of medication; clinical laboratory tests and tests for cardiac function (multiple gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram and electrocardiogram) which will be monitored throughout the study.
