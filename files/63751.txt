The Effects of Neoadjuvant Tislelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced MSS Rectal Cancer
This study aims to elucidate the effects of neoadjuvant Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced MSS rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer|Rectal Cancer Stage II|Rectal Cancer Stage III
DRUG: Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, the proportion of tumor regression grades 0 (TRG0, disappearance of tumor cells) in the pathological specimens of surgically resected tumors, 7days of postoperative pathological examination
Complete Clinical Response(cCR) rate, cCR:After non-surgical antitumor therapy, physical examination and auxiliary examination(CT and MRI ) found no local evidence of tumor residue., 5 days before surgery|3-year disease-free survival(DFS) rate, DFS:From date of the patient signs the informed consent form until the date of earliest occurrence of the patient's tumor recurrence or death, whichever came first.assessed up to 36 months.CT, MRI and colonoscopy were used to evaluate tumor recurrence., 36 months from date of the patient signs the informed consent form|3-year overall survival(OS) rate, OS:From the date of the patient signs the informed consent form until the date of the patient's death.assessed up to 36 months., 36 months from date of the patient signs the informed consent form|the rate of adverse events(AEs), Adverse events (NCI CTC AE 5.0) that occurred from the first day of chemotherapy to one day of treatment end (up to half a year)., From the first day of immunotherapy until 6 months after the end of treatment|the rate of immune-related adverse events(irAEs), Immune-related adverse events (NCCN irAEs (2021)) that occurred from the first day of immunotherapy to one day of treatment end (up to half a year)., From the first day of immunotherapy until 6 months after the end of treatment|the rate of R0 resection, the rate of a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed, 7 days of postoperative pathological examination|the rate of surgical complication during or after operation, From the day of surgery to 30 days after the operation, including intraoperative and postoperative complications(bleeding，anastomotic fistula，intestinal obstruction，Anastomotic stenosis，Surgical site infection（SSI），urinary retention，sexual dysfunction), From the day of surgery to 30 days after the operation|Retain anal proportions, The proportion of cases with anal retention in all patients undergoing surgery, immediately after the surgery|3-year local recurrence rate, From the date of the patient signs the informed consent form until the date of the local recurrence, assessed up to 36 months. CT, MRI and colonoscopy were used to evaluate local recurrence., 36 months from date of the patient signs the informed consent form
T lymphocyte, Cells with cellular immune function. The types and counts of T cells are analyzed using flow cytometry, 1-7 days before treatment, 1-7 days before surgery, 1 day after surgery, 3 months after surgery, and 6 months after surgery|Molecular pathological analysis of tumor tissue, Whole exome gene sequencing is performed on tumor specimens to analyze the gene status, Tumor tissue was obtained 1 month before treatment and analyzed 36 months after treatment
The standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer is neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Pelvic chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer reduces the risk of disease recurrence in the pelvis to less than 10% and has been standard care in North America since 1990.However, it is associated with short-term and long-term toxic effects that can adversely affect quality of life and physical function.

Immunogenic cell death will be enhanced by oxaliplatin-induced immunogenicity and combined with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies for neoadjuvant therapy. The study will conduct 2 or 4 cycles of Tislelizumab with Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine, followed by TME surgery. This study's primary endpoint is the proportion of pCR in the pathological specimens of surgically resected tumors.
