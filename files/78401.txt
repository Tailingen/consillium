The Safe Study of Routine Closure of Mesenteric Defects Versus Non-closure After Radical Gastrectomy
To compare the incidence of internal hernia, overall survival and short-term surgical safety of routine closure of the surgically created mesenteric defects versus non-closure for patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric or esophagogastric junction who underwent radical gastrectomy (D1+/D2 lymph node dissection).
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Closure of the mesenteric defects|PROCEDURE: Non-closure of the mesenteric defects
The incidence of internal hernia within 3 years after surgery, Internal hernia were identified by surgical exploration or abdominal computed tomography (CT) from surgical and medical records during the postoperative 3 years of follow-up., 3 years
The incidence of intraoperative complications, The intraoperative complications occur from the beginning of skin cutting to the completion of sewn skin, including surgical complications, anesthesia related complications and pneumoperitoneum related complications., up to 2 hours after surgery|Incidence of postoperative intestinal obstruction, Refers to the incidence of postoperative intestinal obstruction observed during follow-up period., 3 years|Overall survival at 3 years after surgery, The overall survival of patients with gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma are evaluated at 3 years after radical gastrectomy., 3 years
