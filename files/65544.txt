Effectiveness of Probiotics for the Prevention of Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Children with Leukemia
Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common malignant neoplasm in children. Although chemotherapy achieves remission in over 70% of cases, it can cause gastrointestinal toxicity in up to 32.5%. Some studies suggest that administering probiotics reduces this risk, but the evidence remains inconsistent.

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administering L. casei, L. rhamnosus or B. bifidum compared to a placebo for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity, decreased intestinal permeability, and changes in intestinal microbiota in pediatric patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy.

Methods: A total of 120 participants aged 6 to 17 years, diagnosed with ALL and receiving consolidation phase chemotherapy without gastrointestinal comorbidities, will be included. Participants will be administered daily 2 capsules containing either 1) L. casei, 2) L. rhamnosus, 3) B. bifidum or 4) placebo daily for 8 weeks. The clinical status of the participants will be evaluated weekly by the oncology service to determine the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity and adverse events. Changes in intestinal permeability will be assessed by measuring beta-lactoglobulin in a blood sample using the ELISA technique, while changes in the intestinal microbiota will be analyzed by genomic sequencing at baseline and at the end of follow-up.

Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis will use measures of central tendency and dispersion. For quantitative variables, the mean and standard deviation or median with minimum and maximum values will be calculated depending on the distribution type. Frequencies and proportions will be calculated for qualitative variables, presented in tabular and graphical form. To compare the quantitative variables between the four interventions, a multi-way ANOVA test will be used.

The risk of gastrointestinal toxicity and adverse events will be analyzed by calculating the relative risk and 95% confidence interval. Differences between the interventions will be analyzed using survival analysis with the Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank tests. Sequencing data will be analyzed using the Qiime2 program, filtered to generate a phylogenetic tree using the Silva database. Corresponding plots will be generated for each taxonomic level. Alpha (intra-group) and Beta (inter-group) diversity will be presented by ordination plots using principal component analysis with the ANCOM program

Background Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells. It is the most common neoplasm in children, representing up to 53.1% of all oncologic processes in Mexico \[1-6\]. Fortunately, with the current chemotherapeutic treatments, disease remission is achieved in 98% of cases; however, the chemotherapeutic treatments have side effects that can lead to gastrointestinal toxicity (7.7 to 32.5%), which is associated with up to 50% mortality.

Among the most common gastrointestinal manifestations resulting from this toxicity are mucositis, pancreatitis (2 to 8%), diarrhea (10 to 82%), and colitis associated with decreased Bacillus spp and Bidifobacterium spp, increasing the risk of necrosis and intestinal perforation of the terminal ileum and cecum. Hence, several studies have been conducted to identify agents that can reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity like as probiotics which are a group of saprophytic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa) that live in equilibrium on the skin and mucous membranes, mainly in the intestine, have garnered attention.

Probiotics are known to have several beneficial functions such as promoting the absorption of carbohydrates, short-chain fatty acids and calcium; facilitating the synthesis of lipids and vitamins; modulate and reduce the concentration of inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa; improve mucosal blood flow, thus reducing the risk of ischemic areas in the intestine; and strengthen the immune system.

Although research has been conducted on the use of probiotics to prevent or reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy, the results are still inconclusive because the effect of probiotics has been analyzed in multiple combinations, which makes it difficult to distinguish the specific effects per phylum. This complicates the generation of standardized therapeutic schemes to improve the quality of care of these patients. If this project successfully identifies the effectiveness and safety of these probiotics, it will enable to development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the quality of healthcare for these patients, reducing the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complications secondary to the administration of chemotherapy.

Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum compared to placebo in reducing the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, decreasing intestinal permeability, and changing intestinal microbiota without the development of adverse effects in pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL receiving consolidation chemotherapy in the Oncology Service of the Instituto Nacional de Pediatría.

6. Clinical Evaluation:

   - Weekly clinical evaluations will be conducted for mucositis, diarrhea, colitis, flatulence, abdominal distention, and constipation, graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale (V 4.02) \[39\]. If necessary, the pediatric oncologist will initiate treatment according to the Oncology service plan.
7. Data Collection:

   * If antibiotics are required or the chemotherapy consolidation phase is completed, participants will be eliminated from the study, and final assessments will be conducted.
   * Data from weekly clinical evaluations, nutritional assessments, and study follow-ups will be recorded in a data collection form (Appendix 8) and entered an electronic Excel database for statistical analysis using STATA 18 by a blinded researcher.

The sample size was calculated based on data from the study by Reyna-Figueroa, which reported a 0% incidence of diarrhea during the administration L. rhamnosus compared to 10% in participants who did not receive probiotics. Using the formula for proportions, with an alpha error of 0.05, 80% power, and estimating a loss rate of 20%, a sample size of 30 participants was determined for each of the four groups.

Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis will be performed using measures of central tendency to understand the characteristics of the studied sample and to determine the type of distribution of each variable using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff normality test. For quantitative variables, the mean and standard deviation or median with minimum and maximum values will be calculated, depending on the type of distribution and summarized in tabular form; and data graphically represented by boxplot or bars chats as appropriate.

To compare the quantitative variables between the four interventions, a multi-way ANOVA test will be used. For qualitative variables, the chi-squared test will be used to compare the groups, adjusting for the nutritional status of the participants.

The risk of gastrointestinal toxicity and adverse events will be analyzed by the relative risk or Peto's odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Differences between the interventions will be analyzed using survival analysis with the Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank tests. Sequencing data will be analyzed using the Qiime2 program, filtered to generate a phylogenetic tree using the Silva database. Corresponding plots will be generated for each taxonomic level. Alpha (intra-group) and Beta (inter-group) diversity will be presented by ordination plots using principal component analysis with the ANCOM program.

Noted that patients who drop out of the study will have their results analyzed up to their last record, and all analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.
