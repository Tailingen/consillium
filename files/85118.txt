Promoting Weight Loss Through Diet and Exercise in Overweight Women With Breast Cancer
The investigators aim to evaluate the effect of a 6-month intervention (counseling) focused on weight loss in a group of overweight or obese women previously treated for early breast cancer. Intervention is designed to improve adherence to a healthy diet or/and to increase physical activity and decrease sedentary time, taking advantage of a pedometer-like device.

Body weight reduction, weight loss â‰¥5% of the baseline body weight via calibrated scales, stadiometer, baseline - 6 month
Long-term body weight control, long-term weight control or maintenance via calibrated scales, stadiometer, baseline - 12 month - 24 month|Pedometer Step Count, change in total step count via pedometer device with electronic data transmission, baseline - 6 month - 12 month - 24 month|Physical activity level, change in physical activity and inactivity levels via IPAQ-International physical activity questionnaire, baseline - 6 month - 12 month - 24 month|Dietary intake, change in dietary intake via Food Frequency Questionnaire, baseline - 6 month - 24 month|Quality of life, change in quality of life via Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), baseline - 6 month - 12 month - 24 month|Mood, change in mood via State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaires, baseline - 6 month - 12 month - 24 month|Lipid Marker Change, change in LDL, HDL, triglycerides and cholesterol assessed by blood samples, baseline - 6 month - 24 month|Oestradiol level, change in oestradiol assessed by blood samples, baseline - 6 month - 24 month|Insulin level, change in insulin assessed by blood samples, baseline - 6 month - 24 month|Glucose level, change in glucose assessed by blood samples, baseline - 6 month - 24 month|C-reactive protein level, change in C-reactive protein assessed by blood samples, baseline - 6 month - 24 month
The InForma project is designed as a mono-institutional randomized controlled 4-arm parallel-group trial. Potential study participants will be recruited among all overweight or obese breast cancer patients previously treated at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). Potential study participants will be recruited after breast cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy and and/or radiation) will be completed. Study participants will be randomized to one of the 4 arms: DI - Dietary Intervention; PAI - Physical Activity Intervention; PADI - Physical Activity and Dietary Intervention; LII - Less Intensive Intervention. Enrolled patients will receive a 6-month intervention and will be followed until the end of the study period with two additional follow-up visits at 12- and 24-month. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention programme on body weight change in overweight or obese breast cancer patients.
