A First-in-human Study to Learn How Safe the Study Drug BAY2965501 is, Find the Best Dose (Single Drug & Combination), How it Affects the Body, What Maximum Amount Can be Given, How it Moves Into, Through and Out of the Body, How it Acts on Different Tumors in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced solid tumors. Advanced solid tumors are types of cancer that may have spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, and/or to distant parts of the body and that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments. This study focuses on certain types of skin cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer. The study treatment BAY2965501 is currently under development as monotherapy or in combination for the treatment of people with advanced solid tumors. BAY2965501 blocks an enzyme in T-cells to activate them. T-cells are a type of immune cell that are known to have an anti-cancer effect and BAY2965501 is a potential new immunotherapy. The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn: • how safe different doses of BAY2965501 are when given as a single drug or in combination, • the degree to which medical problems caused by BAY2965501 when given as a single drug or in combination, can be tolerated (also called tolerability), • what maximum amount can be given as a single drug or in combination, and • how it moves into, through and out of the body as a single drug or in combination. To answer this, researchers will look at: • the number and severity of medical problems participants have after taking BAY2965501 as a single drug or in combination for each dose level. These medical problems are also referred to as adverse events. • the (average) total level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called AUC) after intake of single and multiple doses • the (average) highest level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called Cmax) after intake of single and multiple doses Doctors keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study, even if they do not think the medical problem might be related to the study treatment. In addition, the researchers want to know if and how the participants' tumors change after taking BAY2965501. The study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part. For this, participants will be assigned to receive one of the planned doses and schedules of BAY2965501 as single drug or participants will be assigned to one of the increasing doses of BAY2965501 in combination with 200mg pembrolizumab. Additionally, platinum based chemotherapy as decided by the treating investigator will be given within the first months (at minimum 2 cycles and up to 6 cycles maximum). Here participants will receive BAY 2965501 in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum based chemotherapy.

All participants will take BAY2965501 by mouth. Additionally, in combination group 1, pembrozilumab will be given as infusion using a small tube that goes into your vein. In combination group 2, pembrolizumab and platinum based chemotherapy will be given as infusion using a small tube that goes into your vein.

In the second part, called dose expansion, all participants in the single drug group will receive up to 2 of the most appropriate doses of BAY2965501 from the 1st part as tablet by mouth. The participants in the combination groups (group 1: + pembrozilumab; group 2: + pembrolizumab and platinum based chemotherapy) will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY2965501 from the first part. Participants in both parts of the study, will take the study treatment until the tumor gets worse (also known as 'disease progression'), or until the participants have medical problems. In general, the study treatment is planned for a maximum of 35 cycles. Each participant will be in the study for several months, including a screening phase of up to 28 days, few months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase after the end of treatment. Participants in part two will be assigned to one of 3 groups depending on cancer characteristics.During the study, the study team will: • take blood and urine samples • do physical examinations • check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature • examine heart health using ECG (electrocardiogram) • check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and, if needed, bone scan • take tumor samples (if required) The treatment period ends with a visit no later than 7 days after the last BAY2965501 dose in the single drug and combination group. About 30 and 90 days after the last dose and every 12 weeks thereafter, the study team will check the participants' health and any changes in cancer. This follow-up period ends with worsening of the cancer, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or until the participant leaves the study.
