Discovering Patterns in Experiences of Patients in Esophageal Cancer Clinical Research
Participation in clinical trials usually favors a particular demographic group. But there is limited research available to explain what study attributes affect the completion of these specific demographic groups.

This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of esophageal cancer treatments. The focus will be on tracking the rates of completion and withdrawal among these individuals.

It will also try to analyze data from the perspective of different demographic groups to check for recurring trends which might yield insights for the sake of future esophageal cancer research.
