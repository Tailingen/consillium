Using Test of SCM for Detection Breast Cancer
In our previous research, we have shown that women that have breast cancer have a population of lymphocytes that recognizes specific antigen and there cytoplasmic matrix goes through physical change a short time after exposure in vitro to the same antigen. This change can be measured by polarization changes of fluorescent light emitted by FDA (fluorescein diacetate) labeled cells. Further test that we performed showed that those differences are also shown in a benign situation that known as indicator for a high risk for developing breast cancer within 10-15 years. The incidence of the expression of these lymphocytes correlates with the histopathological picture as it is related in high risk for the developing the disease.

In this work we will expand the scope of the procedure to early detection of the cancerous process in breast lesions by Fitzgibbon's risk categories for the development invasive carcinoma of the breast. In the proposed work we intend to use specific antigen MUC1 for breast cancer. This study is a continuation of our published work in the "The Breast "
