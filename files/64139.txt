Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Compared With Standard Therapy in Treating Chronic Arm Lymphedema in Patients Who Have Undergone Radiation Therapy for Cancer
RATIONALE: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be effective in repairing damaged tissue and reducing lymphedema caused by radiation therapy for cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying hyperbaric oxygen to see how well it works compared to standard therapy in treating chronic arm lymphedema in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for cancer.
Breast Cancer|Lymphedema|Perioperative/Postoperative Complications|Radiation Fibrosis
DRUG: hyperbaric oxygen
Volume of the affected limb, expressed as a percentage of the contralateral limb Volume on the day of measurement, as measured by perometer 12 months after baseline assessment
Patient self-assessments, using specific quality of life scale in upper limb lymphoedema and the UK SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire, at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after baseline assessment|99Tc-nanocolloid clearance rate as measured by quantitative lymphoscintigraphy 12 months after baseline assessment|Extracellular water content as measured by EdemaMeter (bioimpedance measurements) 12 months after baseline assessment
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy vs standard management, in terms of reduction of lymphedema, in patients with chronic arm lymphedema after radiotherapy for cancer.

Secondary

* Determine the mechanisms of tissue reperfusion and healing in patients treated with HBO therapy.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy over 90 minutes 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
* Arm II: Patients receive standard management. Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients (42 for arm I and 21 for arm II) will be accrued for this study.
