MTD Determination, Safety and Efficacy of the Decitabine-Genistein Drug Combination in Advanced Solid Tumors and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal neoplasias in the world. Currently used chemotherapy regimens have been disappointing in improving overall survival. Decitabine is a S-phase pyrimidine analog that induces DNA hypomethylation. This drug is currently used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS) and has been studied for the treatment of leukemia. Genistein, is a soy extracted non-toxic isoflavone and phytoestrogen, which has been shown to inhibit activity of cell signaling pathways, such as those driven by tyrosine kinases. Results from in vitro experiments unambiguously demonstrated that the combination of these two compounds induces a synergistic reduction of the multiplication of lung, colon, breast and leukemic cancer cells. Consequently, clinical evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC), and it is hypothezised that this new regimen will safely improve overall tumor response rate and cancer progression free survival.

The proposed trial is a two part study: The phase I part is an open-label, dose-escalation evaluation in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed standard therapies and for whom no curative therapeutic option exists.

A cohort of three subjects will be treated per dose level. One cycle is 28 days. Five different, increasing dose levels ranging from 60 mg/m2 to 500 mg/m2 of IV decitabine combined with a fixed oral dose of 150 mg BID of genistein will be tested. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined based on the occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).

In the phase IIa part of the study, only Stage IIIb and IV advanced NSCLC patients will be treated at the recommended decitabine MTD dose combined with genistein. Safety and preliminary efficacy will be assessed. It is expected that a maximum sample of 46 patients will be enrolled in this trial.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: decitabine in combination with genistein
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD determination will based on the incidence of reported adverse events (including dose-limiting toxicities) and abnormal laboratory test results., 28 day treatment cycle for MTD assessment; 4-6 cycles to be administered
To determine the drug plasma concentrations of decitabine and genistein., Plasma drug levels will be used to obtain preliminary PK profile. Up to 11 blood samples to be obtained from each enrolled patient, over several cycles., Up to 6 , 28 day treatment cycles|Preliminary clinical efficacy assessment, Preliminary efficacy of the investigational regimen will include the assessment of Overall Response Rate ( ORR) and Progression Free Survival(PFS), Up to 6, 28 day treatment cycles
