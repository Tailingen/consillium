Study of Zanzalintinib (XL092) + AB521 and Zanzalintinib + AB521 + Nivolumab in Participants With Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) or Other Advanced Solid Tumors (STELLAR-009)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of zanzalintinib in combination with AB521 (doublet) and in combination with AB521 plus nivolumab (triplet) in participants with advanced ccRCC or other advanced solid tumors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The recommended doses (RDs)
* The safety and tolerability
* The PK and the preliminary efficacy
