Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) Capsule for Improving the Efficacy of Anti- PD-1
To determine whether the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) capsule can help reverse the resistance of anti-PD-(L)1 treatment in Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients.
Gastrointestinal System Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: FMT capsule
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of subjects with objective responses (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) divided by total number of subjects, per iRECIST., 14 weeks|The number of adverse events, The number of adverse events that is related to FMT prior to the first anti-PD-1 immunotherapy treatment., 1 week|Rate of abnormal vital signs and laboratory test results, Rate of abnormal vital signs and laboratory test results that are determined to be clinically significant prior to the first anti-PD-1 immunotherapy treatment., 1 week
Change in T-cells Composition, Compare the changes in CD8+PD-1+T cells, Ki67+CD8+ T cells before and after treatment between response subjects and non-response subjects (evaluated by iRECIST)., 14 weeks|Function of T-cells, Compare the changes in cells expressing IFN-Î³ before and after treatment between response subjects and non-response subjects (per iRECIST)., 14 weeks|Association of anti-PD-1 response with gut microbiota, Compare the changes in bacterial abundance and bacterial diversity before and after treatment between response subjects and non-response subjects (per iRECIST)., 14 weeks|Rate of abnormal vital signs, physical examination results, 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory test results, Rate of abnormal vital signs, physical examination results, 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory test results that are determined to be clinically significant from the beginning of the first anti-PD-1 immunotherapy treatment to the end of study., 14 weeks|Change in subsets of specific and non-specific immune system, Compare the changes in T-cell receptor diversity (quantified by immune repertoire sequencing analyses), CD8+CCR7+CD45RA+T cells, CD4+CCR7+CD45RA+ T cells ,CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells,CD56+NK cells and CD68+ cells before and after treatment between response subjects and non-response subjects (evaluated by iRECIST)., 14 weeks|The number of adverse events, The number of adverse events from the beginning of the first anti-PD-1 immunotherapy treatment to the end of study, 14 weeks
This study is designed to improve the response rate of anti-PD-(L)1 among patients with anti-PD-(L)1 resistant/refractory digestive (including gullet, stomach and intestine) system cancers through the intervention on their gut microbiota. Healthy people who have the gut microbiota profile similar to the responders of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy will be identified. The gut microbiota of these healthy people will be extracted to product FMT capsule. Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients who failed anti-PD-(L)1 treatment will be administrated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy combined with FMT. The enrolled subjects will firstly receive 1-week of FMT therapy. Subsequently, each anti-PD-1 treatment will be combined with the maintenance dose of FMT capsules to ensure the efficiency of gut microbiota colonization. Each subject will receive anti-PD-1 therapy for 6 cycles. After the completion of both 3 and 6 cycles of therapy, safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted. The subjects who complete 3 cycles of treatment but are clinically evaluated as disease progression will not continue to the following 3 cycles of treatment.
