A Dose Escalation Study in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose and thus the recommended phase II dose and schedule of the compound and characterize the safety.
Advanced Solid Tumors With Alterations of FGFR1, 2 and or 3|Squamous Lung Cancer With FGFR1 Amplification|Bladder Cancer With FGFR3 Mutation or Fusion|Advanced Solid Tumors With FGFR1 Amplication|Advanced Solid Tumors With FGFR2 Amplication|Advanced Solid Tumors With FGFR3 Mutation
DRUG: BGJ398
Incidence rate and category of dose-limiting toxicities will be tabulated for patients included in the dose escalation portion of the study, to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD), Incidence rate and category of dose-limiting toxicities will be tabulated for patients included in the dose escalation portion of the study, to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD). This will be calculated using an established statistical model, based on incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory parameters, 23 months
To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of BGJ398 for patients in expansion Arm 4 (previously treated patients with advanced/metastatic UCC with FGFR3 gene alterations), overall response rate (ORR), as assessed by investigator per RECIST v 1.0; overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR) and disease control rate (DCR) will be assessed, 23 months|To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of oral BGJ398, Time vs. concentration profiles, PK parameters of BGJ398 and known active metabolite(s)., 23 months|To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of the drug., Pre- vs. post treatment serial changes in FGF23 plasma levels (not done for patients enrolled to expansion Arm 4), 23 months|Assess preliminary anti-tumor activity for patients not in Arm 4., Overall tumor response rate (ORR) and PFS assessed by investigator per RECIST, 23 months
The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose and thus the recommended phase II dose and schedule of the compound and characterize the safety.
