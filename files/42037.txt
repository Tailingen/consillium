Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive investigational product (ABP 206 or nivolumab).

All subjects will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal of consent for a maximum of 24 months of treatment.

The total duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 26 months.
