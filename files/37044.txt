LCAR-B4822M-02 Cells in Treating Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Multiple Myeloma
This is a single arm, open-label, phase 1 study, to determine the safety and efficacy of LCAR-B4822M CAR-T cells in treating patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (r/r MM).

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a usually incurable malignancy of plasma cells. Current therapies for multiple myeloma often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse, there is an unmet clinical needs for these patients. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein expressed by normal plasma cells and the malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma, and it was supposed to be a promising target for r/r MM.
