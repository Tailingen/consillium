Phase 1/2 Study Evaluating MCLA-129, a Human Anti-EGFR, Anti-c-MET Bispecific Antibody, in Advanced NSCLC and Other Solid Tumors, Alone and in Combination
A phase 1/2 open-label multicenter study will be performed with an initial dose escalation part to determine the MTD and/or the RP2D of MCLA-129 in monotherapy or in combination in patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, GC/GEJ, ESCC, or other solid tumors and who are treatment naïve or have progressed after receiving prior therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.
