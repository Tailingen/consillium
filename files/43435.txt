Should Colorectal Cancer Patients be Followed After Five Years? Study of Recurrence in a Population Cohort
The results of this study will make it possible, thanks to better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer, to define new treatment and surveillance strategies for colorectal cancers resected with curative intent, so as to improve management and thus improve patient survival.

These data will also make it possible to calculate the prevalence of patients who require treatment or surveillance because of their disease.
