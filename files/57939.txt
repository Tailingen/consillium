Oral HYCAMTIN Plus Whole Brain Radiation Therapy In Treatment Of Brain Metastases Resulting From Non-Small Lung Cancer
The current prognosis for patients with metastatic brain cancer from NSCLC is very poor. The current standard treatment for this disease is radiation therapy to the brain. The goal of the current study is to test whether the combination of orally administered HYCAMTIN capsules and whole brain radiation therapy will prolong the survival time of patients with this potentially serious condition.
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
DRUG: HYCAMTIN, oral capsules|RADIATION: Radiation
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause. The date of last contact was used for those participants who had not died or were lost to follow-up. These participants were classified as having been censored., From the time of Randomization until the date of death due to any cause (up to 195 weeks)
Six-month Survival, Six-month survival is defined as the percentage of participants alive at 6 months following randomization. The date of last contact was used for those participants who had not died or were lost to follow-up. These participants were classified as having been censored., Month 6|Number of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR) (Central Nervous System [CNS]-Radiologic), The number of participants achieving either a CR or PR, per World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria, in the CNS was assessed. CR is defined as the complete disappearance of all known measurable (Must be accurately measured in \>=1 dimension) and nonmeasurable disease, without clinical, laboratory, or radiological evidence of recurrence for at least 4 weeks. CR may have been defined in participants with measurable and/or non-measurable disease at Screening. PR is defined as at least a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest length and perpendicular width of all measurable disease with no clear increase in nonmeasurable disease in participants without measurable disease. In both cases, there must have been no appearance of new disease, and no clinical, laboratory, or radiological evidence of disease progression for at least 4 weeks. Assessment of response was performed by the investigator and was based on unconfirmed responses., From the time of Randomization until the time of CR or PR (up to 75 weeks)|Time to Response (TTR) (CNS-radiologic), TTR is defined as the time from Randomization until the first documented evidence of CR or PR in the CNS. CR is defined as the complete disappearance of all known measurable (Must be accurately measured in \>=1 dimension) and nonmeasurable disease, without clinical, laboratory, or radiological evidence of recurrence for at least 4 weeks. CR may have been defined in participants with measurable and/or non-measurable disease at Screening. PR is defined as at least a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest length and perpendicular width of all measurable disease with no clear increase in nonmeasurable disease in participants without measurable disease. In both cases, there must have been no appearance of new disease, and no clinical, laboratory, or radiological evidence of disease progression for at least 4 weeks. Assessment of response was performed by the investigator and was based on unconfirmed responses., From the time of Randomization until the first documented evidence of CR or PR (up to 75 weeks)|Time to Progression (TTP) (CNS-radiologic), TTP is defined as the time from Randomization until the first documented sign of disease progression in the CNS.

In both cases, determination of progression included the appearance of any new lesions, or signification worsening of conditions presumed to be related to malignancy. Participants with clinical or laboratory evidence of possible disease progression were to be evaluated radiologically. TTP was analyzed with censoring for extended loss to follow-up to account for two or more missed assessments before a TTP event.
