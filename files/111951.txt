Little Cigar and Cigarillo Warnings Among US Adults Who Use LCCs
The goal of this research is to assess whether little Cigars and cigarillos (LCC) warnings developed by the study team are more effective than the current warnings proposed by FDA for LCC products. A 3-week web-based randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants are adult persons who currently use LCCs.

In this study, LCC warnings on packs will be electronically presented to participants over time to determine if newly developed LCC warnings increase quit intentions compared to FDA-proposed text-only warnings and a control condition (in which participants do not see LCC packs or warnings.) A daily diary methodology will be employed to present LCC warnings on packs to participants over time. Qualtrics will contact, screen, consent, and administer the survey. To enroll participants, Qualtrics will screen participants using the inclusion criteria and measures and invite eligible participants to enroll in the study.

At the beginning of the baseline survey (day 0), participants will first consent to participate in the study and then complete a questionnaire about their tobacco use and behaviors (e.g., intentions and quit attempts) and other measures of interest. At the end of the baseline questionnaire, survey software will randomly assign participants to one of the 3 study conditions. The three study conditions are 1) Newly developed warnings with images (the six most effective warnings developed by the study team), 2) FDA-proposed text-only warnings, or 3) control condition in which participants will not receive an intervention (no warnings). Participants will be contacted via email each day (at approximately 6 am) to invite them to complete the survey for that day of the study protocol.

For subsequent days (days 1-6, 8-13, 15-20) participants will be contacted and asked to complete a daily survey which will assess their previous day use of LCCs, as well as cigarettes and e-cigarettes. During these daily surveys, participants assigned to condition 1 or 2 (i.e., the warning conditions) will view an image of a little cigar and cigarillo package with a warning according to the participant's condition. Participants within each warning condition will view a total of 6 different warnings over the course of 6 days each week, this will be repeated 3 times during the study, resulting in a total of 18 exposures. Participants will be required to view the warning for at least 5 seconds before answering questions.

On days 7 and 14 participants will be asked to complete a slightly longer survey with questions about their LCC behaviors including the number of LCCs used in the past week, the number of LCCs butted out because they wanted to smoke less, the number of LCCs forgone, other tobacco use, blunt use, and quit intentions and attempts.

For the post-test on day 21, participants will be asked to complete a longer questionnaire about their current tobacco use and behaviors including current LCC smoking behavior, LCC nicotine dependence, other tobacco product (OTP) use, LCC and OTP quit intentions, and LCC and O
