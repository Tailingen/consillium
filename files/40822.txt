Chemoembolization of Non-resectable Non-metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Embolization Microspheres
Chemoembolization is a recognized treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

* classical chemoembolization consists in injecting an emulsion of an anticancer agent in Lipiodol® via the hepatic artery
* doxorubicin, an anthracycline, is the most frequently used drug in lipiodol chemoembolization (LCE)
* however, less than half of HCC respond favourably to classical lipiodol chemoembolization (LCE) with doxorubicin/Lipiodol®

In this trial, we propose to introduce in clinical practice a strategy based on idarubicin to achieve a more effective antitumor effect for the following reasons, recently pointed out by our team:

* idarubicin is an anthracycline that penetrates tumour cells more quickly and is more cytotoxic than doxorubicin on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines
* idarubicin is injected in a solution of embolization microspheres of a diameter of (300-500µm), which all the progressive and controlled release of the anticancer drug, whereas the doxorubicin/Lipiodol® emulsion is unstable
Localized Non-Resectable Adult Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: blood samples (5 ml) will be taken|RADIATION: Chemoembolization
Tolerance: toxicities will be defined according to the scale: National Cancer Institute - Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC AE v3.0) to determine the limiting dose, Patients will be hospitalized for 3 days starting from the date of the chemoembolization and will then be followed regularly for 2 months from the date of the chemoembolization (clinical, biological and radiological surveillance)., total duration of participation for a patient: 2 months
