Principal Investigators:

The principal investigators (PIs) will be transplant physicians at all participating U.S. transplant centers.

Study Design:

This study is an access and distribution protocol for unlicensed cryopreserved cord blood units (CBUs) in pediatric and adult patients with hematologic malignancies and other indications.

Primary Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to examine the incidence of neutrophil recovery of ≥500/mm3 after cord blood transplantation in a multi-institution setting using CBUs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed.

Secondary Objectives:

In patients receiving a non-licensed CBU:

* Assess incidence of transmission of infection
* Assess incidence of serious infusion reaction
* Determine 1 year overall survival after cord blood transplantation
* Assess cumulative incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and grades III to IV
* Assess cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD
* Determine platelet engraftment of \>20,000 mcL and \>50,000 mcL
