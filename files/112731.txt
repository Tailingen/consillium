Prospective Evaluation of the Resection Margins and the Ganglionic Status Using a Quality Standard Resection for Adenocarcinoma of the Head of the Pancreas
This multicentric prospective study evaluates the role of the margins resection and the ganglionic status when using a quality standard for the resection of adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.
Pancreas|Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: resection of adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas
Prognostic value of the invasion of the margins measured in millimetres on the overall survival, 4 years
Relapse free survival: time between surgery and relapse or a right censure. The relapse is determined by clinical examination, biologic examination and imaging, which reveals metastasis or an isolated local relapse, 4 years
Primary objective:

* Evaluation of the prognosis role of the invasion of the margins on the overall survival after a standard resection of adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

Secondary objectives:

* Evaluation of the prognosis role of the invasion:

  * Of margins on the overall survival.
  * Of each margins (distal pancreatic margin, gastric, posterior, retro-venous, retro-arterial) on the overall survival.
  * Of the ganglionic group of the superior mesenteric artery and the other nodes.
