Virtual Ileostomy Versus Conventional Loop Ileostomy
This study aimed at comparing the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), readmission rates, postoperative hospitalization days, duration of bearing the stoma (months), hospitalization costs, the number of hospitalizations with ghost ileostomy versus conventional loop ileostomy after low anterior resection for rectal cancer.
Rectal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Virtual ileostomy|PROCEDURE: Diverting ileostomy
Calculation postoperative of the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) for each patient, The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)summarises all postoperative complications based on the established Clavien-Dindo classification (ranging from mild complications not leading to a deviation from the normal clinical course (grade I) up to postoperative death (grade V)) at an individual patient level according to their grade of severity., An average of 1 year from the date of low anterior resection for rectal cancer until the date of when the patient's condition is stabilized without complications
Postoperative hospitalization days, Patients in the virtual stoma group who did not have a second surgery due to complications recorded days of postoperative hospitalization after low anterior resection for rectal cancer, if the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record days of postoperative hospitalization due to complications and/or reoperation since the data of low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Readmission rates, Patients in the virtual stoma group who did not have a second surgery due to complications recorded the number of hospitalization after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. If the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the number of hospitalization due to complications and/or reoperation since the data of low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|The number of hospitalizations, Patients in the virtual stoma group who did not have a second surgery due to complications recorded the number of hospitalization after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. If the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the number of hospitalization due to complications and/or reoperation since the data of low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of bearing the stoma (months), If the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the duration of bearing the stoma since the data of surgery of diverting ileostomy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|First hospitalization costs, Patient hospitalization costs for radical resection of rectal cancer., During hospitalization,approximately 7 days|Total hospitalization costs, Patients in the virtual stoma group who did not have a second surgery due to complications recorded the costs after low anterior resection for rectal cancer, if the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the costs due to complications and reoperation since the data of low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Whether patients undergo terminal ostomy after low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Hartmann's procedure or for example, abdominoperineal extirpation, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Patients with stoma (terminal/loop) at 6 months after initial surgery, Patients carrying stoma 6 months after low anterior resection for rectal cancer., 6 months from the date of low anterior resection for rectal cancer|The number of participants with virtual ileostomy converted to diverting ileostomy, The virtual stoma required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|The number of patients who required secondary abdominal surgery under general anesthesia due to complications, Patient undergoes second abdominal surgery for complications after first surgery, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Ghost ileostomy remove time, Duration of days from the date of radical resection of rectal cancer to virtual stoma removed., During hospitalization,approximately 7 days|The number of patients with complications after low anterior resection for rectal cancer, Abdominal abscess,Anastomotic bleeding,Pelvic infection,Surgical incision infection, Peritonitis,Interventional drainage ,ileostomy wounds/abscesses/edema/dermatitis/ ulcers,Parastomal hernia ,Stoma prolapse,Anastomotic separation/poor healing, Anastomotic stenosis,Anastomotic leakage,Bowel obstruction,Anastomotic bowel necrosis ,Wound dehiscence / bleeding / sinus tract / abscess/fat liquefaction,Acute kidney injury ,Dehydration/output \>1500 mL/day,Converted to permanent ileostomy,Intestinal fistula,Incisional hernia ,fecal incontinence., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients after low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Whether the patient has completed chemotherapy., 6 months from the date of low anterior resection for rectal cancer
Diverting ileostomy (DI) is a common procedure performed in patients undergoing low anterior resection for rectal cancer to protect the anastomosis and reduce the risk of complications. Although DI remains one of the most common methods used in clinical practice to prevent anastomotic leakage, there is still considerable debate in clinical practice about whether to perform a routine ileostomy. Despite temporary ileostomy fecal diversion can reduce the development of abdominal abscesses, wound inflammation, peritonitis, and sepsis after the occurrence of AL, however, it not only failed to reduce the incidence of AL but significantly increased the risk of non-elective readmissions and reinterventions as well as higher total costs. Meanwhile, stoma significantly increase the risk of stoma-related complication such as small bowel obstruction, postoperative ileus, dehydration from high-output stoma culminating in acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalance, stoma stenosis/ necrosis, parastomal hernia, peristomal abscess, and fistula, etc.
