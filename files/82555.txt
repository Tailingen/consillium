RITUAL Ultivision AI CADe Randomized Controlled Trial
Ultivision AI is a computer-assisted detection (CADe) device intended to aid endoscopists in the real-time identification of colonic mucosal lesions (such as polyps and adenomas).

Ultivision AI CADe is indicated for white light colonoscopy only.
Colon Adenoma|Polyp of Colon|Adenoma Colon
DEVICE: Ultivision AI
Adenoma per Colonoscopy (APC), Superiority of Ultivision-AI arm versus control arm. APC is defined as the total number of histologically confirmed adenomas resected divided by the total number of colonoscopies., During the procedure/surgery|Adenoma Per Extraction (APE)., Non inferiority of Ultivision-AI arm versus control arm. Where APE is the fraction of adenoma, sessile serrated lesions, and large (\>10mm) hyperplastic polyps of the proximal colon (caecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and transverse colon) out of total number of resections., During the procedure/surgery
Ultivision AI contains an image processing software and algorithm based on machine learning technology and convolutional neural networks (CNN).

The algorithm's primary function is to identify and highlight the likelihood of the presence of a colon polyp.
