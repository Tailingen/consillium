A Study of Comparing Huachansu Plus Thoracic RT Versus RT Alone For ESCC
This primary objective of the trial is to study whether the local control of Huachansu plus thoracic radiotherapy is better compared to thoracic radiotherapy alone for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. It's a phase II study, 134 patients are expected to be recruited into the trial.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Huachansu|RADIATION: thoracic radiation
Local control rate, The outcome measure will be assessed by every 3-month follow-up examinations., the date of randomization until progression inside the irradiation field, up to 3 years.
overall survival, The survival time from date of randomization to the day of death or the last follow-up., the date of randomization until the death or the last follow up of the patients, up to 3 years.|progress-free survival, Measured from date of randomization until progression or death from any cause, the date of randomization until progression or death from any cause, up to 3 years
