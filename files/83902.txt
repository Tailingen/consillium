CD19 Targeted CAR T Cell Therapy in Patients With Relapsed/ Refractory B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL)
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study (safety and dose escalation) of autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Relapsed B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)|Refractory B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR engineered autologous T-cells|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Mesna
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT) of CD19 CAR-T cells, Patients will be continually assessed for unexpected adverse events using the NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) or unexpected early mortality 30 days post-infusion.

The primary objectives for the Phase I study portion are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of treatment with CD19 CAR-T cells in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patient's â‰¤ 25 years of age, with relapsed/refractory CD19+ ALL., Within 30 days after the last dose of CD19 CAR-T cells
Number of patients who achieve complete morphological remission, Number of patients who achieve complete morphological remission (Complete Response (CR) or Complete Response with Incomplete count recovery (CRi) in the bone marrow), Within 30 days post CD19 CAR-T cells
In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, pediatric or adolescent/young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) will be enrolled.

Eligible patients will receive CAR T product intravenously as a single or split dose following pre-conditioning by a lymphodepleting chemotherapeutic regimen and will then enter a 30-day follow-up period to monitor adverse events using the NCI CTCAE (version 5.0).
