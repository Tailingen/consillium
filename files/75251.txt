Anlotinib Combined With Niraparib Dual Therapy in Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma.
According to the definition of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a less common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) . The preliminary trial ANNIE (NCT04376073) shows a promising efficacy and safety profile for the ANNIE combo (anlotinib+niraparib). There is limited progress in targeted therapy for those less common ovarian cancers. In this study (CC-ANNIE), we aim to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of niraparib combined with anlotinib in patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory OCCC.
Platinum-resistant Recurrent Clear Cell Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Niraparib|DRUG: Anlotinib
Objective response rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of niraparib in combination with anlotinib in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent or platinum-refractory clear cell ovarian cancer, as measured by the objective response rate (ORR), which is a combination of CR (complete response, the target lesion completely disappeared over 4 weeks) and PR (partial response, the target lesions were reduced by more than 30% for more than 4 weeks)., at 6 months
The frequency and severity of adverse events, The frequency and severity of adverse events and toxicity based upon CTCAE version 5.0 during subjects receiving the study treatment., Baseline through 1.5 year|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the first documentation of tumor progression, or to death due to any cause., at 12 months|Time to response, Time to response is defined as the time from date of enrollment to the date of first documented tumor response (CR or PR)., at 6 months|24 weeks clinical benefit rate, 24 weeks clinical benefit rate is defined as the rate of CR plus PR and stabel disease (SD)., at 24 weeks|Objective response rate of homologous recombination deficient group, The efficacy of administration of niraparib in combination with anlotinib in the homologous recombination deficient group., at 6 months
The CC-ANNIE trial is a single-arm, single-center, exploratory phase II trial. Eligible patients (≥18 \& ≤70 years) are histologically confirmed platinum-resistant recurrent OCCC and 20 subjects are planned to be enrolled. All subjects must have measurable lesions (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1) and are going to be treated with niraparib 200mg once daily, anlotinib 10mg on day 1-14 of each 21-day cycle thereafter until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate.
