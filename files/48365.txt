High Dose Sequential Therapy and Autologous Stem Cell Rescue for Multiple Myeloma
To assess the role of autologous hematopoietic cell rescue in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: high dose chemotherapy then autologous hematopoietic cell transplant
Toxicity and efficacy of sequentially administered high dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation, Patients will have a daily CBC with platelet count, and chemistries until engraftment, then as indicated clinically. Chest x-rays will be done weekly until engraftment, then as indicated clinically. Patients will be restaged for abnormal proteins (SPIE)
To assess the toxicity and efficacy of sequentially administered high dose cyclophosphamide and VP-16 followed by total body irradiation or BCNU and high dose mephalan and autologous stem cell rescue in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
