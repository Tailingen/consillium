Talazoparib and Temozolomide in Treating Younger Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Malignancies
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib and temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating younger patients with tumors that have not responded to previous treatment (refractory) or have come back (recurrent). Talazoparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving talazoparib together with temozolomide may work better in treating younger patients with refractory or recurrent malignancies.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of temozolomide when combined with a dose of talazoparib (BMN 673) given once daily for 5 days after a one day dose of BMN 673 administered orally (either once daily or twice daily), every 28 days to children with refractory or recurrent solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To define and describe the toxicities of BMN 673 given with temozolomide administered on this schedule. (Phase I) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BMN 673 and temozolomide when given in combination to children with refractory or recurrent cancer. (Phase I) IV. To define the antitumor activity of BMN 673 when given with temozolomide in recurrent/refractory Ewing sarcoma.(Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of BMN 673 and temozolomide in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors within the confines of a phase I study.

II. To explore possible predictive biomarkers in archival tumor tissue from Ewing sarcoma patients in Phase II.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-6 and temozolomide PO QD on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
