Endostar/PD-1 Inhibitors Combined With PP for Advanced NSCLC
A Controlled Clinical Study of Endostar/PD-1 Inhibitors Combined With chemotherapy(Carboplatin-Pemetrexed) as First-line Treatment for Advanced Non-squamous Cell Lung Cancer With Negative Driving Gene
Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: endostar/PD-1 inhibitor|DRUG: endostar
progression-free survival(PFS), progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of first document disease progression or death from any cause, approximately 36 months|overall survival (OS), overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, approximately 36 months
objective response rate(ORR), complete response(CR)+partial response(PR) according to RECIST 1.1, approximately 18 months|adverse event(AE), adverse event according to NCI CTCAE V4.0, approximately 36 months
This study was a controlled clinical trial.A total of 170 patients with pathologically confirmed non-squamous NSCLC would be enrolled.Patients were randomly divided into two groups, with 85 in the group A and 85 in the group B.The group A was treated with endostar,sintilimab and chemotherapy(carboplatin-pemetrexed).The group B was treated with endostar and chemotherapy(carboplatin-pemetrexed).The efficacy and safety would be evaluated.The progression-free survival and overall survival would be analyzed.This data of this study might provide a more effective treatment for non-squamous NSCLC.
