Incidence and Mortality
Ovarian borderline tumors (i.e., tumors of low malignant potential) account for 15% of all
epithelial ovarian cancers.  Nearly 75% of borderline tumors are stage I at the time of
diagnosis.[
1
]  Recognizing these tumors is important because their prognosis and
treatment is different from the frankly malignant invasive carcinomas. Ovarian borderline tumors can also become low-grade serous tumors. For more information, see the
Treatment of Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma
section in Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment.
A review of 22 series (which included 953 patients), with a mean follow-up of 7 years, revealed
a survival rate of 92% for patients with advanced-stage ovarian borderline tumors, if patients with so-called
invasive implants were excluded.  The causes of death in these patients were determined to be
benign complications of disease (e.g., small bowel obstruction), complications
of therapy, and only rarely (0.7% of patients), malignant transformation.[
2
]  In one
series, the 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates of patients with borderline tumors (all stages), as demonstrated by clinical life table
analysis, were 97%, 95%, 92%, and 89%, respectively.[
3
]  In this series, mortality rates were stage
dependent:  0.7% of patients with stage I tumors, 4.2% of patients with stage II tumors, and 26.8% of patients with stage III tumors died of disease.[
3
]   The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique reported an extremely good prognosis for ovarian borderline tumors, with a 10-year survival rate of approximately 95%.[
1
]  These survival rates are clearly in
contrast with the 30% survival rate for patients with invasive tumors (all stages).
Another large retrospective study showed that early stage, serous
histology, and younger age were associated with more favorable prognoses in patients with ovarian borderline tumors.[
4
]
Endometrioid Tumors
Endometrioid borderline tumors are less common and should not be regarded as
malignant because  they seldom, if ever, metastasize.  However, malignant transformation
can occur and may be associated with a similar tumor outside of the
ovary. Such tumors are the result of either a second primary or rupture of the
primary endometrial tumor.[

Surgery
In early-stage disease (stage I or II), no additional treatment is indicated for patients with a
completely resected borderline tumor.[
1
]
Importance of Staging for Treatment
The value of complete staging has not been demonstrated for patients with early-stage disease,
but the opposite ovary should be carefully evaluated for evidence of bilateral
disease.  The impact of surgical staging on therapeutic management has
not been defined. However, in a study of 29 patients with presumed localized disease, 7 patients were
upstaged after complete surgical staging.[
2
]
In two other studies, 16%
and 18% of patients with presumed localized borderline tumors were upstaged as a result of a staging laparotomy.[
3
,
4
]  In one of these
studies, the yield for serous tumors was 30.8%, compared with 0% for
mucinous tumors.[
3
]
In another study, patients with localized
intraperitoneal disease and negative lymph nodes had a low incidence of
recurrence (5%), whereas patients with localized intraperitoneal disease and
positive lymph nodes had a statistically significant higher incidence of
recurrence (50%).[
5
]
Fertility Preservation
When a patient wishes
to retain childbearing potential, a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is
adequate therapy.[
6
,
7
]  In the presence of bilateral ovarian cystic neoplasms,
or for patients with a single ovary, a partial oophorectomy can be used to preserve fertility.[
8
]  Some physicians stress the importance of limiting ovarian
cystectomy to patients with stage IA disease whose cystectomy specimen margins are tumor free.[
9
]
In a large series, the relapse rate was higher for patients who underwent
more conservative surgery (cystectomy > unilateral oophorectomy > total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [TAHBSO]). However, differences were not statistically significant, and the survival rates were
nearly 100% for all groups.[
5
,
10
]  When childbearing is not a consideration, a
TAHBSO is appropriate
therapy.  Once a patient's family is complete, most, but not all,[
9
]
physicians favor removal of remaining ovarian tissue as there is risk of
recurrence of a borderline tumor or, rarely, a carcinoma.[

Treatment Options for Advanced-Stage Ovarian Borderline Tumors
Treatment options for advanced-stage ovarian borderline tumors include:
Surgery
.
Surgery
Patients with advanced disease should undergo a total hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, node sampling, and aggressive cytoreductive
surgery.  Patients with stage III or IV disease with no gross residual tumor had a survival rate of 100% in some series, regardless of the follow-up
duration.[
1
,
2
]  Patients with gross residual
disease had a 7-year survival rate of only 69% in a large series, [
3
] and survival appeared to be inversely
proportional to the length of follow-up.[
3
]
Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are not indicated for patients with more advanced-stage disease and microscopic or gross residual
disease.  Scant evidence exists that postoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy alters the
course of this disease in any beneficial way.[
1
,
3
-
6
]  In a retrospective study of
364 patients without residual tumor, adjuvant therapy had no effect on disease-free or corrected survival when stratified for disease stage.[
7
]  Patients
without residual tumor who received no adjuvant treatment had a survival rate
equal to or greater than the treated groups.  No controlled
studies have compared postoperative treatment with no postoperative treatment.
In a review of 150 patients with borderline ovarian tumors, the survival of
patients with residual tumors smaller than 2 cm was significantly
better than survival for those with residual tumors measuring 2 cm to 5 cm or tumors measuring larger than 5 cm (
P
< .05).[
8
]  It is not clear whether invasive implants imply a worse prognosis.  Some investigators have correlated invasive
implants with a poor prognosis,[
9
] while others have not.[
2
,
10
]  Some studies
have suggested DNA ploidy of the tumors can
identify patients who will develop aggressive disease.[
11
,
12
]  One study
could not correlate DNA ploidy of the primary serous tumor with patient survival, but
found that aneuploid invasive implants were associated with a poor
prognosis.[
13
]  No evidence indicates that treating patients with aneuploid
tumors would have an impact on survival.  No significant associations were found
between TP53 and HER2/neu overexpression and tumor recurrence or patient survival.[
