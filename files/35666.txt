Study of the Impact of Everolimus Treatment on Lymphocytes NK (Natural Killer) Development and Functions for Patients With a Metastatic Breast Cancer (HR+ / HER2/Neu Negative)
NK (Natural Killer) cells are important in the fight against tumor, especially for the control of cancer metastasis. The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the impact on lymphocytes NK functions and development of an everolimus treatment in women treated for a metastatic breast cancer. In particular, the study of lymphocytes NK functions and development under everolimus treatment could permit to validate an early biomarker of the impact of everolimus on these NK cells.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: prospective study
Measure of the level of Granzyme B (GzmB), Timepoint at 3 months
Objective Response Rate, The objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of patients (described on the efficacy-evaluable population) who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR is based on tumor assessments (measurements according to RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Measured from the date of study drugs start to the date of the first objective radiological disease progression using RECIST 1.1 or death., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death., 12 months|Intercurrent diseases reporting, Number of patients with adverse events (including infectious events) related to everolimus, 12 months|Circulating NK functions, Characterization of circulating NK functions by flow cytometry, Timepoint at 3 months and at 9 months|mTOR activation status, rpS6 phosphorylation rate by western blot, Timepoint at 3 months and at 9 months
