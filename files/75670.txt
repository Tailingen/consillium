Randomized Controlled Trial on Effect of Lymph Node Mapping by Indocyanine Green Via Submucosal or Subserosal Injection
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether submucosal or subserous injection of indocyanine green during laparoscopic lymphadenectomy for patients with gastric cancer was different. The patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (cT1-4a, N0/+, M0) were studied.

If neither death nor recurrence of the tumor is observed, the endpoint is the final date that a patient is confirmed as relapse-free. (The final date of DFS: The last date of the outpatient visit day or the date of acceptance of the examination)., 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type., 36 months|Time to first ambulation, Time to first ambulation in hours is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first flatus, Time to first flatus in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first liquid diet, Time to first liquid diet in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first soft diet, Time to first soft diet in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Duration of postoperative hospital stay, Duration of postoperative hospital stay in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|The variation of weight, The variation of weight on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|The variation of BMI in kg/m^2, The variation of BMI in kg/m\^2 on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|Intraoperative morbidity rates, The intraoperative postoperative morbidity rates are defined as the rates of event observed within operation., 1 day|The variation of white blood cell count, The values of white blood cell count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The variation of hemoglobin, The values of hemoglobin in gram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The variation of C-reactive protein, The values of C-reactive protein IN milligram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|Lymph node noncompliance rate, Lymph node noncompliance was defined as the absence of lymph nodes that should have been excised from more than 1 lymph node station. Major lymph node noncompliance was defined as more than 2 intended lymph node stations that were not removed., 1 day|Modified EORTC cancer in-patient satisfaction with care measure (EORTC IN-PATSAT14), Participants were asked to complete one modified European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) IN-PATSAT14 questionnaire before their discharge from hospital., 30 days|The Surgery Task Load Index (SURG-TLX), Surgeons were required to complete one modified SURG-TLX questionnaire for each procedure., 1 day|3-year overall survival rate, The overall survival is calculated from the day of surgery until death or until the final follow-up date, whichever occurs first. For survival cases, the endpoint is the last date that survival was confirmed. If the loss to follow-up occurred, the endpoint is the final date that survival could be confirmed., 36 months
In recent years, with the successful application of ICG (indocyanine green) fluorescence imaging technology in laparoscopic equipment, scholars have found that ICG near-infrared imaging has better tissue penetration and can better identify lymph nodes in hypertrophic adipose tissue than other dyes under visible light, which makes ICG fluorescence imaging guide laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer lymph node dissection has become a new exploration direction. ICG near-infrared imaging technology has important research value, good application prospects, and broad development space in laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer. However, at present, the application of ICG near-infrared imaging technology in laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer is still in the exploratory stage, and there is no unified standard. Therefore, in the world, there is still a lack of high-level evidence-based evidence of large-sample prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of submucosal or subserous injection of ICG in guiding laparoscopic D2 resection of gastric cancer. The investigator first carried out this study in the world to evaluate the lymph node dissection and perioperative safety of gastric cancer patients who received a submucosal injection of ICG and subserous injection of ICG during laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in the same period, to promote the standardized development of ICG near-infrared imaging in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.
