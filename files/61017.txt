Safety and Efficacy Study of Topical AP611074 Gel to Treat Genital Warts
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the topical application of AP611074 5% gel during 6 weeks on ano-genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).
Anogenital Warts|Condylomata Acuminata|Human Papillomavirus Infection
DRUG: AP611074|DRUG: Placebo
Complete or partial regression of anogenital warts, based on the total lesion surface before and after treatment, 6 weeks
Safety and local tolerability, Descriptive statistics will be calculated by comparing the number of subjects between Day 1 and Day 42 in each treatment group (active or placebo) presenting AEs, or changes in physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory parameters (biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis), and local tolerability (erythema, scaling, stinging, oedema), Up to 8 weeks|Pharmacokinetic evaluation, Plasma concentrations of AP611074 will be measured from blood samples once weekly up to 8 weeks in all patients. Data will be summarized with descriptive statistics by nominal sampling time., Up to 8 weeks
Genital warts (GW; also called condylomas or condylomata acuminata) are lesions caused by infection of Human papillomavirus (HPV)(specifically HPV-6 or HPV-11 types, found in \> 95% of lesions). GW are sexually transmitted and affect about 1% of the sexually active population. GW represent a distressful condition for social and sexual life, especially in the cases of external condylomas. No HPV-specific antiviral treatment exists to date, and all existing therapies (either surgical or drug) have limited efficacy, with a significant level of GW recurrences and are associated with local skin reactions. AP611074 is a synthetic new chemical entity that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the interaction between two viral proteins from HPV6 and HPV11, an interaction that is a necessary step for HPV DNA replication and thus viral production. AP611074 is the "first in class" specific HPV antiviral described to treat condyloma caused by HPV infection.
