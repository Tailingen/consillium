T-DXd Versus THP for Medium-risk HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer
This study (EXTEND trial) is a multicentre, interventional, prospective, randomised, open-label, controlled neoadjuvant, phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of T-DXd monotherapy vs. standard-of-care docetaxel+ trastuzumab + pertuzumab (THP) in medium-risk (lymph node negative with a primary tumour stage T2) HER2-positive early breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: T-DXd|DRUG: THP
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate after neoadjuvant treatment, defined as the proportion of participants who have no evidence by H\&E staining of residual invasive disease in the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0) by investigator assessment following completion of neoadjuvant therapy., Up to approximately 1 year
Safety including adverse events (AEs), severe adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI)., Incidence of AEs, SAE, AESIs (interstitial lung disease, LVEF decrease), AEs resulting in study intervention interruption and discontinuation, etc., Up to approximately 1.5 years|Event-free survival (EFS) rate at 12, 24, 36-month, EFS is defined as time from date of randomisation until disease progression precluding initial surgery, invasive disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral), or death from any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) rate at 12, 24, 36-month, IDFS is defined as time from surgery until invasive disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral), or death from any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core 30 Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) score, The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Individual responses are given on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much), with a lower score indicating a better outcome., Up to approximately 3 years|EORTC Breast Cancer-Specific QoL Questionnaire (QLQ-BR45) score, The EORTC-QLQ-BR45 is a 45-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of breast cancer patients. Individual responses are given on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much), with a lower score indicating a better outcome., Up to approximately 3 years
