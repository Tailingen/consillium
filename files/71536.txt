Optimized Cord Blood Transplantation for the Treatment of Patients With High-risk Hematologic Malignancies Who Have Relapsed After First Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if intermediate-intensity conditioning therapy followed by a cord blood transplant can help to control high-risk hematological malignancies in patients who need a second allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: Drugs Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Thiotepa|DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: Mycophenolate mofetil
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

To evaluate 1-year overall survival (OS) following CBT with intermediate dose intensity conditioning for patients in need of a second allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Secondary Objectives:

Speed and success of neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Incidences of graft failure.

â€¢ Incidence of day 100 grade II-IV and III-IV aGVHD and day 180 grades II-IV and III-IV aGVHD.

Incidence of 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year cGVHD.

Incidence of TRM (100 days, 6 months, 1 and 2 years).

The probabilities of relapse, OS, PFS, and GRFS at 1 year, 2, and 3 years as listed in the secondary endpoints in section 2.2.

Correlative laboratory studies investigating graft versus leukemia biology.
