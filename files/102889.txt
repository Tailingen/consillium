Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine in Kidney Cancer
The purpose of this study is to estimate the probability of immune response for the combination treatment of dendritic cell vaccine with oral cabozantinib and characterize the safety profile of interventional therapy.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous alpha-DC1/TBVA vaccine|DRUG: Cabozantinib
Probability of immune response, Proportion of HLA-A2+ ccRCC patients that exhibit improved peripheral blood CD8+ T cell responses against 3 or more vaccine-inclusive peptide epitopes (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1) after active vaccination with Type I-polarized autologous dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccine with concomitant oral cabozantinib (IFN-γ ELISPOT)., Up to 48 months|Safety profile of interventional therapy - Adverse Events, Proportion of patient reported symptoms and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) for specific adverse events per NCI CTCAE v5.0., Up to 48 months|Safety profile of interventional therapy - reduction in CD31+, Proportion of RCC patients that exhibit greater than 30% reduction in CD31+ blood vessel content from baseline biopsy., Up to 48 months|Reduction in tumor vascularity, Proportion of RCC patients that exhibit greater than 30% reduction in CD31+ blood vessel content from baseline biopsy., Baseline; Up to 48 months
Markers of vascular normalization, Change in presence of mature CD31+ (HES1+) blood vessels with tightly approximated abluminal SMA+ pericytes and the lack of immature CD31+ blood vessels with loosely-approximated NG2+ pericytes before and after treatment., Baseline; Up to 48 months
To assess the impact of treatment on formation of tertiary lymphoid structures in pre-treatment biopsies and treated tumors., Number of TLS before and after treatment, identified by landmark expression of MECA-79/PNAd+ high endothelial venules with proximal aggregates of DC-LAMP+ DC and CD3+ T cells and quantified using a Euclidean Displacement imaging algorithm., 48 months|To assess peripheral blood CD8+ T cells longitudinally for reactivity against alternate peptide epitopes of DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1 or against non-vaccine-related RCC-associated antigens, Proportion of cells with specific CD8+ T cell reactivity against peptides derived from other TBVA or RCC-associated antigens that were not included in the vaccine (as an index of epitope spreading in the patient's T cell repertoire)., 48 months|To assess immune cell composition and "fitness" within vs. outside of tumor-associated TLS, Change in number and classification of T cell repertoire before and after treatment, longitudinally, and within TLS vs. outside TLS of the same sample by flow cytometry/TCRBseq., 48 months|To assess TCRA/B repertoire evenness (oligoclonality), convergence (antigenic focus) and compartmentalization (tumor vs. blood) in patients at baseline vs. on treatment, Changes in TCRseq adaptome analysis of CD8+ MACS T cells from tumor/PBMC after treatment., 48 months|To correlate changes in microbubble-enhanced ultrasonography or CT tumor enhancement characteristics before and after therapy with VN and TLS formation, Correlate changes in multi-phase enhanced computed tomography before and after study treatment, including structure and integrity (leak) with cellular measures of vascular normalization. Correlate changes in microbubble-enhanced renal ultrasonography before and after study treatment, including vascular morphology and heterogeneity, with cellular measures of VN., 48 months|To transcriptionally profile LCM-isolated TLS versus non-TLS associated cells., Alterations in transcriptional profiling of tumor-associated TLS and the TME after treatment. IFM reduction in co-expression of "exhaustion" markers including immune checkpoint molecules (PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, TIGIT, BTLA, VISTA) and (pro-apoptotic) Annexin-V, and increase in expression of IFN-gamma and granzyme B in TLS vs. non-TLS-associated tumor tissue., 48 months|To measure the impact of patient sex on T-cell specific reactivity, VN and TLS formation., Expression of androgen and estrogen receptors (AR, ER-alpha, ER-beta) in the TME before and after study treatment., 48 months|To assess further indicators of VN., Presence and percentage of Immature CD31+ blood vessels with loosely approximated NG2+ pericytes before and after treatment., 48 months
Participants with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic, histologically confirmed, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who have elected to undergo surgical resection, will receive neoadjuvant autologous Tumor Blood Vessel Antigen (TBVA)-Dendritic Cell Vaccine intradermally every 2 weeks x 2 (days 7(+/-3) and 21(+/-3)) prior to surgery on day 31(+7) with oral cabozantinib 20 mg daily for 10 days. We hypothesize that treated renal tumors will demonstrate maturation and organization of the tumor endothelium with normalization of endothelial markers and formation of tertiary lymphoid structure capable of promoting specific T-cell induction.
