Adjuvant Chemotherapy With or Without Intercalated Icotinib
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations occur in up to 50% of Asian patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) confers a significant survival benefit. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without Intercalated combination of icotinib in patients undergoing resection of stage IIB to IIIA (N1-2) EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
