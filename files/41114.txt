Alectinib in Neo-adjuvant Treatment of Stage III NSCLC
Stage III NSCLC is a heterogeneous group of tumors with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Across this wide spectrum of heterogeneity, there is no single deﬁnitive therapeutic approach and the definition of the most effective treatment approach needs a multidisciplinary approach. In this trial we want to test in ALK positive stage III locally advanced NSCLC patients, the efficacy of Alectinib to induce tumor shrinkage when administered before surgery and to reduce the possibility of disease recurrence, with a limited risk of toxicity related, in long term administration after surgery.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Alectinib
Major Pathological Response (MPR), Percentage of residual viable tumor cells histologically detected in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes after surgery ≤10%. Evaluation by Blinded Independent Pathology Reviewer (BIPR)., From the treatment start until surgery - 12 weeks period (8 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy; surgery should be done within 2-4 weeks afterwards.
Pathological Complete Response, The absence of residual viable tumor cells in all surgical specimens (resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes) as evaluated by BIPR., From the treatment start until surgery - 12 weeks period (8 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy; surgery should be done within 2-4 weeks afterwards.|Objective response, Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Responses (PR) based on the Investigator's assessment and measured according to standard RECIST criteria v1.1, Pre-surgical radiological evaluation (after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy start)|Event-free survival (EFS), The length of time after the trial inclusion the patient remains free of recurrence/progression or death, whatever the cause., From the trial inclusion date to either the date of disease recurrence/progression or the date of death, monitored up to 3 years after surgery.|Disease-free survival (DFS), The length of time after surgical resection the patient remains free of recurrence/progression or death, whatever the cause., From the date of surgical resection to either the date of disease recurrence or the date of death monitored up to 3 years after surgery.|Overall survival (OS), The length of time after the trial inclusion the patient remains alive, From the date of trial inclusion to the date of death monitored up to 3 years after surgery.|Adverse Events (AE), Untoward medical events occurring after trial inclusion. Adverse Events are defined and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] version 5.0.

Adverse event of special interest are cases of potential drug-induced liver, suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment, Interstitial Lung Disease.

Serious adverse events is any AE occurring at any dose that results in death; is life-threatening (i.e., in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate risk of death from the AE); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay); results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the subject's ability to conduct normal life functions); is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event., From the date of the trial inclusion until 30 days (90 days in case of AE serious/special interest) after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first|Tissue and cell-free (plasma) biomarkers, Characterization of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion partner on DNA extracted from tissue biopsy and on cell-free nucleic acid (cfNA) (both cfDNA and cfRNA) extracted from plasma sample., From the time of diagnosis up to 3 years after surgery
