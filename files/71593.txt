Observation of Bevacizumab Plus Front-line Chemotherapy in Patients With Ovarian Cancer
Investigators propose to assess,the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events) of bevacizumab (Avastin) when added to chemotherapy as front-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma
Ovarian Cancer
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which administration was every 3 weeks, Every 3 weeks up to 18 weeks
Number of Participants with Response Rate, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which the disease evaluation was performed every 3 weeks, Disease evaluation at Week 3|Percentage of Patients with Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Patients Overall Survival, 1 year
In the last decade, clinical studies with bevacizumab (Avastin) in various tumors have shown encouraging results in terms of efficacy/safety. However there is no data generated in Greek population with regards to safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in front line Ovarian Cancer. Two prior global phase III randomized trials showed that the addition of concurrent bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy and maintenance bevacizumab significantly increased the PFS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer It would be relevant to document the real life clinical data of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) in Front Line Ovarian Cancer as prescribed by the medical oncologists in Greece.
