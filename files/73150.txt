A Study of Niraparib in People With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Who Have Changes in Their Tumor DNA
The purpose of this study is to test whether the study drug, niraparib, is effective against unresectable and/or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma with DDR mutations. The researchers will also study whether niraparib is safe and causes few or mild side effects, and whether there are groups of DDR mutations in soft tissue sarcoma cells that respond better to treatment with niraparib.
Sarcoma,Soft Tissue|Sarcoma Uterus
DRUG: Niraparib
Progression free survival (PFS), Defined by RECIST 1.1. PFS is defined as the period from start of study treatment until recurrent or progressive of disease (POD) is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurement recorded on study), death, or date of last study visit involving assessment of disease status., 12 weeks
Assess adverse events, as defined by CTCAE v 5.0, 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), 24 weeks
