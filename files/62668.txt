Phase II Clinical Study of Adebrelimab Combined with Apatinib in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients with Radiation Pneumonitis
A prospective, single-center, phase II clinical study of adebrelimab combined with apatinib in the treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC patients with grade ≤2 radiation pneumonitis after definitive chemoradiotherapy
Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Adebrelimab + Apatinib
Progression free survival (PFS), Refers to the time from the start of nonrandomization until tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Doses were administered every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug until approximately 12 months
overall survival, OS, Refers to the time from the start of nonrandomization until death from any cause., Doses were administered every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug until approximately 12 months|Objective Response Rate, ORR, Refers to the proportion of patients who have achieved a pre-defined tumor volume reduction (CR/PR) and maintained the minimum time frame required by the accepted response evaluation criteria (such as solid tumor RECIST Version 1.1)., Doses were administered every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug until approximately 12 months|Disease control rate, DCR, Proportion of all subjects whose best overall response (BOR) was rated as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., Doses were administered every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug until approximately 12 months|Duration of response, DOR, Defined as the period from the date the tumor remission was first recorded to the date the disease progression was first recorded or the date of death from any cause, Doses were administered every 6 weeks from the first dose of study drug until approximately 12 months
A prospective, single-center, phase II clinical study of adebrelimab combined with apatinib in the treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC patients with grade ≤2 radiation pneumonitis after definitive chemoradiotherapy.At least 32 participants will be enrolled in this study.
