Validation of the Prostate Cancer Assay - Beta+Pivotal
The Prostate Cancer Assay performance of Celsee Diagnostics circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis system will be validated in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. It will demonstrate substantial performance equivalency to a CTC Assay predicate device.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer, CTC
DEVICE: Blood Draw
Confirmation of the clinical utility of the cutoff level for the Prostate Cancer Assay for prognosis of progression free survival (PFS) in comparison to the predicate device, CellSearch CTC Assay, "CTC negative" means a level of CTCs below the cutoff indicating lower risk for progression (i.e. PFS, and "CTC positive" means a level of CTCs at or above the cutoff indicating higher risk for progression (i.e. shorter PFS)., 9 months
