Adenosine Receptor Antagonist Combination Therapy for Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter platform trial to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of etrumadenant (AB928)-based combination therapy in participants with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Stage 1 and 2, ORR defined as the composite proportion of participants with a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and/or radiographic complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) determined by the investigator according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, From study enrolment until participant discontinuation, or first occurrence of progressive disease, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 3-5 years)|Incidence and Severity of AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in Stage 1, From first dose date to 90 days after the last dose (approximately 1.5 years)
Percentage of participants with a PSA response in Stage 1 and 2, PSA response defined as the proportion of participants with a confirmed PSA decrease from baseline of 50% or more based on two consecutive assessments measured 3 to 4 weeks apart, From study enrollment until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (approximately 3-5 years)|Percentage of participants with Radiographic Response in Stage 1 and 2, Radiographic Response is measurable disease at baseline who achieved a best overall response of CR or PR according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, From study enrollment until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (approximately 3-5 years)|Percentage of Participants with Disease Control Rate in Stage 1 and 2, Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline who achieved a best overall RECIST response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)., From study enrollment until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (approximately 3-5 years)|Serum/Plasma Concentration for etrumadenant, zimberelimab, and enzalutamide when administered as part of a combination regimen in Stage 1 and 2., Recorded at baseline (enrollment), during the first 5 months of treatment and 3 additional timepoints in the first year of treatment. (approximately 1.5 years)|Serum/Plasma Concentration for etrumadenant and zimberelimab when administered as part of a combination regimen with docetaxel in Stage 1 and 2, Recorded at baseline (enrollment), during the first 5 months of treatment and 3 additional timepoints in the first year of treatment.

(approximately 1.5 years)|Serum/Plasma Concentration for etrumadenant, zimberelimab, and AB680 when administered as part of a combination regimen in Stage 1 and 2, Recorded at baseline (enrollment), during the first 5 months of treatment and 3 additional timepoints in the first year of treatment. (approximately 1.5 years)|Serum/Plasma Concentration for etrumadenant and AB680 when administered as part of a combination regimen in Stage 1 and 2., Recorded at baseline (enrollment), during the first 5 months of treatment and 3 additional timepoints in the first year of treatment. (approximately 1.5 years)|Percentage of participants with anti-drug antibodies to zimberelimab in Stage 1 and 2, Recorded at baseline (enrollment), during the first 4 months of treatment, 4 additional timepoints in the first year of treatment, and at end of treatment. (approximately 1.5 years)|Incidence and severity of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) in Stage 2, From first dose date to 90 days after the last dose (approximately 3-5 years)
