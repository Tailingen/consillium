Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to develop a novel platform for allo-SCT in multiple myeloma (MM) with the idea of maximizing anti-myeloma effect with conditioning and minimizing GvHD (graft versus host disease). Specifically, the investigators will use the Flu/Mel (fludarabine and melphalan) regimen. For GvHD prophylaxis, the investigators use the Hopkins PT-Cy (post-transplant cyclophosphamide) platform with the novelty of adding tocilizumab as both an anti-myeloma therapy and as a method to reduce GvHD. IL-6 has an important role in promoting the growth of myeloma cells and progression of disease.
Multiple Myeloma|Myeloma-Multiple
BIOLOGICAL: Tocilizumab|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: Mycophenolate mofetil|DRUG: Filgrastim
Safety and tolerability of regimen as measured by grade and frequency of adverse events, Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE v4.0 and summarized by grade and frequency, Day +100
Cumulative incidence and severity of acute GvHD, 6 months|Cumulative incidence and severity of chronic GvHD, 1 year|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), -NRM is defined as death occurring in a patient from causes other than disease relapse or progression, 1 year|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), -NRM is defined as death occurring in a patient from causes other than disease relapse or progression, Day +100|Progression-free survival (PFS), -PFS is defined as the duration from transplant to time of first progression, death, relapse after CR, or the date the patient was last known to be in remission., 1 year|Overall survival (OS), -OS is defined as the duration from the time of transplant to death or last follow-up., 1 year|Time to neutrophil engraftment, * Neutrophil engraftment is defined as ANC \> 0.5 × 10\^9/L × 3 consecutive daily assessments. The first of 3 consecutive days for which ANC \> 0.5 × 10\^9/L will be recorded as the date of neutrophil engraftment. Time to neutrophil engraftment will be calculated as the time from the date of the ASCT to the date of neutrophil engraftment.
* Non-engraftment is defined as failure to reach an ANC \> 0.5 × 10\^9/L × 3 consecutive daily assessments by Day +30., Day +30|Time to platelet engraftment, * Platelet engraftment is defined as an untransfused platelet measurement \> 20,000/ x10\^9/L × 3 consecutive daily assessments. The first of 3 consecutive days for which the untransfused platelet measurement is \> 20,000 x 10\^9/L will be recorded as the date of platelet engraftment. Time to platelet engraftment will be calculated as the time from receiving the date of ASCT to the date of platelet engraftment. Untransfused is defined as no transfusions within 7 days.
* Non-engraftment is defined as failure to reach platelets \> 20,000 × 10\^9/L × 3 consecutive assessments by Day +100., Day +100|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), -NRM is defined as death occurring in a patient from causes other than disease relapse or progression, Day +180
