This research study is an Expanded Access Trial, which is a way to provide an investigational therapy to individuals who are not eligible to receive that therapy in a clinical trial, but have a serious or life-threatening illness for which other treatments are not available.

The purpose of this expanded access program is to treat participants diagnosed with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with an investigational drug called ulocuplumab.

Participants enrolled in the program will receive ulocuplumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or ulocuplumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Ulocuplumab is supposed to kill myeloma cells.

Lenalidomide, which is also known as Revlimid® and Bortezomib, which is also known as Velcade®, are approved by the FDA for treatment of Multiple Myeloma. Dexamethasone, also known as Decadron®, is also approved by the FDA for other treatments. It is a type of steroid medication that fights inflammation.
