Modifications in Retinal Microvascularization With Targeted Anti-angiogenic Therapy in Colorectal Cancer
Retinal microvascularization can provide important informations to systemic vascular phenomena. The non-invasive quantitative description of the retinal vascularization is now possible by performing OCT-angiography and their image analysis software (vascular density and retinal perfusion). Systemic microvacular changes during the establishment of oncological treatment by targeted antiangiogenic therapy are little described in the literature. The objective of this pilot study is to describe the evolution of the retinal vascular density of patients with antiangiogenic drugs. In addition, the evolution of the retinal vascular density of patients on antiangiogenic drugs will study as a function of the response to the treatment and the toxicity of these treatments.
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: OCT- Angiographie
retinal vascular density retinal vascular density, this measurement will be the average of the 4 quadrants (temporal, nasal, superior and inferior 24). It will be performed by PLEX Elite 9000 Swept Source OCT-A before, during and at the end of the anti-angiogenic treatment, 12 month
The main objective of this study is to describe the change in retinal vascular density of patients with first-line colorectal cancer treated with Bevacizumab.
