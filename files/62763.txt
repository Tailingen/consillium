Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 5 Plus HAIC of FOLFOX for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
Oncolytic viruses can selectively replicate in and destroy tumor cells. Recent studies indicate that recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (H101), which is the first approved oncolytic virus drug in the world, shows anti-tumor effects on liver cancer. This study aims to further verify the effect and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 combined with HAIC in the treatment of intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma.

Progression-free survival (PFS), The median amount of time from registration until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was assessed via RECIST 1.1 criteria., up to 1 month
1 year survival rate, The percentage of participants who are alive one year after the start of the treatment., 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of participants who have achieved either a complete or partial response, as assessed by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)., up to 1month|Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of participants who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease, as assessed by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)., up to 1 month
This is a perspective, single-arm trial. According to previous studies, the PFS of HAIC for unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is approximately 8 - 10 months, and one year progression free rate is about 40%. We assumed that the study could detect 20% absolute difference and 1 year PFS rate could achieve 60% PFS by (FOLFOX + H101) over conventional HAIC (FOLFOX). Simon's two-stage design is used to estimate the sample size, with Î± value of 0.05 and power of 0.9. A total sample size of 66 participants are required.
