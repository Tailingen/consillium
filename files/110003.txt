Locoregionally advanced laryngo-hypopharyngeal squamous cell cancer patients have the demand of laryngo-preservation. Induction chemotherapy (FP) combined with Toripalimab (a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1) will be given. This regimen will be given every 21 days for 2 cycles. Radiological examinations and PET(FDG/FAPI) examinations pre/post-treatment will be administrated for response evaluation.
