The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of early and intermediate toxicity related to the AccuBoost System for delivery of APBI in women with resected, early stage breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Accelerated partial breast irradiation|OTHER: Extended Follow up
Early and Intermediate Toxicity, Any toxicity related to the radiation treatment will be scored and graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 (Appendix 4). Acute side effects are any side effects occurring within 3 months of treatment. Intermediate side effects are any side effects occurring between 3 months and 2 years. This is reported in the outcome table., 2 years
