A Clinical Study of MK-1045 (CN201) in People With Precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (MK-1045-002)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with a type of blood cancer called precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) that is relapsed- the cancer has come back after treatment, or refractory - the current treatment has stopped working to slow or stop cancer growth. This study will have two parts. In the first part (dose escalation phase) the goal is to learn about the safety of a study treatment, MK-1045, and to find the best dose level of MK-1045 that is tolerated and may work to treat B-ALL. In the second part (Phase II) researchers want to learn how well MK-1045 works to treat B-ALL
