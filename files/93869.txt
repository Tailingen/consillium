Hormone Therapy, Radiation Therapy, and Steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700 in Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700, when used with other hormone therapy, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer when combined with hormone therapy. Studying quality-of-life in patients having cancer treatment may help identify the intermediate- and long-term effects of treatment on patients with prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the use of hormone therapy, including TAK-700, together with radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to risk group (see Disease Characteristics) and type of radiation therapy (RT) boost (intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) vs brachytherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
