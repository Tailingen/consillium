Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability of JPI-547 in Combination With Modified FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel in Patients With Locally Advanced and Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability of JPI-547 in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) or Gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel (GemAbraxne) in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: JPI-547|DRUG: modified FOLFIRINOX|DRUG: Gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)., The MTD is determined according to the traditional 3+3 rule-based method for each combination therapy, and it is defined as the highest dose with a DLT incidence of less than 1/3 or 2/6 subjects., From the date of administration to 4 weeks (DLT period)
To assess the adverse events, drug adverse events, and serious adverse events evaluated by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Until 4 weeks after the last dose administration|To evaluate anti-tumor activity., Anti-tumor activity is evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Evaluation at 8 weeks intervals through study completion from the date of study entry until the date of progression, up to 18 months
In combination with JPI-547 and chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer,

Primary Objectives

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
* To select the optimal combination chemotherapy based on the safety profile.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess the safety and toxicity.
* To evaluate anti-tumor activity.
