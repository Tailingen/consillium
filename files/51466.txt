Stimulation of Acupuncture Points by Athermic Laser Therapy for the Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Children
Poor control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has a major clinical and psychological impact in patients treated with chemotherapy. Metabolic, nutritional and mechanical complications, as well as psychological repercussions, complicate the therapeutic management of the patient and can lead to poor compliance, a deterioration in the general condition or even prolongation of hospitalizations and a delay in the implementation of chemotherapy cures. The control of induced chemo- and radio-induced nausea and vomiting rests above all on their prevention. At present and in most centers, the prevention of nausea and vomiting in the pediatric onco-hematology department of the CHU de Nice is based exclusively on drug treatments, according to a protocol established according to the emetogenic risk of the chemotherapy received.

We propose a study evaluating the effectiveness of the stimulation of acupuncture points by low frequency laser therapy associated with antiemetics in the management of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in patients of 2 to 20 years followed in the service of analgesics. pediatric onco-hematology.
