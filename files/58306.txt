Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer
Single-arm, open-label, interventional study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative(NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the treatment of patients with advanced liver cancer.
Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes
Types and incidence of Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) [Safety and Tolerability], Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be collected and graded according to CTCAE v5.0, 1 month|Types and incidence of adverse events (AEs) ,serious adverse events (SAEs) [Safety and Tolerability], AE will be collected and graded according to CTCAE v5.0, Up to 24 months|Maximum tolerated dose [Safety and Tolerability], Evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of TILs in patients with advanced liver cancer, 1 month
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated as the time from TIL infusion to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) (RECIST v1.1)., 6 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR will be calculated as the percentage of patients who achieved Stable Disease(SD) or better for more than 8 weeks (RECIST v1.1)., Up to 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be calculated as the percentage of patients who achieved partial response (PR) or better (RECIST v1.1)., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from TIL infusion to time of death due to any cause, Up to 24 months
This is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process for the treatment of patients with advanced liver cancer. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a non-myeloablative lymphodepletion preparative regimen, followed by i.v. infusion of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
