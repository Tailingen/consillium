Imaging With a PET Agent for Detection of Cancers of the Head and Neck
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a study drug called PARPi-FL. This drug has been tested in animals but not yet in people. The purpose of this study is to test if a PARPi-FL scan can be used to take pictures of head and neck cancer. The usual approach to imaging this cancer includes several different imaging scans, including x-rays, CT (computed tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and PET (positron emission tomography). These tests take pictures of the cancer.
