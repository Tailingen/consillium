Chemotherapy Combined With Apatinib and PD-1 Antibody
The effective rate of second-line and later-line single-agent therapy for advanced gastric cancer is limited. This research plan aims to explore whether the combination of drugs can further improve the benefits of second-line and above therapies. Previous studies have shown that there is a significant synergistic effect between chemotherapy and PD-1 monoclonal antibody, or anti-angiogenic TKI drugs and PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This project is planned to be based on the classic chemotherapy drugs irinotecan or paclitaxel, combined with mesylate Apatinib and PD-1 monoclonal antibody, explore the effectiveness and safety of this three-drug combination regimen for the second-line and above treatment of advanced gastric cancer, in order to provide a better late-line treatment plan for patients with advanced gastric cancer.

The Overall Response Rate, The proportion of CR and PR, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival, Time from the start of treatment to the progression of the disease, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months
Overall survival, Time from the start of treatment to the occurrence of death, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause or the last visit date, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Disease Control rate, The proportion of CR,PR and SD, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|adverse events, The incidence of various adverse events, Until 3 months after the end of the treatment
biomolecular markers, Serum will be collected before medication and during each evaluation. Mass spectrometry or RNA sequencing technology will be used to detect the differences in the exosomal proteome and non-coding RNA group in the serum before medication. Screen out the group of exosomal protein/non-coding RNA components with obvious differences in the two groups of patients; and consider its biological function/signal pathway, and finally select 1-2 kinds of protein/non-coding RNA., From the begaining of treatment, then every 2 months after treatment, until the last time after treatmentï¼Œ assessed up to 24 months
This study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical study, which aims to explore the efficacy of PD-1 antibody combined with apatinib combined with chemotherapy as a second-line and above regimen in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.The enrolled patients were patients with advanced inoperable gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who had advanced first-line fluorouracil combined with platinum or advanced second-line paclitaxel and irinotecan, with an ECOG PS of 0-1. Treatment plan: PD-1 antibody: 200mg intravenous drip every 3 weeks; Apatinib 250mg/day; Chemotherapy: Irinotecan 150mg/m2, intravenous drip every 2 weeks, or Paclitaxel 150mg/m2, intravenous drip, once every 3 weeks. An imaging evaluation is performed every 6-8 weeks. Monitor blood routine, blood biochemistry, electrocardiogram, urine routine, thyroid function, heart function according to clinical routine, and record adverse events. Primary observational endpoints: objective effective rate (ORR), progression-free survival time (PFS), secondary observational endpoints: overall survival time (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety, and dynamic monitoring of serum biomolecular markers for exploration study .
