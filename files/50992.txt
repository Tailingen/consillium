This is a pilot study, it is the first time investigators are examining the effect of this exercise program on cancer survivors physical and emotional functioning. The exercise programs is based on the conditioning program used by boxers.- Haymakers for Hope 16-week exercise program

* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.
* Participants will attend the 16-week program of boxing conditioning. It is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study.

  * This 16 week will include supervised exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility, balance and cardiopulmonary fitness.
  * There will be 4 sessions of 1 hour each week for each of the 10 participants.
  * The program will be conducted at gymnasiums contracted with the H4H program and outcomes assessments at Massachusetts General Hospital and the gymnasiums..
