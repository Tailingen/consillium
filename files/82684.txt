Stem Cell Transplant From Donors After Alpha Beta Cell Depletion in Children and Adults With T-allo10 Cells Addback
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a cell therapy, T-allo10, after αβdepleted-HSCT in the hopes that it will boost the adaptive immune reconstitution of the patient while sparing the risk of developing severe Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD).

The primary objective of Phase 1a is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) administered after infusion of αβdepleted-HSCT in children and young adults with hematologic malignancies.

A Phase 1b extension will occur after dose escalation, enrolling at the RP2D for the T-allo10 cells determined in the Phase 1 portion to evaluate the safety and efficacy of infusion of T-allo10 after receipt of αβdepleted-HSCT. Additionally, Phase 1b aims to explore improvements in immune reconstitution.

All participants on this study must be enrolled on another study: NCT04249830
