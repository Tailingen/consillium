To define provider-level knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to BE screening., This investigator will conduct a survey study among primary care providers and gastroenterologists at 7 large health systems in the U.S.-including 4 tertiary care referral centers and 3 safety-net health systems. Based on constructs from Social Cognitive Theory and Theory of Reasoned Action, the survey will assess provider knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to BE screening among at-risk individuals., 2 years|To characterize the association between patient-level knowledge, attitudes, and barriers regarding BE screening., This investigator will conduct a survey study among patients at 7 large health systems in the U.S. Based on constructs from the Health Behavior Framework, the survey will assess patient knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to BE screening. To accomplish these study aims, this investigator has assembled a strong and diverse team with complementary areas of expertise in Barrett's esophagus, and survey research., 2 years
The initial step to achieve this goal is to study shortcomings of the current BE screening referral processes in the United States. These shortcomings will be identified through completion of two synergistic aims that assess:, (1) provider knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to BE screening referral and (2) patient knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to completion of BE screening. The central hypothesis is that there are patient- and provider-level factors that can be modified to improve BE screening adherence. This hypothesis was formulated based on strong preliminary data demonstrating significant single-mindedness among gastroenterologists regarding BE screening criteria.
