Study of SYN818 for the Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This interventional study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of SYN818 as monotherapy in adult patients with advanced solid tumors
Advanced Solid Cancer|Metastatic Solid Tumor|Ovarian Cancer|Breast Cancer|Prostate Cancer|BRCA Mutation|HRR Deficiency
DRUG: SYN818
Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Severity of adverse events as assessed by the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., From first dose of study treatment until the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21-days)|Number of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs), Number of participants with incidence of adverse events and with serious adverse events including changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examination, etc., From time of information consent to 30 days post last dose, up to 3 years|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the maximum dose level at which â‰¤1 patient have DLTs during the DLT observation period, and it should be determined with 6 evaluable patients., Up to 3 years
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and Pharmacodynamic (PD) marker change, Blood drug concentrations at each scheduled time point will be summarized descriptively, and individual and mean concentration-time curves will be plotted by dose group., Up to 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 recorded from first investigational product treatment until disease progression or death due to any cause. The confirmation of response for patients who has PR or CR at first time should be performed by at least 4 weeks. For castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, bone lesion will be assessed according to PCWG3 criteria., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DoR) and Time to Response (TTR), DOR is defined, for patients with an objective response, as the time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause., Up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first study treatment to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause., Up to 3 years|Serum tumor marker change: CA125, etc. (OC), prostatic specific antigen (PSA, prostate cancer) decreased, and specific tumor markers for other tumor types may also be included (to be assessed by clinical investigators), The tests for the above serum tumor markers will support the tumor response evaluation., Up to 3 years
This study is a Phase I, open-label, multicentre study of SYN818 administered orally in patients with advanced solid tumors
