Fecal and Oral Microbiota Between Pancreatic Cancer and Benign/Low-grade Malignant Tumor Patients
Significant gaps exist in understanding the gastrointestinal microbiota in patients with pancreatic cancer (PCA) versus benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors (NPCA). This study aimed to analyze these microbiota characteristics and explore their potential use in distinguishing malignant pancreatic lesions.

the accuracy of the diagnostic classifier, we used random forest algorithm to construct oral and fecal microbiome classifiers to discriminate PCA and NPCA. AUC value was used to evaluate the efficacy of the classifiers, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks
In the past decade, microbiome research has rapidly progressed, revealing the critical roles of fecal and oral microbiota in maintaining internal homeostasis. Studies employing 16S rRNA and metagenomics have highlighted dysbiosis of the fecal and oral microbiota as closely linked to PCA development and progression. However, significant gaps exist in understanding the fecal and oral microbiota in patients with pancreatic cancer (PCA) versus benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors (NPCA). This study aimed to analyze fecal and oral microbiota characteristics, and to establish classifiers to discriminate PCA from NPCA, providing a reference for early clinical identification of malignant tumors.
