Postoperative Electrical Muscle Stimulation Two
Undesirable loss of skeletal muscle mass (atrophy) is a common feature of many diseases as well as ageing, bed rest and physical inactivity. Losing muscle can lead to a reduction in one's ability to perform physical activities, and reduce independence and overall health. Muscle mass loss occurs very quickly (i.e., within a few days) after surgery.

The investigators previous work has shown that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the thigh muscles on one side of the body can help maintain muscle mass and strength on the stimulated side after surgery. Since then, additional work has been carried out to find the most effective form of stimulation to build muscle.

The current study aims to use this refined stimulation protocol in a clinical trial on the wards after major abdominal surgery. The intervention will involve delivering stimulation to both thighs in the few days after surgery, so that the investigators can assess whether this stimulation can preserve muscle mass and strength, and also, patients' ability to perform physical activities after surgery. In addition, the study will aim to find out whether any benefit provided by electrical stimulation can be increased further by taking a protein supplement at the same time.

The EuroQoL-5D-3L questionnaire is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It generates a simple descriptive profile and a single summary index value for health status., Pre-operatively, 5 days post-operatively and 28 days post-operatively|Physical activity profiles of patients following major GI surgery, Measured using a thigh-worn accelerometer, Days 1-4 post operatively|Circulating amino acid profiles, Blood samples to assess circulatory amino acid levels, Pre-operatively, and on day 1 and 5 post-operatively|Systemic markers of inflammation, Blood samples to assess inflammatory marker levels, Pre-operatively, and on day 1 and 5 post-operatively|Post-operative vastus lateralis (VL) muscle mass loss, Vastus lateralis (VL) muscle mass loss as measured on ultrasound muscle thickness, Pre-operatively and 5 days post-operatively

The main objective of this trial is to assess whether neuromuscular stimulation (NMES) can minimise muscle loss following abdominal surgery for cancer; and whether such effect is further improved by simultaneous protein supplementation.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does NMES training reduce the volume of muscle lost from the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle (in the thigh) after surgery as measured on ultrasound scan 5 days after surgery?
* Does NMES training together with protein supplementation lead to greater reduction of VL muscle volume loss on ultrasound 5 days after surgery then NMES alone?

Researchers will allocate participants into three groups (using a randomisation software).

All participants will visit the hospital once before surgery for starting point measurements including ultrasound.

Whilst they are in hospital, from the first until the fourth day after surgery, they will have the following interventions:

* Group 1 (the control group) will receive usual post-operative care with no additional interventions;
* Group 2 will receive normal postoperative care and twice daily NMES training sessions and a flavoured (placebo) drink
* Group 3 will receive normal post operative care as well as twice daily NMES training sessions and two protein rich drinks per day.

On the fifth day after surgery all participants will have repeat measurements including ultrasound to assess the extent of muscle loss they had since surgery.
