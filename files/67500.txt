The purpose of the study is to evaluate the oncological efficacy of pancreatic radiofrequency by the objective response rate (complete and partial responses according to RECIST 1.1.), 5 years after the end of treatment.
Pancreatic Tumor
PROCEDURE: Pancreatic radiofrequency
Carcinological efficacy of pancreatic radiofrequency, The primary endpoint of the study is the oncological efficacy of pancreatic radiofrequency, which will be assessed by the objective response rate (complete and partial responses according to RECIST 1.1.), 5 years after treatment., 5 years
This is a prospective, longitudinal, open, non-randomized, non-interventional, multicenter study on ultrasound-guided radiofrequency endoscopy for the treatment of pancreatic tumours. The study will be offered prospectively to all patients in need of treatment. They will be taken care of in accordance with current practice.

The patient will be seen again 7 times after the end of the pancreatic radiofrequency (which will include one or two sessions): the follow-ups will be done according to current practice on D15 ± 7 days, M6 ± 14 days, M12 ± 1 month then annually until M60 ± 1 month.

The study consists to evaluate the oncological efficacy at 5 years of pancreatic radiofrequency delivered by means of a needle guided by ultrasound endoscopy.
