Prospective Phase 2 Trial of Cabazitaxel in Patients With Temozolomide Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme
The proposed study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase- II trial to assess the efficacy of cabazitaxel in GBM WHO grade IV patients with a progression during or within 6 months after last temozolomide treatment (Figure 1).

Cabazitaxel will be given at a dose of 25mg/m² as 1h infusion every 3 weeks with standard concomitant medication (as outlined below):

* On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive cabazitaxel at a dose of 25mg/m², administered by i.v. route in 1 hour.
* Cycle length for cabazitaxel is 3 weeks (21 days).
* New cycles of therapy may not begin until Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3, platelet count ≥75 000/mm3, and non-hematological toxicities (except alopecia) have recovered to baseline.
* A maximum of 2 weeks (14 days) delay is allowed between 2 treatment cycles.
* Patients should come off treatment if treatment delay is more than 2 weeks.

At least 30 minutes prior to each administration of cabazitaxel, patients will receive i.v. premedication including:

* An antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5mg, diphenhydramine 25mg, or equivalent). In case of i.v. antihistamine other than promethazine is not being available, local practice should be followed.
* Corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8mg or equivalent)
* H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent).
* Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously if necessary.
* Primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) should be given on day 4 of each treatment cycle as per ASCO and ESMO guidelines.
