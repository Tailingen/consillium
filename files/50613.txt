RVU120 for Treatment of Anemia in Patients With Lower-risk Myelodysplastic Neoplasms
This study will evaluate orally administered RVU120, a novel small molecule Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) 8/19 inhibitor, in terms of erythroid hematologic improvement (HI-E) and safety in participants with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Responding patients are eligible to continue treatment until loss of response/disease progression.
