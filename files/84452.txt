A Study of Pemetrexed Plus Carboplatin Combined With Radiation in Patients With Inoperable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (LA-NSCLC) (RT0801)
Patients with inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer will receive thoracic radiation therapy 66 Gy over 33 fractions,and concurrent with 2 cycles of chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2,d1,repeated every 3 weeks)and carboplatin (AUC=5,d1,repeated every 3 weeks).
