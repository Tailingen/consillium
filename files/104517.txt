A Study of Irinotecan and Cetuximab With or Without IMC-A12 for Treatment of Participants With Colon or Rectum Cancer Who Got Worse After Their First Treatment With Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab
The purpose of this study is to determine the value of adding IMC-A12 to irinotecan and cetuximab in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).

The purpose of this study is to determine the value of adding IMC-A12 to irinotecan + cetuximab in improving progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 weeks from the date of randomization for participants with metastatic Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (K-RAS) wild-type CRC that has progressed on an oxaliplatin/bevacizumab-containing regimen.
