Paclitaxel/Cisplatin/Fluorouracil Followed by Paclitaxel/Cisplatin/Radiotherapy and Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer
We hypothesize that one-cycle induction chemotherapy may also help to identify chemo-responsive esophageal cancer patients who are highly treatable by definitive CCRT.
Esophageal Cancer
PROCEDURE: TP-HDFL,TP-CCRT, Esophagectomy
To determine whether clinical response to one cycle of induction chemotherapy (TP-HDFL) could predict the pathologic complete response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy (TP-CCRT, 2 years
We hypothesize that one-cycle induction chemotherapy may also help to identify chemo-responsive esophageal cancer patients who are highly treatable by definitive CCRT.in order to test this hypothesis, we thus propose this phase II clinical study to verify the role of "response to one-cycle induction chemotherapy"in the prediction of pathologic complete response rate to CCRT and tje outcomes for patients with loco-regional esophageal cancer.
