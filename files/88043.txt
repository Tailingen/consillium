An Evaluation of Tilmanocept by IV Injection Using SPECT/CT vs PET Imaging in Subjects With Liver Metastases.
Estimation of the concordance of Tc 99m localization in liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma using SPECT/CT imaging and abdominal FDG (PET)/CT imaging per subject.
Liver Metastases|Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Tilmanocept (Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept Injection)|PROCEDURE: SPECT/CT Imaging
Visualization of Lesions by FDG PET/CT Imaging and by Tc 99m Tilmanocept SPECT/CT Imaging., The primary objectives of this study were to estimate the concordance of Tc 99m tilmanocept localization in liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) using single photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and abdominal fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) imaging per subject and to evaluate the safety including monitoring the incidence of adverse events and changes over time in laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination findings., Within 7 days after Tc 99m tilmanocept administration
This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, comparator study of IV injected Tc 99m Tilmanocept in the localization and detection of liver metastases in subjects with confirmed colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The study will be divided into two cohorts.

If it was determined that additional enrollment would not provide meaningful data, for example no metastatic liver lesions were visualized by Tc 99m tilmanocept for any of the subjects in the cohort, enrollment into Cohort 2 would begin and 3 subjects would be enrolled followed by a review of the imaging and safety data.

This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tc 99m tilmanocept administered intravenously. SPECT/CT imaging of the subject's abdominal cavity will be reviewed to establish concordance with FDG PET imaging.
