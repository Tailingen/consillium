Rituximab,Zanubrutinib in Combination With Lenalidomide, Followed by Zanubrutinib or Lenalidomide Maintenance in Patients With Primary or Secondary CNS Lymphoma
In view of the synergistic effects of rituximab, zanubrutinib, and lenalidomide and severe complications caused by current standard chemotherapy regimens in Patients for primary or secondary CNS lymphoma, we intend to conduct a prospective clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Rituximab, Zanubrutinib in combination with Lenalidomide. Besides, the efficacy of Zanubrutinib or Lenalidomide in maintenance was also compared.
