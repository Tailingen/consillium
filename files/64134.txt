Irinotecan for Advanced and Metastatic Breast Cancer
This trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-line or later irinotecan treatment for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer among Chinese patients who have received at least two regimens containing anthracyclines and taxanes.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR will be calculated based on the number of patients who achieve a complete or partial response divided by the total sample size., 1 year
Progression-free survival(PFS), The PFS interval will be calculated from the start of irinotecan treatment to the first instance of tumor progression, treatment failure, or death from any cause. Overall survival will be calculated from the start of irinotecan treatment to death from any cause., 1 year
Anthracyclines and taxanes are the most effective first-line and second-line treatments for breast cancer, although increased usage in early treatment lines can make it difficult to select a third-line or later treatment. This issue is further complicated by the fact that patients with metastatic breast cancer can become resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes. Thus, there are no consistent international guidelines regarding treatment in this setting.

In China, the treatment procedures for metastatic breast cancer follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, which recommend single-drug treatments for recurrent or metastatic disease, which typically involve anthracyclines, taxanes, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, capecitabine, and eribulin. However, there is no standard international recommendation for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have developed resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes, and there are limited options for third-line or later treatment in this setting.

This trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-line or later irinotecan treatment for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer among Chinese patients who have received at least two regimens containing anthracyclines and taxanes.
