An Open Label Study of Bavituximab and Pembrolizumab in Advanced Gastric and GEJ Cancer Patients
This study evaluates the combination of bavituximab and pembrolizumab in the treatment of gastric and gastroesphogeal cancer. All patients will receive both bavituximab, a drug that is not yet approved by the FDA, and pembrolizumab known as Keytruda.

There is no expanded access program available for the investigational agents per this protocol.

Number of Patients With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Incidence of TEAEs graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, including changes in clinical laboratory parameters. TEAEs: any AE that emerged on or after first dose, and within 30 days of the last dose., From first dose through 30 days after last dose. Maximum exposure: 567 days.|Severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Severity of TEAEs graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, including changes in clinical laboratory parameters. TEAEs: any AE that emerged on or after first dose, and within 30 days of the last dose., From first dose through 30 days after last dose. Maximum exposure: 567 days.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was based on RECIST version 1.1 criteria for target lesions, where a patient may achieve as best overall response (BOR) either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline summary of diameters. ORR is calculated as the number of patients achieving a CR or PR (objective response) divided by the number of efficacy patients., From date of first dose until the date of CR, PR, first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first. Maximum exposure: 567 days.
