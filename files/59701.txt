A Phase 1 Drug-Drug Interaction Study Between Brigatinib and the CYP3A Substrate, Midazolam, in Participants With ALK-Positive or ROS1-Positive Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of repeat-dose administration of brigatinib 180 milligram (mg) once daily (QD) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam.
Carcinoma, Advanced ALK+ or ROS1+Non-Small-Cell Lung, Neoplasm, Advanced ALK+ or ROS1+Solid Tumors
DRUG: Midazolam|DRUG: Brigatinib
Part A, AUCâˆž: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity for Midazolam, The statistical analysis was calculated via a mixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) fitting terms for treatment (midazolam with or without brigatinib coadministration)., Cycle 1, Days 1 (Midazolam alone) and 21 (Midazolam + Brigatinib): pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length is 28 days)|Part A, Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Midazolam, The statistical analysis was calculated via a mixed-effects ANOVA fitting terms for treatment (midazolam with or without brigatinib coadministration)., Cycle 1, Days 1 (Midazolam alone) and 21 (Midazolam + Brigatinib): pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length is 28 days)|Part A, Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Midazolam, Cycle 1, Days 1 (Midazolam alone) and 21 (Midazolam + Brigatinib): pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length is 28 days)
The study will enroll approximately 20 participants to achieve approximately 15 PK-evaluable participants for assessment. This study will consist of 2 parts: Part A of the study will evaluate the effect of repeat-dose administration of brigatinib on the single-dose PK of midazolam. Part B of the study is exploratory and will allow participants to continue brigatinib until disease progression (PD). All participants will receive study drug via the oral route. Participants will be assigned to: Midazolam 3 mg + Brigatinib 90 mg.

The overall time to participate in this study is 26 months. Participants will have a 28-day PK cycle in Part A and a maximum of 23 cycles in Part B, and a 30-day follow-up period after end of treatment.
