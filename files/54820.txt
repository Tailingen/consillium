Study of Combined VisioCyt Test and FGFR3 Mutations on a Urinary Sample to Diagnose Bladder Tumors
This study is a case-control, propsective and muticentric clinical trial, which aim to compare the specificity and sensibility of VisioCyt urinary cytological test combined with FGFR3 mutation detection test to VisioCyt urinary cyological test on its own to detect bladder cancer.

The case are patient in whom newly diagnosed, or recurring /progressing bladder cancer is strongly suspected after initial fibroscopy.

The control are patient attending or hospitalized for urolithiasis, urinary infections, urinary superior excretory stones or with non suspect urinary symptomatology.
Bladder Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Urine collection (150ml)|OTHER: Blood sample (20 ml)
Specificity, Specificity comparaison between Visiocyt test + FGFR3 analysis and FGFR3 analysis on its own, at inclusion
