RRx-001 Given With Irinotecan and Temozolomide for Pediatric Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Malignant Solid and Central Nervous System Tumors
The PIRATE study tests the experimental drug RRx-001 in combination with 2 chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used in patients with cancer. RRx-001 has been used alone and with other anti-cancer medicines in adults. However, the investigators do not know what effects it will have in children and young adults.

The goals of the PIRATE study are:

* Determine if the adult dose of RRx-001 is safe when given together with 2 chemotherapy drugs called irinotecan and temozolomide in children and young adults with previously-treated cancerous tumors
* Determine the side effects of RRx-001 in children and young adults when given together with irinotecan and temozolomide
* Understand if the combination of RRx-001, irinotecan, and temozolomide is helpful for children and young adults with previously-treated cancerous tumors
* In patients with brain tumors, measure if RRx-001 causes changes in the tumor on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
* Determine if RRx-001 causes changes in the immune system which may help the body naturally fight the tumor
