Safety and Tolerability of ABM-1310 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, First-In-Human, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of ABM-1310 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have no effective standard treatment options available, as monotherapy in patients with documented BRAF V600 mutation, or in combination with cobimetinib (Cotellic速) in adult patients who have documented BRAF mutation and progressive disease or intolerance to at least one prior line of systemic therapy.

This is a Phase I, First-In-Human, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of ABM-1310 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have no effective standard treatment options available, as monotherapy in patients with documented BRAF V600 mutation, or in combination with cobimetinib (Cotellic速) in adult patients who have documented BRAF mutation and progressive disease or intolerance to at least one prior line of systemic therapy. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of both single agent and combination treatment and to assess the safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 as a monotherapy and in combination.

Study consists of three Parts:

Part A: The starting dose of ABM-1310 is 25 mg po bid, and dose escalation will be guided by a "3+3" design. ABM-1310 will be administered twice daily on a continuous schedule. Each treatment cycle consists of 28 days.

Part B: The starting dose of ABM-1310 will be a dose below the MTD that has been demonstrated to be safe in Part A Monotherapy. A classic "3+3" design will guide the dose escalation. At each dose level, ABM-1310 will be administered in combination with 60 mg cobimetinib (Cotellic 速) once daily (qd) for the first 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle.

Part C:

* In C-1 (Monotherapy - Primary CNS Tumors) and C-2 (Monotherapy - Advanced or Metastatic solid tumors excluding Primary CNS tumors with or without Brain Metastasis), continuous twice daily oral doses of ABM-1310 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) from Part A until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another withdrawal criterion is met.
* In C-3 (Combination therapy - Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors including Primary CNS Tumors but excluding Melanoma with Brain Metastsis) and C-4 (Combination therapy - Melanoma with Brain Metastasis), continuous twice daily oral doses of ABM-1310 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) from Part B, in combination with cobimetinib (Cotellic速) 60 mg administered the first 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another withdrawal criterion is met.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated and managed per the pre-defined DLT criteria and rules specified in the protocol. MTD and/or RP2D will be confirmed in a dose confirmation cohort.
