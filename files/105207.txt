Self-expandable Metal Stents Versus Multiple Plastic Stents for Palliation of Biliary Obstruction
A randomised clinical trial to compare the clinical efficacy of multiple plastic stents to fully covered self expanding metal stents in the palliation of distal malignant biliary obstruction in patients with irresectable tumours.
