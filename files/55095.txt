A First in Human Study Using 89Zr-cRGDY Ultrasmall Silica Particle Tracers for Malignant Brain Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test if PET scans using 89Zr-DFO-cRGDY-PEG-Cy5-C' dot particles, can be used to take pictures of brain tumors. The investigators want to understand how the particles are distributed and removed from the body, which may help others be treated in the future. This will be the first time that 89Zr-DFO-cRGDY-PEG-Cy5-C' dot particles are being used in people. The amount of particles given in this study is very small compared to the amount that was used in mice animal studies.
