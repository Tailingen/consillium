Monitor Response to Treatment in Neuroblastoma Using 3&Apos;-Deoxy-3&Apos;-Fluorothymidine- Positron Emission Tomography (FLT-PET)
The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge about how to best diagnose and treat tumors, how tumors affect normal tissue and how treatment of tumors with radiation therapy and chemotherapy affect tumors.
Neuroblastoma
DEVICE: FLT-PET
To determine whether 18F-FLT-PET is a sensitive tool to image neuroblastoma., 1st PET - At diagnosis
To evaluate the utility of FLT-PET in early assessment of patient response to treatment., 1st PET - At diagnosis|To evaluate the utility of FLT-PET in early assessment of patient response to, 2nd PET - Approx. 3 wks (end of 1st cycle)|To evaluate the utility of FLT-PET in early assessment of patient response to treatment., 3rd PET: 6-15 wks (Prior to surgery)
The purpose of this research study is to observe the changes within the tumor cells which may improve the understanding of how tumors grow and how they respond to various treatments. These changes will be compared with results of the physical examination and scans (CT and MRI) that are done as part of clinical care. Images will be made showing the distribution throughout the body of substances containing a small amount of radioactive material. This procedure is called a PET scan. The radioactive substances (tracer compound) in this study are \[F-18\] FLT.
