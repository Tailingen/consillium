SpeakFree Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME)
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the new Blom-Singer SpeakFree disposable hands free valve heat and moisture exchanger (HME). The investigators will compare the SpeakFree to other modalities of stomal occlusion (digital occlusion and digital depression of an HME) for patients who communicate with a voice prosthesis as determined by patient preference and satisfaction. In addition, the investigators will compare the SpeakFree to other modalities of stomal occlusion as determined by objective measures of speech and voice parameters (maximum phonation time, syllables per breath, minimum/maximum phonation pressures, and a clinician rating of voice quality using a visual analog scale).
Laryngeal Cancer|Laryngectomy
DEVICE: SpeakFree HME Hands Free Valve|OTHER: Digital Occlusion|DEVICE: Digital Depression HME
Satisfaction as measured by VAS, Patient preference and satisfaction will be measured using a visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging in score from 1-10 with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction with the device., Up to 1 month|Voice Quality: Patient Rating, Voice Quality will be measured using a visual Analog Scale ranging in score from 1-10 with a higher score indicating that the patient feels their voice quality is better with the device., Up to 1 month
Change in Maximum Phonation Time, Maximum phonation time (MPT) is a clinical measurement of the longest time a person can phonate a vowel in seconds., Baseline, 1 month|Change in Syllables Per Breath, Participants' number of syllables per breath while reading a standardized reading passage will be measured and reported., Baseline, 1 month|Pressure Needed to Phonate, Minimal and maximal pressures will be reported using a manometer while the participant counts from 1 to 15., Baseline|Change in Voice Quality: Clinician Rating, The clinician will rate participant's voice quality using VAS. VAS has a total score ranging from 1 to 10 with the higher score indicating that the clinician feels that participant's voice quality is better with the device., Baseline, 1 month
