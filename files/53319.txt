MOtiVating Endometrial Cancer Survivors With Activity Monitors and Tailored Feedback
Overweight and obese endometrial cancer (EC) survivors at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill will be approached for tailored feedback fitness intervention. The investigators plan to enroll 36 women (18 in each arm) to evaluate if receipt of weekly tailored feedback messages can improve physical activity in EC survivors. It is hypothesized that women receiving the feedback message intervention will increase step counts from baseline more than 2,000 steps compared to women in the non-intervention arm.
Endometrial Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Tailored Feedback Messages
Change in Steps in Endometrial Cancer Survivors During 12 Week Intervention, Steps recorded on a fitness tracker at week 1 and week 13, 13 weeks
Objectives:

* To assess if a tailored feedback fitness intervention can increase physical activity in EC survivors from baseline to 12 weeks post-baseline
* To determine the acceptability of the fitness intervention in EC survivors through a completion survey.
* To assess if a tailored feedback message fitness intervention can (1) decrease BMI, (2) reduce waitst to hip (W.H) ratios, (3) improve quality of life (QOL) and (4) improve serum metabolic markers (insulin, glucose and low density lipoprotein (LDL) in EC survivors.
