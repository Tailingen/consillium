Tumoral Circulating Cells and Colorectal Cancer Progression
Prospective research of circulating tumor cells as markers of progression risk in colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood and tumor samples
Evaluation of CTC features, Changes in the number of CTC with high risk to form metastasis, defined as an aggregation of phenotypic, molecular and functional characteristics., Group 1: at surgery, 4 (+/- 1) weeks post-surgery, at progression. Group 2: before chemotherapy, after 4 months treatment (responders), at progression. Group 3: before neoadjuvant surgery, at surgery, 4 (+/- 1) weeks post-surgery, at progression.
This study aims at allowing a better understanding of which circulating tumor cells (CTC) have the higher risk of metastasis of in the overall population of CTC.

Prospective monocenter open-label study.

In the frame of the management of the disease, blood samples will be collected at different times of treatment, regarding disease status (localized of stage II/III, metastatic non resectable, metastatic potentially resectable). Tissue samples will be collected for patients scheduled for surgery.
