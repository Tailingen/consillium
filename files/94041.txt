A Study of IBI110 in Combination With Sintilimab and Chemotherapy in Patients With Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
IBI110 is an investigational drug under evaluation for treatment of small cell lung cancer. The purpose of the study was to assess the Efficacy and Safety of IBI110 in combination with Sintilimab and chemotherapy with untreated ES-SCLC.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time interval from ra ndomization to the date of the first docu mented tumor progression, based on inve stigator assessments (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause, whichever come s first., Up to 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events(TRAE), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Immune-related adverse events (irAE) nation with sintilimab and EP in untreated ES-SCLC, Evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of IBI110 + sintilimab and EP in untreated ES-SCLC . Adverse events per CTCAE v5.0 criteria guidelines will be used to assess this outcome., Up to 5 years
Overall Survival(OS), OS: Defined as the time interval from ran domization to death., Up to 5 years|Objective response rate(ORR), ORR: Defined as the number of cases achi eving CR, or PR, as a percentage of patien ts with evaluable efficacy., Up to 5 years|Disease control rate(DCR);, DCR: The percentage of cases that achiev ed remission (PR+CR) and stable disease (SD) after treatment accounted for the n umber of evaluable cases., Up to 5 years|Duration of response(DOR);, DOR: Defined as the time from the first d ocumented objective response to the first documented progressive disease or deat h of any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|To assess the immunogenicity;, Immunogenicity: the immunogenicity: will be evaluated by determining the inciden ce of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and furt her testing ADA-positive serum specimen s for neutralizing antibody (Nab);, Up to 5 years|To assess the Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve(AUC) of IBI110+Sintilimab+EP, Up to 1 year|To assess the Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax) of IBI110+Sintilimab+EP, Up to 1 year|To assess the half-life(t1/2) of IBI110+Sintilimab+EP, Up to 1 year|To assess the clearance(CL) of IBI110+Sintilimab+EP, Up to 1 year|To assess the volume of distribution(V) of IBI110+Sintilimab+EP, Up to 1 year
This Phase II, multicenter, open-lable study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IBI110 (anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 \[LAG-3\] monoclonal antibody) and sintilimab (anti-programmed death 1 \[PD-1\] antibody) in combination with intravenous (IV) cisplatin/carboplatin plus (+) etoposide (EP) in treatment na√Øve patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) . Sixty eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the experimental arm or the control arm. The experimental arm will be IBI110+ sintilimab + EP Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by IBI110+ sintilimab Q3W until disease progression. The control arm will be sintilimab + EP Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by sintilimab Q3W until disease progression.
