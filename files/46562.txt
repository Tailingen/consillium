A Study for Identification of Predictive Immune Biomarker for Atezolizumab Therapy in NSCLC Patients
The study aimed to elucidate predictive immune related biomarker to the responsiveness to the PD-L1 blockade and evaluate the dynamics of immune cells in peripheral blood from NSCLC patients during atezolizumab treatment.

ORR(Objective response rate), The manner and interval of efficacy assessment for tumor scan will depends on the investigator's decision., Atezolizumab treatment will be given every 3 weeks up to progression or 1 year. The manner and interval of efficacy assessment for tumor scan will depends on the investigator's decision.|PFS(Progression free survival), The manner and interval of efficacy assessment for tumor scan will depends on the investigator's decision., Atezolizumab treatment will be given every 3 weeks up to progression or 1 year. The manner and interval of efficacy assessment for tumor scan will depends on the investigator's decision.|OS(Overall survival), Overall survival will be followed continuously while subjects are on the study drug and every 6 months after discontinuation or progression for up to 5 years following the start of therapy either by direct contact (office visits) or via telephone contact, until death, withdrawal of study consent, or lost to follow-up. Overall survival is defined as the time between the start of treatment and the date of death due to any cause., Overall survival will be followed continuously while subjects are on the study drug and every 6 months after discontinuation or progression for up to 5 years|Safety, Number of participants with adverse events and abnormal laboratory values as assessed by NCI-CTCAE version 5, local laboratory assessments should be done with prior to each atezolizumab dose Atezolizumab treatment will be given every 3 weeks up to progression or 1 year.
