Utility of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer After Focal Gland Treatment
To evaluate the effectiveness of a PSMA-PET scan in identifying recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy
Ability of Post-treatment PSMA-PET Scan to Detect Residual Disease
DRUG: 18F-rhPSMA-7.3
To evaluate the effectiveness of PSMA-PET scan in identifying recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy, All patients will get a biopsy to assess the effectiveness of treatment at 1 year, which is standard protocol at our institutions (all patients undergo biopsy at year 1 and 3 at our institutions). The post-treatment PSMA-PET scan will be correlated to 1-year biopsy results to study the utility of such a scan. Recurrence is defined by a positive PSMA-PET scan and positive biopsy in the area of PET scan tracer uptake at 1 year after SOC focal treatment., Approximately 1 year after SOC focal therapy.
To report the sensitivity and specificity in evaluating PSMA-PET scan, Sensitivity and specificity will be reported under the ROC and AUC analysis., Approximately 1 year after SOC focal therapy.
PSMA is a protein that is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, making it an excellent specific target for imaging with PET scans that can provide detailed information about the location, extent and aggressiveness of prostate cancer lesions. These scans have proven invaluable for identifying and characterizing prostate cancer, aiding in treatment planning, and Monitoring treatment response. It's true and fully utility in focal therapy for prostate cancer is unknown.
