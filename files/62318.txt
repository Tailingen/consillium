Assess the Efficacy and Safety of MYL-1402O Compared with Avastin®, in the First-line Treatment of Patients with Stage IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
NSCLC Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab as MYL-1402O|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab as Avastin
Primary Efficacy Analysis of Overall Response Rate ( ORR) of MYL-1402O as Compared to Avastin, The primary efficacy endpoint Overall Response Rate (ORR) will be based on best tumor responses as assessed by an independent review at any time point during the first 18 weeks, and assessed according to RECIST 1.1. The primary efficacy analysis is based on the ratio of the MYL-1402O ORR to the Avastin ORR at Week 18 based on the Intent to Treat ( ITT) set of patients., 18 weeks after first dosing per patient
MYL-1402O is a monoclonal antibody currently being developed by Mylan GmbH, as a proposed biosimilar to European Union and US licensed Avastin (hereafter referred to as Avastin), which is approved as first line treatment in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) for patients with Stage IV unresectable, recurrent or metastatic nsNSCLC. This randomized equivalence study is designed to meet the global regulatory requirement for approval of a biosimilar product. For this study, both MYL-1402O and Avastin are considered investigational medicinal products (IMP).
