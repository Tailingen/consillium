Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) and Neutralizing Antibody, Participants tested for immunogenicity to CAT-8015 (moxetumomab pasudotox) prior to enrollment, before each cycle and at end of study. The neutralization assay measures the capacity of participant's plasma (antibodies) to inhibit the binding of moxetumomab pasudotox to its target, cluster of differentiation 22 (CD22), coated onto enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. It was used as a direct surrogate for biological activity based on the mechanism of action of this drug.
