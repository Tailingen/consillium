Study of B7-H3-Specific CAR T Cell Locoregional Immunotherapy for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma/Diffuse Midline Glioma and Recurrent or Refractory Pediatric Central Nervous System Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study of central nervous system (CNS) locoregional adoptive therapy with autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lentivirally transduced to express a B7H3-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt. CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

A child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells. Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3 weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.

The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell locoregional therapy.

Establish the safety, defined by the adverse events, of B7H3-specific CAR T cell infusions delivered by a central nervous system (CNS) catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system, The type, frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events as a result of B7H3-specific CAR T cell infusion will be summarized, up to 7 months|Establish the feasibility, defined by the ability to produce and administer CAR T cell product, of B7H3-specific CAR T cell product infusions delivered by a central nervous system (CNS) catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system, The proportion of products successfully manufactured and infused will be measured, 28 days
Assess the distribution of CNS-delivered B7H3-specific CAR T cells distribution within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood, The trafficking of B7H3-specific CAR T cell product through the CSF by measuring remaining CAR T cells from a prior infusion at the time of each infusion and the trafficking of B7H3-specific CAR T cells from the CSF into the peripheral blood will be evaluated., up to 6 months|Assessment of disease response of B7H3-expressing DIPG and DMG tumors to B7H3 specific CAR T cell therapy delivered into the CNS, The response of DIPG and DMG tumors to B7H3-specific CAR T cell therapy delivered into the CNS will be determined by evaluating CSF for tumor cells and by CNS imaging with MRIs, up to 6 months|Assessment of disease response of B7H3-expressing refractory or recurrent central nervous system (CNS) tumors to B7H3 specific CAR T cell therapy delivered into the tumor cavity or into the CNS, The response of refractory or recurrent CNS tumors to B7H3-specific CAR T cell therapy delivered into the tumor cavity or into the CNS will be determined by evaluating CSF for tumor cells and by CNS imaging with MRIs, up to 6 months
Quantitative biomarker assessment of anti tumor CAR T cell functional activity, The presence of biomarkers of CAR T cell functional activity, such as cytokines, will be quantified via protein expression analysis in CSF. These findings will be correlated with safety determined by occurrence of adverse events, and response determined by disease evaluations via CSF cytology and MRI imaging of the CNS., up to 6 months
