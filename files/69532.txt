CVM-1118 and Sorafenib Combination in Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
CVM-1118 is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic by TaiRx, Inc. CVM-1118 is a potent anti-cancer agent in numerous human cancer cell lines. The safety of administrating CVM-1118 on human is evaluated from the phase 1 study. The objectives of the phase 2 study is to further investigate the efficacy of CVM-1118 with sorafenib for subjects with advanced hepatoma.

Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis. Although sorafenib is the first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC), patients developing resistance to sorafenib have been reported.

To meet the medical need, TaiRx, Inc. develops a new small molecule drug, CVM-1118 targeting the formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM). VM has been associated with tumor metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. VM is reported to be particularly active in tumor under hypoxia state when patients are treated with the potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor like sorafenib. Hence, the ability of inhibiting the VM network make CVM-1118 a potential good combination drug with sorafenib for advanced diseases.

The safety profile of CVM-1118 dosing has been established in the phase 1 study. The analysis of metabolism pathways further showed that the potential of CVM-1118 and sorafenib drug-drug interactions are very low.

Based on the mechanism of actions and the safety analysis of sorafenib and CVM-1118, the design of phase 2 trial with the combination therapy might have great potential for the patients with advanced HCC.
