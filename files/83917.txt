Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can include any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug., Up to 36 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs Graded Per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (CTCAE, v 4.03), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can include any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug. The severity of TEAEs was assessed by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 (CTCAE,v 4.03).

Injection site reactions were assessed in accordance with the 'Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials' (Food and Drug Administration \[FDA\] Guidance for Industry, September 2007). Local reaction to the injectable product such as pain, tenderness, erythema/redness and induration/swelling were graded on a 4-point scale where: 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe and 4 = Potentially life-threatening., Up to 36 weeks|Rates of Acute Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, or Other Chemoradiation Side Effects Above the Expected, Graded Per Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria, Up to 36 weeks|Change From Baseline in Hematocrit at the Indicated Time Points, Clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, serum chemistry, and creatine phosphokinase \[CPK\]) were analyzed using descriptive statistics for actual values and changes from baseline to each study visit., Baseline and Week 4, 8,12,16,24, 32 and 48|Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin at the Indicated Time Points, Clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, serum chemistry, creatine phosphokinase \[CPK\]) were analyzed using descriptive statistics for actual values and changes from baseline to each study visit., Baseline and Weeks 4, 8,12,16,24, 32 and 48|Change From Baseline in Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils and White Blood Cell (WBC) Count at the Indicated Time Points, Clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, serum chemistry, creatine phosphokinase \[CPK\]) were analyzed using descriptive statistics for actual values and changes from baseline to each study visit.
