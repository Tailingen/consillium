Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Chemotherapy in Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma (MK-3475-C93/KEYNOTE-C93/GOG-3064/ENGOT-en15)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) compared to a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel in women with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma who have not previously been treated with prior systemic chemotherapy.

The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab is superior to the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel with respect to Progression Free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and Overall Survival (OS).

BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: cisplatin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more lesions and the unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR will be reported for participants., Up to approximately 45 months|Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The OS will be reported for all participants., Up to approximately 59 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 45 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), DCR is defined, per RECIST 1.1, as the percentage of participants who have achieved Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or demonstrated Stable Disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.) The DCR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 45 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, for participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 45 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more lesions and the unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator will be reported for participants., Up to approximately 45 months|Progression-Free Survival 2 (PFS2) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.1 after initiation of a new anticancer therapy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more lesions and the unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD. The PFS2 per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator will be reported for participants., Up to approximately 45 months|Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research And Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (GHS) (Item 29) And Quality of Life (QoL) (Item 30) Combined Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 combined score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 25 months|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research And Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Physical Functioning (Items 1-5) Combined Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The change from baseline in Physical Functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5) score will be presented. A higher score indicates a better quality of life., Baseline and up to approximately 25 months
