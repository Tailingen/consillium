Effect of Serotonin Level on Constipation Caused by Chemotherapy in Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
RATIONALE: Gathering information about changes in serotonin levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer may help doctors learn more about constipation caused by chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how blood levels of serotonin effect constipation caused by chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

Alterations in serotonin levels associated with increased constipation, Once the blood is drawn at the time of another necessary blood draw, the specimen will be labeled as a send out lab in the acute care lab. These are frozen and batched. Batched samples will then be sent to an outside laboratory for serotonin measurements., PreDose, Post 3rd Cycle, Post Treatment and 4 Months Post Treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if there are any alterations in serotonin levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and if this is associated with increased constipation.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to beginning of planned postoperative chemotherapy, after 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy, and at the 3-month surveillance visit. Patients also complete a bowel function questionnaire at these time points.
