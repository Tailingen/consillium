Camrelizumab With AC in Patients With Brain Metastases of Driven Gene-negative,NSCLC
The primary hypothesis is that camrelizumab in combination with pemetrexed/ carboplatin will present a better efficacy for treatment of first line metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and minimize the risk of toxicity
Non-squamous Non-small-cell Lung Cancer|Brain Metastases
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin
Intracranial Objective Response Rate (iORR), iORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response(PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) of intracranial lesion according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, 1 year
Intracranial Progression-Free Survival(iPFS), Intracranial Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the first occurrence of progression in intracranial lesions according to modified RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, 3.5year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, 3.5year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the first occurrence of progression of overall disease or death from any cause, 3.5year|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) in the treatment of Camrelizumab combined with pemetrexed / carboplatin for patients with brain metastasis according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03, 3.5year
This is a prospective, open-label, phase Ⅱ studyto evaluate the efficacy and safetyof camrelizumab combined with pemetrexed/ carboplatin in participants with brain metastases ofnon-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.Paticipant was confirmed without EGFR activating mutation or ALK fusion, and received no prior systemic therapy.Patients would receive camrelizumab in combination with pemetrexed/ carboplatin for 4 cycles，followed by camrelizumab and pemetrexed as maitenance treatment until progression, camrelizumab will be administered no more than 24 months. PD-L1 expression assessed with 22C3 pharmDx assay will be used as a stratification factor.
