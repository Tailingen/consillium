A Phase 2 Study of Ramucirumab (LY3009806) in Participants With Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of administering various dose regimens of ramucirumab in participants with advanced gastric cancer whose disease has progressed during or following prior chemotherapy.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Ramucirumab
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Ramucirumab, The Cmin is the minimum observed serum concentration of ramucirumab., Day 29, 43, 71 and 85: predose
Immunogenicity: Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Number of participants with positive treatment emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies was summarized by treatment group. A treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TEADA) sample was defined as: a post treatment sample with at least a 4-fold increase in titer from pre treatment sample; or 1:20 post treatment titer for participants that had no detectable ADA titer at baseline., Predose Cycle 1 Through Short Term Follow Up (Up to 5 Months)|Rate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) at the First 6-Week Tumor Assessment, PFS defined as the time from first day of therapy to first evidence of disease progression per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause up to the first 6-week tumor assessment. Progressive Disease (PD) is at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,taking as reference smallest sum on study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm.Appearance of 1 or more new lesions was also considered progression. Nontarget PD is unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.Appearance of 1 or more new nontarget lesions was also considered PD.Participants with no baseline disease assessment: PFS time was censored at the randomization date,regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death has been observed., Baseline until the first 6-week tumor assessment
