A Study of BMS-986218 or BMS-986218 Plus Nivolumab in Combination With Docetaxel in Participants With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and toxicity of docetaxel alone, in combination with BMS-986218, or in combination with nivolumab plus BMS-986218 in men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that progressed after novel antiandrogen therapy and have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC.
