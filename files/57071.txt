Phase 1/2a Study of Cancer Vaccine to Treat Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of PVX-410, (a cancer vaccine), treatment regimen for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide.
Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: PVX-410
All adverse events will be recorded., Throughout treatment phase (3 months) and follow up period (12 months)
Immune response to the vaccine will be measured, Patient blood samples will be measured for immune response through ELISPOT and Pentamer assays., Designated timepoints during the treatment phase (3 months) and follow up phase (12 months)
Clinical Response will be measured., Clinical response will be determined by the treating physician according to the International Myeloma Working Group Disease Response Criteria., Designated timepoints during the treatment phase (3 months) and follow up phase (12 months)
This is a dose escalation, phase 1/2a study to assess the safety and tolerability of PVX-410, (a multi-peptide cancer vaccine), treatment regimen in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide.. Approximately 22 patients will receive six (6) bi-weekly, subcutaneous injections of PVX-410 for a total of twelve (12) weeks of treatment. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Tolerability, immunogenicity and clinical response will also be measured as described in the protocol.
