Neoadjuvant Durvalumab Alone Versus Durvalumab With Olaparib in Patients Ineligible for Cisplatin With Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder Followed by Radical Cystectomy
This study is a phase II, randomized, open-label, clinical trial including patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder candidates for radical cystectomy. The study will include patients ineligible for cisplatin.

Patients will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive durvalumab plus olaparib (Arm A) or durvalumab alone (Arm B).

The clinical study´s hypothesis is that for patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who are not fit for cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Durvalumab monotherapy will have a similar efficacy to historical chemotherapy controls and Durvalumab in combination with olaparib will be associated with an even improved efficacy results in terms of pathologic complete response (pCR).
