Pre-Operative Staging of Pancreatic Cancer Using Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SPIO MRI)
The purpose of this research study is to see if a specific kind of MRI, called Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging (USPIO MRI), which uses an FDA-approved therapeutic agent(Feraheme) to see if it is able to identify small and otherwise undetectable lymph node metastases in people who have pancreatic cancer and are scheduled for surgical resection.

To Determine the Sensitivity High Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Lymphotrophic Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles to Identify Small and Otherwise Undetectable Lymph Node Metastases., Using Pathology as the gold standard the excised nodes were correlated and the percentage of positive cases were measured on the post contrast exam. Sensitivity is the percentage of positive cases (i.e., metastases confirmed using pathology) identified as positive., 3 years|To Determine the Specificity of High Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Lymphotrophic Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles to Identify Small and Otherwise Undetectable Lymph Node Metastases., Using Pathology as the gold standard the excised nodes were correlated and the percentage of true negative nodes were measured on the post contrast exam. Specificity is the percentage of true negative cases as identified as negative., 3 years
* On the first day, study participants will undergo 2 MRI examinations. A scan will be done prior to administration of the contrast agent (Feraheme) and then a second scan immediately after administration. On the second day, study participants will be asked to return for a third MRI.
* All MRI scans will be done at Massachusetts General Hospital.
