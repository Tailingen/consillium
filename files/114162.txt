A Study of Serum Folate Levels in Patients Treated With Olaparib
This is a study investigating folate deficiency (lack of folic acid in the blood) in patients who take the drug olaparib to treat their advanced ovarian or breast cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Breast Cancer|Folic Acid Deficiency
DRUG: Folic Acid Tablet
Frequency of Folate Deficiency, The frequency of folate deficiency in patients with ovarian and breast cancers who are treated with olaparib will be measured., Up to approximately 2 years|Timing of Folate Deficiency, The timing of folate deficiency in patients with ovarian and breast cancers who are treated with olaparib will be measured., Up to approximately 2 years
Complete Blood Count (CBC), To evaluate the effect of folic acid supplementation on hemoglobin level, CBC will be measured every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, and then monthly thereafter for duration of olaparib therapy. Hematological toxicity will be assessed by utilizing CTC Version 4.0., Up to approximately 2 years|Serum folate, To evaluate the effect of folic acid supplementation on serum folate levels, serum folate will be measured every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, and then monthly thereafter for duration of olaparib therapy., Up to approximately 2 years|Number of required blood tranfusions, The number of blood transfusions during olaparib treatment will be measured., Up to approximately 2 years|Number of olaparib dose interruptions, The number of interruptions in olaparib treatment will be measured., Up to approximately 2 years|Number of olaparib dose reductions, The number of reductions in olaparib treatment will be measured., Up to approximately 2 years|Number of olaparib discontinuations, The number of subjects who have their olaparib treatments discontinued will be measured., Up to approximately 2 years|Response Rate to olaparib, The response rate will be assessed by treating physicians. The data on the response rate will be collected and correlated with hematologic toxicity, serum folate level, and folic acid supplementation., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Investigators will compare progression free survival in Lynparza- treated patient with folate deficiency who were subsequently treated with folic acid to those who did not develop folate deficiency and did not require supplementation., Up to approximately 2 years
This is a study investigating folate deficiency (lack of folic acid in the blood) in patients who take the drug olaparib to treat their advanced ovarian or breast cancer. The primary goal of this study is to determine the frequency and timing of folate deficiency, and to learn more about whether giving folic acid supplements (vitamins) will help delay or avoid deficiency in these patients. Deficiency can cause doctors to reduce or stop treatment with olaparib. In this case, patients are not getting the best treatment for their cancer due to the unwanted side effect.
