A Study of Combination Therapy With Amivantamab and Cetrelimab in Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 (combination) dose (RP2CD) of the amivantamab and cetrelimab combination therapy in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Phase 1 (combination dose selection); and to evaluate the antitumor effect of the combination at the selected RP2CD in participants with NSCLC characterized on the basis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Programmed-cell death Ligand (PD-L)1 status, in the Phase 2 (expansion).
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Cetrelimab|DRUG: Amivantamab
Phase 1: Number of Participants with Adverse events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 3 months|Phase 1: Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, hematological toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, liver enzyme elevation, treatment delay greater than (\>) 28 days due to unresolved toxicity, or immune-related toxicity requiring the use of therapies in excess of corticosteroids., Up to Cycle 1 (Day 1 through Day 28)|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as per investigator assessment., Up to 2 years 3 months
Phase 1 and Phase 2: Number of Participants with AEs by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. Severity will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 3 months|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Number of Participants with Abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Number of participants with abnormalities in clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, serology, and urinalysis) will be reported., Up to 2 years 3 months|Phase 2 : Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (PR or CR) until the date of documented progression or death from any case, whichever comes first, for participants who have PR or CR. If a participant does not progress following a response, then his/her duration of response will be censored at the date of last evaluable disease assessment. Participants who started a subsequent anticancer therapy in the absence of progression will be censored at the last disease assessment before or on the start of subsequent therapy., Up to 2 years 3 months|Phase 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a PR, CR, or stable disease using RECIST version 1.1 by investigator review., Up to 2 years 3 months|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose date until the date of disease progression or death, whichever comes first, based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1. Participants who have not progressed or have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of their last evaluable RECIST v1.1 assessment., Up to 2 years 3 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of administration of the first study treatment until the date of death due to any cause. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive., Up to 2 years 3 months
