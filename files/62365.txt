Clinical Study on PET Imaging, Distribution and PK of 89Zr-CD147 in Patients With Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to observe the distribution of 89Zr-CD147 and radiation dosimetry characteristics in patients with solid tumors. The secondary objective is to observe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 89Zr-CD147 in patients with solid tumors. This study is a single-center, open-lable study, including 89Zr-CD147 1mCi±10%，89Zr-CD147 3mCi±10% and 89Zr-CD147 5mCi±10% dose group. The trial is expected to last for 2 years from the first patient signing the consent form to the end of the trial.

Antibody based positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) imaging is of increasing importance to visualize and characterize tumor lesions. Additionally, it can be used to identify patients who may benefit from a particular therapy and monitor the therapy outcome.
