Phase 1 of EC1169 In Patients With Recurrent MCRPC
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of EC1169 and the best dose to use in humans in future studies. This study will also determine how EC1169 is distributed, broken down, passed and absorbed through your body and how quickly it is eliminated (leaves the body). All patients will receive EC1169.

As a secondary objective in Part A: To explore the relationships between baseline PSMA expression (tumor and patient level) as measured by 99mTc-EC0652 scans and the antitumor activity of EC1169.

As an exploratory objective in Part B: To assess EC0652 as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of EC1169 by comparing PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative lesions for response.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: EC1169|OTHER: EC0652
PART A: Maximum Tolerated Dose of EC1169, Review to see if there are any (Dose Limiting Toxicities) seen in cycle 1., Patients will be followed for an anticipated 21 days for occurence of DLTs|PART B:To identify the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in taxane-naïve and taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC, To identify the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in taxane-naïve and taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC patients receiving treatment with EC1169., Patients will be followed until progression of disease or no longer clinically benefiting for an anticipated 27 weeks (9 cycles)
PART A: Safety/adverse event review, Adverse Events reviewed weekly and at end of each cycle (every 21 days), Patients will be followed until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity for an anticipated 12 weeks (4 cycles)|PART B: To evaluate time to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3)-defined NLCB (no longer clinically benefiting), To evaluate time to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3)-defined NLCB (no longer clinically benefiting), Patients will be followed until progression of disease or no longer clinically benefiting for an anticipated 27 weeks (9 cycles)|PART B: To evaluate the median progression-free survival [defined as the time from C1D1 to an event (i.e., radiological or clinical progression or death)] for each cohort, To evaluate the median progression-free survival \[defined as the time from C1D1 to an event (i.e., radiological or clinical progression or death)\] for each cohort, Patients will be followed until progression of disease or no longer clinically benefiting for an anticipated 27 weeks (9 cycles)
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, oncology study to conducted in 2 parts. Part A is a dose-escalation phase to determine the Recommended Phase 2 (RP2) dose and the following :

* Evaluate the administration of EC1169 QW on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule
* Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of EC1169 and EC0652
* To assess preliminary efficacy results in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and previously treated with a taxane.

The primary objective of Part B is to identify the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in taxane-naïve and taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC patients receiving treatment with EC1169.
