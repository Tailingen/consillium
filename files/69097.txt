BAY43-9006 - Phase II Study in Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC)
The purpose of the study is to evaluate if BAY43-9006 has an effect on the tumors, how long the effect continues, if the patients receiving BAY43-9006 will live longer.

* If BAY43-9006 has an effect on the quality of life of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
* If BAY43-9006 helps to slow the worsening of non-small cell lung cancer.
* If BAY43-9006 prevents the growth of, or shrinks non-small cell lung tumors and/or their metastases.

Anti-cancer Activity (eg, Percentage of Patients With Confirmed Complete Responses (CR) and Partial Responses (PR) Per RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) Criteria in Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), CR-disappearance of clinical/radiological tumor evidence (target/nontarget). PR- \>=30% decrease in sum longest diameter (LD) of target lesions from BL sum LD. Stable disease (SD)-no shrinkage for PR nor increase for PD. Progressive disease (PD) measurement proven- \>=20% increase in sum LD of lesions from smallest sum LD since start or new lesions. Progression by clinical judgement- \>clinically meaningful cancer-related deterioration as judged by the investigator., First patient first treatment until date for last data collection for efficacy for a study period up to 62 weeks. Tumor assessed per RECIST at baseline (BL), every 8 weeks during treatment and at end of treatment.
Duration of Stable Disease, Duration of stable disease was calculated as date of first treatment until date of documented progressive disease (PD) or last observation if subject did not progress. Stable disease (SD) defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Kaplan-Meier methodology, descriptive analysis., First patient first treatment until date for last data collection for efficacy for a study period up to 62 weeks. Tumor assessed per RECIST at baseline (BL), every 8 weeks during treatment and at end of treatment.|Overall Survival, Overall survival was calculated from the date of the first treatment until death of the subject.

Evaluation by Kaplan-Meier methodology, descriptive analysis., First patient first treatment until date for last data collection for efficacy for a study period up to 62 weeks.|Percentage of Subjects With Stable Disease (SD), Percentage of subjects with stable disease was calculated from date of first treatment until date of documented progressive disease (PD) or last observation if subject did not progress. Stable disease (SD) defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Descriptive summary of subjects with SD., First patient first treatment until date for last data collection for efficacy for a study period up to 62 weeks. Tumor assessed per RECIST at baseline (BL), every 8 weeks during treatment and at end of treatment.|Change From Baseline of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Score Assessed at Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and End of Treatment (EOT), HRQoL was assessed with the FACT-L questionnaire, a validated instrument for determining lung cancer HRQoL. The 36-item questionnaire includes 4 domains: Physical, functional, emotional, and social/family well-being, and a lung cancer-specific subscale. The FACT-L total score ranges from 1 to 136. Lower scores (negative change from baseline) demonstrate impaired HRQoL., From first patient first treatment until date of last efficacy data collection (study period up to 62 weeks). HRQoL assessed at baseline (BL), end of treatment Cycles 2 and 4, and at end of treatment
In addition to the key secondary outcome parameters several potential biomarkers were evaluated as exploratory parameters.
