Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of JWCAR029 in Adult Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CD19 CAR) T cells in adult patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
