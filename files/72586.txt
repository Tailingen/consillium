A Study of AL101 Monotherapy in Patients With Notch Activated Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AL101 monotherapy in subjects with Notch-activated recurrent or metastatic TNBC; Notch activation will be determined by a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) test.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: AL101
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) as assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 for target lesions assessed by MRI.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., 12 month
Clinical Benefit Response Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit response rate (CBR) is defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) by investigator review based on RECIST v1.1 for target lesions assessed by MRI.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage (at least 30%) to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase (more than 20%) to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters., 12 month|Duration of Response (DOR) by Investigator Review Based on RECIST v1.1, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response., 12 month
