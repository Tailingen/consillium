An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 1b/2 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of KRT-232 When Administered Alone and in Combination With Low-Dose Cytarabine (LDAC) or Decitabine in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study evaluates KRT-232, a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of MDM2, when administered alone and in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or Decitabine for the treatment of adults with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and AML secondary to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Participants must be relapsed/refractory (having failed prior therapy) and will be assigned to receive monotherapy (KRT-232 alone) or combination therapy (KRT-232 with LDAC or KRT-232 with Decitabine).
Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Secondary to Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)
DRUG: KRT-232|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Decitabine
Part A: To determine KRT-232 recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of KRT-232 in combination with cytarabine or decitabine, 28 Days|Part B: To determine the RP2D of KRT-232, The safety review committee (SRC) will determine the RP2D based on safety and tolerability data obtained from each arm, 2 years after last patient enrolled
Part A: To determine the rates of complete remission (CR) and complete remission with partial hematological improvement (CRh), Proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR) or complete remission with partial hematological improvement (CRh) as determined by Modified 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) response criteria, 12 weeks|Part B: To determine the rates of complete remission (CR), CR with partial hematological improvement (CRh) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), Proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR), complete remission with partial hematological improvement (CRh), and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) as determined by Modified 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) response criteria, 12 weeks
