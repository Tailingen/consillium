Quilting Sutures After Mastectomy
The use of wound drains after mastectomy is common practice in Belgium. However, placement of suction drainage has several disadvantages. Skin bacteria can enter via the drain and cause infection, or the drain itself can cause discomfort and a need for daily nursing. After drain removal, seroma is the most common complication following breast cancer surgery. Seromas are collections of serous fluid that frequently develop under the skin or in the axillary space formed after mastectomy and/or axillary lymph node dissection, resulting from surgical trauma to blood/lymphatic vessels and post-traumatic inflammation. Seroma formation can cause discomfort and limitations in shoulder function. Moreover, it is associated with surgical site infections, often requires treatment and increases healthcare consumption. Wound healing problems might be a cause of postponement of adjuvant therapy.

The quilting suture technique, in which the skin is sutured to the pectoralis muscle and drain placement is not needed, may lead to a significant reduction of seroma with a decrease in the number of aspirations and surgical site infections.

In this national multicentric study, we will compare mastectomy with placement of suction drains, a standard technique used in the vast majority of Belgian hospitals, with the new quilting suture technique without placement of suction drains. We will focus on 3 distinct primary outcomes:

* Pain of the mastectomy area 6 months after surgery
* Upper limb function 6 months after surgery
* Cosmetic outcome scored by the patient 6 months after surgery.

The goal of this study is to demonstrate the absence of long-term negative effects of the quilting suture technique on shoulder function, cosmetic outcome, and pain management.

Pain in the mastectomy area scored by VAS, A non-inferiority margin of 10 mm was adopted, which implies that a difference between both arms up to 10 mm in favour of the standard approach would be clinically acceptable, 6 months postoperative|Upper limb function scored by QuickDASH, A non-inferiority margin of 10 points was adopted, which implies that a difference between both arms up to 10 points in favour of the standard approach would be clinically acceptable., 6 months postoperative|Cosmetic outcome scored by the patient on a 10-point scale, A non-inferiority margin of 1 point on the 10-point scale was adopted which implies that a difference between both arms up to 1 point in favour of the standard approach would be clinically acceptable, 6 months postoperative
