LDK378 in Patients With ALK Positive NSCLC Previously Treated With Alectinib.
This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the ALK inhibitor LDK378 when used as single agent in patients with ALK-rearranged stage IIIB or IV NSCLC previously treated with alectinib. Treatment with LDK378 750 mg qd continued until the patient experienced disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity that precluded further treatment, pregnancy, start of a new anticancer therapy, discontinued treatment at the discretion of the patient or investigator, lost to follow-up, death, or study was terminated by Sponsor.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: LDK378
Overall Response Rate (ORR) to LDK378 by Investigator Assessment, ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the whole body as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by the investigator. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, or patient withdrawal up to 798 days
Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR, calculated as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) evaluated by investigator per RECIST 1.1; CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters; SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progressive disease (PD); PD: taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., 6 cycles of 28 days up to 798 days|Time to Tumor Response (TTR), TTR, calculated as the time from first dose of LDK378 to first documented response (CR or PR) evaluated by investigator per RECIST 1.1 for participants with confirmed PR or CR., 6 cycles of 28 days up to 798 days|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, calculated as the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression evaluated by investigator per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, 6 cycles of 28 days up to 798 days|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, calculated as the time from first dose of LDK378 to date of first documented disease progression evaluated by investigator per RECIST 1.1 or date of death due to any cause, 6 cycles of 28 days up to 798 days|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the start date of study drug to the date of death due to any cause., 6 cycles of 28 days up to 798 days|Overall Intracranial Response Rate (OIRR), OIRR, calculated as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR in the brain assessments for participants having measurable brain metastases at baseline, 6 cycles of 28 days up to 798 days
Study completed as per protocol. 'Switched to commercial drug' implies that after the primary and secondary objectives were achieved, one patient continued the study treatment as they did not meet the progression disease or AE to be discontinued from the treatment. But after the regulatory approval, Novartis decided to close the study, the 1 patient switched to commercially available drug.
