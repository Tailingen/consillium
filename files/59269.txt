Dexamethasone Versus Dexmedetomidine as Adjuncts to Serratus Anterior Plane Block
Modified radical mastectomy is the most commonly performed surgical approach for breast cancer. The procedure enables surgeons to remove the main tumor mass, adjacent glandular tissue and regional lymph nodes. Moreover, it provides a cosmetic outcome that clearly surpasses the standard radical mastectomy and allows subsequent breast reconstruction with favorable results.

The present randomized study aims to compare the postoperative analgesic effects of dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine as adjuncts to serratus anterior plane block in women undergoing modified radical mastectomy.

Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) with ultrasound guidance is a fascial plane block that proved to be feasible, safe and effective tool for reduction of postoperative pain after thoracic and breast surgeries. In multiple instances, SAPB is used with additional adjuncts e.g. dexamethasone or dexmedetomidine to improve analgesic potency and duration.
