A Study of TAR-200 Versus Intravesical Chemotherapy in Participants With Recurrent High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (HR-NMIBC) After Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
The purpose of this study is to compare disease free survival (DFS) in participants with recurrence of papillary-only high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) within 1 year of last dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy and who refused or are unfit for Radical Cystectomy (RC), receiving TAR-200 versus investigator's choice of single agent intravesical chemotherapy.
Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Neoplasms
DRUG: TAR-200|DRUG: Mitomycin C|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS will be measured as the time from randomization to the time of the first recurrence of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) \[high grade (HG) Ta, any T1 or carcinoma in situ (CIS)\], progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 6 years 7 months
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), RFS will be measured as the time from randomization to the time of the first recurrence of HR-NMIBC (HG Ta, any T1 or CIS), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 6 years 7 months|Time to Next Intervention (TTNI), TTNI will be measured as the time from randomization to the time of next intervention (localized or systemic) for the treatment of bladder cancer., Up to 6 years 7 months|Time to Disease Worsening (TTDW), TTDW is measured as the time from randomization to cystectomy, systemic therapy, or radiation therapy (treatments of disease worsening)., Up to 6 years 7 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP will be measured as the time from randomization to the time of first documented evidence of disease progression (that is, progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer \[MIBC\] \[T greater than or equal to {\>=} 2\], lymph node \[N+\], or distant disease \[M+\]), or death due to disease progression, whichever occurs first., Up to 6 years 7 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death, due to any cause., Up to 6 years 7 months|DFS Rate at 12 and 24 Months, DFS rate that is percentage of participants with DFS at 12 and 24 months will be reported., At 12 and 24 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) According to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Number of participants with AEs by severity grade as assessed by CTCAE version 5 will be reported. Grade refers to the severity of AE as follows: Grade 1- Mild; Grade 2- Moderate; Grade 3- Severe; Grade 4- Life-threatening; Grade 5- Death related to adverse event., Up to 6 years 7 months|Number of Participants With Change from Baseline in Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with change from baseline in laboratory abnormalities (including hematology, clinical chemistry and routine urinalysis) will be reported., Up to 6 years 7 months|Number of Participants With Change from Baseline in Vital Signs Abnormalities, Number of participants with change from baseline in vital signs including temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) (supine) will be reported., Up to 6 years 7 months|Change from Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) - C30 Scores, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire for evaluating the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of participants participating in cancer clinical studies. It includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea or vomiting), and a global health status or HRQoL scale. Ratings for each item range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much)., Up to 5 years|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ- Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) 24 Scores, EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 is a 24-item questionnaire for evaluating the HRQoL of participants with NMIBC. The questionnaire is designed to supplement the QLQ-C30 and incorporates 6 multi-item scales (urinary symptoms, malaise, future worries, bloating and flatulence, sexual function and male sexual problems) and 5 single items (intravesical treatment issues, sexual intimacy, worries about risk of contaminating partner, sexual enjoyment, and female sexual problems). Ratings for each item range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much)., Up to 5 years|Proportion of Participants With Meaningful Change in EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 Scores, Proportion of participants with meaningful change in EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 scores will be reported., Up to 5 years
The purpose of this study is to compare disease free survival (DFS) in participants with recurrence of papillary-only high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) within 1 year of last dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy and who refused or are unfit for Radical Cystectomy (RC), receiving TAR-200 versus investigator's choice of single agent intravesical chemotherapy.
