A Study of PRT1419 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT1419, a myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) inhibitor, in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this study is to define the dosing schedule, maximally tolerated dose and/or estimate the optimal biological dose to be used in subsequent development of PRT1419.
Multiple Myeloma|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: PRT1419
To describe dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of PRT1419, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated through the first cycle, Baseline through Day 28|To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and/or optimal biological dose (OBD), The MTD and/or OBD will be established for further investigation in participants with multiple myeloma, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, Baseline through approximately 2 years|To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of PRT1419, The RP2D will be established for further investigation in participants with multiple myeloma, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, Baseline through approximately 2 years
To describe the adverse event profile and tolerability of PRT1419, Adverse events as characterized by type, frequency, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study therapy, Baseline through approximately 2 years|To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of PRT1419, PRT1419 pharmacokinetics will be calculated including the maximum observed plasma concentration, Baseline through approximately 2 years|To describe any anti-tumor activity of PRT1419, Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 will be based on the measurement of objective responses, Baseline through approximately 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL1 inhibitor, evaluating patients in two cohorts as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap syndrome. Cohort A will evaluate PRT1419 administered as monotherapy in patients with either AML, CMML and/or high-risk MDS or MDS/MPN overlap. Cohort B will evaluate PRT1419 administered as monotherapy in patients with NHL or MM. The study will employ a "3+3" dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a dose limiting toxicity is identified.
