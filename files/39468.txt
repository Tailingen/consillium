Evaluation of AK104 (Cadonilimab) Combined with Chemotherapy for Recurrent or Metastatic Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Cervix
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AK104 (Cadonilimab) combined with chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin, and etoposide) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Is AK104 (Cadonilimab) combined with chemotherapy effective in treating recurrent or metastatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix? What side effects or medical issues do participants experience while taking AK104?

Participants will:

Receive AK104 (10 mg/kg) combined with either cisplatin (75 mg/m²) or carboplatin (AUC 5) and etoposide (100 mg/m²) every three weeks for up to six cycles.

After chemotherapy, continue with AK104 (10 mg/kg every three weeks) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator decision, withdrawal of consent, death, or other reasons specified in the protocol, with a maximum treatment duration of 24 months.

Undergo tumor assessments every 6 weeks (±7 days) for the first 48 weeks after the first dose, and every 12 weeks (±7 days) thereafter.

Participants who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will continue with follow-up for disease status as much as possible, until they begin another anticancer therapy, experience disease progression, withdraw consent, die, or the study ends, whichever occurs first.

Researchers will evaluate the safety of AK104 by assessing adverse events (AEs) using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grading system, and determine their relationship to the drug. Depending on the severity of the AEs and their relationship to the drug, researchers will take appropriate measures and provide additional treatments to ensure participant safety.

After completing treatment, participants will have a safety follow-up visit (90 days after the last dose) and then participate in survival follow-up every 3 months to collect survival information and information on subsequent anticancer treatments until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.
Cervix Cancer|Cadonilimab|Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Cervix
Safety of Cadonilimab Combined with Chemotherapy in Treating Recurrent or Metastatic Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Cervix, The number of participants who experience treatment-related adverse events (graded according to CTCAE v4.0) during treatment will be measured. Data will include the type, severity, and frequency of adverse events., At least 3 months from the start of the study to the end of treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of participants achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by RECIST v1.1 criteria., At least 6 months after the end of treatment.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause, measured using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression will be determined according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., At least 6 months after the end of treatment|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the start of treatment to death from any cause, measured using the Kaplan-Meier method., At least 12 months after the end of treatment.
