Safety and Efficacy of MAGE-A3/A6 T Cell Receptor Engineered T Cells (KITE-718) in HLA-DPB1*04:01 Positive Adults With Advanced Cancers
The primary objectives of Phase 1A are to evaluate the safety of KITE-718, determine a recommended Phase 1B dose, and to evaluate the efficacy of KITE-718 in Phase 1B.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: KITE-718|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DEVICE: MAGE - A3/A6 Screening Test
Phase 1A - Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events Defined as Dose-Limiting Toxicities, Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as protocol-defined KITE-718 related events with onset within the first 21 days following KITE-718 infusion., Up to 21 days|Phase 1B - Efficacy: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as complete response + partial response for participants evaluated by RECIST v1.1 and very good partial response (VGPR) or better for multiple myeloma participants evaluated by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Consensus Panel 1 Criteria., Up to year 2 for solid tumor participants and up to Year 5 for multiple myeloma participants
Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who experience an objective response, DOR is defined as the time from the date of their first objective response to the date of disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 or consensus panel 1 criteria or death regardless of cause., Up to year 2 for solid tumor participants and up to year 5 for multiple myeloma participants|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the KITE-718 infusion date to the date of disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 or consensus panel 1 criteria or death from any cause., Up to year 2 for solid tumor participants and up to year 5 for multiple myeloma participants|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from KITE-718 infusion to the date of death., Up to 15 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, Up to 15 years|Percentage of Participants with Anti-KITE-718 Antibodies, Up to 2 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Replication-competent Retrovirus (RCR), Up to 2 years|Levels of MAGE-A3/A6 TCR-transduced T Cells in Blood, Up to 2 years
Participants found to be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DPB1\*04:01 positive and whose tumors are MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6 positive can participate if all eligibility criteria are met. Other tests required to determine eligibility include a physical exam, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) of the heart, CT or MRI scans, and blood draws. Eligible participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis. These cells are genetically modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-718. The desired outcome is that the genetically modified T cells will target tumor cells that express MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6, which are proteins that can be expressed by cancer cells. Participants receive chemotherapy prior to the KITE-718 infusion. After the KITE-718 infusion, participants will be followed for side effects and have scans performed to see any potential impact on their cancers. Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized and/or in the outpatient setting. Subjects who received an infusion of KITE-718 will complete the remainder of the 15 year follow-up assessments in a separate long-term follow-up study, KT-US-982-5968
