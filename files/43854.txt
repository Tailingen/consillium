Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of IV Doses of BMS-906024 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of BMS-906024 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who no longer respond to or have relapsed from standard therapies.
Cancer
DRUG: BMS-906024
Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Weekly assessments until study discontinuation due to disease progression or unacceptable adverse event as well as an assessment 30 day after treatment discontinuation with an average time on study expected to be <1 year
Tumor assessments using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Tumor assessments at least every 8 weeks during treatment period|PD changes from baseline in the expression of Notch pathway-related genes in surrogate tissues (peripheral blood cells) and tumor biopsies, PD changes from baseline during the first 4-5 weeks of dosing|PK parameters for BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557, maximum observed concentration (Cmax), PK at multiple time points during the first 8 weeks of dosing|PK parameters for BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557, minimum observed concentration (Cmin), PK at multiple time points during the first 8 weeks of dosing|PK parameters for BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557, time to reach maximum observed concentration (Tmax), PK at multiple time points during the first 8 weeks of dosing|PK parameters for BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557, terminal phase elimination half-life (T-Half), PK at multiple time points during the first 8 weeks of dosing|PK parameters for BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557, accumulation index (AI), PK at multiple time points during the first 8 weeks of dosing|PK parameters for BMS-906024 and its metabolite BMS-911557, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), PK at multiple time points during the first 8 weeks of dosing
