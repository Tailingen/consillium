Dose Escalation, Expansion Study of Vofatamab (B-701) in Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase 1/2(b), sequential, dose escalation, open-label, randomized expansion, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of vofatamab alone or in combination with docetaxel, or versus docetaxel in FGFR3 mutant/fusion subjects with Stage IV, locally advanced or metastatic UCC who have relapsed after, or are refractory to at least one prior line of chemotherapy. This study is divided into 3 phases: Phase 1b (Cohort 1), Phase 2 (Cohorts 2 and 3), and Phase 2b (Monotherapy Expansion Phase and Randomized Phase).
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma|Urinary Bladder Disease|Urological Diseases
DRUG: Vofatamab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Primary Efficacy Outcome: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Efficacy of vofatamab plus docetaxel, compared with docetaxel plus placebo, and vofatamab alone as measured by PFS; measured from randomization to first occurrence of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death, whichever occurs first. A patient has had to receive at least one vofatamab dose. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 3-4 years
This is a Phase 1/2(b), sequential, dose escalation, open-label, randomized expansion, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of vofatamab alone or in combination with docetaxel, or versus docetaxel in FGFR3 mutant/fusion subjects with Stage IV, locally advanced or metastatic UCC who have relapsed after, or are refractory to at least one prior line of chemotherapy. Vofatamab is a novel monoclonal antibody specific for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) that is being developed to target FGFR3-positive tumors.

This study is divided into 3 phases: Phase 1b (Cohort 1), Phase 2 (Cohorts 2 and 3), and Phase 2b (Monotherapy Expansion Phase and Randomized Phase).
