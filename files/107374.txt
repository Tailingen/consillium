A Dose Escalating Study of SGX942 for Oral Mucositis in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SGX942 in patients receiving chemoradiation treatment for the treatment of head and neck cancer.
Oral Mucositis
DRUG: SGX942|DRUG: Placebo
Duration of Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM), Duration of SOM was defined as the number of days from the onset of SOM until resolution of SOM. If the patient did not meet the requirements for resolution of SOM by the 1-month follow up visit, he/she was considered censored at the 1-month follow-up visit (or point of discontinuation of the study, if the patient had discontinued prior to the end of planned treatment). Patients who did not experience SOM were assigned a duration of 0.01. OM was evaluated using the published World Health Organization (WHO) OM grading scale that uses a scale of 0 to 4., 4 weeks after end of therapy
Residual Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM), OM was evaluated using the published World Health Organization (WHO) OM grading scale that uses a scale of 0 to 4. SOM is defined as a WHO score of greater than or equal to 3., 4 weeks after end of therapy|Duration of Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM), OM was evaluated using the published World Health Organization (WHO) OM grading scale that uses a scale of 0 to 4. SOM is defined as a WHO score of greater than or equal to 3., 4 weeks after end of therapy|Incidence of Clinically Reported, Non-fungal Infections, 4 weeks after end of therapy|Percent of Patients With RECIST 1.1 Classification of "Complete Response", The RECIST 1.1 scoring system evaluates both the defined (target) tumor, the non-target lesions, and the appearance of new lesions on radiologic scans as follows:

Target Lesion :

Complete Response (CR): All target lesions gone Partial Response (PR): \>30% decrease from Baseline Progressive Disease (PD): \>20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started (best response) Stable Disease (SD): Neither PD nor PR

Non-Target Lesion:

Complete Response (CR): All non-target lesions gone,Tumor markers gone Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of ≥1 non-target lesion, Tumor marker level elevated Progressive Disease: Enlargement of non-target lesions, 4 weeks after end of therapy|Duration of Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM) in Patients Receiving Every 3rd Week Cisplatin, 4 weeks after end of therapy|Incidence of Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM) in Patients Receiving Every 3rd Week Cisplatin, 4 weeks after end of therapy|Survival, 12 months after end of therapy|Percent of Patients With RECIST 1.1 Classification of "Complete Response", The RECIST 1.1 scoring system evaluates both the defined (target) tumor, the non-target lesions, and the appearance of new lesions on radiologic scans as follows:
