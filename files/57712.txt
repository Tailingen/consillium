Cohort Study Comparing Surgeon Stress, Utilization of Surgical Instruments, Surgical Outcomes According to Surgical Approach for Gastrectomy
A new surgical instrument is supposed to allow surgeon to do surgery with better performance. However, the learning period before getting used to the new instruments is necessary. The surgeon's stress to overcome the learning effect and the surgical outcome was rarely assessed. The comparative analysis of surgical outcome, surgeon's stress, and utilization of instruments for gastrectomy will be performed in prospective cohort study
Gastric Cancer Patients Undergoing Gastrectomy
complication, One of the most important surgical outcome, complication will be measured at 1 month after surgery, 1 month after surgery
operative time (min), 1 month after surgery|bleeding(ml), 1 month after surgery|gas passing(day), 1 month after surgery|hospital stay(day), 1 month after surgery|readmission rate(percent), 1 month after surgery|Heart rate variability of surgeon, during the operation|Duration for each surgical instruments, during the operation|number of use for each surgical instruments, during the operation
Before the surgery, all the eligible patients will be explained regarding the study and informed consent will be given. During the surgery, the surgeon will wear heart rate monitoring device to monitor hear rate variability of the surgeon. The surgical procedure will be recorded. After the surgery, morbidity following surgery will be monitored and recorded. At 1 month after surgery, additional morbidity will be recorded.
