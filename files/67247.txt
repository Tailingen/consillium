Whole-target Consolidation Therapy Under Systemic Therapy for Oligometastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
In this exploratory clinical trial, patients with newly diagnosed distant metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with gemcitabine+ cisplatin+PD-1 inhibitor regimen followed by whole-target radiotherapy (IMRT for local regional lesion, SBRT for distant metastasis) and PD-1 inhibitor long-term maintenance regimen. To investigate the efficacy and safety of "whole target" radiotherapy combined with immuno-maintenance therapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab, gemcitabin, cisplatin|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy, Intensity modulated-radiotherapy
Median progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death of any cause or the first progress at any site, censored on the last date of tumor evaluation if no progress has happened., 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate is the rate of patients achieving complete response or partial response for a certain period of time after intervention., 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate is the rate of patients achieving complete response, partial response or stable disease for at least 4 weeks after intervention., 2 years|Median overall survival (OS), Overall survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death of any cause, censored on the last date of known survival if no death has happened, 2 years|Adverse events, NCI-CTC5.0 and RTOG standards are adopted, and acute subjective toxicity, acute objective toxicity and late subjective toxicity are included., 2 years|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0) before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment., 2 years|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (The QLQ-H&N35), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (The QLQ-H\&N35) before treatment, during treatment, after treatment., 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), Defined as the time from first documentation of objective response to radiological disease progression., 2 years
This exploratory clinical trial will evaluate tumor control rate, survival, and safety of newly diagnosed distant metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma by further adding local regional IMRT, distant metastatic SBRT and immuno-maintenance therapy to the standard regimen of gemcitabine+ cisplatin+ PD-1 inhibitor (historical data). To explore whether the "full target" model can be a better comprehensive therapy for the initial diagnosed distant metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the era of immunotherapy.
