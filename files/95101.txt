Camrelizumab in Combination With Apatinib in Advanced ICC: A Single-arm Phase II Study
This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized and single-center phase II clinical study, to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with Apatinib in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Apatinib
Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) or death of any cause., Three years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume has reached a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit, including complete response and partial response patients., Three years|Overall Survival (OS), Duration from the date of initial treatment to the date of death due to any cause., Three years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume control (reduced or enlarged) reaches a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit., Two years|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration from the first time reported partial response or complete response to the first time of disease progression or death., Two years|Time to Progression (TTP), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1), Two years|Adverse events (AE), Any adverse events related with treatment drugs and details include adverse events type, frequency and severity., Two years
It is estimated that 50 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in 3 years and treated with Camrelizumab plus Apatinib in SYSUCC. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including objective response rate (ORR) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS), until disease progression or death. Histopathology and multi-omics data analysis will be used to explore potential biomarkers of treatment response.
