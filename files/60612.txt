Trial of R-GemOx Regimen in Previously Untreated Elderly Patients With DLBCL.
The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of GemOx(Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin) combination with rituximab(R) as first-line treatment of elderly patients with DLBCL
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: R-GemOx
overall response rate, overall response rate after 3 cycles and at the end of R-GemOx regimen., at the end of 3 cycles and 6 cycles of R-GemOx regimen(each cycle is 14 days)
progression free survival, from date of inclusion to date of progression, relapse from response, or death from any cause or last follow-up., Two-year|overall survival, from the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause or last follow-up., Two-year|The incidence and severity of adverse events, All the treatment related adverse events was evaluated according to common terminology criteria adverse events(CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 30 days following the last dose of study drug
Previous studies showed that the combination of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) achieved high efficacy with a low toxicity profile in relapsed and refractory DLBCL. This regimen might be considered a putative treatment option for elderly patients. To our knowledge, the efficacy and safety of R-GemOx when given as first-line therapy in elderly patients with DLBCL remains unknown. The investigators therefore developed a two-weekly regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen as first line treatment in elderly DLBCL and investigate its efficacy and safety.
