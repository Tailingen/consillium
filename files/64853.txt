METIMMOX: Colorectal Cancer METastasis - Shaping Anti-tumor IMMunity by OXaliplatin
This study aims to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the sequential addition of immune-modulating therapy to standard-of-care therapy of microsatellite-stable (MSS)/mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: FLOX
Primary - progression-free survival (PFS), To determine PFS, in terms of failure of treatment strategy, on sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen in previously untreated MSS mCRC.

- PFS: radiologic assessment every 8 weeks (following 4 cycles of FLOX or the alternative 2 cycles each of FLOX and nivolumab), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and the RECIST consensus guideline for assessment of response to immune-modulating therapies (iRECIST)., Through study completion, an average of 15 months
Secondary 1 - Incidence (safety) and grading (tolerability) of treatment-related adverse events, To determine the number of participants (incidence; safety) with treatment-related adverse events and their grading (tolerability), as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 2 - Objective response rate (ORR), To determine the percentage of patients with confirmed complete or partial response of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 3 - Duration of response (DOR), To determine the time from the first documentation of a complete or partial response to disease progression of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 4 - Secondary curative resection rate (SSCRR), To determine the percentage of patients with a confirmed resection of metastatic disease with microscopically free margin (R0) of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 5 - Overall survival (OS), To determine the time from randomization to death of any cause of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 6 - Quality-of-life (QoL), To monitor and compare QoL alterations during therapy courses using the consensus module EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life, 30 question version).

Per the EORTC Scoring manual, the EORTC-QLQ-C30 uses 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea and vomiting), a global health status/quality of life scale and a number of other questions which assess items such as dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea, as well as the perceived financial impact of having cancer. Scales range from 0 to 100, and a higher score means a higher response rate, where a high score on the functional or global health status questions represents a high or healthy level of functioning, quality of life or, alternatively, more symptoms or issues (symptom scale/items). \[Scoring information summarised from the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring manual, 3rd edition\], Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 7 - Quality-of-life (QoL), To monitor and compare QoL alterations during therapy courses using the consensus module EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life, 20 question Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy questionnaire).

The EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 uses 20 questions assessing the quality of sensory, motor and autonomic symptoms on a 4-point Likert scale. Answers range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Patients indicate their perception of each item, and the scores are aggregated by quality, with a maximum of 32 points for motor, 36 for sensory, and either 12 (men) or 8 (women) in autonomic, where women would not answer a question about erectile function. Scores are then added together to give an overall score. The higher the score, the more symptoms the patient is experiencing., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Secondary 8 - Quality-of-life (QoL), To monitor and compare QoL alterations during therapy courses using the consensus module EQ-5D-5L (EuroQoL's 5-dimension, 5-level questionnaire).

The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a "standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal". The questionnaire uses 5 dimensions (5D) - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. There are 5 response levels: no issues, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable to function/extreme problems. These answers are geared appropriately to the specific questionbeing asked. Responses are coded from 0 for no problems to 5 for unable to function, and are combined to give a 5-digit code that will describe the patient's state of health. For example, 21111 would mean slight problems with mobility, but no other issues in the other dimensions. (summarised from the EQ-5D-5L user guide, v3.0)., Through study completion, an average of 15 months
Tertiary - Cost estimate, To compare costs for the resource use (in diagnostic work-up, treatment, and any adverse events) for the sequential therapy with that of the standard-of-care, applying a model specifically developed for CRC., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Exploratory 1 - Circulating biomarkers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, To monitor the individual patients' levels of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) phosphatase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells throughout study treatment., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Exploratory 2 - Circulating biomarkers of tumor response, To monitor the individual patients' levels of plasma tumor DNA throughout study treatment., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Exploratory 3 - Circulating biomarkers of tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD), To monitor the individual patients' levels of serum/plasma immune proteins throughout study treatment., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Exploratory 4 - Functional MR (Magnetic Resonance) imaging biomarkers, To monitor the individual patients' changes in liver/peritoneal functional MR signals throughout study treatment., Through study completion, an average of 15 months|Exploratory 5 - Histologic and molecular tumor biomarkers, To monitor the individual patients' changes in liver/peritoneal tissue composition throughout study treatment., Through study completion, an average of 15 months
Hypothesis: Patients with MSS/pMMR-mCRC harbor tumor that can be transformed into an immunogenic disease by short-course oxaliplatin-based therapy, and may thereby benefit from the addition of immune-modulating therapy to improve outcome of the current oxaliplatin-based standard-of-care.

Primary objective: To determine progression-free survival (PFS), in terms of failure of treatment strategy, of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX (5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and leucovorin) regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen in previously untreated MSS/pMMR-mCRC.

Secondary objectives: To determine safety and tolerability of sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab compared with the standard-of-care Nordic FLOX regimen. To monitor and compare quality-of-life (QoL) alterations during therapy courses.
