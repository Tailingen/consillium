The aim of this study was to investigate the added value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for differentiating low risk patients with breast nodules categorized as 4A using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The study included patients with 4A nodules confirmed by core biopsy and/or surgery. The CEUS parameters were assessed to evaluated the added value in BI-RADS 4A nodules
