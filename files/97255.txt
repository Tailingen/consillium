Safety and Efficacy of FalateScan (Technetium Tc 99m EC20) in Patients With Known Suspected Recurrent or Metastatic Cancer From a Solid Tumor
The folate receptor is over-expressed on many types of cancer cells and new folate receptor targeted therapies are being developed to target cancer cells that over-express the folate receptor. As with other targeted therapies, it is important to develop diagnostic tests that will provide accurate information on folate receptor status and aid in selecting patients that may benefit from folate-targeted therapy.

This Phase II, limited institution, open-label, single-arm, baseline-controlled study is designed to obtain data on the percentage of patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer from a solid tumor (including, but not limited to, breast, lung, mesothelioma, liver, colorectal, prostate, head and neck, pancreas, bladder and testicular cancer) with increased uptake of FalateScan in tumors, correlate the immunohistochemical staining findings with the FolateScan images, and verify product safety in patients with suspected recurrent or metastatic disease from any solid tumor.
