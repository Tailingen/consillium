A Phase II Study of PX-866 in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the new drug PX-866 will slow the growth of your prostate cancer. The investigators will also watch you carefully for any side effects that PX-866 might cause.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: PX-866
Lack of Disease Progression at 12 Weeks, Proportion of patients without evidence of progression (objective progression, defined as an increase in sum of diameters of target lesions of at least 20% above the lowest (or baseline) value (minimum of 5 mm increase) OR the appearance of unequivocal increase in non-measurable/non-target disease OR the appearance of new lesions, or PSA progression, defined as a rise in PSA of 25% (minimum 5 ng/ml) above baseline value or nadir, whichever is lowest, and confirmed by a second increasing value at least 3 weeks later) at 12 weeks after start of therapy, 12 weeks
PSA Response Rate, Proportion of patients with PSA response defined as a \> 50% fall in PSA (minimum of 5 ng/ml) from baseline maintained for \> 4 weeks without evidence of disease progression otherwise, 12 weeks|Objective Response Rate, Proportion of patients with objective response defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions (partial response) maintained for at least 4 weeks, or complete disappearance of disease and cancer related symptoms (complete response), also maintained for at least 4 weeks, 12 weeks|Change in Circulating Tumour Cell Number During Treatment, Proportion of patients with Favorable circulating tumour cell (CTC) conversion (\< 5 CTC/7.5 mL), 12 weeks
PX 866 is a new type of drug that inhibits a molecule related to cancer cell growth. While this molecule is also found in normal cells, it is much more active in some cancer cells, so inhibiting the molecule with PX-866 is hoped to slow the growth of cancer cells. Laboratory tests show that it may help slow the growth of prostate cancer in animals, but it is not known whether it will have the same effects in humans. PX-866 has been studied in some cancer patients to find out safe doses that can be given but it has not undergone study in prostate cancer. This study will be the first study of PX-866 in prostate cancer.

Health Canada has not approved the sale or use of PX-866 to treat prostate cancer, although they have approved its use in this clinical trial.
