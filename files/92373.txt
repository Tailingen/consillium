Dapagliflozin for Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiotoxicity: a Randomized Controlled Trial
Brief Summary

Background \& Rationale Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) are widely used in cancer treatment but are associated with cardiotoxicity, which can lead to left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and long-term cardiovascular complications. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is primarily dose-dependent and often irreversible, resulting from oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In contrast, trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is typically not dose-dependent and is often reversible, occurring due to HER2 receptor blockade in cardiac tissue, impairing myocardial repair mechanisms. The combination of anthracyclines and trastuzumab significantly increases the risk of cardiac dysfunction, necessitating effective cardioprotective strategies.

Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (SGLT2i), is approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but has demonstrated cardioprotective benefits beyond glucose control. It exerts beneficial effects through reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and myocardial fibrosis, making it a promising candidate for mitigating chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. This study aims to evaluate Dapagliflozin's potential role in preventing cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.

Study Design

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll 100 cancer patients receiving anthracycline and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups:

Control Group (n=50): Standard anthracycline-based and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy + placebo Intervention Group (n=50): Standard anthracycline-based and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy + Dapagliflozin

Objectives \& Outcomes

Primary Outcome:

Change in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by echocardiography over a 4-month follow-up period.

Secondary Outcomes:

* Serum cardiac biomarkers: Serum Troponin I, Serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and Serum Galectin-3.
* Renal function markers: Serum Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN).
* Cancer progression marker: Serum Carbohydrate Antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3).
* Incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
* Assessment of chemotherapy-related and Dapagliflozin-related adverse effects, including hypoglycemia, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and renal function changes.

Patient Follow-Up \& Safety Monitoring Patients will be closely monitored throughout the study with scheduled assessments at baseline, during chemotherapy, and at the 4-month follow-up.

* Cardiac function will be assessed using echocardiography and serum cardiac biomarkers.
* Renal function and metabolic status will be evaluated to ensure Dapagliflozin safety.
* Adverse events will be classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

Significance of the Study By investigating Dapagliflozin's potential role in preventing anthracycline- and/or trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, this study may provide a novel cardioprotective strategy for cancer patients. If successful, this intervention could improve cardiac outcomes, maintain chemotherapy efficacy, and enhance long-term quality of life.

Detailed Description

Background and Rationale Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is a significant concern in cancer treatment, particularly with anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin) and HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab (Herceptin). These agents, while highly effective in treating malignancies, are associated with dose-dependent or reversible cardiac dysfunction, respectively, potentially leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, and long-term cardiovascular complications.

Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is often irreversible, resulting from oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and direct cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is not dose-dependent and is often reversible, primarily occurring due to HER2 receptor blockade in cardiac tissue, impairing myocardial repair mechanisms.

The risk is highest when anthracyclines and trastuzumab are used sequentially, as seen in standard treatment protocols for HER2-positive breast cancer.

Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (SGLT2i), is primarily used for type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, emerging evidence suggests cardioprotective properties independent of glucose control, including:

Reduction of oxidative stress and myocardial fibrosis Improvement of mitochondrial efficiency and myocardial metabolism Reduction in systemic and myocardial inflammation Modulation of sodium and calcium handling in cardiomyocytes Given these mechanisms, Dapagliflozin may provide a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, preserving cardiac function without compromising cancer treatment efficacy.
