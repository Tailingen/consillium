Clinical Study of ET019002-T Cell Therapy for Refractory/Relapsed B-Cell Malignancies
This study is to determine the safety, including potential dose limiting toxicities, and efficiency of ET019002-T cells and the duration of in vivo survival of ET019002-T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-Cell Malignancies.
B-Cell Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: Low dose ET019002- T Cells|BIOLOGICAL: Middle dose ET019002- T Cells|BIOLOGICAL: High dose ET019002- T Cells
Maximum Tolerated Dose, A dose limiting toxicity is defined as any toxicity that is considered to be primarily related to the ET019002T-cells,which is irreversible or life threatening or CTCAE Grade 3-5., Up to 12 weeks.|Tmax of serum cytokine levels, Cytokins as measured by CBA-Bioplex Multiplex Immunoassays will be presented as time to peak level., Up to 12 weeks.|Time to baseline for serum cytokine levels, Inceases or decreases in the amout of cytokine produced compared to baseline at time points measured up to 24 weeks since dosing., Up to 12 weeks.|Toxicity profile of ET019002T-cell treatment, Frequency of treatment-related adverse events that occurred at any time from the first day of infusion that are "possibly", "likely", or "definitely" related to the study, including infusion related toxicity and ET019002 T cell related toxicity. Include but not limited to: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice and other gastrointestinal symptoms; Fatigue, hypotension, respiratory distress; Tumor lysis syndrome; Cytokine release syndrome; Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver and kidney dysfunction. Assessed at all visits., Up to 2 years.
Rate of disease response, Rate of disease response assessed by lugano cliassification.Response rates will be estimated as CR,PR,SD,PD., Up to 12 weeks.|Progression free survival(PFS), Progression free survival(PFS) denotes the chances of staying free of disease progression for patients after treatment., Up to 2 years.|Time to baseline for B cell level, B cell level as measured by Bio-Plex Multiplex Immunoassays will be presented., Up to 2 years.
ET019002-T cell therapy is a novel chimeric T-cell therapy platform that in preclinical studies, functionally matches the efficacy of CAR-T cells, but dramatically reduces the release of cytokines upon killing of target-positive tumors.The arm of the study is experimental i.v. arm:ET019002-T cells administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.The intervention is ET019002-T cells(Autologous T cells transduced with lentivirus encoding an anti-CD19 (ET019002)-expression construct).
