Analysis of Next Generation PET and Liquid Biopsy to Monitor mCRPC Treated With Abiraterone: ANGELA Trial
By incorporating dual-tracer PET/CT (PSMA and FDG) and ctDNA, we aimed to evaluate lesion heterogeneity and genomic change of mCRPC patients receiving novel hormonal therapy. The relationship between treatment response and different molecular characterization, as well as imaging features would also be evaluated.
