microRNA Profiles Identification in Adeno Carcinoma Prostate Cancer
In our study, the investigators want to find correlation between circulating miRNAs associated with prostate cancer metastases to bones and to lymph nodes separately with results of 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET (positron emission computed) imaging.
