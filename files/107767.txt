A Phase 1 Study of AMG 211 in Participants With Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer
The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to determine if AMG 211 given as a continous intravenous (IV) infusion is safe and tolerable in adult participants that have advanced gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. The study will be conducted in multiple sites and test increasing doses of AMG 211. The safety of participants will be monitored by intensive assessment of vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Efficacy will be assessed by the usual imaging procedures and their interpretation.
