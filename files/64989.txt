MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound Radiosensitization for Patients With Malignant Melanoma and Non Melanoma Skin Cancer
The objective of this study is to examine the safety profile and therapeutic efficacy of MRI-guided focused ultrasound microbubble therapy and radiotherapy in humans.
Melanoma
DRUG: Definity|DEVICE: Sonalleve Focused Ultrasound Device
Incidence of toxicity and adverse events, scored on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTCAE 4.03), The patient will be assessed by a physician investigator and clinical research assistant (CRA) on the MRI-guided focused ultrasound + microbubble (MRgFUS + MB) treatment date and within follow up period of 90 days after treatment., 90 days
Radiological response, The secondary aim is to evaluate tumour (primary and/or metastasis) response to MRgFUS + MB and radiation, which will be evaluated by tumour volume change., 2 years
The approach uses relatively low-power ultrasound, operating with lower power levels than high intensity focused ultrasound and ultrasound-based hyperthermia techniques, delivered on the Sonalleve platform. The tumour will be sonicated before the radiation to enhance the effect of therapy. The technique is spatially targeted and stimulates microbubbles using low-power ultrasonic fields in the tumour location only. the primary aim of this research is to evaluate the safety profile of MRI-guided ultrasound stimulated microbubble treatment and radiation in patients with malignant melanoma. The secondary aim is to evaluate tumour (primary and/or metastasis) response to MRI-guided ultrasound stimulated microbubble treatment and radiation, as measured radiologically within the treated regions.
