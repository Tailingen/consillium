HPV Integration Testing for Cervical Cancer Screening
The primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the HPV Integration-based cervical screening for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), using colposcopic inspection as the reference method. Lesions will be confirmed as malignant or CIN by colposcopic inspection and histopathologic examination.
