A Clinical Study of SKLB1028 Capsule in the Treatment of Recurrence/Refractory AML Patients
Patients will receive oral SKLB1028 for 28 days as a course of treatment, and then to evaluate the side effects,tolerability and best dose for treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia With FLT3 Mutations.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: SKLB1028 150mg bid|DRUG: SKLB1028 200mg bid|DRUG: SKLB1028 300mg qd
Total remission rate (ORR), Complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) + complete molecular remission (CRm) + partial remission（PR）, Evaluation at the end of each cycle(a cycle is 28 days) of administration and at the end of the study (assessed up to approximately 24 months)
Progression-free survival time (PFS), Up to a total of 24 months after first dose or until disease progression, withdrawal from study, or death|Total survival time (OS), 30 days after last subject discontinues treatment (assessed up to approximately 24 months)|CR mitigation duration (DoR-CR), Time from the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be a CR to the earliest date progression is documented (assessed up to approximately 24 months|FLT3 inhibition rate, Evaluation when the patient's efficacy was evaluated as CR (assessed up to approximately 24 months)|Incidence of adverse events, From the start of the study treatment to the end of the study treatment(Within 4 weeks after the last administration)|Vital signs, From the start of the study treatment to the end of the study treatment(Within 4 weeks after the last administration)|12-lead ECG, From the start of the study treatment to the end of the study treatment(Within 4 weeks after the last administration)|physical examination, From the start of the study treatment to the end of the study treatment(Within 4 weeks after the last administration)|laboratory examination, From the start of the study treatment to the end of the study treatment(Within 4 weeks after the last administration)
It is an open,multicenter,queue extension study designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of different administration regimens of SKLB1028 capsules in patients with recurrent/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3 mutation. Divided into three dose groups,150mg BID,200mg BID,300mg QD. The main end point is total remission rate (ORR), total survival time (OS), progress-free survival time (PFS), remission duration, FLT3 suppression rate, competitive parameters, safety (incidence of adverse events).
