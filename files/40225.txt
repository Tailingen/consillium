Breast Cancer Outreach Among Primary Care Patients
This project aims to evaluate different approaches to increase breast cancer screening among primary care patients at Penn Medicine through a centralized screening outreach program. In a pragmatic trial, the investigators will evaluate different approaches to increase completion of screening among eligible patients, including ordering mammograms in bulk prior to outreach, sending personalized text reminders, and endorsing of the communication by the primary care provider.

While mammograms are recommended by guidelines for early detection of breast cancer, mammogram rates are significantly lower now than they were prior to the initial COVID-19 pandemic surge in early 2020. In this project, the investigators will evaluate different ways of reaching out to eligible patients to encourage them to participate in breast cancer screening. Through letters, texting, and the electronic health record portal (MyPennMedicine (MPM)), the investigators will compare mammogram bulk orders, text messaging, and primary care provider endorsement to traditional outreach messaging with the goal of increasing breast cancer screening uptake.
