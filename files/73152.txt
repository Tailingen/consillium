The Combination of Radiotherapy，Surufatinib and Sintilimab in High-Risk Localized Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase Ib/II clinical trial. The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment which combines radiotherapy, Sintilimab (Anti-PD1 Antibody) and Surufatinib (small-molecule Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor) in patients with high-risk localized soft tissue sarcoma.

There will be 52 patients with high-risk localized extremity and trunck soft tissue sarcoma recruited. The trail is designed as a two-stage study. In safety lead-in phase (phase Ib), using 3+3 design, 6 cycles of Surufatinib (250mg, 200mg, qd) and Sintilimab (200mg, q3w) will be applied. And radiotherapy (BED=50-60Gy (α/β=10)) will begin in week 4 of the therapy. In extended phase (phase II), Surufatinib will be applied in the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) according to phase Ib. And 200mg Sintilimab and radiotherapy will be applied as before. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in phase Ib and objective response rate (ORR) in phase Ib+Phase II will be mainly analyzed.
High-Risk Localized Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Surufatinib|DRUG: Sintilimab|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with objective response. Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per response evaluation criteria (RECIST v1.1) before surgery., The objective response rate (ORR) will be evaluated before surgery.
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) and Near pCR Rate, The proportion of subjects whose pathological response rate of tumor tissue in postoperative specimens is ≥90% after preoperative treatment., The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate will be evaluated from surgical samples, immediately after surgery.|Non-Perfused Volume (NPV), The changes in tumour volume that are not enhanced in imaging images with contrast agent before and after treatment., The non-perfused volume (NPV) will be measured in four weeks before preoperative treatment and before surgery in week18-21.|Adverse Events, The toxic reactions are evaluated and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Edition 5 (NCI-CTCAE V. 5)., From the beginning of treatment to 90 days after the end of the last treatment.|Wound Complications, Postoperative incision healing, with reference to the Canadian study for grading of wound complications., Up to 120 days from the surgery.|Local Control Rate, The proportion of subjects who recurred within the radiotherapy exposure field from the start of treatment to the imaging assessment of all evaluable subjects., From the start of treatment to local recurrence, up to 5 years.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from initiation of treatment to PD or death from any cause., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), The time from initiation of treatment to death from any cause., Up to 5 years|Quality of Life (QoL) according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS), The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) is a measure of physical function across 7 items, including pain, range of motion, strength, joint stability, joint deformity, emotional acceptance, and overall function. Each item is scored from 0(worst) to 5(best) with a maximum possible score of 35, which is converted to a scale from 0 to 100 points, Quality of Life (QoL) will be evaluated at least five times: before treatment, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months respectively after surgery.|Quality of Life (QoL) according to the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), The Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) is a self-administered questionnaire evaluating possible limitations in physical activity. A total of 30 questions are included in the TESS, and the degree of disability is rated from 0 (complete disability) to 5 (no functional impairment) in each item, Quality of Life (QoL) will be evaluated at least five times: before treatment, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months respectively after surgery.|Quality of Life (QoL) according to the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires, The Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires is a 36-item health survey status which is composed of the following eight domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each of these domains can be rated from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The final SF-36 score is converted to a 0-100 points range scale, Quality of Life (QoL) will be evaluated at least five times: before treatment, at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months respectively after surgery.
