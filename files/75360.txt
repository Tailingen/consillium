Impact of Reinforced Education by Video on the Quality of Bowel Preparation
High quality bowel preparation is essential for successful colonoscopy. This study aimed to assess the impact of reinforced education by Video on the quality of bowel preparation. This prospective, endoscopist-blinded, randomized, controlled study was conducted. Reinforced education groups received additional education via reminders by video 2 days before colonoscopy. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel preparation according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). The secondary outcomes included polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), tolerance, and subjective feelings of patients.

Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, The primary end point of the study was adequate bowel prepara- tion quality de ned as a BBPS total score of ≥6 with all segment scores ≥2, 2 days
Polyp detection rate, Secondary end points included polyp detection rate which would be higher in the colonoscopy with satisfactory bowel preparation., 2 days|Adenoma detection rate, Secondary end points included adenoma detection rate which would be higher in the colonoscopy with satisfactory bowel preparation., 2 days
