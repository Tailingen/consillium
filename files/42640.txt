PET/CT-directed Hyperfractionated Radiation Dose Escalation in Esophageal Cancer
The goal of this study is to find the maximum tolerable dose of radiation that can be delivered with concurrent chemotherapy (carboplatin \& paclitaxel) in patients with esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: radiochemotherapy 1|RADIATION: radiochemotherapy 2|RADIATION: radiochemotherapy 3|RADIATION: radiochemotherapy 4|RADIATION: radiochemotherapy 5|RADIATION: radiochemotherapy 6
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximum Tolerated Dose is defined as CTCAE 4 grade 3 acute radiation-related toxicity, 1 year
Time to Local Failure, Local control will be assessed radiographically using endoscopy with biopsy and a positron emission computed tomography-CT scan, 2 years
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for esophageal cancer based on the results of phase III randomised trials. The current standard radiation therapy dose has remained 50 Gy at -2 Gy/fraction for decades.However, locoregional control remain problematic, with 25% of patients having persistence and 20% relapse of locoregional disease following the combined modality approach. New regimen is urgently needed for improving localregional control and survival.Investigators hypothesize that hyperfractionated radiation dose escalation to residual tumor volumes after standard chemoradiotherapy as defined by positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) would improve local control and overall survival while reducing the acute and late normal tissue toxicity.
