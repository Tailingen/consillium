Serial FLT PET Imaging in Cancer Patients for Monitoring of Response to Therapy
The purpose of this study is to see if PET/CT scans that use a radioactive substance called \[18F\] fluorothymidine (FLT), can detect and monitor changes in the tumor. Radioactive substances are used with PET/CT scans to "see" cancer cells, and are also called radiotracers. FLT is a new radiotracer that has been given to people in prior studies. FLT PET/CT is an experimental scan unlike FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET scan which is a standard clinical scan and is commonly used. The investigators would like to know if there is any evidence of early treatment response by obtaining FLTPET/ CT scans before and after treatment.

change from pre- to posttreatment, We will describe the distribution of the change and explore if it is associated with the findings of standard-of-care imaging such as FDG-PET or CT/MRI using rank based methods such as Spearman correlation and the signed-ranks test. In addition we will also explore the value of the change in the FLT metrics in predicting the clinical outcome using logistic regression (for response) and proportional hazards regression (for progression and survival)., 4 years
This protocol is an "umbrella" or "companion" protocol to be used in conjunction with other protocols that are evaluating treatment response in solid or hematologic malignancies. The aim of this protocol is to determine if PET imaging with the proliferation marker 18FFLT can monitor changes in FLT uptake parameters, in particular changes in the standardized uptake value (SUV), within tumor target lesions.
