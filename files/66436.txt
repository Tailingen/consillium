Multi-center, Open Label, Extension Study of ALN-VSP02 in Cancer Patients Who Have Responded to ALN-VSP02 Treatment
This study provides a mechanism for continued administration of ALN-VSP02 therapy to patients with cancer who completed participation in another ALN-VSP02 clinical study. The primary objective of this study is to collect long term safety data.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: ALN-VSP02
Collect long term ALN-VSP02 safety data, Patients remain on treatment until disease progression or an adverse event. Adverse events are assessed throughout treatment., Throughout the study
Assess disease response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), Disease response is assessed every 2 months until the patient stops treatment due to disease progression or an adverse event, Every 2 months|Evaluate preliminary evidence of antitumor activity/antiangiogenic activity, Evaluations will take place every 3-6 months until disease progression, Every 3 - 6 months
Study ALN-VSP02 is an extension study for previously conducted ALN-VSP02 studies. The study is being conducted to allow for continued ALN-VSP02 therapy for patients who completed participation in an ALN-VSP02 clinical study, achieved clinical benefit with ALN-VSP02 (i.e., disease response of stable disease or better), and, in the Investigator's opinion, may benefit from continuation of ALN-VSP02 therapy.
