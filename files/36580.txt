Intubation Techniques on Colonoscopy Quality (SINOCOLO2013)
The primary aim of this study is

- to explore the usefulness of abdominal compression on intubation.

Other aims include

1. to investigate the effectiveness and the efficacy of different manners of abdominal compression and to analysis the reasons of their success and failure
2. to get the knowledge of the formation of colon loops and its frequency
3. to clarify the impact of intubation with loops on adenoma detection rate
Colorectal Adenoma|Colorectal Polyp
BEHAVIORAL: Abdominal Compression|DEVICE: Guidance of Magnetic Endoscopic Imaging (MEI) System
Mean Intubation Time (MIT), MIT refers to the mean of intubation time. Intubation time refers to the time spent on the intubation procedure. Intubation is defined as the procedure during which the tip of the colonoscope reaches the cecum from the anus., At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour
Cecal Intubation Rate (CIR), CIR refers to the proportion of the subjects who receive the whole colon examination. The whole colon examination means the tip of the colonoscope reaches the cecum during the procedure., At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour|Pain Score (PS), PS is measure by the numerical rating scale during the intubation process. Numerical rating scale contains 11 ranks from 0 to 10, in which 0 means no pain and 10 means the extreme pain cannot be borne., During the procedure, up to 1 hour|Severe Adverse Event Rate (SAER), SAER refers to the proportion of the subjects to whom severe adverse events happens. Severe adverse events include perforation, massive hemorrhage, lethal arrhythmia, death and so on., The day of the procedure, 24 hours|Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR), ADR refer to the rate of adenoma detection, calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one adenoma., At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour|Polyp Detection Rate (PDR), PDR refer to the rate of polyp detection, calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one polyp., At the end of the procedure, up to 1 hour
