Sirolimus in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as sirolimus use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sirolimus in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Leukemia|Lymphoma
DRUG: sirolimus
Toxicity as assessed by Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) toxicity criteria after the first course of treatment, Subjects will be assessed for toxicity on days 3, 7 and 21, within 21 days following administration of sirolimus
Response as assessed by radiologic scans after each course of treatment, Response will be assessed on day 21 of cycle 1, day 21
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of sirolimus in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the trough levels produced by this drug in these patients.
* Determine the anti-leukemia/lymphoma activity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

Patients receive oral sirolimus once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sirolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
