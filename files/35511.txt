Study of Pembrolizumab and Cabozantinib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a phase I/II open-label study designed to evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Sequential dose escalation of cabozantinib with standard dose pembrolizumab will occur in the phase I dose escalation part of the study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Subsequently, subjects will receive cabozantinib at the RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab in the phase II dose expansion part of the study.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Efficacy of Pembrolizumab and Cabozantinib Based on Objective Response Rate, Measured through the complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)\] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Beginning of study to end of study, up to 5 years
Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), * The MTD is defined as the highest dose level with no more than 1 DLT reported in 6 DLT-evaluable subjects.
* The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of cabozantinib will be selected based on the clinical data and will not exceed the MTD. If \< 2/6 subjects experience a DLT at 60 mg daily during dose escalation, then 60 mg daily will be considered the RP2D. If ≥ 2/6 subjects experience DLTs at 60 mg daily, and ≤ 1/6 subjects experience a DLT at 40 mg daily, then 40 mg daily will be considered the RP2D. The dose of pembrolizumab will be constant at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks., Throughout Cycle 1, up to 21 days|Dose Limiting Toxicities, Assessed through Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was defined as any of the following events occurring during the DLT assessment window (21 days) and is assessed by the investigator to be likely related to study treatment (pembrolizumab and/or cabozantinib).

* Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic, non-hepatic adverse events
* Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting \>72 hours despite maximal medical therapy.
* Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia (ANC \< 500 cells/μL) lasting \> 7 days
* Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia
* Grade ≥ 4 anemia
* Grade ≥ 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding
* Grade ≥ 3 elevation of serum hepatic transaminase (ALT or AST).
* Grade ≥ 3 elevation of serum total bilirubin.
* ALT or AST \> 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) AND total bilirubin \>2 × ULN will require permanent treatment discontinuation., Throughout Cycle 1, up to 21 days|Progression-Free Survival, Measured as the time it takes for an occurrence of documented disease progression. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Beginning of study to end of study, or death, whichever comes first, up to 5 years|Overall Survival, Measured as the time it takes for an occurrence of death due to any cause, Beginning of study to end of study, or death, whichever comes first, up to 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), AKA Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), DCR is the sum of the complete response, partial response, and stable disease rates, Beginning of study to end of study, or death, whichever comes first, up to 5 years|Duration of Response, Duration of time that patients maintain RECIST response to treatment, Time of first response as measured by RECIST 1.1 to time of progression or death, whichever comes first, up to 5 years
Primary Objectives

* To determine the efficacy based on objective response rate \[ORR = complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)\] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma..

Secondary Objectives

* To characterize dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination.
* To assess other measures of anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
