Heart Analysis in GATED-PET in Patients Having a Gallium-68-DOTATOC PET/CT Exam for Oncology Indication
Gallium-68-DOTATOC binds primarily with high affinity to somatostatin subtype 2 (SSTR2) receptors and these somatostatin receptors are also overexpressed on inflammation cells when activated.

The hypothesis is that the GATED mode on a Gallium-68-DOTATOC cardiac recording would be able to highlight abnormalities that could be correlated with the age of the patients and their cardiovascular risk factors.
Cardiac Inflammation
OTHER: Cardiac ECG-gated PET imaging will added
Relationship between the captation of radiotracer and the cardiovascular disease, Measurement of myocardial activity, 1 day
Relationship between the captation of radiotracer and the troponin value, Correlation between the myocardial activity and the troponin value, 1 day
People with the selection criteria for the study, coming to the nuclear medicine department in order to benefit from a Gallium-68-DOTATOC PET/CT exam as part of a diagnostic or pre-therapeutic assessment of a neuroendocrine tumor will be offer to participate in the study After sign consent, patients were install in a room to have blood drawn for Troponin Ic, BNP and CRP and after Gallium-68-DOTATOC infusion Gallium-68-DOTATOC PET/CT will be recorded and immediately the cardiac record in Gated mode
