A Phase II Clinical Study to Evaluate HLX43 in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic CC Failed or Intolerance to Standard Therapy
The study is being conducted to explore the reasonable dosage and evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HLX43 (Anti-PD-L1 ADC) in Patients with Recurrent/Metastatic Cervical Cancer (CC) Failed or Intolerance to Standard First-Line Therapy.

This study is an open-label phase II clinical study to explore the reasonable dosage and evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HLX43 (Anti-PD-L1 ADC) in Patients with Recurrent/Metastatic Cervical Cancer (CC) Failed or Intolerance to Standard First-Line Therapy.

In this study, eligible subjects will be randomized at 1:1:1 ratio, and the patients will be administered with HLX43 at different doses via intravenous infusion.
