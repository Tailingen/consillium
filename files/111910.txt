Cadonilimab and Lenvatinib for Conversion Therapy in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical trial designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of the combination therapy of Cadonilimab and Lenvatinib for conversion treatment in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Eligible patients, meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed consent, will undergo 3-4 cycles of Cadonilimab and Lenvatinib conversion therapy. A single imaging assessment will be conducted, and successfully converted patients will proceed to surgical treatment, with pathological evaluation of intraoperative specimens. Post-surgery, patients will choose an appropriate adjuvant treatment based on prior treatment benefits, disease baseline, and personal preferences.

Patients who do not successfully convert and experience disease progression will exit the study for alternative treatment. Those who do not successfully convert but do not exhibit disease progression will continue conversion treatment with Cadonilimab and Lenvatinib±TACE/HAIC, with tumor imaging assessments every 3 cycles. Successfully converted patients will undergo surgery, followed by the selection of an appropriate adjuvant treatment based on prior treatment benefits, disease baseline, and personal preferences.

Patients who do not successfully convert and experience disease progression will exit the study for alternative treatment. Those who do not successfully convert but do not exhibit disease progression will continue conversion treatment with Cadonilimab and Lenvatinib±TACE/HAIC until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs, with a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. Efficacy assessment will use mRECIST and RECIST v1.1 criteria, and safety evaluation will follow CTCAE 5.0 standards. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study, with a period extending to 60 days after treatment completion for serious adverse events or those related to Enfortumab Vedotin, and in some cases extended to 90 days post-treatment.
Cadonilimab and Lenvatinib
DRUG: Cadonilimab lenvatinib
Objective response rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum required duration, including complete response and partial response., Baseline up to approximately 6 months|Conversion success rate, Successful conversion criteria are as follows

* Child-Pugh score \<7
* ECOG PS 0 or 1
* No extrahepatic lesions or complete necrosis of extrahepatic lesions
* Preservation of the intact vascular architecture of the liver
* Adequate FLR after resection (≥35%), Baseline up to approximately 6 months
Disease control rate, It refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor volume control (shrinkage or enlargement) reaches a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum required duration. According to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), during the treatment period or within 30 days after the discontinuation of the investigational drug, it is the sum of the percentage of subjects who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD)., Baseline up to approximately 6 months|Progression-free survival, It refers to the time from the first administration of the regimen to the first occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Overall survival, The time from randomization to death due to any cause in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 24 months
