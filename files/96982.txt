IDEntification of New Predisposition Genes in Differentiated THYroid Cancer
The purpose of this research is to find new predisposition genes for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer|Thyroid Cancer, Nonmedullary
GENETIC: WGS
Type and Number of genetic variants associated with or causing the development of differentiated thyroid cancer, To be achieved by a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach in a familial analysis of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. In addition, high-throughput genotyping of multiple individuals in each family will allow complementary detection of genomic regions that are shared only by affected subjects, within 2 years
Number of phenotypes associated to genotypes of CDT, By studying the association between the clinical characteristics of patients and the identified genetic variants, within 2 years|Analysis of birthplace/family origin information, Definition of the spatial location of family forms of CDT and to identify possible founding effects, within 2 years
The purpose of this research is to find new predisposition genes for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Therefore, in the absence of a BAP1 and DICER1 abnormality, we offer to sequence your whole genome (WGS) or partial genome (genotyping) for a previously unknown genetic abnormality.

Furthermore, the discovery of new genes would be a major medical advance that could contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets.

This research will be conducted at the University Hospital of Nantes and the Hospital of Vend√©e and 95 people should participate.
