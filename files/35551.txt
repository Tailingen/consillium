Adebrelimab Combined with Irinotecan Liposomes, 5-FU, CF ± Lenvatinib As First-line Treatment for Advanced ICC
This is a multicenter, open label, randomized, two-arm clinical study to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab combined with irinotecan liposomes, 5-fluorouracil, calcium folinate ± lenvatinib as first-line treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), The time from enrollment until tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, up to 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a PR or CR, determined by RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with a PR, CR, or SD, up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), The time calculated from enrollment until death from any cause, with living patients censored at the last known survival date, up to 24 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Incidence and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., up to 24 months
This study plans to recruit 68 patients with unresectable ICC who have not received prior systematic treatment. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups. Group A: patients will receive adebrelimab+irinotecan liposomes+5-fluorouracil+calcium folinate+lenvatinib; Group B: patients will receive treatment with adebrelimab+irinotecan liposomes+5-fluorouracil+calcium folinate. The combination of irinotecan liposomes+5-fluorouracil+calcium folinate will be used 9 times (Q2W), and adebrelimab ± lenvatinib will be used until disease progression or medication for 2 years.
