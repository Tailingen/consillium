Endoscopic Quality Improvement System Study
We intend to develop intelligent quality control and management software based on the work of digestive endoscopic artificial intelligence in the Department of Gastroenterology, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, to accurately and comprehensively assess the quality of gastrointestinal endoscopy and to provide a practical basis for improving the quality of digestive endoscopy in our endoscopic center.
Adenoma Colon|Gastric Precancerous Condition
BEHAVIORAL: Quality audit and feedback|BEHAVIORAL: Control
Adenoma detection rate, ADR was calculated by dividing the total number of patients being detected adenomas by the number of colonoscopies., 3 Months|Gastric precancerous detection rate, GPCs detection rate was calculated by dividing the total number of patients being detected gastric precancerous by the number of gastroscopies., 3 Months
Adcanced ADR, Adcanced ADR was calculated by dividing the total number of patients being detected â‰¥10mm in size, or adenomas with histopathology of tubulovillous, villous, adenocarcinoma, or high-grade dysplasia by the number of colonoscopies., 3 months
