A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) of potential clinical significance such that further dose escalation would expose subjects to unacceptable risk; any Grade \>=3 non-hematological toxicity except Grade 3 asymptomatic increases in liver function tests, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting with duration \<= 48 hours and alopecia; Grade 4 neutropenia of \>5 days duration or febrile neutropenia of \>1 day duration; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; any treatment interruption \>2 weeks due to adverse events; any severe, impairing daily functions or life-threatening, complication or abnormality not defined in NCI-CTCAE that is attributable to the therapy., Up to 21 Days (within Cycle 1)
Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. The TEAEs were those events that occur between first dose of trial treatment and up to 30 days after last dose of the trial treatment that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., From the start of the trial treatment until data cut-off date (23 February 2012)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Pimasertib, Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., Drug-drug interaction (DDI) cohorts: Days 1 and 9 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Temsirolimus, Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 and 16 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 8|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Pimasertib, Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 1 and 9 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Temsirolimus, Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 and 16 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Area Under the Concentration Time Curve During a Dosing Interval (AUCtau) and Area Under the Concentration Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Pimasertib, The AUCtau was defined as the area under the concentration curve divided by the dosing interval. AUC(0-inf) was estimated by determining the total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1 for AUCtau; DDI cohorts: Day 1 of Cycle 1 AUC0-inf|Area Under Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Temsirolimus, The AUC(0-inf) was estimated by determining the total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 and 16 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Apparent Terminal Half-life (t1/2) of Pimasertib, The t1/2 was defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of drug to decrease 50% in the final stage of its elimination. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 1 and 9 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Apparent Terminal Half-life (t1/2) of Temsirolimus, The t1/2 was defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of drug to decrease 50% in the final stage of its elimination. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 and 16 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Apparent Clearance From Plasma Following Oral Administration (CL/f) of Pimasertib, Clearance (CL) of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. The CL obtained after oral dose (CL/F) was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed (bioavailability). Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 1 and 9 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Total Body Clearance From Plasma Following Intravenous Administration (CL) of Temsirolimus, The clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 and 16 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of Pimasertib, Volume of distribution (Vz) was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired serum concentration of a drug. The Vz after oral dose (Vz/F) was influenced by the fraction absorbed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 1 and 9 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Volume of Distribution (Vz) of Temsirolimus, The Vz was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired serum concentration of a drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported based on DDI and non-DDI cohorts as per plan., DDI cohorts: Days 9 and 16 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Day 8 of Cycle 1|Number of Subjects With Disease Control Rate, Disease control is defined as confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) \>=12 weeks), based on tumor assessments as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. CR: The disappearance of all lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the sum of the longest diameter at baseline. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment started., From the start of the trial treatment until data cut-off date (23 February 2012)|Phospho Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (pERK ) Levels and Phospho Ribosomal Protein S6 (pS6) Levels in in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), During the first cycle (either Cycle 1 non-DDI or Cycle 1-DDI) blood samples will be collected for pharmacodynamic marker assessments by flow cytometry such as phospho-ERK and phospho- S6 activities in PBMCs, DDI cohorts: Days 1, 9 and 10 of Cycle 1; Non-DDI cohorts: Days 1, 8 and 9 of Cycle 1
