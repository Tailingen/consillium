A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of ZG006 in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 clinical study of ZG006 in the US for the treatment of subjects with small cell lung cancer who have failed or are intolerant to available standard treatment. During the dose escalation stage, a standard "3+3" design will be used to assess the MTD/ recommended dose for the subsequent studies.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ZG006
The incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), An event is considered to be a DLT if the event occurs within the first 28 days of treatment and meets the dose-limiting toxicity criteria, Up to 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ZG006, Approximately 2 years|Determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Approximately 2 years|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), The types and frequencies of adverse events (AEs) evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0, Approximately 2 years|Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs), Approximately 2 years|Incidence of abnormal laboratory results, Approximately 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first evidence of response (CR or PR per RECIST 1.1) to earlier date of disease progression or death due to any cause, Approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Approximately 2 years|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ZG006, Approximately 2 years|Time to peak concentration (Tmax), Approximately 2 years|AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration after dosing (AUC[0-t]) of ZG006, Approximately 2 years|Terminal phase half-life (t1/2) of ZG006, Approximately 2 years|Detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Approximately 2 years
