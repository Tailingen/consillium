A Study to Assess the Effect of AZD5462 on the Pharmacokinetics of Midazolam, Rosuvastatin and Digoxin
This study will assess the effect of multiple doses of AZD5462 on the PK of oral midazolam (CYP3A4 probe), rosuvastatin (OATP1B1/3, BCRP probe), and digoxin (P-gp probe) in healthy participants.

This study will consist of 2 treatment arms (Treatment Arms A and B) and within each treatment arm, the participants will first be administered the probe substrates (midazolam, rosuvastatin, and digoxin) alone followed by administration of the probe substrates together with AZD5462. The treatment arms differ in the dose of AZD5462 being administered and will be performed sequentially starting with Treatment Arm A (AZD5462 Dose A, high dose treatment arm) and followed by Treatment Arm B (AZD5462 Dose B, low dose treatment arm). Each treatment arm will include 5 periods.

Thirty two participants in total (16 participants per treatment arm) will be enrolled to ensure at least 24 evaluable participants (12 participants per treatment arm) at the end of the last treatment period.

A follow-up visit at Day 24 (+-1 Day) will be conducted via a phone call.

This is a phase I, single-centre, 2-treatment arm, 5-period, fixed sequence study.

The Study Will Comprise of a Screening Period and Five Treatment Periods:

* Screening Period (Maximum 28 Days) Participant eligibility will be confirmed during the Screening Visit.
* Period 1 (Day 1) Single dose administration of midazolam on Day 1.
* Period 2 (Day 2) Single dose administration of rosuvastatin and digoxin on Day 2. There will be a minimum washout period of 3 days between Period 2 and Period 3.
* Period 3 (Days 6 to 14) Single dose administration of rosuvastatin and digoxin together with AZD5462 (Treatment Arm A, Dose A; Treatment Arm B, Dose B) on Day 6. AZD5462 will continue to be administered throughout the period including Day 14.
* Period 4 (Day 15) Single dose administration of midazolam together with AZD5462 (Treatment Arm A, Dose A; Treatment Arm B, Dose B) at steady state on Day 15.
* Period 5 (Days 16 to 18) Single dose administration of rosuvastatin and digoxin together with AZD5462 (Treatment Arm A, Dose A; Treatment Arm B, Dose B) at steady state on Day 16. AZD5462 will continue to be administered on Days 17 and 18.

Participants will be resident in the study centre when dosed with probe substrates (midazolam, rosuvastatin, and digoxin) and/or AZD5462 including the washout period between Period 2 and Period 3. Residency will commence on Day -1 and end on Day 20.

A follow-up visit at Day 24 (+-1 Day) will be conducted via a phone call.
