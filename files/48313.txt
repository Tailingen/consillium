Study of Iopofosine I 131 (CLR 131) in Select B-Cell Malignancies (CLOVER-1) and Pivotal Expansion in Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
Part A of this study evaluates iopofosine I 131 (CLR 131) in patients with select B-cell malignancies (multiple myeloma( MM), indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) who have been previously treated with standard therapy for their underlying malignancy. Part B (CLOVER-WaM) is a pivotal efficacy study evaluating IV administration of iopofosine I 131 in patients with WM that have received at least two prior lines of therapy.

B-cell malignancies represent a diverse collection of diseases and, taken together, make up the majority of hematologic malignancies. B-cell lymphomas represent the largest percentage of these neoplasms, and the relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphomas have proven very difficult to treat. Patients that have failed prior therapy, including WM patients, represent a very challenging patient population with significantly reduced life-expectancy.

Iopofosine I 131 is a targeted radiotherapeutic that exploits the selective uptake and retention of Cellectar's proprietary phospholipid ethers (PLEs) by malignant cells. Cellectar Biosciences' novel cancer-targeted small-molecule compound is radiolabeled with the radioisotope iodine-131 (I-131) which has previously been used approved for use in select tumors. Iopofosine I 131 has been evaluated in over 80 xenograft and spontaneous (transgenic) tumor models where it was demonstrated to be effective in eliminating tumors.

Based on the critical unmet medical need for effective agents with novel mechanisms of action in B-cell malignancies, Cellectar Biosciences has chosen to expand this ongoing study to assess iopofosine I 131 in a pivotal expansion cohort in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia patients that have received at least two prior lines of therapy.
