Methodology: This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in patients with a diagnosis of anti-AchR antibody positive myasthenia gravis.

Study Design: The clinical trial will be conducted over a 6-week treatment period with 2 groups.

* Group A: Patients currently taking pyridostigmine and experiencing pyridostigmine-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) within the past 14 days.
* Group B: Patients not currently taking pyridostigmine due to a documented history of GI AEs.

Randomized to either the control (pyridostigmine+ placebo) or the test group (pyridostigmine + ondansetron) and treated for 6 weeks. Following enrolment, patients may (if needed) titrate up their pyridostigmine dose at the investigator's discretion each week to the highest dose deemed appropriate, tolerable and safe.
