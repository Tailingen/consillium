Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This clinical trial studies potential genetic markers which might be used to predict which patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes respond to decitabine. This study will contribute to the efforts to find effective and less toxic therapies to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of elderly AML patients.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: decitabine
Correlation of Patient Specific Mutations With Overall Response Rate, -Best response after 4 treatment cycles as assessed according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria; bone marrow for gene sequencing will be collected at baseline; mutations will be correlated with overall response rate

--Complete remission (CR), Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), Marrow complete remission (mCR), Partial remission (PR), Stable disease (SD), Progressive disease (PD), 4 months (4 treatment cycles)
Compare Outcomes of a 10-day Decitabine Per Cycle Regimen to a 5-day Regimen (Historical Controls), The overall response rate (CR/CRi/mCR/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi/mCR) will be compared with historical controls. Response assessed according to IWG criteria., 4 months (4 treatment cycles)|Rate of Mutation Clearance During Treatment, Samples collected at baseline and after 10, 28 and 56 days of therapy; the rate of mutation clearance was measured as mean VAF change per day of treatment and was estimated using linear mixed model for repeated measurement data ., Up to Day 56|Peripheral Blood Decitabine Plasma Levels, * To determine whether steady state serum concentrations of decitabine correlated with responses
* Complete remission (CR), Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), Partial remission (PR), Stable disease (SD), Progressive disease (PD), Not applicable (NA) - assessed according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria, Day 4|Change in Bone Marrow Methylcytosine, -Change of total bone marrow deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylcytosine from baseline to Day 10, Baseline and Day 10
