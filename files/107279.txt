This is an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, prospective study of darbepoetin alfa to treat anaemia in patients with low and intermediate-1 IPSS risk MDS. The study will consist of a 14-day screening period followed by a maximum 24-week treatment period and a final visit. Darbepoetin alfa will be initiated at a dose of 300 mcg QW SC over a period of 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, erythroid response will be evaluated, and treatment algorithm adapted to it.

The study treatment period will last for a maximum of 24 weeks. The treatment will end at the start of week 24. If the scheduled 24-week treatment period is not completed, it will end during the week of the last administration of the study drug.

The follow-up period will last for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 8 weeks after the last dose of darbepoetin alfa.

Subjects will be stratified at enrolment according to IPSS (low risk versus intermediate-1 risk).
