Enhancing Graft vs Leukemia Via Delayed Ex-Vivo Co-Stimulated DLI After Non-Myeloablative Stem Cell Transplantation
This is a new platform in non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation to improve survival by harnessing the immunologic potential of donor T-cells to induce and maintain long-term remissions in patients with hematologic malignancies without undue toxicity. This study involves is the first study in humans directed at optimizing the graft vs leukemia effect by infusing activated T-cells from healthy donors prophylactically, months after recovery from the initial transplant. Investigators are studying whether the activation of donor cells prior to infusion will enhance the patient's ability to "seek and destroy" residual malignant cells while also helping the immune system to fight infection without increasing the immune reaction against the host.

DRUG: Non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with prophylactic activated DLI|DRUG: "Prophylactic" delayed ADLI|DRUG: "Prophylactic" delayed activated donor lymphocyte infusion
Evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after non-myeloablative transplant (NMT)., Six months after last patient entered on study.
