18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography
The study objectives are as follows:

* To determine the safety of trial 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, produced by a new manufacturer, by surveillance for adverse events in patients having Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography scans in a comprehensive program for indications including, but not limited to, oncology, neurology, cardiac and infectious/inflammatory processes.
* To determine the efficacy of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography in differentiating benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules and calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using pathologic confirmation as the gold standard when available, or greater than 6 month follow up stability on Computed Tomography scan when not.

The purpose of performing this clinical trial is to provide local access of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to the patients of Newfoundland and Labrador. This product has been offered to patients over the last three years by transporting from facilities outside of the province. There have been significant delays in access and in fact, times where 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose has not been available through this process. This has caused delays and limitations of treatments for patients who rely on Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography scans for diagnosis.

DRUG: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
Measuring the safety of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose produced by a new manufacturer by evaluating for any adverse events that occur during their Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography scan appointment., Evaluation for any adverse events after administration of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose produced by Eastern Health in the Nuclear and Molecular Medicine Department who is a new manufacturer, For the length of time required to perform informed consent, the scan, and follow-up interview for adverse events, approximately 4 hours
Evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in the assessment of solitary pulmonary nodules compared to anatomic pathology, or more than 6 month follow-up stability when not available., Assess the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography in differentiating benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules. This is being done with a view towards eventually applying for an Abbreviated New Drug Submission., Variable, from the time of the scan to appropriate follow-up (either biopsy or follow-up imaging that occurs more than 6 months after the Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography study)
