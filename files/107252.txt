A Study of PM8002 (Anti-PD-L1/VEGF) in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With ES-SCLC
PM8002 is a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and VEGF. This study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PM8002 in combination with etoposide and platinum in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
SCLC
DRUG: PM8002|DRUG: Platinum|DRUG: Etoposide
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years
Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of randomization or first dosing date to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (based on RECIST v1.1)., Up to approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the start of the treatment to the first objective tumor response observed for patients who achieve CR or PR (based on RECIST v1.1)., Up to approximately 2 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, The PK parameters including serum concentrations of PM8002 at different time points after study drug administration., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), To evaluate the incidence of ADA to PM8002., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs), The incidence and severity of TRAEs graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 30 days after last treatment
