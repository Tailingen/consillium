HPV in Sinonasal Ca: Retrospective Analysis Association of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Serology and Behavioral Risk Factors
This is a case-control study designed to evaluate the role of anatomic site, gender and race in human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCC). We will explore the role of HPV, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, in HNSCC by tumor site with particular emphasis on the sinonasal cavity as well as differences in risk factors for HPV-positive HNSCC by gender and race.
