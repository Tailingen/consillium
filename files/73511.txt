Trilaciclib, a CDK 4/6 Inhibitor, in Patients Receiving Gemcitabine and Carboplatin for Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of trilaciclib versus placebo administered prior to gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients receiving first- or second-line treatment for locally advanced unresectable/metastatic TNBC.
TNBC - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trilaciclib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Effect on Overall Survival (OS), (Cohort 1):To evaluate the effect of trilaciclib on overall survival (OS) compared with placebo in patients receiving first-line gemcitabine and carboplatin., Cohort 1:From date of randomization up to 39 months|Effect on Overall Survival (OS), (Cohort 2): To evaluate the effect of trilaciclib on OS compared with placebo in patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin as second-line therapy after treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in the locally advanced unresectable/metastatic setting, Cohort 2: From date of randomization up to 28 months
Quality of life/Effects On Chemotherapy-Induced Fatigue, To assess the effect of trilaciclib on patients' quality of life as measured by time to first confirmed deterioration of fatigue compared with placebo in patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) up to 14 months|Myeloprotective Effects, Occurrence of cytopenias, febrile neutropenia, hospitalization due to chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, RBC and platelet transfusions, growth factor administration, and dose reductions and delays, Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) up to 14 months|Progression Free Survival, To evaluate the effect of trilaciclib on progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin., From date of randomization up to 14 months)
This study will have two separate cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Both cohorts will follow the same general study conduct/design with similar primary and key secondary endpoints and identical treatment arms.

* Cohort 1 will evaluate patients receiving first-line therapy, regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, who are programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy na√Øve.
* Cohort 2 will evaluate PD-L1 positive patients receiving second-line therapy following prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy in the locally advanced unresectable/metastatic setting.
