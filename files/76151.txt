Subclinical Cardio-toxicities Evaluation With Strain Rate Echocardiography After Chemotherapy and/or Mediastinal Radiotherapy in Patient With Lymphoma
Treatments-related cardiotoxicity is a critical issue in long term lymphoma survivors, particularly at young age, and its early identification is important to prevent clinically relevant cardiac events. Complete echocardiographic assessment including 2-dimension global longitudinal strain (2D-GLS), seems to be an effective tools in detecting preclinical systolic changes to the cardiac function even when the ejection fraction is preserved. The aim of Cardiocare study is to investigate early detection of subclinical chemo and radiation-induced changes in left ventricular function using 2D-GLS.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by echocardiography, Baseline, Change of LVEF from Baseline at 4/6 month (end of chemotherapy), Change of LVEF from Baseline at 6/8 months (end of radiotherapy - if applicable), Change of LVEF from Baseline at 9/11 months (3 months after treatment completion)|Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS), Global Longitudinal Strain measured by strain-rate echocardiography, Baseline, Change of GLS from Baseline at 4/6 month (end of chemotherapy), Change of GLS from Baseline at 6/8 months (end of radiotherapy - if applicable), Change of GLS from Baseline at 9/11 months (3 months after treatment completion)
