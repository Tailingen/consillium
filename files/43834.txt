Only toxicities that occurred during safety evaluation period(defined as first 28 days of treatment-Cycle 1 of Part 1) was used for analysis of specified toxicities and for dose reduction decisions. Toxicities were graded for severity as per NCI-CTCAE, version 4.03. Safety evaluation criteria were: Any Grade(G) \>=3 non-hematological toxicity without anorexia, or constipation, fatigue improved to G\<=2 in \<7 days, vomiting and diarrhea resolved in \<=3 days, laboratory abnormalities with hospitalization, tumor flare improved to G\<=2 in \<=7 days, elevation in AST/ALT for \<=7 days and G3 hypertension controlled by medical therapy; any treatment-related(TR)G4 or G\>=3 thrombocytopenia required platelet transfusion; Any TR G4 neutropenia \>=7 days or G3 or 4 neutropenia with infection/fever \>38.5 degrees Celsius; Any TR SAE or intolerable toxicity., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Combination 1: Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR of soft tissue (visceral or nodal disease) was defined as percentage of participants with measurable disease who achieved a best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 with no evidence of bone progression according to prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3) criteria., Up to 37 months|Combination 2: Composite Response Rate (RR), Composite response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had a composite response which is defined as one of the following PCWG3 criteria: Objective response (percentage of participants with measurable disease who achieved a best response of either CR or PR as assessed by RECIST 1.1 with no evidence of bone progression according to PCWG3 criteria) (confirmed per RECIST 1.1), or; circulating tumor cells (CTC) response: defined as CTC=0 per 7.5 milliliters (mL) of blood at 8 weeks for participants who had CTC greater than or equal to (\>=) 1 at baseline or CTC less than (\<) 5 per 7.5 mL with CTC \>=5 at baseline, confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained 4 or more weeks later, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declined of \>=50 percentage (%), measured twice 3 to 4 weeks apart.

This multicenter study will evaluate safety and efficacy of niraparib in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Combination 1 will combine niraparib with the anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 monoclonal antibody cetrelimab, in participants with mCRPC. Combination 1 has 2 parts: in Part 1 (dose selection), participants will be enrolled to establish RP2D doses of niraparib and cetrelimab; and Part 2 (dose expansion) will evaluate the combination therapy in an expanded number of participants into 2 cohorts (biomarker positive or biomarker negative). Combination 2 will combine niraparib with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA-P) in mCRPC participants with DNA-repair gene defects (DRD). Combination 3 will evaluate the relative bioavailability (BA) of niraparib and AA in combination. In a pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment phase, niraparib and AA will be administered, and in an extension phase, niraparib and AA-P will be administered. Combinations 1 and 2 will have 5 phases: A Pre-screening Phase, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, a Follow-up Phase, and a Long-term Extension (LTE) Phase; Combination 3 has 3 phases: A Screening Phase, A PK Assessment Phase, an Extension Phase (including LTE phase). Study evaluations will include efficacy, PK, PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, safety and tolerability.
