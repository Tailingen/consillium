A Phase 2a, Open-Label, Two Stage Study of Nerofe or Nerofe With Doxorubicin in Subjects With AML or MDS
This is a Phase 2a, Open-label, one arm study in which the eligible patients will be treated with IV Nerofe, three times a week in 28 days cycles (up to 12 cycles).

Evaluation will include safety procedures, blood level of study drug in certain time points, immune system response and tests checking the mechanism of the drug action.
