Primary brain tumors, including craniopharyngiomas, are a diverse group of diseases that together constitute the most common solid tumors of childhood. Brain tumors are classified according to an integrated assessment of histology and molecular characteristics, with tumor location and extent of spread as important factors that affect treatment and prognosis.
Craniopharyngiomas are uncommon pediatric brain tumors. They are believed to be congenital in origin, arising from ectodermal remnants, Rathke cleft, or other embryonal epithelium. They often occur in the suprasellar region with an intrasellar portion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging are used to diagnose craniopharyngiomas, but histological confirmation is generally required before treatment.
The treatment of patients with newly diagnosed craniopharyngiomas may include surgery, radiation therapy, cyst drainage, and intracystic therapies. The treatment of patients with recurrent craniopharyngiomas depends on the initial treatment used. With current treatment strategies, the 5-year and 10-year survival rates reach 80% to 90% for children between the ages of 0 and 14 years.[

Anatomy

Figure 1.  Anatomy of the inside of the brain, showing the pineal and pituitary glands, optic nerve, ventricles (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), and other parts of the brain. The tentorium separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum. The infratentorium (posterior fossa) is the region below the tentorium  that contains the brain stem, cerebellum, and fourth ventricle. The supratentorium is the region above the tentorium and denotes the region that contains the cerebrum.
Clinical Presentation
Craniopharyngiomas occur in the suprasellar region, near the pituitary gland, optic nerves, and optic chiasm (see
Figure 2
). This proximity commonly leads to injury of these surrounding structures, both by the tumor and interventions used to treat the tumor. Endocrine function is most frequently affected,[

] with patients suffering from neuroendocrine deficits such as growth hormone, thyroid, and cortisol deficiencies.  Additionally, tumor proximity to the optic nerves and chiasm may result in  visual compromise.[

Diagnostic Evaluation
CT and MRI scans are often diagnostic for childhood craniopharyngiomas, with most tumors demonstrating intratumoral calcifications and a solid and cystic component.  MRI of the spinal axis is not routinely performed.
Craniopharyngiomas without calcification may be confused with other tumor types, including germ cell tumors, hypothalamic/chiasmatic astrocytomas, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Biopsy or resection is required to confirm the diagnosis.[
17
]
Apart from imaging, patients undergo endocrine testing and formal vision examination, including visual-field evaluation.
Prognosis
Regardless of the treatment modality, the 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates range from 80% to 90% in children between the ages of 0 and 14 years.[

18
-
21
] The event-free survival (EFS) rates can be more variable, depending on therapy and clinical characteristics of the patient and tumor. EFS rates range from 23% for younger children to 65% for school-aged children.[

Histopathological Classification of Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Craniopharyngiomas are histologically benign and often occur in the suprasellar region, with an intrasellar portion. They may be locally invasive and typically do not metastasize to remote brain locations.
Craniopharyngiomas are classified under the category of tumors of the sella region according to the defined entities below. The two entities were previously described as subtypes of craniopharyngioma. However, based on the different populations they tend to affect, combined with distinct clinical, histological, and molecular characteristics, these are now considered unique diagnoses.[
1
]
Adamantinomatous:
Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas most frequently occur in children.[
2
] These tumors are typically composed of a solid portion formed by nests and trabeculae of epithelial tumor cells, with an abundance of calcification, and a cystic component that is filled with a dark, oily fluid. Wet keratin is also characteristic of this tumor type. Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are more locally aggressive than are papillary craniopharyngiomas and have a significantly higher rate of recurrence.[

] Activating
CTNNB1
gene variants are found in most adamantinomatous tumors.[

Stage Information for Childhood Craniopharyngioma
There is no generally applied staging system for childhood craniopharyngiomas. For treatment purposes, patients are grouped as having newly diagnosed or recurrent disease.
Treatment Option Overview for Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Treatments for pediatric craniopharyngiomas have traditionally included maximal safe surgical resection and radiation therapy to treat residual tumor. Additionally, intracystic therapies such as radioactive phosphorus P 32, bleomycin, and interferon-alpha have been used. Evidence has demonstrated that conservative surgical approaches lead to better neuroendocrine and quality-of-life outcomes in patients.[

,

] Additionally, as the biological understanding of molecular and inflammatory drivers of these tumors have been identified, targeted therapies are now being studied.

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation
There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for patients with newly diagnosed craniopharyngioma, in part because of the lack of prospective randomized trials that compare the different treatment options. Treatment is individualized on the basis of the following factors:
Tumor size.
Tumor location.
Extension of the tumor.
Potential short-term and long-term toxicity, partially related to baseline neuroendocrine and vision deficits (i.e., more conservative surgical approaches may be prioritized in patients who do not have existing neuroendocrine or visual deficits to mitigate the risk of surgical morbidity).[

Established treatment options for newly diagnosed childhood craniopharyngioma include the following:
Complete resection with or without radiation therapy
.
Subtotal resection with radiation therapy
.
Primary cyst drainage with or without radiation therapy
.
Intracystic therapy
.
Complete Resection With or Without Radiation Therapy
It may be possible to remove all visible tumor and achieve long-term disease control.[

] A 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of about 65% has been reported.[
5
] Reported recurrence rates range from less than 10% to nearly 50%.[
6
,
7
] Gross-total resection is often technically challenging because the tumor is surrounded by vital structures, including the optic nerves and chiasm, the carotid artery and its branches, the pituitary and hypothalamus, and the third cranial nerve. These structures may limit the ability to remove the entire tumor. Conservative surgical approaches are often used to preserve functional and quality-of-life outcomes.[

Level of evidence C1

Many surgical approaches have been described, and the choice is determined by tumor size, location, extension, and the patient's baseline signs and symptoms of disease. Surgical approaches include the following:
Craniotomy:
As noted above, gross-total resection may be technically challenging because the tumor is surrounded by vital structures. The surgeon often has a limited view of the hypothalamic and sellar regions, and portions of the mass may remain after surgery, accounting for some recurrences.  An understanding of the complex variations in how the tumors grow anatomically may help facilitate gross-total resection.[
10
] Nonetheless, almost all craniopharyngiomas attach to the pituitary stalk. Of the patients who undergo complete resection, virtually all will require lifelong pituitary hormone replacement with multiple medications.[
3
,
11
]
Transsphenoidal approach:
A transsphenoidal approach has been proven possible in patients of all ages and for tumors of various sizes localized within the sella.[
12
]; [
13
][
Level of evidence C1
]  The development of expanded endonasal techniques with endoscopic visualization has allowed increased use of this approach, even for sizeable childhood tumors, which is similar to the experience in adults.[
14
] A complete resection can be obtained using this approach, with associated complications of panhypopituitarism and the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leaks.[
15
,
16
] When an endonasal approach is not possible, a craniotomy is required.
Complications of complete resection using either approach include the following:
Obesity, which can be life-threatening.[
17
]
Need for hormone replacement therapy.[
18
]
Severe behavioral problems.[
18
]
Blindness.
Seizures.
Spinal fluid leak.
False aneurysms.
Difficulty with eye movements.
Death from intraoperative hemorrhage, hypothalamic damage, or stroke (rare).
If the surgeon indicates that the tumor was not completely removed or if postoperative imaging reveals residual craniopharyngioma, radiation therapy may be recommended to prevent early progression.[
19
][
Level of evidence C2
]  For more information, see the
Subtotal Resection With Radiation Therapy
section.
Routine surveillance using magnetic resonance imaging is performed for several years after complete resection because of the possibility of tumor recurrence.
Subtotal Resection With Radiation Therapy
The goal of limited surgery can be to establish a diagnosis, drain cystic components of the tumor, and decompress surrounding anatomical structures. In subtotal resections, removal of the tumor from the pituitary stalk or hypothalamus is typically avoided to minimize the late effects associated with complete resection.[
20
]
Surgery is often followed by radiation therapy, because radiation therapy can decrease the risk of recurrence after a subtotal resection.[
21
] With this approach, the 5-year PFS rates are approximately 70% to 90%,[
5
,
22
-
25
]; [
26
][
Level of evidence C1
] and the 10-year overall survival (OS) rates exceed 90%, which are similar to the rates in patients who undergo a gross-total resection.[
27
,
28

Level of evidence C1
]; [
29
][
Level of evidence C2
] Most often, radiation therapy is timed to immediately follow subtotal resection. However, in certain cases, such as in young patients or in patients without existing neuroendocrine or visual deficits, serial imaging may be used to delay or avoid radiation therapy for as long as feasible.[
7
,
30
] The standard approach to radiation therapy involves fractionated external-beam radiation, with a recommended dose of 50 to 54 Gy, in 1.8-Gy fractions, restricting the optic chiasm dose to 54 Gy.[
31
-
34
] Newer radiation technologies such as
intensity-modulated photon therapy
and
proton-beam radiation therapy
may reduce the radiation dose to uninvolved parts of the brain and spare normal tissue.[
23
,
34
-
36
] It is unknown whether such techniques reduce the late effects of radiation therapy.[
26
,
34
,
36
,
37
] Transient cyst enlargement may be noted during radiation therapy, and serial imaging may be required during radiation therapy to assess cyst changes and consider updates to radiation mapping.[

Surgical complications with a subtotal resection can be similar to, but are less likely than, with a complete resection. If radiation therapy is used, additional complications must be considered, including the following:
Loss of pituitary hormonal function.
Cognitive dysfunction.
Development of late strokes and vascular malformations.
Delayed blindness.
Development of second tumors.
Malignant transformation of the primary tumor within the radiation field (rare).[

A phase II single-arm study included 94 patients (aged 12 months to 21 years) with craniopharyngiomas who were treated with
proton-beam radiation therapy
after individualized surgical resection. These patients were compared with a historical cohort of patients who were treated with photon-beam radiation therapy.[
41
] The survival outcomes of patients who received proton therapy were similar to those of patients who received photon therapy. The cumulative incidence rates of necrosis, vasculopathy, changes in vision, and severe complications were also similar between the two groups of patients. However, patients treated with proton therapy in the more recent cohort had superior cognitive outcomes.
A long-term study of 101 children who were treated for craniopharyngiomas evaluated visual, neurocognitive, and endocrine outcomes after photon radiation therapy. Race and presence of a shunt affected baseline scores.[
42
] For children who presented with lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores at diagnosis, the impact of treatment often resulted in an IQ score reduction to the borderline mental disability range of 70 to 84. The investigators demonstrated that age at treatment (younger children had worse outcomes), radiation dose to the temporal lobes and hippocampi, and visual impairment significantly impacted neurocognitive function after radiation therapy. This study demonstrates the importance of these factors in the treatment and late effects of craniopharyngioma.
A report from the prospective registry study KiProReg examined the use of proton-beam therapy in 84 children younger than 18 years with craniopharyngioma.[
43
] The estimated 3-year OS rate was 98.2%, and the PFS rate was 94.7%. With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, late toxicities appeared acceptable. Sixty-three of the patients were treated with pencil-beam scanning, which is considered an advancement in proton technology.
Primary Cyst Drainage With or Without Radiation Therapy
For predominantly cystic craniopharyngiomas, stereotactic drainage of the cyst, insertion of a catheter from which drainage can be facilitated, or cyst fenestration are other therapeutic alternatives.[
7
,
44
] This can be followed by observation or radiation therapy, depending on clinical and tumor characteristics .  This procedure may also allow the surgeon to use the following two-staged approach:[
45
]
Draining the cyst to relieve pressure and complicating symptoms.
Resecting the tumor or employing radiation therapy later.
Intracystic Therapy
Intracystic therapies include peginterferon alpha, radioactive phosphorus P 32 (32P) or other compounds,[

A systematic review of publications on the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas with radioisotope brachytherapy from 2010 to 2021 identified 66 pediatric patients (N = 228).[
55
] With a minimum follow-up of 5 years, partial and complete responses were achieved in 89% of children with purely cystic lesions, compared with 58% of children with nonexclusively cystic lesions.  Visual improvement was achieved in 64% of the patients with purely cystic lesions, and endocrine improvement was achieved in 20% of these patients.  The observed progression rate was 3% for patients with purely cystic lesions.  Treatment with intracystic brachytherapy, most commonly using 32P and yttrium Y 90, can be considered for patients with purely cystic craniopharyngiomas.

Treatment options for recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma include the following:
Surgery
.
Radiation therapy, including radiosurgery

Intracystic therapy (intracavitary instillation of radioactive phosphorus P 32 [32P] or bleomycin for those with cystic recurrences, where these agents are available)
.
Systemic targeted therapy
.
Observation
.
Surgery
The management of recurrent craniopharyngioma is determined largely by previous therapy. Repeat attempts at gross-total resections are difficult, and long-term disease control is achieved less often.[

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation
Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the
NCI website
. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the
ClinicalTrials.gov website
.
Preclinical contemporary evaluations have identified active molecular and immune pathways in craniopharyngioma that may be targetable using commercially available or investigational agents. Specifically, MAPK and RAF pathways and immune/inflammatory targets such as PD-1 pathway components and IL-6 have been identified.[

Late Effects in  Patients Treated for Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Quality-of-life issues are important to pediatric patients with craniopharyngiomas and are difficult to generalize because of the various treatment modalities. In one series of 261 patients diagnosed with craniopharyngiomas before 2000, hypothalamic involvement was associated with lower overall survival (OS), impaired quality of life, and severe obesity.[
1
][
Level of evidence C1
] Other studies investigating quality of life in large, multi-institutional cohorts have correlated worse quality-of-life outcomes with variables such as older age at diagnosis, hypothalamic involvement, degree of postoperative hypothalamic injury, and degree of tumor resection.[
2
,
3
] Regardless of therapy, most patients with craniopharyngiomas experience long-term effects from the tumor and associated therapies.[

][
Level of evidence B3
]
Late effects of treatment for childhood craniopharyngioma include the following:
Behavioral issues and memory deficits.
Although intelligence quotient is usually maintained, behavioral issues and other cognitive domains such as memory, executive function, and attention are commonly impacted.[
4
,
6
-
8
] Memory and neurocognitive effects may be mitigated by the use of proton radiation therapy and conformal plans to avoid surrounding normal brain anatomy such as the hypothalamus and hippocampus.[
9
]; [
10
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Visual disturbances.
Visual disturbances, including visual field and acuity defects, have been reported. These deficits may be decreased with less aggressive surgical approaches or radiation therapy alone.[
11
][
Level of evidence C1
]; [
6
,
10
]
Endocrine abnormalities.
Endocrine abnormalities result in the almost universal need for lifelong endocrine replacement with multiple pituitary hormones.[
5
,

-
14
][
Level of evidence C1
]  Similar to visual disturbances, endocrine injury can be offset by limited surgical resection [

-
17
] and intracystic therapies that minimize invasive interventions.[
18
]
Decreased height.
Growth hormone replacement therapy is used to improve growth in children treated for craniopharyngiomas. Growth hormone replacement initiated in childhood results in increases in height without impact on OS and progression-free survival when compared with children who did not receive growth hormone.[
19
][
Level of evidence C1
]; [
20
] Growth hormone administration beginning 1 year after diagnosis may be associated with early improvements in quality of life when measured at 3 years postdiagnosis.[
21
][
Level of evidence C1
] Published consensus guidelines do not support an increased risk of recurrence with use of growth hormones. They recommend considering growth hormone replacement therapy as early as 3 months after completing cancer therapy in patients who have stable disease and significant growth deficits.[
22
][
Level of evidence D
]
Obesity.
Obesity, which can be life-threatening, and the development of metabolic syndrome, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, can occur.[
23
,
24
] Children who undergo complete resection or subtotal resection may develop obesity, suggesting that a predilection to obesity may be a component of the disease itself, not the result of direct hypothalamic injury.[
25
][
Level of evidence C1
] Severe obesity seen in patients with craniopharyngiomas is more likely a result of a combination of factors such as tumor location and treatment characteristics,  with multifaceted downstream impacts.[
26
][
Level of evidence C1
]   In a study of 709 patients with craniopharyngiomas, posterior hypothalamic involvement or operative injury to the posterior hypothalamus appeared to be a key factor in the development of severe obesity.[
3
]
Vasculopathies and stroke.
Vasculopathies and subsequent strokes may result from local irradiation.[
27
,
28
]  Previous studies have suggested that long-term growth hormone replacement may reduce the risk of stroke. Studies have also shown that pretreatment characteristics such as existing vascular injury, vessel location in the surgical field, and larger radiation doses to vascular structures increase the risk of long-term vessel stenosis.[
28
]; [
29
][
Level of evidence C1
] In a study of 94 pediatric patients with craniopharyngiomas who were treated with surgery and 54 Gy of proton therapy, the strongest predictor of postradiation therapy vasculopathy was preexisting vasculopathy.[
29
] The impact of proton radiation therapy was negligible within the operative corridor.  Despite the high incidence  (n = 27, 28.7%) of imaging-only evidence of subclinical stenosis events, only five patients required a revascularization procedure.  In one of these patients, high-grade stenosis was present before radiation therapy. Two patients had previous tumor recurrences that required multiple resections before radiation therapy.
Subsequent neoplasms.
Subsequent neoplasms may result from local irradiation.[
27
] Secondary malignancies related to radiation therapy that specifically involve the pituitary/sellar region can range from malignant tumors, such as high-grade gliomas, to meningiomas. This risk is increased in  patients who are younger at the time of radiation therapy.[

Latest Updates to This Summary (11/26/2024)
The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above.
Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Added
text
to state that a report from the prospective registry study KiProReg examined the use of proton-beam therapy in 84 children younger than 18 years with craniopharyngioma. The estimated 3-year overall survival rate was 98.2%, and the progression-free survival rate was 94.7%. With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, late toxicities appeared acceptable. Sixty-three of the patients were treated with pencil-beam scanning, which is considered an advancement in proton technology (cited Bischoff et al. as reference 43).
Late Effects in Patients Treated for Childhood Craniopharyngioma
Added Nguyen Quoc et al. as
reference 20
.

About This PDQ Summary
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of childhood craniopharyngioma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.
Reviewers and Updates
This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Childhood Craniopharyngioma Treatment are:
Kenneth J. Cohen, MD, MBA (Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital)
Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber of Boston Children's Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Harvard Medical School)
Roger J. Packer, MD (Children's National Hospital)
D. Williams Parsons, MD, PhD (Texas Children's Hospital)
