Innovative "Scoring System" in Breast Cancer Post Neoadiuvant Chemotherapy
Our aim is to create a Scoring System (SS) able of guaranteeing radical oncology by completely removing cancer and aesthetic outcomes in line with the needs or expectations of the patients that helps surgeons to decide the type of surgery in patients undergoing NACT.

Secondary outcome is to assess the ability of the score to avoid neoplastic relapses by evaluating:

* Loco-regional disease free-survival (LR-DFS): months between start of NACT and date of a neoplastic recurrence in residual mammary gland, in ipsilateral chest wall or in ipsilateral axilla.
* Distant disease-free survival (DDFS): months between start of NACT and date of onset of visceral or skeletal metastases.
* Overall survival (OS): months from the start of NACT to death or last follow-up.
