Pressure-enabled Retrograde Occlusive Therapy with Embolization for Control of Thyroid Disease (PROTECT Registry): a Multicenter Registry
Multi-center registry study to evaluate disease-related quality of life outcomes of thyroid embolization via pressure-enabled delivery (PED-TAE). Additional technical success data on parenchymal volume reduction, thyroid function tests changes and post-procedural complications will be recorded. Data will be collected for patients who have undergone PED-TAE using the TriNav Infusion System at participating sites. The registry study will include up to 10 sites, with Sarasota Memorial Health Care System acting as the lead site responsible for maintaining and monitoring the study database.

OTHER: Data Collection
ThyPro-39 questionnaire, Change in quality of life as measured by ThyPro-39 questionnaire at 6-months (+/- 60). Responses to each statement are measured on a Likert scale ranging from '0= no symptoms or problems' to '4= severe symptoms or problems' based on the period of the last 4 weeks. Higher scores indicate greater impact on quality of life due to thyroid issues., 6 months|Procedure related adverse events, Safety as measured by the rate of procedure related adverse events as measured by SIR criteria at 2-weeks (+/- 7 days), 3- (+/- 30 days) and 6-months (+/- 60 days) post PED-TAE using TriNav treatment., 6 months
Thyroid volume change, Thyroid volume change based on 3D CT volumetry at 6-months (+/- 60 days) post-treatment, 6 months|Change in TSH, T3 and T4, Change in TSH, T3 and T4 levels at 2-weeks (+/- 7 days), 3-(+/- 30 days) and 6-months (+/- 60 days) post-treatment, 6 months
