Evaluation of the Photobiomodulation Using LED Lamp for Curative Treatment of Radio-induced Mucositis.
This is a monocentric, prospective, non-comparative phase II study with minimal risks and constraints. The study will aim to assess the curative treatment of radio-induced mucositis by photobiomodulation using LED lamp.
Oral Cancer|Oropharyngeal Cancer
PROCEDURE: LED photobiomodulation
Mucositis assessment, The mucositis will be assessed at least once a week between the inclusion and the end of treatment by radiotherapy or radio-chimiotherapy. It will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v5 scale. The scale ranging from 1 to 5. Where 1 is mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated and where 5 is death related to adverse event.

We will consider as success the non-occurrence of stage 3 or higher mucositis between the inclusion and the end of radiotherapy. All patient presenting stage 3 or higher mucositis, which means, aphagia leading to an indication of nutritional support between the inclusion and the end of radiotherapy will be considered as a failure.

A patient receiving less than 60 grey for an other reason than mucositis will be concidered as not assessable for the primery outcome., Change from baseline mucositis assessment at 7 weeks
Pain related to the mucositis, Pain will be assessed with a decimal numerical scale (END) from 0 to 10. Where 0 is no pain felt and 10 is the maximal pain felt.

An estimation of the average difference between each mesure will be performed., At baseline, during each session - at least 3 times a week during 7 weeks, at the end of the study (week 7)|Starting a level 3 analgesic treatment (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydromorphone), Percentage of patients starting a level 3 analgesic treatment during the study., Through study completion, an average of 7 weeks|Quality of Life (QoL), The quality of life will be evaluated using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. This questionnaire aim to assess the quality of life of cancer and it's composed of 30 questions.

In this questionnaire, the items are scored from 1-4, where 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much.

Only 2 items in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire are scored from 1-7, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent.

After that, questions from 31 to 65 are about H\&N35, still to assess the quality of life of cancer.

The items are scored from 1-4, where 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much.

Only 5 items are scored from 1-2, where 1 = No and 2 = Yes., At baseline and at week 7 (end of the study)|Modification of treatment by radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy, Percentage of patient with an interruption (temporary or permanent) or dose modification., Through study completion, an average of 7 weeks|Interruption of sessions, Percentage of patient with session interruption, temporary or permanent., Through study completion, an average of 7 weeks|Number of side effects, Percentage of patients with side effect probably related to the photobiomodulation LED treatment., Through study completion, an average of 7 weeks|Nutritional support by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube, Percentage of patients with needs of nutritional support by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube., Through study completion, an average of 7 weeks|Weight variation, Weighting at each visit and comparison between the values, Every week during the study (7 weeks)|Performance status, Assessment of the general condition by the scale of performance status (OMS) from 0 to 5., Every week during the study (7 weeks)
The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the treatment of radio- or radio-chemotherapy-induced early stage mucositis (stage 1 and 2) by photobiomodulation using LED lamp (PLED) in terms of controlling the mucositis assessed at the end of radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy treatment.

Other objectives of the study include:

* To assess the pain evolution over-time, both overall over the evaluation period until the end of radiotherapy and at each session
* To assess the needs of level 3 analgesics (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydromorphone) during the PLED protocol.
* To assess the quality of life variation between inclusion and the end of treatment by radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy.
* To estimate the frequency of radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy treatment (temporary or permanent interruption, dose modification), and eventually, the reason of this modification.
* To assess the feasibility of photobiomodumation by LED (PLED) in this context.
* To assess the tolerability of photobiomodumation by LED (PLED) in a short term.
* To assess the frequency of the needs of nutritional support by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube during the PLED protocol.
* To assess the weight and general condition variation during the treatment.
