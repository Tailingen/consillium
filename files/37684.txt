Study Elesclomol Sodium in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase 1 study to test the safety of escalating doses of elesclomol sodium given to patients with advanced myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Elesclomol Sodium
Evaluation of adverse events based on frequency, causality, and severity as a measure of safety and tolerability., - Characterize the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium administered to subjects with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1 year|Measurement of study drug concentrations to characterize pharmacokinetics., - Determination of PK of elesclomol and elesclomol metabolites in subjects with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)., 1 year
Assessment of Dose Limiting Toxicities and Response based on Peripheral Blood Counts and Bone Marrow, - Determine the optimal Phase II dose and preliminary activity for elesclomol sodium in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)., 1 year
This aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium at escalating doses (ultimately identifying the maximum tolerated dose) when administered to patients with advanced myeloid leukemia.
