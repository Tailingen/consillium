A Study of the Combination of Anti-PD-1 AK105 and Anlotinib in First-line Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
This is a multi-center,open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody AK105 plus anlotinib hydrochloride in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: AK105|DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1., up to approximately 18 months
Number of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From the time of informed consent through 90 days after last dose of AK105|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 18 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD based on RECIST v1.1., up to approximately 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dosing till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., up to approximately 18 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of first dosing to death due to any cause., up to approximately 24 months|Observed concentrations of AK105, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK105 include serum concentrations of AK105 at different timepoints after AK105 administration., From first dose of AK105 through 90 days after last dose of AK105|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK105 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK105 through 90 days after last dose of AK105
