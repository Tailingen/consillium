A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A SAE is any AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after last dose of study drug up to 106.7 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response of ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% Reduction at 4 Weeks, PSA Response is defined as a reduction in PSA from Baseline and is reported for 2 categories: ≥ 50% reduction and ≥ 90% reduction., Week 5, Day 1|Prostate-Specific Antigen Nadir, PSA nadir is the lowest PSA achieved after treatment., During Weeks 1 to 24|Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Concentration at the End of Weeks 12 and 24, Blood was collected and serum concentrations of PSA were obtained using a validated laboratory test at a central laboratory facility., Day 1 of Weeks 13 and 25|Time to Achieve Testosterone Concentrations < 50 ng/dL and < 20 ng/dL, During Weeks 1 to 24|TAK-385 Plasma Concentrations, Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 25, 37, 49 pre-dose; Day 4 of Week 1 pre-dose; Day 1 of Weeks 5, 13, 2 hrs post-dose|Serum Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Concentrations, Blood was collected and serum concentrations of LH in milli international units per milliliters (mIU/mL) were obtained using a validated laboratory test at a central laboratory facility., Baseline and Day 4 of Week 1, Day 1 of Weeks 2, 3, 5,13, 25 and 49, End of Treatment (EOT - 106.4 Weeks), Follow-up (110.4 Weeks) and End of Study (114.4 Weeks)|Serum Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Concentrations, Blood was collected and serum concentrations of FSH were obtained using a validated laboratory test at a central laboratory facility., Day 1 of Weeks 2, 5, 13, 25, 49, EOT (106.4 Weeks), Follow-up (110.4 Weeks) and End of Study (114.4 Weeks)|Serum Sex Hormone-binding Globulin (SHBG) Concentrations, Blood was collected and serum concentrations of SHBG were obtained using a validated laboratory test at a central laboratory facility., Day 1 of Weeks 2, 5, 13, 25, 49, EOT (106.4 Weeks), Follow-up (110.4 Weeks) and End of Study (114.4 Weeks)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-P25 Score, EORTC QLQ-PR25 is an EORTC module designed to supplement the QLQ-C30 for any application in prostate cancer consisting of 25 questions distributed on 6 domains: urinary symptoms (8 items), incontinence aid (1 item), bowel symptoms (4 items), hormonal treatment-related symptoms (HTRS) (6 items), sexual activity (2 items), and sexual functioning (4 items). Questions use are answered using a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all to 4 =Very much. All raw domain scores are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual). A positive change from Baseline in activity or functioning scales and negative change from Baseline in symptom scales indicates improvement., Baseline and Day 1 of Weeks 5,13, 25, 37 and 49, EOT (106.4 Weeks), Follow-up (110.4 Weeks) and End of Study (114.4 Weeks)|Percent Change From Baseline of Aging Male Survey (AMS) Total Score, AMS scale is a self-administered questionnaire used to: 1) assess symptoms of aging (independent from those that are disease related) between groups of males under different conditions; 2) evaluate the severity of symptoms over time; and 3) measure changes before and after androgen therapy. Each question was answered between 1=none to 5=extremely severe for 17 items from psychological (5 items), somatic (7 items), and sexual (5 items) categories. Total score is sum of all the item scores and range from 17 (minimum) to 85 (maximum), where high score indicated high level of symptoms., Baseline and Day 1 of Weeks 5,13, 25, 37 and 49, EOT (106.4 Weeks), Follow-up (110.4 Weeks) and End of Study (114.4 Weeks)|Change From Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 included 30 questions comprising 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties) and a global health and QOL scale. Most questions used a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much); 2 questions used a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). All domain scores were calculated as an average of item scores and transformed to 0 to 100 score range. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problem. A positive change from Baseline in quality og life or functioning scales and negative change from Baseline in symptom or difficulties scales indicates improvement., Day 1 of Weeks 5, 13, 25, 37, 49, 73, 97, EOT (106.4 Weeks), Follow-up (110.4 Weeks) and End of Study (114.4 Weeks)
The drug being tested in this study is called relugolix (TAK-385). Relugolix is being tested to treat people who have prostate cancer. This study will look at achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression (\<50 ng/dL).

The study enrolled 136 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

* Relugolix 80 mg
* Relugolix 120 mg
* Leuprorelin 22.5 mg

Relugolix was administered starting with a 320 mg (loading dose), followed by relugolix 80 mg or 120 mg tablets, for 48 weeks plus an optional 48-week extension at the investigator's discretion. Patients randomized to leuprorelin were administered 22.5 mg subcutaneously on Day 1 and every 12 weeks for 4 injections.

This multicenter trial was conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time to participate in this study was 114.4 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and at 12 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
