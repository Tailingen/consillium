A Study to Investigate ANS014004 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multi-center study with the aim of exploring the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ANS014004 as a single agent in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors

Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage or number of patients with a confirmed investigator assessed complete or partial response according to response criteria in solid tumours (RECIST v1.1), From date of first dose of ANS014004 up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression (approximately 2 years)|Duration of Response (DoR), The percentage of patients with confirmed CR or PR or having SD maintained (RECIST v1.1), From date of first dose of ANS014004 up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression (approximately 2 years)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), From date of first dose of ANS014004 up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, From date of first dose of ANS014004 up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression (approximately 2 years)|Progression free Survival (PFS), The time from first dose until RECIST 1.1 defined disease progression or death due to any cause, rom date of first dose of ANS014004 up until date of progression or death due to any cause (approximately 2 years)|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of the first dose of study treatment until death due to any cause, From date of first dose of ANS014004 up until the date of death due to any cause (approximately 2 years)|Pharmacokinetics of ANS014004: Plasma PK concentrations, Measurement of plasma concentrations of ANS014004, total antibody and total unconjugated warhead, From date of first dose up until 28 days post last dose|Pharmacokinetics of ANS014004: Area under the concentration time curve (AUC), Measurement of PK parameters: Area under the concentration time curve (AUC), From date of first dose up until 28 days post last dose|Pharmacokinetics of ANS014004: Maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (C-max), Measurement of PK parameters: Maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug (C-max), From date of first dose up until 28 days post last dose|Pharmacokinetics of ANS014004: Time to maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (T-max), Measurement of PK parameters: Time to maximum observed plasma concentration of the study drug (T-max), From date of first dose up until 28 days post last dose|Pharmacokinetics of ANS014004: Clearance, Measurement of PK parameters: the volume of plasma from which the study drug is completely removed per unit time (Clearance), From date of first dose up until 28 days post last dose|Pharmacokinetics of ANS014004: Half-life, Measurement of PK parameters: Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), From date of first dose up until 28 days post last dose
