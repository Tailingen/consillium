SCT-001 CAR T Cells Therapy for Relapsed and Refractory Ovarian Cancer
This study is an open-label, dose-escalation, investigator-initiated phase I interventional clinical study. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SCT-001 CAR-T cell injection in subjects with relapsed and refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer, and to explore the pharmacokinetic characteristics, biomarker changes and immunogenicity of SCT-001 CAR-T cell injection in subjects with relapsed and refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer.

In this study, two trial cohorts were set up, cohort 1 was the intraperitoneal route of administration, and the subjects enrolled in cohort 1 needed to meet the conditions for intraperitoneal administration ((1) the subject had a large amount of ascites, (2) the subject was suitable for peritoneal catheterization, (3) the subject had no severe abdominal adhesions, and (4) the subject agreed to undergo intraperitoneal surgical catheterization for intraperitoneal administration); Cohort 2 is the intravenous route.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma|Peritoneal Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: SCT-001 CAR-T cells
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), The incidence of of DLT event, which is defined as toxic events related to SCT-001 CAR-T cell injection that occur within the DLT observation period (28 days after CAR-T cell injection), including general adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)., 28 days|Incidence of adverse events, Toxicity within 24 months after CAR-T cell injection will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., 24 months
Change of CAR Copies, CAR Copies measured by qPCR (12 months after CAR-T infusion), 12 months|Objective response rate, The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator in accordance with the RECIST 1.1 criteria, 12 months
