Study of Accurate Diagnosis and Treatment of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
The mutation of STK11 has been regcognized to be the major cause of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS).The aim of this study was to confirm the mutation rate of gene associated with gastrointestinal malignancies,including STK11, APC,PMS1,et al. Furtherly, the investigators analyze the association of STK11 with gut microbiota.
Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome
BEHAVIORAL: Second generation sequencing|BEHAVIORAL: 16s rRNA gene sequencing
Mutation of gene associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Mutation of gene associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, including STK11, APC,PMS1,PMS2 et al., 2 years
Intestinal microbiota of patients with PJS, Identify the variation of intestinal microbiota of patients with PJS, 1year
The association of STK11 with intestinal microbiota of patients with PJS, The association of STK11 with intestinal microbiota of patients with PJS, 1 year
All patients diagnosed as PJS were enrolled and accepted second generation gene sequencing with their blood specimens. Then all patients allocated into gene mutation group and no gene mutation group according to if the cases accompany with gene mutation of STK11.Also, health persons were enrolled and a case controlled study will be carried out.All patients and health persons accepted 16s rRNA sequencing with their feces specimens.
