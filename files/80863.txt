PCOS Immune Function Predicts Metformin Efficacy
In this study, the investigators will include PCOS patients who meet the trial criteria, introduce participants to the content of this study, and invite participants to participate. The immune function of peripheral blood samples of PCOS patients was detected by flow cytometry. Participants were further treated with metformin for 6 months and followed up after the intervention. The objective of this study was to investigate immune markers related to the efficacy of metformin in PCOS patients and to predict the efficacy of metformin in PCOS patients using immune function.

In this study, peripheral blood samples of PCOS patients were collected before and after intervention. Flow cytometry was used to detect the antigenic antibody reaction between the surface differentiation antigen of lymphocyte membrane and fluorescently labeled antibodies in human peripheral blood, and the unlabeled cells were dissolved. The number and percentage of cell groups expressing different markers were counted by the fluorescence detection system on flow cytometry.
