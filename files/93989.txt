Phase I/II Clinical Study of Decitabine Combined With TQB2450 Injection or Decitabine + Anlotinib Combined With TQB2450 Injection in the Treatment of PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody-resistant Digestive System Tumors
This clinical study focused on patients with digestive system tumors resistant to PD-1 inhibitors, and explored the reversal resistance of epigenetic drugs (decitabine) and TKI drugs (anlotinib) in this part of patients.
Patients With Digestive System Tumors Resistant to PD-1 Inhibitors
DRUG: decitabine＋ TQB2450 injection|DRUG: decitabine＋ TQB2450 injection＋Anlotinib
Overall response rate (ORR), Objective response rate refers to the percentage of complete (CR) or partial response (PR) subjects determined by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 or iRECIST (CR under iRECIST criteria, PR can occur after imaging disease progression)., up to 48 weeks
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause., up to 48 weeks
