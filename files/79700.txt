A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Divarasib Versus Sotorasib or Adagrasib in Participants With Previously Treated KRAS G12C-positive Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of divarasib compared to locally approved KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib or adagrasib) in participants with KRAS G12C-positive (KRAS G12C +) advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), Up to approximately 4 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, Up to approximately 4 years|Objective Response, Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 4 years|Time to Confirmed Deterioration (TTCD) on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Dyspnea Item and Physical Functioning Scale, Baseline up to approximately 4 years|TTCD on the EORTC Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Supplemental Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13) Cough Scale, Baseline up to approximately 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression, as determined by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), Up to approximately 4 years|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Up to approximately 4 years|Number of Participants Reporting Presence, Frequency, Severity, and/or Degree of Interference with Daily Function of Symptomatic Treatment Toxicities Assessed by NCI Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), Up to approximately 4 years|Change from Baseline in Diarrhea, Nausea, Vomiting, Anorexia, Alopecia, Dyspnea, Cough, Constipation, Myalgia, Headache, and Rash/Acne as Assessed Through use of the NCI PRO-CTCAE, Baseline up to approximately 4 years|Frequency of Participants' Response of the Degree they are Troubled with Treatment Symptoms, as Assessed Through use of the single-item EORTC Item List (IL46), Up to approximately 4 years|Change from Baseline in Cough, Chest Pain, Dyspnea, Physical and Role Functioning, and Global Health Status score/Quality of Life Score (GHS/QoL) at Each Timepoint as Assessed Through use of the EORTC QLQ-LC13 and QLQ-C30, Baseline up to approximately 4 years|TTCD on the EORTC QLQ-C30 Role Functioning and GHS/QoL scales, Up to approximately 4 years|TTCD on the Chest Pain Scale of the QLQ-LC13 Scales, Up to approximately 4 years
