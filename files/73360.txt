Safety and Efficacy Study of Imexon for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma Patients
AMP-007 is a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of advanced, previously treated multiple myeloma. The first phase of the study is designed to determine a safe dose of imexon that can be given to patients with advanced, previously-treated multiple myeloma. The Phase 2 part of the study is designed to provide additional safety data and to gain an understanding of whether imexon can improve the outcome for patients with multiple myeloma
