Ultrasound Radiomics for Predicting Breast Cancer and Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis
The project is proposed based on multimodal ultrasonic imaging omics building used for accurate prediction of the breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis load artificial intelligence forecasting model, this method can dig the hidden features of ultrasonic image is not visible to the naked eye, make up the subjectivity in the process of clinical doctors in diagnosis and treatment, provide accurate, objective basis for clinical decision making.
