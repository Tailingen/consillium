A Phase 1/2a Study of Human Anti-CD 38 Antibody MOR03087 (MOR202) in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is an open-label, multicentre, dose escalation study to characterize the safety and preliminary efficacy of the human anti-CD38 antibody MOR03087 (MOR202), in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, as monotherapy and in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in combination with standard therapy.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: MOR03087 phase 1 dose escalation|DRUG: MOR03087|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose and / or Recommended Dose and Dosing Regimen of MOR03087, 1. as monotherapy
2. in combination with dexamethasone
3. in combination with pomalidomide + dexamethasone
4. in combination with lenalidomide + dexamethasone, First cycle of treatment|Number of Participants Who Develop Anti-MOR03087 Antibodies, Number of participants who develop anti-MOR03087 antibodies, a measure of immunogenicity, during treatment period, maximum 3 years after 1st dose
Overall Response Rate, number (#) of patients responding (# stringent complete response + # complete response + # very good partial response + # partial response), maximum 3 years after 1st dose|Time to Progression, Time to Progression (Kaplan Meier estimate), patients were observed for up to 36 months|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (Kaplan Meier estimates), patients were observed up to 36 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response (Kaplan Meier estimates), patients were observed up to 36 months|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax - Maximum Observed Serum Concentration for MOR202, PK analysis for MOR202 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg IV once weekly dose groups only, since serum concentrations of MOR202 were substantially affected by target mediated drug disposition effects for remaining dose groups, up to 7 days after last MOR202 dose|Pharmacokinetics: AUC Cycle 1+2 - Area Under the Time/Concentration Curve for MOR202, PK analysis for MOR202 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg IV once weekly dose groups only, since serum concentrations of MOR202 were substantially affected by target mediated drug disposition effects for remaining dose groups, 56 days
The study enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and Karnofsky performance status of 60% or higher. Patients were assigned to the different treatment regimens with MOR202 ranging between 0Â·01 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg in a 3 + 3 design. Dose-escalation and expansion was done either with MOR202 intravenous infusions alone (MOR202 q2w \[twice a week\] and q1w \[weekly\] groups) or in combination with dexamethasone (MOR202 with dexamethasone group), with dexamethasone plus pomalidomide (MOR202 with dexamethasone plus pomalidomide group) or plus lenalidomide (MOR202 with dexamethasone plus lenalidomide group). Primary endpoints were safety, MOR202 maximum tolerated dose (or recommended dose) and regimen, and immunogenicity.
