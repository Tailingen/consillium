Real World Study of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Advanced Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most common and the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the world. In spite of the progresses made in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer in the past decades, the prognosis is still unsatisfied mainly due to recurrence and distant metastasis. Surgical treatment is the first choice for the treatment of early gastric cancer, but it is prone to recurrence and metastasis after surgery. There are relatively few chemotherapy drugs for gastric cancer. Studies have shown that about 13% of gastric cancers have HER2 gene amplification, and there are no other known driver gene other than HER-2. At present, the targeted therapeutic drugs approved for gastric cancer in China are only trastuzumab and apatinib.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 inhibitors, PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors, have achieved significant therapeutic effects in a variety of tumors and are expected to alter the current state of treatment of tumors. In gastric cancer, the KEYNOTE-012 study demonstated the efficacy of Pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive advanced gastric cancer. The study showed that 53% of patients had tumor retraction, and 22% achieved partial imaging remission with a median duration of 40 weeks. At the same time, Pembrolizumab is also less toxic than standard second-line chemotherapy. However, Are the Immune checkpoint inhibitors should be used as single-drug or in combination with chemotherapy? Are the Immune checkpoint inhibitors should be used in the first-line or in the back-line? And which is the best combination therapy? For these issues, there is no conclusion yet.

This observational study included all patients with gastric cancer who used Immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice, regardless of treatment lines and combination with different chemotherapy. Through follow-up observations, the aim of this study is to analyze the efficacy of Immune checkpoint inhibitors for gastric cancer in the real world, and to explore the differences in the efficacy of Immune checkpoint inhibitors in different stages of treatment, as well as the efficacy of different chemotherapy combinations, so as to provide clinical evidence for the use of immunotherapy for advanced gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
OS (overall survival), the time from receiving the first dose of Immune checkpoint Inhibitors treatment to death or the end of the observation, through study completion, an average of 3 years
progression-free survival (PFS), the time from receiving the first dose of Immune checkpoint Inhibitors treatment to progression of disease (PD) or death, through study completion, an average of 3 years
