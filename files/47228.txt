Safety and Tolerance Study of Oral Doses of CT53518 to Treat Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
This is the first study of the drug CT53518 when given to humans. The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of CT53518 that can safely be given to patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and to identify the side effects associated with taking the drug. The study will evaluate how CT53518 is absorbed, broken down, and eliminated by the body. Additionally, the study will evaluate the effects of the drug on a specific type of cell in bone marrow and blood, known as a blast.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: CT53518
This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalating study at five clinical sites to determine dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and the effect on the peripheral and bone marrow blast count of an oral 28-day course of CT53518 in patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome. This study will confirm the tolerability and assess the effects on the peripheral and bone marrow blast count of an oral 28-day course of CT53518 at or near the maximum tolerated dose in patients with AML displaying a specified mutation of the FLT-3 gene, internal tandem duplication (ITD).
