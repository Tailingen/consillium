Surgical Approach in Liver Hemangiomas
Operations performed for liver hemangioma between January 2017 and December 2018 will be retrospectively analyzed.
Hemangioma Liver
PROCEDURE: Liver resection or enucleation for liver hemangioma
Complications, Complications after surgery for hemangioma will be collected from records and and will be classified according to 'The Clavien-Dindo Classification of Surgical Complications'. The classification grades are ranging between Grade 1(better) which indicates minor deviation from normal postoperative course and Grade 5 (worst) which means death as a complication., Complications reported within 3 months after surgery will be evaluated within 15 days after completion of data collection
Hospital stay, Length of hospital stay postoperatively, Hospital stay starting with operation and ends with discharge will be compared within 15 days after completion of data collection|Transfusion, Rate of erythrocyte transfusion, Erythrocyte transfusion during surgery will be analyzed within 15 days after completion of data collection
Operations performed for liver hemangioma at Ankara University Hospitals will be retrospectively analyzed. Patient and disease characteristics including demographics, laboratory tests, imaging studies, type of surgical approach and outcomes including postoperative laboratory tests, record of complications, duration of hospital stay will be reviewed. Complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. The patients were informed about the surgeries in advance and their informed consents about surgeries and data collection for scientific purposes were obtained. Datafile will be anonymized before analysis and original file will be destroyed. Outcomes such as complications, hospital stay, blood transfusion and mortality will be compared between groups created according to type of surgery, lesion size, preoperative laboratory values and demographic features. Variables for prediction of better outcomes are expected to be discovered.
