A Phase I, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study to Assess the Safety of Lenalidomide in Patients With Advanced Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma and Peripheral T-cell Lymphomaperipheral T-cell Lymphoma
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide in patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who have previously received therapy for ATL and PTCL
Adult T-cell Leukemia-Lymphoma|Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide
The safety of lenalidomide evaluated based on the severity of adverse events and their causality, The safety of lenalidomide evaluated based on the severity of adverse events and their causality, Up to 2.5 years
Response, The response of ATL patient to lenalidomide will be evaluated according to the criteria proposed by the International Consensus Meeting.

The response of PTCL will be assessed by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) response criteria that have been established by the Lymphoma Study Group of the JCOG based on criteria of Cheson et al.in the Report of an International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas, Up to 2.5 years|PK-Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), PK-Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Day 8 of Cycle 1|PK-Apparent Total Body Clearance (CL/F), PK-Apparent Total Body Clearance (CL/F), Day 8 of Cycle 1|PK-Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F), PK-Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F), Day 8 of Cycle 1|PK-Terminal half-life (T1/2), PK-Terminal half-life (T1/2), Day 8 of Cycle 1|PK-Area under the Plasma concentration time curve (AUC), PK-Area under the Plasma concentration time curve (AUC), Day 8 of Cycle 1|Accumulation ratio (Cmax), Accumulation ratio (Cmax), Day 8 of Cycle 1|Accumulation ratio (AUCτ), Accumulation ratio (AUCτ), Day 8 of Cycle 1|PK-Maximum Concentration in Plasma (Cmax), PK-Maximum Concentration in Plasma (Cmax), Day 8 of cycle 1
