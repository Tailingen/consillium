Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radio Frequency Ablation Assisted Enucleation of Renal Cell Carcinoma With T1a Stage
To evaluate the feasibility and efﬁciency of zero ischemia robot-assisted laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted enucleation of T1a renal cell carcinoma in comparison with robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy without hilar clamping.
