DRUG: Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223)|DRUG: Matching placebo (normal saline)|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Prednisone/Prednisolone
Symptomatic Skeletal Event Free Survival (SSE-FS), SSE-FS was defined as time (months) from randomization to the earliest of onset date of skeletal symptoms treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), onset date of pathological bone fracture, onset date of spinal cord compression, procedure date of tumor-related orthopedic surgery, or death from any cause. Participants who died without prior SSE and ≥ 13 weeks after the last SSE assessment are censored at the last SSE assessment date. Participants alive at the survival cut-off date are censored at the last date known to be alive. Participants with multiple events are only counted for the category in which the first event occurred. If multiple SSE (component events) occur on the same date for 1 participant, the participant is only counted into 1 category in the order of: spinal cord compression \> bone fracture \> orthopedic surgery \> EBRT., From randomization until first onset of on-study symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) or death, up to 47 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (months) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants alive at the survival cut-off date were censored at the last date known to be alive., From randomization until death from any cause, up to 67 months|Radiological Progression Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS was defined as the time (months) from the date of randomization to the date of confirmed radiological progression or death (if death occurred before progression) based on independent assessment., From randomization until the date of confirmed radiological progression or death, up to 47 months|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression was defined as the interval from randomization to the first date a participant experienced pain progression assessed by Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form and defined as: an increase of 2 or more points in the average worst pain score (WPS) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart or initiation of short- or long-acting opioid use for pain for participants with WPS 0 at baseline; an increase of 2 or more points in the average WPS from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart and an average WPS of ≥4 OR initiation of short- or long-acting opioid use for pain for participants with WPS 1 to 3 at baseline. Participants without pain progression at end of study are censored at the last date known to have not progressed: last evaluation date for pain scores or last visit when recorded opiate use, whichever is last. Participants with no on-study assessment or no baseline assessment are censored at the date of randomization., From randomization until the date of pain progression based on pain score, up to 47 months|Time to Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy is time (months) from randomization to the earliest date of the first cytotoxic chemotherapy. Participants who have not started cytotoxic chemotherapy during the study were censored at the last assessment date., From randomization until the date of first cytotoxic chemotherapy, up to 47 months|Time to Opiate Use for Cancer Pain, Time to opiate use for cancer pain was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of opiate use., From randomization until the date of opiate use, up to 47 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign \[including abnormal laboratory findings\], symptom or disease) in a participant in the study. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose was resulting in death, was life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. A treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or serious TEAEs was defined as any event that started on or after the first dose of the study treatment and during the treatment period and was not a continuation of a pretreatment event or started before the first dose and worsened after the first dose or the treatment period. Drug-related TEAEs or serious TEAEs were those with "reasonable causal relationship" to the study treatment decided by the investigators., From start of study treatment until the end of the treatment period, up to 110 months|Number of Participants With Radium-223/Placebo-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Per Maximum Intensity, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign \[including abnormal laboratory findings\], symptom or disease) in a participant in the study. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose was resulting in death, was lifethreatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. A treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or serious TEAEs was defined as any event that started on or after the first dose of the study treatment and during the treatment period and was not a continuation of a pretreatment event or started before the first dose and worsened after the first dose or the treatment period. Radium-223/placebo-related TEAEs or serious TEAEs were those with "reasonable causal relationship" to radium-223 or placebo decided by the investigators., From start of study treatment until the end of the treatment period, up to 110 months|Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Additional Primary Malignancies, Treatment-emergent additional primary malignancies were adverse events identified as additional primary malignancies that occurred after start of study treatment until the end of the treatment period., From start of study treatment until the end of the treatment period, up to 110 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Bone Fractures, Treatment-emergent fractures were adverse events identified as fractures that occurred after start of study treatment until the end of the treatment period. All bone fractures and bone-associated events (e.g., osteoporosis) were reported as either AEs, or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator's causality assessment., From start of study treatment until the end of the treatment period, up to 110 months|Number of Participants With Post-treatment Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign \[including abnormal laboratory findings\], symptom or disease) in a participant in the study. Any bleeding event occurring during the study was not documented as an AE because this event was planned to be captured in the assessment of efficacy. AEs that started after the treatment period were defined as post-treatment AEs. Drug-related AEs were those with "reasonable causal relationship" to the study treatment decided by the investigators., After the treatment period, up to 48.5 months in active follow-up and 74.9 months in long-term follow-up|Number of Participants With Any Study Drug-related Post-treatment Adverse Events Per Maximum Intensity, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign \[including abnormal laboratory findings\], symptom or disease) in a participant in the study. Any bleeding event occurring during the study was not documented as an AE because this event was planned to be captured in the assessment of efficacy. AEs that started after the treatment period were defined as post-treatment AEs.

All bone fractures and bone-associated events (e.g., osteoporosis), were reported as either AEs, or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator's causality assessment., After the treatment period, up to 48.5 months in active follow-up and 74.9 months in long-term follow-up
This study is a phase III multinational, multicenter,randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, study with a randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 (radium-223 dichloride plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone: placebo plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone). Until the final overall survival (OS) analysis, the study period consisted of screening / randomization, treatment, active follow-up with clinic visits, active follow-up without clinic visits, and longterm follow-up phases. Up until this point, subjects received study treatment (radium-223 dichloride or placebo in addition to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone for the first 6 cycles followed by abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone thereafter) until an on-study SSE occurred (or other withdrawal criteria were met). After the final OS analysis (after implementation of Amendment 7), in order to reduce the burden to study subjects, evaluation of efficacy and exploratory endpoints will be discontinued, except for symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) and OS. Subjects who are discontinued from study treatment will initiate the long-term follow-up period; therefore, active follow-up periods will no longer be applicable. Subjects who are in active follow-up at the time of Amendment 7 is implemented should have the end of active follow-up completed (protocol driven decision) and should be directly transitioned into the extended safety follow-up study. Long term follow-up will continue until the subject dies, is lost to follow-up, withdraws informed consent, actively objects to collection of further data , or is transitioned to the extended safety follow-up study. Subjects will be followed for safety for up to 7 years, which eventually will be completed in this study or in the extended safety follow-up study.
