Patients who are alive will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive on or before the time of analysis., Up to 37 months post-randomization.|EQ-5D-5L utility index at 12 and 18 months., The EQ-5D-5L utility index will be calculated using the EQ-5D-5L value set for the recruiting site country (Singapore, China, South Korea, and Taiwan) based on EQ-5D-5L assessment at time t (t = 12 and 18 months). Currently, there is no value set available for Singapore. However, if it will not be available by the time of the analysis, another suitable country's value set will be used. The EQ-VAS will also be used as an additional measure., 12 and 18 months post-randomization.|FACT-Hep scores at 12 and 18 months., The FACT-Hep total score along with subscales (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, hepatobiliary cancer, trial outcome index, FACT-G total score) will be calculated using the FACT-Hep (version 4) scoring guideline based on FACT-Fep assessment at time t (t = 12 and 18 months)., 12 and 18 months post-randomization.|Quality-adjusted life years at 18 months., The quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) will be calculated as the area under the EQ-5D-5L index during the 18 months., 18 months post-randomization.
SIRT-Y90 post-treatment dosimetry., Voxel-level mean tumor absorbed dose (Dmean) and mean biological effective dose (BEDmean) for SIRT-Y90 will be calculated using CT images using local deposition method. In addition, administered activity and mean absorbed dose to treated liver volume (including both tumoral and non-tumoral tissue) will be used as dosimetry parameters. Dose response evaluation will be attempted based on the information obtained and follow-up anatomical evaluation. The impact of tumour absorbed dose on BORR, tumour response as assessed by RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST and outcomes of patients receiving SIRT-Y90 (3, 6, 12 and 18 months) will be assessed., 4-week SIRT pre-randomization; 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-randomization.|Hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS)., Hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS) is defined as the time from randomization and the date of tumor progression in liver or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For those who remain alive and have not progressed in the liver, HPFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment on or before the time of analysis or end of study treatment, whichever is earlier., Up to 19 months post-randomization.|Tumor resectability rates at 12 and 18 months., Tumor resectability rate at time t (t = 12 and 18 months) is defined as the number of patients undergone surgical resection for the target lesions of HCC by time t, divided by the total number of patients in the analysis population., 12 and 18 months post-randomization.|Impact of Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade on the overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes of HCC patients undergoing SIRT-Y90., The ALBI (Albumin-Bilirubin) score is calculated based on serum albumin and bilirubin levels and values are classified into three ALBI grades: Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3, where Grade 1 indicates a better outcome. In this trial, the ALBI grade at screening will be correlated to information obtained during treatment and follow up visits such as clinical outcomes like mortality, grade 3 or 4 adverse events and/or radiological responses as measured by RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST., Up to 19 months post-randomization.|Occurrence of adverse events and adverse events related to study treatment., Occurrence of adverse events and adverse events related to study treatment up to 30 days post last study treatment dose, including abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters., Up to 19 months post-randomization.|Occurrence of ≥3 grade adverse events (graded with NCI CTCAE v5.0)., Occurrence of ≥3 grade adverse events (graded with NCI CTCAE v5.0) up to 30 days post last study treatment dose, including abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters., Up to 19 months post-randomization.|Occurrence of adverse events of special interest., Occurrence of adverse events of special interest up to 90 days post last study treatment dose, including abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters., Up to 21 months post-randomization.|Occurrence of adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation or interruption., Occurrence of adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation or interruption., Up to 18 months post-randomization.|Occurrence of serious adverse events after initiation of study treatment until 90 days post last study treatment dose., Occurrence of serious adverse events after initiation of study treatment until 90 days post last study treatment dose., Up to 21 months post-randomization.|Occurrence of adverse events leading to death., Occurrence of adverse events leading to death., Up to 21 months post-randomization.
This study will enroll 176 patients randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio (88 in each arm) to one of the two arms.

* Control arm: SIRT-Y90 + placebos (IV)

The patients will be recruited from up to 13 sites from the Asia-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma (AHCC) Trials Group (subjected to feasibility studies and ethics approval). Proposed sites are in Singapore, China, South Korea, and Taiwan.
