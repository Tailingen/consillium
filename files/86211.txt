Genotype and Phenotype in Early Onset Breast Cancer in Young Women on the Two Shores of the Mediterranean Sea
Breast cancer are common on mediterranean basin. Epidemiological data suggest that breast cancer in young women (\< 40years old) is more aggressive in the Maghreb countries comparatively to western countries. This aggressiveness could be associated with phenotypic and genotypic differences between this two populations.

The object of this study is to compare the genotypic and phenotypic differences between south and north shore of the mediterranean sea.
