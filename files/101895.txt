Treatment Patterns in Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
Non-interventional, retrospective study of advanced SCLC patients in 4 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom \[UK\]) with the aim to produce evidence across different SCLC treatment lines to characterize the clinical and economic burden of the disease in Europe.
