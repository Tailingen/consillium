Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management in Monitoring Adults With Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy
This pilot early phase I trial studies the Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management in monitoring adult patients with lung cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy. The Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management may provide useful information to doctors to help monitor adult patients with lung cancer and diagnose certain conditions earlier than traditional means.
Lung Carcinoma
DEVICE: Monitoring Device
Percentage of hours per day that patients wear the Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management device, The compliance rate along with a one-sided exact 95% confidence interval will be estimated., Up to 4 weeks post-radiation therapy|Percentage of days per study period that patients wear the Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management device, The compliance rate along with a one-sided exact 95% confidence interval will be estimated., Up to 4 weeks post-radiation therapy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine compliance with the Automated Device for Asthma Monitoring and Management (ADAMM) device in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of the ADAMM device, and compliance with electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in this patient population
