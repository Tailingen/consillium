Open Label Phase I Study of P276-00 in Patients With Advanced Refractory Neoplasms
P276-00 is specific Cdk4-D1 and Cdk1-B inhibitor. P276-00 exhibited significant tumour reduction in animal models with less adverse effects.Based on the results from various in-vitro studies, P276-00 could be a potential candidate as a new mechanism based drug for the treatment of cancer.This Phase I study will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose,Dose Limiting Toxicity and efficacy of P 276-00 in patients with advanced Refractory neoplasms.
Neoplasm
DRUG: P276-00
To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of selective Cdk inhibitor P276-00 in patients with advanced refractory neoplasms., DLT to be seen for cycle 1.Adverse events as and when they occur during the trial duration and till their resolution after exit from study
To determine the toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and clinical response of this regimen., Pharmacokinetics on day 1 and 5 of cycle 1, clinical response after every 2 cycles, toxic effects of the drug as and when they occur to be evaluated
