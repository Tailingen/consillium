ImmuNe ParameTERs to Predict Immunotherapy REsponse and Toxicity (INTERPRET)
This is a prospective observational study that will collect blood samples at 1-10 timepoints related to initiation of immunotherapy. The study may collect samples before the start of immunotherapy and/or at clinically significant timepoints during immunotherapy treatment.
Cancer
Quantification of plasma concentrations, Including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and other relevant immunologic molecules from blood samples, through study completion (i.e. up to 12 months)|Profiling of immune cells, Plasma concentrations of immunologic molecules will be assayed using immunoassays or plasma proteomic approaches. Profiling of immune cells will be performed using flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, and other established approaches., through study completion (i.e. up to 12 months)
Assessment of genomic variants, Whole genome sequencing of germline DNA isolated from blood samples., through study completion (i.e. up to 12 months)
The long-term goal of this research is to identify immunologic and other blood-borne markers of immunotherapy efficacy and toxicity. The objective of this proposal is to identify associations between immunologic parameters and other blood-borne markers with treatment response, irAE development, or relevant biomarkers of both outcomes.
