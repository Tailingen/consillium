Invasiveness and Chemoresistance of Cancer Stem Cells in Colon Cancer
The main objective of this study is to identify and characterize subpopulations of cells with invasive capacity in colorectal cancer from primary tumor, blood and metastatic samples.

Secondary objectives include:

* Determine the intrinsic properties essential for the dissemination and chemoresistance of these cells capable of initiating tumors
* Identify a "molecular signature" for potential invasiveness and chemoresistance of cells initiating metastases.
* Describe the evolution of patients during 24 months of follow up and correlations with observed cellular profiles.
* Enrich the tumor bank of the institution.
