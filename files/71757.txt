Carbonic Anhydrase IX Enzyme in Triple Negative Breast Carcinoma
Triple-negative breast carcinoma is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2/neu receptors. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a tumor-associated cell surface glycoprotein that is involved in adaptation to hypoxia-induced acidosis and plays a role in cancer progression. This study aimed to investigate CA IX expression in TNBC and its relationship with treatment effect.

Poor prognostic factors in patients with TNBC, Higher staining CA IX levels (â‰¥ 10%) in TNBC patients' pathological specimens is a poor prognostic factor, 2018-2023|The treatment success with inhibiting the CA IX enzyme levels' effectiveness, Treatment success in TNBC patients by evaluating changes in CA IX staining levels, 2018-2023
Tru-cut biopsy materials, sent to our hospital pathology laboratory between August 2018 and May 2023, will be examined. Invasive carcinoma cases will be evaluated according to estrogen, progesterone, and HER 2 receptor levels. Triple-negative tumor cases were isolated and those cases who underwent breast resection in our hospital after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and then paclitaxel for 4 cycles) were included in the study.
