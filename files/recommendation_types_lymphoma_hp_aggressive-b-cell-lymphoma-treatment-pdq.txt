Late Effects of Treatment of NHL
The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment.[
1
] This summary focuses primarily on aggressive B-cell NHL. For information about B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, see

. 
Like Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. However, NHL is much less predictable than Hodgkin lymphoma and has a far greater tendency to spread to extranodal sites. The prognosis depends on the histological type, disease stage, and treatment.
Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from all types of NHL in the United States in 2025:[
2
]
New cases: 80,350.
Deaths: 19,390.
B-cell lymphomas make up about 85% of NHL cases.[
3
] 
Anatomy
NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues.
Enlarge
The lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.
Prognosis and Survival
NHL can be divided into two prognostic groups: indolent lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas.
Indolent NHL has a relatively good prognosis, with a median survival as long as 20 years, but it is usually not curable in advanced clinical stages.[
4
] 
Aggressive NHL has a worse prognosis in the short term, but a significant number of these patients can be cured with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens. Patients who present with, or convert to, aggressive forms of NHL may have sustained complete remissions with combination chemotherapy regimens or aggressive consolidation with marrow or stem cell support.[
5
,
6
]
In general, with modern treatment of patients with NHL, the 5-year overall survival rate is over 60%. More than 70% of patients with aggressive NHL can be cured. Most relapses occur in the first 2 years after therapy. The risk of late relapse is higher in patients who manifest both indolent and aggressive histologies.[
7
]
Late Effects of Treatment of NHL
Late effects of treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma


(NHL) have been observed. Impaired  fertility may occur after exposure to alkylating agents.[
8
] For as many as three decades after diagnosis, patients are at a significantly elevated risk of developing second primary cancers, especially the following:[
9
-
12
]
Lung cancer.
Brain cancer.
Kidney cancer.
Bladder cancer.
 Melanoma.
Hodgkin lymphoma.
Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Left ventricular dysfunction was a significant late effect in long-term survivors of high-grade NHL who received more than 200 mg/m² of doxorubicin.[
8
,
13
]
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia are late complications of myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support, as well as conventional chemotherapy-containing alkylating agents.[
10
,
14
-
21
] Most of these patients show clonal hematopoiesis even before the transplant, suggesting that the hematologic injury usually occurs during induction or reinduction chemotherapy.[
16
,
22
,
23
] A series of 605 patients who received autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) with cyclophosphamide and total-body radiation therapy (as conditioning) were followed for a median of 10 years. The incidence of a second malignancy was 21%, and 10% of those malignancies were solid tumors.[
24
]
A study of young women who received autologous BMT reported successful pregnancies with children born free of congenital abnormalities.[
25
] Late-occurring venous thromboembolism can occur after allogeneic or autologous BMT.[
26
]
Some patients have osteopenia or osteoporosis at the start of therapy; bone density may worsen after therapy for lymphoma.[
27
]
Long-term impaired immune health was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of 21,690 survivors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from the California Cancer Registry. Elevated incidence rate ratios were found up to 10 years later for pneumonia (10.8-fold), meningitis (5.3-fold), immunoglobulin deficiency (17.6-fold), and autoimmune cytopenias (12-fold).[
28
] Similarly, there are impaired humoral responses to COVID-19 virus vaccination in patients with lymphoma who receive B-cell–directed therapies.[

Cellular Classification of  B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma


In This Section
Historical Classification Systems
Current Classification Systems
Updated REAL/WHO classification
A pathologist should be consulted before  a biopsy because some studies require special preparation of tissue (e.g., frozen tissue). Knowledge of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The clonal excess of light-chain immunoglobulin may differentiate malignant cells from reactive cells. Because the prognosis and the approach to treatment are influenced by histopathology, outside biopsy specimens should be carefully reviewed by a hematopathologist who is experienced in diagnosing lymphomas. Although lymph node biopsies are recommended whenever possible, sometimes immunophenotypic data are sufficient for diagnosis of lymphoma when fine-needle aspiration cytology or core needle biopsy is preferred.[

Historical Classification Systems
Historically, uniform treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been hampered by the lack of a uniform classification system. In 1982, results of a consensus study were published as the Working Formulation.[
3
] The Working Formulation combined results from six major classification systems into one classification. This allowed comparison of studies from different institutions and countries. The Rappaport classification, which also follows, is no longer in common use.
Table 1.  Historical Classification Systems for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
Working Formulation [

] 
Rappaport Classification 
Low grade
 
A. Small lymphocytic, consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia

B. Follicular, predominantly small-cleaved cell
Nodular lymphocytic, poorly differentiated
C. Follicular, mixed small-cleaved, and large cell
Nodular mixed, lymphocytic, and histiocytic
Intermediate grade
 
D. Follicular, predominantly large cell
Nodular histiocytic
E. Diffuse small-cleaved cell
Diffuse lymphocytic, poorly differentiated
F. Diffuse mixed, small and large cell
Diffuse mixed, lymphocytic, and histiocytic
G. Diffuse, large cell, cleaved, or noncleaved cell
Diffuse histiocytic
High grade
 
H. Immunoblastic, large cell
Diffuse histiocytic
I. Lymphoblastic, convoluted, or nonconvoluted cell
Diffuse lymphoblastic
J. Small noncleaved-cell, Burkitt, or non-Burkitt
Diffuse undifferentiated Burkitt or non-Burkitt
Current Classification Systems
As the histopathological diagnosis of NHL has become more sophisticated with the use of immunologic and genetic techniques, a number of new pathological entities have been described.[
4
] In addition, the understanding and treatment of many of the previously described pathological subtypes have changed. As a result, the Working Formulation has become outdated and less useful to clinicians and pathologists. European and American pathologists have proposed a new classification, the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification.[
5
-
8
] Since 1995, members of the European and American Hematopathology societies have been collaborating on a new World Health Organization (WHO) classification, which represents an updated version of the REAL system.[
9
,
10
]
Updated REAL/WHO classification
The World Health Organization (WHO) modification of the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification recognizes three major categories
of lymphoid malignancies based on morphology and cell lineage: B-cell
neoplasms, T-cell/natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). 
Both lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are included in this classification
because both solid and circulating phases are present in many lymphoid
neoplasms and distinction between them is artificial.  For example, B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma are simply
different manifestations of the same neoplasm, as are lymphoblastic lymphomas
and acute lymphocytic leukemias.  Within the B-cell and T-cell categories, two
subdivisions are recognized: precursor neoplasms, which correspond to the
earliest stages of differentiation, and more mature differentiated
neoplasms.[

B-cell neoplasms
Precursor B-cell neoplasm: precursor B-acute lymphoblastic
leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL).

Stage Information for Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma


In This Section
Staging Subclassification System
Lugano classification
Stage is important in selecting a treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are usually part of the staging evaluation for all patients with lymphoma. The staging system for NHL is similar to the staging system used for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
It is common for patients with NHL to have involvement of the following sites:
Noncontiguous lymph nodes.
Waldeyer ring.
Epitrochlear nodes.
Gastrointestinal tract.
Extranodal presentations. (A single extranodal site is occasionally the only site of involvement in patients with diffuse lymphoma.)
Bone marrow.
Liver (especially common in patients with low-grade lymphomas).
Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid may be positive in patients with aggressive NHL. Involvement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes is less common than in HL. Mediastinal adenopathy, however, is a prominent feature of lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, entities primarily found in young adults.
Most patients with NHL present with advanced (stage III or stage IV) disease often identified by CT scans or biopsies of the bone marrow and other accessible sites of involvement. In a retrospective review of over 32,000 cases of lymphoma in France, up to 40% of diagnoses were made by core needle biopsy, and 60% were made by excisional biopsy.[
1
] After expert review, core needle biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 92.3% of cases; excisional biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 98.1% of cases (
P
 < .0001). Laparoscopic biopsy or laparotomy is not required for staging but rarely may be necessary to establish a diagnosis or histological type.[
2
]
Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose can be used for initial staging. It can also be used  for follow-up after therapy as a supplement to CT scanning.[
3
] Multiple studies have demonstrated that interim PET scans after two to four cycles of therapy do not provide reliable prognostic information. A large cooperative group trial (
ECOG-E344
 [NCT00274924])  reported problems with interobserver reproducibility. Two prospective trials  and one meta-analysis showed no differences in outcomes between PET-negative and PET-positive/biopsy-negative patients.[
4
-
7
]
In a retrospective study of 130 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PET scanning identified all clinically important marrow involvement from lymphoma, and bone marrow biopsy did not upstage any patient's lymphoma.[
8
] A retrospective study of 580 patients with follicular lymphoma from seven National Cancer Institute–sponsored trials showed no improvement in assessing response to therapy when bone marrow biopsy was added to radiological imaging.[
9
] The workup of NHL should include bone marrow biopsy when management would change (e.g., determining limited stage vs. advanced stage) or when evaluating cytopenias.
 For patients with follicular lymphoma, a positive PET result after therapy has a worse prognosis; however, it is unclear whether a positive PET result is predictive when further or different therapy is implemented.[
10
]
Staging Subclassification System
Lugano classification
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has adopted the Lugano classification to evaluate and stage lymphoma.[
11
] The Lugano classification system replaces the Ann Arbor classification system, which was adopted in 1971 at the Ann Arbor Conference,[
12
] with some modifications 18 years later from the Cotswolds meeting.[

Stage II bulky may be considered either early or advanced stage based on lymphoma histology and prognostic factors.
c
The definition of disease bulk varies according to lymphoma histology. In the Lugano classification, bulk ln Hodgkin lymphoma is defined as a mass greater than one-third of the thoracic diameter on CT of the chest or a mass >10 cm. For NHL, the recommended definitions of bulk vary by lymphoma histology. In follicular lymphoma, 6 cm has been suggested based on the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 and its validation. In DLBCL, cutoffs ranging from 5 cm to 10 cm have been used, although 10 cm is recommended.
Limited stage
I
Involvement of a single lymphatic site (i.e., nodal region, Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen).
Enlarge
IE
Single extralymphatic site in the absence of nodal involvement (rare in Hodgkin lymphoma).
 
II
Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.

IIE
Contiguous extralymphatic extension from a nodal site with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.

Stage II with disease bulk.
c
 
Advanced stage
III
Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement.
Enlarge
IV
Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement; or noncontiguous extralymphatic organ involvement in conjunction with nodal stage II disease; or any extralymphatic organ involvement in nodal stage III disease. Stage IV includes any involvement of the CSF, bone marrow, liver, or multiple lung lesions (other than by direct extension in stage IIE disease).
Enlarge
Note: Hodgkin lymphoma uses A or B designation with stage group. A/B is no longer used in NHL.
Occasionally, specialized staging systems are used. The physician should be aware of the system used in a specific report.
The E designation is used when extranodal lymphoid malignancies arise in tissues separate from, but near, the major lymphatic aggregates. Stage IV refers to disease that is diffusely spread throughout an extranodal site, such as the liver. If pathological proof of involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites has been documented, the symbol for the site of involvement, followed by a plus sign (+), is listed.
Table 3.  Notation to Identify Specific Sites
N = nodes
H = liver
L = lung
M = bone marrow
S = spleen
P = pleura
O = bone
D = skin
Current practice assigns a clinical stage  based on the findings of the clinical evaluation and a pathological stage based on the findings from invasive procedures beyond the initial biopsy.
For example, on percutaneous biopsy, a patient with inguinal adenopathy and a positive lymphangiogram without systemic symptoms might have involvement of the liver and bone marrow. The precise stage of such a patient would be clinical stage IIA, pathological stage IVA(H+)(M+).
Several other factors that are not included in the above staging system are important for the staging and prognosis of patients with NHL. These factors include the following:
Age.
Performance status (PS).
Tumor size.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values.
The number of extranodal sites.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of overall survival (OS) and their associated risk scores:[
15
]
Age.
<40 years: 0.
41–60 years: 1.
61–75 years: 2.
>75 years: 3.
Stage III/IV: 1.
Performance status (PS) 2/3/4: 1.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Normalized: 0.
>1x–3x: 1.
>3x: 2.
Number of extranodal sites ≥2: 1.
Risk scores:
Low (0 or 1): 5-year OS rate, 96%; progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 91%.
Low intermediate (2 or 3): 5-year OS rate, 82%; PFS rate, 74%.
High intermediate (4 or 5): 5-year OS rate, 64%; PFS rate, 51%.
High (>6): 5-year OS rate, 33%; PFS rate, 30%.
Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[
16
] Shorter intervals of time between diagnosis and treatment appear to be a surrogate for poor prognostic biological factors.[

Aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) includes the following subtypes:
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.
Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis).
Follicular lymphoma (grade 3b).
Mantle cell lymphoma. (For more information, see

Burkitt lymphoma/diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma.
B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.
Primary effusion lymphoma.
Plasmablastic lymphoma.
Polymorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL and makes up 30% of newly diagnosed cases.[
1
] Most patients present with rapidly enlarging masses, often with both local and systemic symptoms (designated B symptoms with fever, recurrent night sweats, or weight loss). For more information about weight loss, see 
Nutrition in Cancer Care
.
Some cases of large B-cell lymphoma have a prominent background of reactive T cells and histiocytes, and is so-called T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma. This subtype of large cell lymphoma has frequent liver, spleen, and bone marrow involvement; however, the outcome is equivalent to that of similarly staged patients with DLBCL.[
2
-
4
] At diagnosis, some patients with DLBCL have a concomitant indolent small B-cell component. While overall survival (OS) appears similar to de novo DLBCL after multidrug chemotherapy, there is a higher risk of indolent relapse.[
5
]
Prognosis
For most patients, localized disease can be cured with combined-modality therapy or combination chemotherapy alone, typically R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone).[
6
] Among patients with advanced-stage disease, 50% are cured with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy and rituximab, typically Pola-R-CHP (polatuzumab, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) or R-CHOP.[

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has identified 
risk factors and associated risk scores
.
The 
BCL2
 gene and rearrangement of the 
MYC
 gene or dual overexpression of the 
MYC
 gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[
11
-
13
] Dose-intensive therapies, infusional therapies, and stem cell transplant (SCT) consolidation are being explored in this high-risk group.[
14
-
17
] 
In a retrospective review of 117 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who underwent autologous SCT, the 4-year OS rate was 25% for patients with double-hit lymphomas (rearrangement of 
BCL2
 and 
MYC
), 61% for patients with double-expressor lymphomas (no rearrangement, but increased expression of 
BCL2
 and 
MYC
), and 70% for patients without these features.[
18
] 
 Molecular profiles of gene expression using DNA microarrays may help to stratify patients in the future for therapies directed at specific targets and to better predict survival after standard chemotherapy.[
19
] For example, true ALK-positive large B-cell lymphomas are extremely rare, and they do not respond well to conventional R-CHOP therapy. Anecdotal responses to ALK inhibitors like lorlatinib or alectinib have been reported.[
20
][
Level of evidence C3
] Coexpression of CD20 and CD30 may define a subgroup of patients with DLBCL with a unique molecular signature and a more favorable prognosis. Patients in this subgroup may be treated with an anti-CD30–specific therapy, such as brentuximab vedotin.[
21
] Patients with DLBCL who are event-free after 2 years have a subsequent OS equivalent to that of the age- and sex-matched general population.[
22
]
Patients at high risk for central nervous system (CNS) relapse may be candidates for prophylaxis. For more information, see the 
CNS Prophylaxis
 section in the Treatment of Aggressive, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma section.
Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a subset of DLBCL with molecular characteristics that are most similar to nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).[
23
] Mediastinal lymphomas with features intermediate between primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and nodular-sclerosing HL are called mediastinal gray-zone lymphomas.[
24
,
25
] Patients are usually female and young (median age, 30–40 years). Patients present with a locally invasive anterior mediastinal mass that may cause respiratory symptoms or superior vena cava syndrome. 
Prognosis and therapy are the same as for other comparably staged patients with DLBCL.  Uncontrolled phase II studies using dose-adjusted R-EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin plus rituximab) or R-CHOP showed high cure rates while avoiding any mediastinal radiation.[
25
-
31
][
Level of evidence C1
] These results suggest that patients who receive R-CHOP–based regimens may avoid the serious long-term complications of radiation therapy when given  with  chemotherapy.  Posttreatment fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scans are controversial. It remains unclear if PET scans can reliably identify patients who can undergo or omit radiation therapy consolidation.[
26
,
32
-
34
]
A retrospective review of 109 patients with PMBCL showed that 63% had a negative end-of-treatment PET-CT (EOT-PET-CT) (Deauville score 1–3).[
35
] No radiation therapy was offered and the 5-year time-to-progression rate (similar to disease-free survival, but restricted to lymphoma relapse) was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%–95%), and the 5-year OS rate was 97% (95% CI, 88%–99%).[
35
][
Level of evidence C3
] Patients with a positive EOT-PET-CT received radiation therapy consolidation. It is unclear from this study whether those patients might have done just as well without radiation therapy. Clinicians may monitor patients with Deauville 4 scores on EOT-PET-CT scans for improvement over time, as an alternative to giving radiation therapy. However, this approach has not been studied in a clinical trial.
Because PMBCL is characterized by high expression of programmed death-ligand 1 and variable expression of CD30, a phase II study evaluated nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin in 30 patients with relapsed disease. With a median follow-up of 11.1 months, the objective response rate was 73% (95% CI, 54%−88%).[
36
][
Level of evidence C3
] Similarly, a phase II trial of pembrolizumab in 53 patients with relapsed or refractory disease showed an objective response rate of 41.5%. With a median follow-up of 48.7 months, the 4-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 33.0% and the 4-year OS rate was 45.3%.[
37
][
Level of evidence C3
] Among the 11 patients who achieved a complete response, all remained in complete response at the time of the final analysis.
Among those who had received two prior lines of therapy, more than one-half of patients who received chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy with lisocabtagene maraleucel had a disease response.[
38
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma (Intravascular Lymphomatosis)
Intravascular lymphomatosis is characterized by large cell lymphoma confined to the intravascular lumen. The brain, kidneys, lungs, and skin are the organs most likely to be affected by intravascular lymphomatosis.
 With the use of aggressive R-CHOP–based combination chemotherapy, as is used in DLBCL, the prognosis is similar to that of conventional stage IV DLBCL.[
39
-
41
]
Follicular Lymphoma (Grade 3b)
Prognosis
The natural history of follicular large cell lymphoma remains controversial.[
42
] While there is agreement about the significant number of long-term disease-free survivors with early-stage disease, the potential for cure in patients with advanced disease (stage III or stage IV) remains uncertain. Some groups report a continuous relapse rate similar to the other follicular lymphomas (a pattern of indolent lymphoma).[
43
] Other investigators report a plateau in freedom from progression at levels expected for an aggressive lymphoma (40% at 10 years).[
44
,
45
] This discrepancy may be caused by variations in histological classification between institutions and the rarity of patients with follicular large cell lymphoma. A retrospective review of 252 patients, all treated with anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy, showed that patients with more than 50% diffuse components on biopsy had a worse OS than other patients with follicular large cell lymphoma.[
46
]
Therapeutic approaches
Treatment of follicular large cell lymphoma is more similar to the treatment of aggressive NHL than it is to the treatment of indolent NHL. In support of this approach, treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic peripheral SCT shows the same curative potential in patients with follicular large cell lymphoma who relapse as it does in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma who relapse.[
47
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Among patients who had received two prior lines of therapy, more than one-half who received CAR T-cell therapy with lisocabtagene maraleucel had a disease response.[
38
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Burkitt Lymphoma/Diffuse Small Noncleaved-Cell Lymphoma
Burkitt lymphoma/diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma typically involves younger patients and represents the most common type of pediatric NHL.[
48
] These types of aggressive extranodal B-cell lymphomas are characterized by translocation and deregulation of the 
MYC
 gene on chromosome 8.[
49
] A subgroup of patients with dual translocation of 
MYC
 and 
BCL2
 appear to have an extremely poor outcome despite aggressive therapy (median OS, 5 months).[
50
][
Level of evidence C1
]
In some patients with larger B cells, there is morphological overlap with DLBCL. These Burkitt-like large cell lymphomas show 
MYC
 deregulation, extremely high proliferation rates, and a gene-expression profile as expected for classic Burkitt lymphoma.[
51
-
53
] Endemic cases, usually from Africa, involve the facial bones or jaws of children, mostly containing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes. Sporadic cases usually involve the gastrointestinal system, ovaries, or kidneys. Patients present with rapidly growing masses and a very high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level but are potentially curable with intensive doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.
Therapeutic approaches
Treatment of Burkitt lymphoma/diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma involves aggressive multidrug regimens in combination with rituximab, similar to those used for the advanced-stage aggressive lymphomas (DLBCL).[
54
-
57
] Aggressive combination chemotherapy, which is modeled after that used in childhood Burkitt lymphoma, has been successful for adult patients with more than 60% of advanced-stage patients free of disease at 5 years.[
58
-
61
] Adverse prognostic factors include bulky abdominal disease and a high serum LDH level.  Patients with Burkitt lymphoma have a 20% to 30% lifetime risk of CNS involvement. Prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy is required as part of induction therapy.[
62
] Patients with HIV-associated Burkitt lymphoma also benefit from less-toxic modification of the aggressive multidrug regimens in combination with rituximab.[

] For more information, see 
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Treatment
 and 
AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment
.
B-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (precursor T-cell) is a very aggressive form of NHL. Treatment is usually modeled after that for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Intensive combination chemotherapy with or without bone marrow transplant is the standard treatment for  this aggressive histological type of NHL.[
64
-
66
] Radiation therapy is sometimes given to areas of bulky tumor masses. Because these forms of NHL tend to progress quickly, combination chemotherapy is instituted rapidly once the diagnosis is confirmed. Careful review of the pathological specimens, bone marrow aspirate, biopsy specimen, cerebrospinal fluid cytology, and lymphocyte marker constitute the most important aspects of the pretreatment staging workup. For more information, see 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment
.
Primary Effusion Lymphoma
Primary effusion lymphoma presents exclusively or mainly in the pleural, pericardial, or abdominal cavities in the absence of an identifiable tumor mass.[
67
] Patients are usually HIV seropositive, and the tumor usually contains Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpes virus/human herpes virus 8.[
68
]
Prognosis
The prognosis of primary effusion lymphoma is extremely poor.
Therapeutic approaches
Therapy is usually modeled after the treatment of comparably staged diffuse large cell lymphomas.
Plasmablastic Lymphoma
Plasmablastic lymphoma is most often seen in patients with HIV infection and is characterized by CD20-negative large B cells with plasmacytic features. This type of lymphoma has a very aggressive clinical course, including poor responses and short remissions with standard chemotherapy.[
69
] Anecdotal reports suggest using aggressive chemotherapy for Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma, followed by SCT  consolidation in responding patients, when feasible.[
69
-
71
]
Polymorphic Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder
Patients who undergo a transplant of the heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas usually require lifelong immunosuppression. This may result in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in 1% to 3% of recipients, which appears as an aggressive lymphoma.[
72
] Pathologists can distinguish a polyclonal B-cell hyperplasia from a monoclonal B-cell lymphoma; both are almost always associated with EBV.[
73
]
Prognosis
Poor performance status, grafted organ involvement, high International Prognostic Index, elevated LDH, and multiple sites of disease are poor prognostic factors for PTLD.[
74
,
75
]
Therapeutic options
In some cases, withdrawal of immunosuppression results in eradication of the lymphoma.[
76
,
77
] When this is unsuccessful or not feasible, a course of rituximab may be considered because it has shown durable remissions in approximately 60% of patients and a favorable toxicity profile.[
76
,
78
,
79
] If these measures fail, doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy (R-CHOP) is recommended, although some patients can avoid cytotoxic therapy.[
79
,
80
] Localized presentations can be controlled with surgery or radiation therapy alone. These localized mass lesions, which may grow over a period of months, are often phenotypically polyclonal and tend to occur within weeks or a few months after transplant.[
73
] Multifocal, rapidly progressive disease occurs late after transplant (>1 year) and is usually phenotypically monoclonal and associated with EBV.[
81
] These patients may have durable remissions using standard chemotherapy regimens for aggressive lymphoma.[
81
-
83
] Instances of EBV-negative PTLD occur even later (median, 5 years posttransplant) and have a worse prognosis; R-CHOP can be given directly in this circumstance.[
84
] A sustained clinical response  in patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease was attained using an immunotoxin (anti-CD22 B-cell surface antigen antibody linked with ricin, a plant toxin).[
85
] An anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody is also under clinical evaluation.[
86
]
Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is an EBV-positive large B-cell lymphoma with a predominant T-cell background.[
87
,
88
] The histology shows association with angioinvasion and vasculitis, usually manifesting as pulmonary lesions or paranasal sinus involvement.
Patients are managed like others with diffuse large cell lymphoma and require doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.

Castleman Disease
True Histiocytic Lymphoma
Therapeutic options
Castleman Disease
A biopsy of localized or multifocal collections of lymph nodes may lead to a diagnosis of Castleman disease (CD). Strictly speaking, this uncommon diagnosis is not a lymphoma or even a malignancy. Yet, many patients with CD may be seen and treated by hematologists or oncologists.
Localized or unicentric CD is usually asymptomatic and occurs in the mediastinum, which is the most common presentation for CD.[
1
] Watchful waiting, surgery, or radiation therapy can be used to treat this indolent form. Multicentric CD (30% of CD patients) presents with lymphadenopathy in multiple sites; symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue; and laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, low albumin level, elevated C-reactive protein level, and high fibrinogen level.[
1
] Multicentric CD (MCD) is subdivided into human herpes virus-8–associated MCD (usually with HIV or severe immunocompromise) or idiopathic MCD. Cytopenias and cytokine storm are attributed to interleukin-6 (IL-6) overproduction. MCD is a feature seen in POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin abnormalities) syndrome [
2
] and TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly) syndrome.[
3
,
4
] Therapy with siltuximab (an anti–IL-6 monoclonal antibody), rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), or chemotherapeutic agents has been presented in anecdotal nonrandomized series.[
5
-
8
]
True Histiocytic Lymphoma
True histiocytic lymphomas are very rare tumors that show histiocytic differentiation and express histiocytic markers in the absence of B-cell or T-cell lineage-specific immunologic markers.[
9
,
10
] Care must be taken with immunophenotypic tests to exclude anaplastic large cell lymphoma or hemophagocytic syndromes caused by viral infections, especially Epstein-Barr virus.
Therapeutic options
 Therapy is modeled after the treatment of comparably staged diffuse large cell lymphomas, but the optimal approach remains to be defined.

Treatment Option Overview for Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma


Treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) depends on the histological type and stage. Many of the improvements in survival have been made because of clinical trials that have attempted to improve conventional or standard therapy.
In asymptomatic patients with indolent forms of advanced NHL, treatment may be
deferred until the patient becomes symptomatic as the disease progresses.  When
treatment is deferred, the clinical course of patients with indolent NHL
varies; frequent and careful observation is required so that effective
treatment can be initiated when the clinical course of the disease accelerates. 
Some patients have a prolonged indolent course, but others have disease that
rapidly evolves into more aggressive types of NHL that require immediate
treatment.
Radiation techniques differ somewhat from those used in the treatment of
Hodgkin lymphoma.  The dose of radiation therapy usually varies from 25 Gy to
50 Gy and is dependent on factors that include the histological type of
lymphoma, the patient’s stage and overall condition, the goal of treatment
(curative or palliative), the proximity of sensitive surrounding organs, and
whether the patient is being treated with radiation therapy alone or in
combination with chemotherapy.  Given the patterns of
disease presentations and relapse, treatment may need to include unusual sites
such as Waldeyer ring, epitrochlear nodes, or mesenteric nodes.   The
associated morbidity of the treatment  must be considered carefully.  Most patients who receive radiation are treated on only one side
of the diaphragm.  Localized presentations of extranodal NHL may be treated
with involved-field techniques with significant (>50%) success.
In situations where mediastinal radiation therapy would encompass the left side of the heart or would increase breast cancer risk in young female patients, proton therapy may be considered to reduce radiation dose to organs at risk.[

Aggressive multidrug regimens
CNS prophylaxis
Even though existing treatments cure a significant fraction of patients with lymphoma, numerous clinical trials that explore treatment improvements are in progress. If possible, patients can participate in these studies. Standardized guidelines for response assessment have been suggested for use in clinical trials.[
2
]
Several retrospective reviews suggest that routine surveillance scans offer little to no value in patients with diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have attained a clinical complete remission after induction therapy. Prognostic value is also difficult to identify for an interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan during induction therapy for DLBCL.[

Aggressive lymphomas are increasingly seen in patients with HIV. Treatment
of these patients requires special consideration.  For more information, see 

AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment
In addition to screening for HIV among patients with aggressive lymphomas, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C can be assessed before treatment with rituximab and/or chemotherapy.[
7
,
8
] Patients with detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) benefit from prophylaxis with entecavir in the context of rituximab therapy.[
9
,
10
] Patients with a resolved HBV infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. In a retrospective study of 326 patients, prophylactic nucleoside analogue therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% to 2.1%.[
11
] Similarly, prophylaxis for herpes zoster with acyclovir or valacyclovir and prophylaxis for 
Pneumocystis
 with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone are usually given to patients receiving rituximab with or without combination chemotherapy. Long-term impaired immune health was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of 21,690 survivors of DLBCL from the California Cancer Registry. Elevated incidence rate ratios were found up to 10 years later for pneumonia (10.8-fold), meningitis (5.3-fold), immunoglobulin deficiency (17.6-fold), and autoimmune cytopenias (12-fold).[
12
]
Among 2,508 patients in a Danish registry, the incidence of doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure increased for 115 NHL survivors with a history of cardiac disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15−6.36) and/or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.56−5.23).[

Current Clinical Trials
Patients with aggressive stage I or aggressive, contiguous stage II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are candidates for combination chemotherapy with or without involved-field radiation therapy (IF-XRT).
Patients with a resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. In a retrospective study of 326 patients, prophylactic nucleoside analogue therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% to 2.1%.[

Stage IE or IIE Gastric DLBCL
Four case series involving more than 100 patients with stage IE or IIE disease (with or without mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue) and with positive 
Helicobacter pylori
 infection. The series reported that more than 50% of patients attained a durable complete remission after appropriate antibiotic therapy to eradicate 
H. pylori

Treatment Options for Aggressive Stage I and Aggressive, Contiguous Stage II B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Treatment options for aggressive stage I and aggressive, contiguous stage II B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma include:
R-CHOP    (rituximab,  cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with or without IF-XRT
.
R-ACVBP (rituximab, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, prednisone).[

R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT
Rituximab has efficacy in advanced-stage disease. However, its use is only supported by retrospective comparisons in studies of R-CHOP with or without radiation therapy.[

R-CHOP (four to six cycles).
R-CHOP (three to six cycles) + IF-XRT.
Evidence (R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT):
In a randomized prospective trial of 334 patients with nonbulky (≤7 cm) stage I or stage II DLBCL, after receiving four  to six cycles of R-CHOP-14 (R-CHOP delivered every 2 weeks), patients were randomly assigned to undergo 40 Gy of radiation therapy or no radiation therapy.[
9
]
After a median follow-up of 64 months, the 5-year event-free survival rate (89%–92%; 
P
 = .18) and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate (92%–96%; 
P
 = .32) were the same.[
9
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Similar to the results of randomized studies of radiation therapy in the era before rituximab, radiation therapy can be deferred in patients with nonbulky early-stage disease. For patients unable to tolerate prolonged-course chemotherapy, three cycles of R-CHOP plus radiation therapy has produced equivalent results based on single-arm retrospective trials.[
8
]
In a randomized prospective trial (
NCT00278421
) of 592 patients younger than 60 years with nonbulky (<7.5 cm) stage I or stage II DLBCL, patients were randomly assigned to receive either four or six cycles of R-CHOP (with an extra two cycles of rituximab after four cycles).[
10
]
With a median follow-up of 66 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%−99%) for patients who received four cycles of R-CHOP, which was 3% better (lower limit of one-sided 95% CI was zero) than the PFS rate for patients who received six cycles, establishing noninferiority for the four-cycle regimen.[
10
][
Level of evidence B1
]
A retrospective analysis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2001 and 2015 included  341 patients with stage I disease. The analysis found that 66% of patients had an extranodal presentation. After R-CHOP (or a similar regimen), with or without radiation therapy, the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 77%, and the 5-year OS rate was 94%.[
11
][
Level of evidence C3
] A multivariate analysis suggested that radiation therapy may improve outcomes for patients with extranodal disease that is positron emission tomography (PET)–positive at the end of therapy. This hypothesis needs confirmation in a prospective randomized trial.[
11
]
In summary,
 for patients with favorable prognosis, nonbulky (<7 cm), stage I or stage II DLBCL, four cycles of R-CHOP are sufficient. For patients with an unfavorable prognosis, six cycles of R-CHOP or three cycles of R-CHOP and 40 Gy of radiation therapy can be used. Early-stage patients with bulky disease (>7.5 cm) have not been studied in randomized trials; combined-modality therapy with R-CHOP for four to six cycles plus radiation therapy is usually chosen. Although a retrospective study suggested that patients with stage I extranodal disease and a positive PET scan at the end of therapy may benefit from radiation therapy, this hypothesis must be confirmed in a prospective randomized trial.

The treatment of choice for patients with advanced stages of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is combination chemotherapy, either alone or supplemented by local-field radiation therapy.[

The following drug combinations are referred to in this section:
Pola-R-CHP: polatuzumab vedotin + rituximab +  cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + prednisone.
R-CHOP: rituximab + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + vincristine + prednisone.

R-ACVBP: rituximab, an anti–CD20 monoclonal antibody + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide + vindesine + bleomycin + prednisone.
Treatment Options for Aggressive, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV B-Cell NHL
Treatment options for aggressive, noncontiguous stage II/III/IV B-cell NHL include:
Pola-R-CHP
 (for National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index [IPI] score of 2 to 5).
R-CHOP
.
Radiation therapy consolidation to sites of bulky disease
 (under clinical evaluation). 
Pola-R-CHP
R-CHOP has been compared with Pola-R-CHP. Polatuzumab is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-CD79B monoclonal antibody attached to vedotin (monomethyl auristatin E), a microtubule inhibitor.
Evidence (Pola-R-CHP):
A prospective, randomized study (
POLARIX
 [NCT03274492]) of 879 patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and an IPI score of 2 or higher compared R-CHOP with Pola-R-CHP.[
2
] Polatuzumab vedotin was substituted for vincristine to mitigate neurological toxicity.
At a median follow-up of 28.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was significantly higher in the Pola-R-CHP group than in the R-CHOP group: 76.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.7%–80.0%) versus 70.2% (95% CI, 65.8%–74.6%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.95; 
P
 = .02).[
2
][
Level of evidence B1
]
The  2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 88.7% (95% CI, 85.7%–91.6%) for patients who received Pola-R-CHP and 88.6% (95% CI, 85.6%–91.6%) for patients who received R-CHOP (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.65–1.37; 
P
 = .75).
A similar 7.7% improvement in 2-year PFS for Pola-R-CHP versus R-CHOP has been seen in an Asian subpopulation analysis from this  trial.[
3
][
Level of evidence C2
]
The follow-up interval was too short to establish whether the 6% improvement in the PFS rate will plateau or improve after 2 years, and there is no evidence of OS advantage. Nonetheless, updated outcomes with a median follow-up over 3 years showed continued improvement of PFS, prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve Pola-R-CHP. Pola-R-CHP is the first regimen in over 20 years to be approved by the FDA as a therapy for patients with noncontiguous stage II, stage III, and stage IV disease. The new regimen is more than twice the cost of R-CHOP using acquisition prices in 2022, and polatuzumab may not be available worldwide.
The Pola-R-CHP regimen demonstrated substantial efficacy for patients with DLBCL non–germinal center B-cell (GCB)-origin tumors, predominantly those with the ABC (activated B-cell) subtype.[
4
] In the POLARIX trial, the HR
PFS
 for Pola-R-CHP versus R-CHOP in patients with ABC-subtype tumors was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.13–0.85), and the HR
OS
 for those patients was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.06–1.26). In contrast, no such benefit was observed for patients with GCB-subtype tumors in this trial. For Pola-R-CHP, the HR
PFS
 was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.75–1.84), and the HR
OS
 was 1.64 (95% CI, 0.87–3.07). This differential efficacy in favor of the non-GCB or ABC subtype was seen in five prospective phase I and II trials of the Pola-R-CHP regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory disease, with a combined analysis of data showing a level of significance 
P
 < .001.[
4
] Combining the data for a randomized phase II trial studying Pola-R-CHP in patients with relapsed or refractory disease with data from the POLARIX trial in patients with previously untreated disease, the HR
disease relapse/progression/death
 was 0.25 for patients with ABC-subtype tumors and 0.98 for patients with GCB-subtype tumors (
P
 < .001).[
4
] The only exception to this observation is the clear benefit of Pola-R-CHP in GCB patients with double-hit variants (
MYC
 gene and 
BCL2
 gene). Given the increased rates of febrile neutropenia in patients who receive Pola-R-CHP and the significant financial toxicity, it is reasonable to consider R-CHOP as a standard regimen for patients with GCB-subtype DLBCL without a double-hit variant. However, assessing the GCB subtype using commercially available immunophenotyping is less accurate than using the molecular genetic signatures used in the POLARIX study. Some patients may miss the PFS benefit of polatuzumab. Some clinicians err on the side of using Pola-R-CHP for GCB subtype when patients have other high-risk features (e.g., CD5 positivity or involvement in two or more extranodal sites).
R-CHOP
The following studies established R-CHOP as a standard regimen for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and noncontiguous stage II, stage III, and stage IV disease for over 20 years.[
5
] Dose intensification of R-CHOP by a 14-day versus a 21-day cycle did not result in improved outcomes.[
6
] R-CHOP is the preferred regimen when polatuzumab is not available or affordable, or when contraindicated due to adverse side effects. 
Evidence (R-CHOP):
R-CHOP showed improved event-free survival (EFS) and OS compared with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) alone in 399 patients older than 60 years with advanced-stage DLBCL (EFS rate, 57% vs. 38%; 
P
 = .002, and OS rate, 70% vs. 57%; 
P
 = .007 at 2 years).[
7
][
Level of evidence A1
] At a median follow-up of 10 years, the OS rate of patients who received R-CHOP was 44% compared with 28% for patients who received CHOP (
P
 < .0001).[
8
] 
Similarly, for 326 evaluable patients younger than 61 years, R-CHOP showed improved EFS and OS compared with CHOP alone (EFS rate, 79% vs. 59%, 
P
 = .001, and OS rate, 93% vs. 84%, 
P
 = .001 at 3 years).[
9
][
Level of evidence A1
] 
A randomized study (
DSHNHL-1999-1A
 [NCT00052936]) of 1,222 patients older than 60 years compared R-CHOP given every 2 weeks for six or eight cycles with CHOP given every 2 weeks for six or eight cycles.[
10
] With a median follow-up of 72 months, the EFS favored R-CHOP given every 2 weeks for six or eight cycles (6-year EFS rate, 74% vs. 56%;  
P
 < .0001). The OS favored R-CHOP for only six cycles because of increased toxicity in the eight-cycle arm (6-year OS rate, 90% vs. 80%; 
P
 = .0004).[

A trial 
(NCT00140595)
 of 380 patients younger than  60 years with DLBCL and an age-adjusted IPI score of 1 randomly assigned patients to receive ACVBP and R-ACVBP plus consolidation with methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and cytarabine versus CHOP and rituximab.[
11
]  With a median follow-up of 44 months, 3-year OS rates favored R-ACVBP (92% vs. 84%; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28–0.81, 
P
 = .007).[
11
][
Level of evidence A1
] The significantly worse toxicities with R-ACVBP, the narrow target population (<60 years with either elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] or stage III-stage IV disease, but not both), and the lack of a confirmatory trial may inhibit adoption of R-ACVBP as a new standard of care.[
12
]
There is no validated trial for interim positron emission tomography–based treatment intensification.[
13
] R-CHOP has curative potential, even in patients older than 80 years who are frail and require reduced dosage of R-CHOP components. In a retrospective review of 239 patients, the 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 48% (95% CI, 41%−55%).[
14
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Less than 10% of patients with DLBCL present with a concurrent indolent lymphoma at diagnosis, and these are predominantly of GCB phenotype. A retrospective review of 1,324 patients showed similar EFS (HR, 1.19) and OS (HR, 1.09).[
15
][
Level of evidence C3
] For 847 patients who were  treated with R-CHOP and free of disease 24 months after therapy, the rate of indolent lymphoma relapse by 5 years was higher with a concurrent diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (7.4% vs. 2.1%, 
P
 < .01) and with a GCB phenotype (3.9% vs. 0.0% at 5 years, 
P
 = .02).[
16
]
Modifications  to R-CHOP to achieve improved efficacy continue to be explored in clinical trials. 
Radiation therapy consolidation to sites of bulky disease
After R-CHOP induction chemotherapy (or similar regimens), the addition of involved-field radiation therapy to sites of initial bulky disease (≥5–10 cm) or to extralymphatic sites remains controversial.[
17
-
19
] Increased risks, such as long-term toxicities (e.g., second malignancies), must be considered.
Bone marrow transplant  (BMT) or stem cell transplant (SCT)
Several randomized prospective trials evaluated the role of autologous BMT or SCT consolidation versus chemotherapy alone in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma in first remission.[
20
-
27
]; [
28
-
30
][
Level of evidence A1
] Although some of these trials demonstrated significant increases in EFS (by 10% to 20%) among patients who received high-dose therapy, significant differences in OS could not be demonstrated prospectively in any of the series.
Retrospective analyses of high-intermediate (two risk factors) or high-risk (more than three risk factors) patients as defined by IPI suggest improved survival with BMT in two of the trials.[
21
,
27
] These studies do not establish that high-dose consolidation is of value to patients with aggressive lymphoma who are truly at high risk of relapse, and they also demonstrate that EFS may be a poor surrogate for OS for these patients.[
31
]
Prognostic factors
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of overall survival (OS) and their associated risk scores:[
32
]
Age.
<40 years: 0.
41–60 years: 1.
61–75 years: 2.
>75 years: 3.
Stage III/IV: 1.
Performance status (PS) 2/3/4: 1.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Normalized: 0.
>1x–3x: 1.
>3x: 2.
Number of extranodal sites ≥2: 1.
Risk scores:
Low (0 or 1): 5-year OS rate, 96%; progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 91%.
Low intermediate (2 or 3): 5-year OS rate, 82%; PFS rate, 74%.
High intermediate (4 or 5): 5-year OS rate, 64%; PFS rate, 51%.
High (>6): 5-year OS rate, 33%; PFS rate, 30%.
Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[
33
] Shorter intervals of time between diagnosis and treatment appear to be a surrogate for poor prognostic biological factors.[
34
]
The 
BCL2
 gene and rearrangement of the 
MYC
 gene or dual overexpression of the 
MYC
 gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[
35
-
38
] Patients at high risk of relapse may be considered for clinical trials.[
39
] Molecular profiles of gene expression using DNA microarrays may help to stratify patients in the future for therapies directed at specific targets and to better predict survival after standard chemotherapy.[
40
]
Treatment of Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Patients with bulky and extensive lymphadenopathy and elevations of serum uric acid and LDH are at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome, resulting in metabolic derangements such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and subsequent acute renal failure.[
41
] Treatment options include alkaline hydration,  allopurinol, and rasburicase (a recombinant urate oxidase).[
42
]
Central Nervous System (CNS) Prophylaxis
The CNS-IPI tool predicts which patients have a CNS relapse risk exceeding 10%.[
43
,
44
] It was developed by the German Lymphoma Study Group and validated by the British Columbia Cancer Agency database. The presence of four to six of the CNS-IPI risk factors (age >60 years, performance status ≥2, elevated LDH, stage III or IV disease, >1 extranodal site, or involvement of the kidneys or adrenal glands) was used to define a high-risk group for CNS recurrence (a 12% risk of CNS involvement by 2 years).[
44
]
CNS prophylaxis (usually with four to six doses of intrathecal methotrexate) is often recommended for patients with testicular involvement.[
45
-
47
][
Level of evidence C3
] A retrospective analysis of the German RICOVER studies compared intrathecal methotrexate with no prophylaxis in patients with DLBCL. This study was completed during the R-CHOP treatment era. With the possible exception of patients with testicular involvement, the analysis showed that intrathecal methotrexate did not reduce the risk of CNS disease.[
48
][
Level of evidence C3
]  
Some clinicians use high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate (usually four doses) as an alternative to intrathecal therapy because drug delivery is improved and patient morbidity is decreased.[
43
,
49
] Five retrospective studies and one network meta-analysis evaluating high-dose methotrexate alone in patients with high-risk DLBCL also showed no improvement in CNS relapse rate.[
50
-
55
][
Level of evidence C3
] Patients deemed at high risk for CNS relapse (e.g., patients with testicular, renal, or adrenal disease and three or more extranodal sites) may receive intrathecal methotrexate or high-dose IV methotrexate, but the lack of confirmatory randomized studies calls this standard into question and shows an urgent need for better therapeutics verified in clinical trials.[
43
,
43
] While there is insufficient evidence to support a significant benefit for CNS prophylaxis in most high-risk patients, the perceived risk of not treating for CNS relapse has often outweighed the lack of evidence for its efficacy.[
43
] Although patients with testicular involvement or kidney/adrenal involvement are considered an exception, there is only anecdotal  benefit from intrathecal or high-dose IV methotrexate in reducing CNS recurrence.[

In retrospective analyses, the addition of rituximab to CHOP-based regimens has significantly reduced the risk of CNS relapse.[

Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Aggressive, Recurrent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
In a retrospective review of multiple international trials, 636 patients were identified as having refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which was defined as progression or stable disease during or just at completion of full-course chemotherapy or relapse within 1 year after autologous stem cell transplant (SCT).[
1
] With subsequent therapy, the objective response rate was 26%, complete response rate was 7%, median overall survival (OS) was 6.3 months, and only 20% of patients were alive at 2 years. Even with reinduction chemotherapy with planned autologous SCT, outcomes remain poor.[
2
]
Treatment options for aggressive, recurrent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma include the following:
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for primary refractory disease or relapse within 1 year
 (or for relapse after autologous SCT).
Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel).
Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel).
Bone marrow transplant (BMT)/SCT consolidation

CAR T-cell therapy for primary refractory disease or relapse within 1 year (or relapse after autologous SCT)
Patients with DLBCL who relapse during or within 2 months of receiving R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy have primary refractory disease. Any patient with disease relapse within 1 year of R-CHOP chemotherapy or with primary refractory disease has a poor prognosis, even with reinduction using chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[
1
,
2
] Patients who received CAR T-cell therapy had a 40% to 50% 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate with a 40-month follow-up, a result equivalent retrospectively to autologous SCT in bone marrow registries.[

]
Three randomized trials compared chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT with CAR T-cell therapy with or without bridging chemoimmunotherapy for patients with high-risk relapsed disease, defined as primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP therapy.
Evidence (CAR T-cell therapy):
A prospective randomized trial included 359 patients with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients received the CAR T-cell therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) with only bridging steroids or second-line chemoimmunotherapy (usually R-ICE [rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin] or R-DHAP [rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin]) followed by autologous SCT.[

]
	With a median follow-up of 47.2 months, the median OS was not reached in the axi-cel cohort and was 31.1 months in the chemoimmunotherapy cohort. The estimated 4-year OS rate was 54.6% for patients who received axi-cel and 46.0% for patients who received chemoimmunotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]

P

] 
	The median investigator-assessed PFS was 14.7 months in the axi-cel cohort and 3.7 months in the chemotherapy cohort (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38–0.67). 
	In the chemoimmunotherapy arm, 64% patients never received autologous SCT during the study because of inadequate response, progression, or death.[
7
]
	Clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences in quality of life were obtained in the CAR T-cell arm at day 100 and day 150, compared with the standard of care.[

][
Level of evidence A2
] 
	Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 6% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity occurred in 21% of patients.
A prospective randomized trial included 184 patients with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients received the CAR T-cell therapy lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), with 63% of patients receiving bridging therapy or second-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[
9
]
With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, the median PFS was not reached for patients who received liso-cel and was 6.2 months for patients who received chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT (HR, 0.40; 
P
 < .0001).[
9
][
Level of evidence B1
]
On the chemoimmunotherapy arm of the study, 53% of patients never received autologous SCT because of inadequate response, progression, or death.[

]
Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 1% of patients, and grade 3 neurotoxicity occurred in 4% of patients. There were no grade 4 or 5 occurrences.
A prospective randomized trial included 322 patients with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients received the CAR T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel, with most patients receiving bridging therapy to achieve response, or second-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[
10
]
There was no difference in event-free survival (EFS) for patients in either arm (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82–1.40; 
P
 = .69).[
10
][
Level of evidence B1
]
In the CAR T-cell therapy arm, 48% of patients received two or more cycles of chemoimmunotherapy as part of bridging therapy. This approach to bridging therapy may have led to an unacceptable number of cases of progressive disease.
In summary:
For patients with high-risk relapsing DLBCL with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of R-CHOP-based chemotherapy, axi-cel and liso-cel are superior induction regimens, compared with chemoimmunotherapy with regimens like R-ICE, R-DHAP, and R-GDP (rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin).
The interval until patients receive CAR T cells must be minimized, optimally by using only steroids, eliminating bridging chemoimmunotherapy, and infusing the CAR T-cell product as quickly as possible.
The preference for CAR T-cell therapy over chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT does not apply to patients who relapse more than 12 months after R-CHOP therapy.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has compiled guidelines for the management of adverse events in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy.[
11
]
Worse outcomes were reported when apheresis for CAR T-cell therapy occurred just after bendamustine therapy. In a retrospective multicenter review of 439 patients who were infused with CD-19–targeted CAR T cells, 80 patients had received prior bendamustine. With a median follow-up of 20.6 months after CAR T-cell infusion, the patients who had received prior bendamustine had a lower overall response rate (53% vs. 72%, 
P
 < .01), worse median PFS (3.1 vs. 6.2 months, 
P
 = .04), and worse median OS (4.6 vs. 23.5 months, 
P
 < .01).[

BMT or SCT consolidation
BMT
BMT consolidation is a treatment option for patients with relapsed  lymphoma.[
13
] Preliminary studies indicate that approximately 20% to 40% of patients will have a long-term disease-free status, but the precise percentage depends on patient selection and the specific treatment used. Preparative drug regimens have varied; some investigators also use total-body irradiation. Similar success has been achieved using autologous marrow, with or without marrow purging, and allogeneic marrow.[

18
]
Evidence (BMT):
In a prospective randomized study (EORTC-PARMA), 215 patients in first or second relapse of aggressive lymphoma, younger than 60 years, and with no bone marrow or central nervous system involvement, were given two cycles of intensive combination chemotherapy. The 109 patients who responded were randomly assigned to receive four more cycles of chemotherapy and involved-field radiation therapy (IF-XRT) versus autologous BMT followed by IF-XRT. With a 5-year median follow-up, the EFS rate was significantly improved with transplant (46% vs. 12%). The OS rate was also significantly better with transplant (53% vs. 32%).[
19
][
Level of evidence A1
] Salvage BMT was unsuccessful for patients on the nontransplant arm whose disease relapsed.
In general, patients who responded to initial therapy and who  responded to conventional therapy for relapse before the BMT have had the best results.[
20
]
In a prospective trial, patients who relapsed late (>12 months after diagnosis) had better OS than patients who relapsed earlier (the 8-year survival rate was 29% vs. 13%, 
P
 = .001).[

Peripheral SCT
Peripheral SCT has yielded results equivalent to standard autologous SCT.[
22

Evidence (peripheral SCT):
In a randomized prospective trial, 396 patients with DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory to first-line therapy received either R-ICE or R-DHAP followed by autologous SCT.[

CAR T-cell therapy for relapse after autologous SCT
In the event of disease relapse after autologous SCT, many patients receive consolidation with CAR T-cell therapy.
Multiple trials describe patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an infusion of T cells that were engineered to express a CAR to target the CD19 antigen expressed on the malignant B cells using three different constructs: axi-cel, tisagenlecleucel, and liso-cel.[
31
-
35

Tafasitamab plus lenalidomide
Tafasitamab is a humanized anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody with a fucosylated Fc region to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Tafasitamab has been studied mostly in combination with lenalidomide.
Evidence (tafasitamab plus lenalidomide):
In a phase II study, 80 patients with SCT-ineligible relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated with tafasitamab and lenalidomide. The study excluded patients with high-risk cytogenetics (
MYC

BCL2
 and/or 
BCL6
 rearrangements) and those who had received more than four prior  lines of therapy or prior CD19-directed therapy.[

Similarly, the median PFS was higher for patients who received the polatuzumab vedotin combination (9.5 months) than for the patients who received BR alone (3.7 months) (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21−0.63; 
P
 < .001); the OS was 12.4 months for patients who received the polatuzumab vedotin combination versus 4.7 months for the patients who received BR alone (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24−0.75; 
P

The FDA approved the combination of polatuzumab vedotin and BR for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
Loncastuximab tesirine
Loncastuximab tesirine is a CD19-directed antibody conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer cytotoxin (an antibody-drug conjugate).[
42
]
Evidence (loncastuximab tesirine):
A phase I and subsequent phase II trial included 184 patients with SCT-ineligible relapsed or refractory DLBCL after two or more lines of therapy.
The overall response rate was 48.3% (95% CI, 39.9%–56.7%), and the complete response rate was 24%.[

Palliative radiation therapy
In general, patients with aggressive lymphoma who relapse with indolent histology will benefit from palliative therapy.[

Treatment of B-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia


In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a very aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which occurs often but not exclusively in young patients. LBL is the lymphomatous manifestation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The treatment paradigms are based on trials for ALL because LBL and ALL are considered different manifestations of the same biological disease. LBL is commonly associated with large mediastinal masses and has a high tendency to spread to bone marrow and the central nervous system. For more information, see 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment
.

Treatment of Diffuse Small Noncleaved-Cell/Burkitt Lymphoma


In This Section
Treatment Options for Diffuse Small Noncleaved-Cell/Burkitt Lymphoma
Aggressive multidrug regimens
CNS prophylaxis 
Current Clinical Trials
Diffuse small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma typically involves younger patients and represents the most common type of pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[
1
,
2
] High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, includes lymphomas with Burkitt-like or blastoid morphology without double hit cytogenetics, and with germinal center B-cell phenotype.[
3
] Up to one-half of patients have a single 
MYC
 rearrangement. Optimal treatment is poorly defined  because the diagnosis is rare.  Burkitt lymphoma regimens with central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis are usually chosen.[
3
]
Treatment Options for Diffuse Small Noncleaved-Cell/Burkitt Lymphoma
Treatment options for diffuse small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma include the following:
Aggressive multidrug regimens
.
CNS prophylaxis
.
Aggressive multidrug regimens
Treatment for diffuse small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma is usually an aggressive multidrug regimen similar to those used for advanced-stage aggressive lymphomas (such as diffuse large cell).[
4
-
6
] Adverse prognostic factors include age older than 40 years,  high serum lactate dehydrogenase (>3 times normal), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or greater, and CNS involvement.[
2
] A retrospective review of 641 adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma from 30 U.S. cancer centers found a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 64%. Nineteen percent of patients had CNS involvement, 14% had primary refractory disease, and the treatment-related mortality rate was 10%.[
2
]
Evidence (aggressive multidrug regimens):
Aggressive combination chemotherapy modeled after that used in childhood Burkitt lymphoma has been successful for adult patients. More than 60% of advanced-stage patients were free of disease at 5 years.[
6
-
9
]
Rituximab has been incorporated into these  aggressive combination chemotherapy regimens.  A nonrandomized, single-arm, prospective, multicenter trial of 363 patients, aged 16 years to 85 years,  showed a 5-year PFS rate of 71% and a 5-year overall survival rate of 80%.[
5
][
Level of evidence C1
]
CNS prophylaxis 
Patients with diffuse small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma have a 20% to 30% lifetime risk of CNS involvement. CNS prophylaxis with methotrexate is recommended for all patients and is usually given as four to six intrathecal injections.[
10
] For more information, see 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment
.
Evidence (CNS prophylaxis):
In a series of 41 patients treated with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, 44% of those who presented with CNS disease and 13% of those who relapsed with CNS involvement became long-term disease-free survivors.[
11
] CNS relapse patterns were similar whether or not patients received radiation therapy, but increased neurological deficits were noted among those who received radiation therapy.
