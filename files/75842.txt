Efficacy and Safety of Nab-paclitaxel-Lenvatinib-Pembrolizumab as Second-line Treatment in Advanced NSCLC Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel-lenvatinib-pembrolizumab in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC patients after progression to first-line anti-PD-1/L1 inhibitor with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. All participants will be given with albumin-bound paclitaxel, lenvatinib and pembrolizumab.
