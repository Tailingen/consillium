Trial of AB-110 in Adults With Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing Cord Blood Transplantation
A phase 1b, open label, multi-center trial of AB-110 in adults with hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplasia (MDS) undergoing cord blood transplantation. Subjects will receive unmanipulated cord blood (UCB) and AB-110 expanded CD34 enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells (HSPC).
