Blinatumomab in Adult Patients With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) of B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study is designed to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of blinatumomab in patients with MRD of B- precursor ALL in complete hematological remission including patients with relapse after SCT. The study aims to expand experience generated in previous trials in patients with MRD positive ALL with a focus on additional specific questions.

Transfer of patients to alloHSCT after one cycle or after a subsequent cycle is considered as per protocol discontinuation and as premature treatment discontinuation.

In case of hematological or extramedullary relapse, the study treatment will be permanently discontinued.

There will be a safety follow-up visit at 30 days after end of the last infusion. There will be efficacy follow-up until 18 months after treatment start. In patients scheduled for SCT the 30-day safety-visit may be performed at the latest time point possible before initiation of subsequent treatment.
