R1vascular Hepatectomy for HCC Patients
Since the previous decade, the authors introduced the R1 vascular (R1vasc) resection for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal liver metastases (Torzilli et al. J Am Coll Surg 2005; Vigan√≤ et al. Ann Surg Oncol 2016; Torzilli et al. Surgery 2017). However, oncological reliability of tumor exposure in surgery for HCC remains controversial since it has never been validated. The aim of the study is to determine the oncological adequacy of R1vasc hepatectomy in patients with HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hepatic resection
Rates of local recurrence, Calculation of the local recurrence (cut-edge tumor re-growth) of R0, R1par, and R1vasc, and R1par+R1vasc hepatectomy., From date of surgery until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, which ever came first assessed up to 72 months
A prospective cohort of patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between January 2005 and December 2015 is reviewed. The following definitions are adopted: R0 is any resection with at least 1 mm of negative margin; R1vasc is any resection with tumor exposure due to the detachment from major intrahepatic vessel (1st/2nd order glissonean pedicles and hepatic vein at caval confluence); R1-parenchymal (R1par) is any resection with tumor exposure at parenchymal margin.
