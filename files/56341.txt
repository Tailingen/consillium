Vopratelimab is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Inducible Co-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is an open label, roll over study to evaluate the long-term safety of continued treatment with vopratelimab monotherapy or combination treatment.
