NGR-hTNF in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy to Treat Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The main objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) when NGR-hTNF is added to standard chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin/gemcitabine or cisplatin/pemetrexed) in locally advanced (stage IIIb with supraclavicular lymph node metastases or malignant pleural or pericardial effusion), metastatic (stage IV) or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: NGR-hTNF|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS evaluated according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), Every 6 weeks during study treatment and every 6 weeks during the follow-up before PD
Safety according to NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 3), To evaluate safety profile related to NGR-hTNF in combination with standard chemotherapy, from the date of randomization until 28 days after last treatment|Objective response rate, Antitumor activity defined as response rate evaluated according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), Every 6 weeks during study treatment and every 6 weeks during the follow-up before PD|Duration of response (DR), defined as the time that measurement criteria are met for complete response or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the progressive disease is objectively documented., from the time of first recorded evidence of complete response or partial response until the progressive disease objectively documented|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive, from the randomization until to the date of patient death or discontinuation from the study
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to a standard chemotherapy regimen plus low-dose (0.8 mcg/m\^2) NGR-hTNF or standard chemotherapy alone, through a centralized randomization process using the following stratification factors: performance status (0 vs 1) and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). In both arms the choice between the two chemotherapy regimens will be based on the histologic subtype: in patients with squamous histology (including also generic diagnosis of NSCLC without further subtype classification) is recommended cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen, in patients with nonsquamous histology (including adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma) is recommended cisplatin/pemetrexed regimen.
