Breast Reconstruction With External Pre-expansion and Autologous Fat Transfer Versus Standard Therapy
This multicentre randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate a new breast reconstruction technique- autologous fat transfer (AFT). Female patients with breast cancer schedule to receive a mastectomy (or having undergone mastectomy in the past) will be randomized to undergo breast reconstruction with either AFT (intervention group) or reconstruction with implants (control group). AFT will be evaluated in terms of quality of life, aesthetic result, complications, oncological safety and cost-effectiveness.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: autologous fat transfer|PROCEDURE: breast implant
Breast-related Quality of life (BREAST_Q), Measured by the BREAST-Q questionnaire (quality of life subdivision) preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively, 1 year
Aesthetic result, The overall aesthetic result will be measured using 3D-photographs which will be assessed by a panel of independent plastisch surgeons, ex-breast cancer patients and healthy volunteers. In addition, the volume, shape and symmetry will be assessed by the patient using the BREAST-Q questionnaire (satisfaction with breasts subdivisions) at 1 year postoperatively., 1 year|Complications, Measurement of short-term als well as mid-term complications associated with procedures as well as (serious) adverse events., 1 year|Oncological safety, Oncological follow-up will comply to the guidelines for breast cancer and will take place by a yearly consult with the oncological surgeon (including physical examination and mammography/ultrasound/MRI) for 5 years postoperatively. All (loco)regional and distant recurrences will be recorded and compared between both grops., 5 years|Cost-effectiveness, Cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the intramural and socio-economic costs associated with the breast reconstruction treatment. It will be calculated according to the guidelines of the "Instuction manual cost-effectiveness analysis" (Handleiding kostenonderzoek) of the Dutch Health Institute (Zorginstituut Nederland)., 1 year|Sensibility, Measurement of skin sensitivity with Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments, 12 months after final reconstruction surgery., 1 year|Donor site satisfaction, Measurement of quality of life and satisfaction at AFT donor sites, as measured by the BODY-Q questionnaire and additional questions concerning liposuction sites., 2 years
