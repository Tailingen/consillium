Gemcitabine/Cisplatin for Resected Pancreas Cancer: Establishing the Role of ERCC1 in Treatment Decision
The purpose of this study is to investigate if the investigators can use a specific marker in the pancreatic tumor itself to determine which patients will benefit from receiving combination chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin after undergoing resection of a pancreatic cancer.

The investigators will also investigate if there is any benefit to receiving both chemotherapy drugs as opposed to only gemcitabine after undergoing complete resection of the tumor.

Recurrence-free Survival as Measured by CT Scan, Clinical data were prospectively collected. Staging was performed using 7th American Committee on Cancer criteria. Patients were followed by radiologic evaluation (CT or MRI) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) every 3 months for the first 3 years after resection to assess for recurrence. Subsequently, patients underwent imaging every 6 months., Every 3 months and then every 6 months for 2 more years after resection
Immunohistochemistry to Determine Status of Excision Repair Cross Complementation Gene-1 (ERCC1) Expression, To determine the level of ERCC1 expression, formalin-fixed, resected tumors were stained with anti-ERCC1 monoclonal antibody (clone 8F1; Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) using the Dako Autostainer (Ft. Collins, CO). The percentage and intensity of fine granular nuclear staining were graded by a single pathologist. Percentage of staining was categorized into the following groups: 0 ≤ 1%; 1 = 1-10%; 2 = 11-50%; 3 = 51-100%. Staining intensity was scored as follows: 0 = none; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong. Subsequently, an overall score to dichotomize the expression level to low or high was calculated: \[(1+intensity score)/3\]\*percentage score. An overall score ≤ 2 was considered low ERCC1 expression, and \> 2 was high ERCC1 expression., At the time of resection
The study will specifically be looking at ERCC1 expression in pancreas cancer with regards to its prognostic and predictive value as a biomarker for patients receiving Gem / Cis as adjuvant therapy after resection.
