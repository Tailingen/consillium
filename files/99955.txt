The recommended phase 2 dose is the MTD defined in Cycle 1, with consideration given to chronic cumulative toxicity occurring at later cycles., Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1)
Number of Participants With Death as Outcome, Treatment-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAEs, Adverse Events (AEs), and Treatment-related AEs Leading to Discontinuation, An SAE is any untoward medical event that at any dose: results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency or abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization. An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-related comprises certainly, probably, and possibly related and of unknown relationship to study drug., Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1)|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Greater Treatment-related AEs, An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. AEs graded according to CTC, Version 3.0. Gr 1=Mild; Gr 2=Moderate; Gr 3=Severe; Gr 4=Life-threatening. Treatment-related comprises certainly, probably, and possibly related and of unknown relationship to study drug., Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Hematology Laboratory Values by Worst CTC Grade, LLN=lower level of normal; ULN=upper level of normal. Hemoglobin (g/dL; LLN=11.3; ULN=14.9); leukocytes (\*10\^3 c/uL; LLN=4.1; ULN=6.1); lymphocytes (\*10\^3 c/uL); neutrophils (absolute), neutrophils + bands (\*10\^3 c/uL); platelet count (\*10\^9 c/L; LLN=131; ULN=365)

Appendix 7.1.2, At screening and Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Serum Chemistry Laboratory Values by Worst CTC Grade, ULN=upper limit of normal; LLN=lower limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase=ALP(LLN=115; ULN=359) (U/L); alanine aminotransferase=ALT (LLN=8; ULN=42)(U/L); aspartate aminotransferase=AST (LLN=13; ULN=33) (U/L); albumin (LLN=3.7; ULN=5.2)(g/dL); bilirubin (LLN=0.3; ULN=1.2)(mg/dL); calcium (LLN=8.7; ULN=10.3)(mg/dL); creatinine (LLN=0.6; ULN=1.1)(mg/dL); potassium (LLN=3.6; ULN=4.9) (mEq/L); sodium (LLN=138; ULN=146) (mEq/L), At screening and Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Urine Testing Results by Worst CTC Grade, Toxicities graded according to CTC, Version 3. Protein Gr 1: \<1.0 g/24 hrs (1+); Gr 2: 1.0 to 3.4 g/24 hrs (2+ to 3+ ); Gr 3: \>=3.5 g/24 hrs (4+); Gr 4: Nephrotic syndrome. Note: + = qualitative measure of urine chemistry., At screening and Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Blood Pressure and Heart Rate, Blood pressure and heart rate obtained before ixabepilone infusion, every 1 hour during and at the end of ixabepilone infusion, and at the end of carboplatin infusion in Cycle 1. For subsequent cycles, vital signs obtained before ixabepilone infusion, at the end of ixabepilone infusion, and at the end of carboplatin infusion. Any new or worsening clinically significant changes since last entry were recorded as appropriate AE or SAE., At screening and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (21 days) and Day 1 of Cycle 2 (Study day 22)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Weight and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, Participants weighed same day as serum chemistry tests. Body surface area recalculated only if body weight changes \>10%. ECOG criteria used to assess disease progression and affects on daily living abilities and to determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. Grade 1=Restricted physical activity but ambulatory and capable of light work; Grade 2=Ambulatory, capable of self care, but unable to carry out any work activities; Grade 3=Capable of limited self care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours; Grade 4=Completely disabled, totally confined to bed or chair., At screening of Cycle 1 (21 days) and Day 1 of Cycle 2 (Study day 22)|Number of Participants at Each Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Assessment, Tumor response was assessed using the RECIST assessment: Complete response (CR)=Disappearance of all clinical and radiologic evidence of target lesions; Partial response (PR)=At least 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameters of all target lesions; Progressive disease (PD)=At least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of all target lesions; Stable disease (SD)=Neither PR nor PD criteria were met., Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of Ixabepilone, Days 1 to 8 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Time of Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of Ixabepilone, Days 1 to 8 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinite Time of Ixabepilone, Days 1 to 8 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Volume of Distribution at Steady State of Ixabepilone, Days 1 to 8 of Cycle 1 (21 days)|Total Body Clearance of Ixabepilone, Days 1 to 8 of Cycle 1 (21 days)
