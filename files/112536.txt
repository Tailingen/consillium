Comparison Of Radiation Exposure To Patients During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Performed By Endoscopists Trained In Judicious Use Of Fluoroscopy With Those Without Formal Training
Purpose: To compare the radiation exposure in patients during Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) done by Endoscopists formally trained in judicious use of fluoroscopy versus ERCPs done by Endoscopists without such formal training.

Research design: This is an observational study to compare radiation exposure in patients during ERCPs based on formal training.

Procedures to be used: None Risks and potential benefits There are no risks associated with this study as it is a retrospective chart review. Potential benefits include the knowledge gained from this study which may be of help to patients in the future.

Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result The knowledge gained from this study may be of help to provide new insights and develop newer guidelines for radiation use in the future.

Radiation exposure as assessed by fluoroscopy time, Radiation exposure of patients who undergo ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreatography) will be assessed by fluoroscopy time, which is indicated by the device used for ERCP. Fluoroscopy time at the time of ERCP will be recorded at the end of the procedure and is documented by the endoscopy technician., at the time of ERCP|Radiation exposure as assessed by total emittance, Radiation exposure of patients who undergo ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreatography) will be assessed by total emittance, which is indicated by the device used for ERCP. Total emittance at the time of ERCP will be recorded at the end of the procedure and is documented by the endoscopy technician., at the time of ERCP
