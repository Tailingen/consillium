Online Proton Adaptive Radiotherapy
This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of daily online adaptive planning for patients undergoing proton radiation therapy.

Patients undergoing proton radiation therapy normally undergo extensive pre-planning for their treatment. However, accounting for uncertainties in treatment delivery remains a challenge for a variety of reasons, such as differences in patient anatomy from pre-planning to the day of treatment. Online adaptive planning is a process consisting of generating the original pre-plan on the patient on a treatment day, assessing the pre-plan's coverage and safety, and if changes are needed, the plan is changed in order to optimize the treatment while the patient is still on the treatment table. This study is assessing the feasibility and safety of this approach in order to gather data for a larger trial.
Solid Tumor
RADIATION: Proton SBRT
Feasibility of online proton adaptive radiotherapy, Feasibility will be defined as successful completion of the online adaptive proton radiotherapy workflow in at least 70% of planned adaptive fractions., Through end of treatment (up to 2 weeks)
Safety of online proton adaptive radiotherapy as measured by the amount of grade 2 and higher radiation-related toxicities, Adverse events are graded per CTCAE v5.0., from start of treatment through 3 months
