A Study of DOX-SL in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-SL) in the long-term treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients who previously had good responses to DOX-SL in controlled studies of limited duration, or those with KS who discontinued treatment with another Kaposi's sarcoma therapy because of inadequate efficacy or unacceptable toxicity. To provide a defined protocol for Kaposi's sarcoma patients for whom DOX-SL therapy is indicated.
Sarcoma, Kaposi|HIV Infections
DRUG: Doxorubicin hydrochloride (liposomal)
Patients receive DOX-SL every 3 weeks for a maximum of 20 cycles (including any cycles from a previous DOX-SL study). KS lesions are evaluated prior to administration of each treatment, at the end of the final treatment cycle, and at 4 weeks following the end of the final treatment. Patients who respond will be followed every 2 months for up to 1 year. Study treatment may be interrupted for up to 4 months because of complete response, development of opportunistic infections, or adverse drug effects.
