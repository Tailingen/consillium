Radio-Immunotherapy Before Cystectomy in Locally Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder
A prospective, single arm, multicenter, Phase II-Trial to assess safety and efficacy of preoperative Radiation therapy before radical CystEctomy combined with ImmunoTherapy in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder
Urinary Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|RADIATION: Radiation therapy of the pelvis|PROCEDURE: Radical cystectomy with standardized pelvic lymphadenectomy
Rate of patients with completed Treatment, Completed Treatment (consisting of radio-immunotherapy and radical cystectomy) is defined by Administration of at least 2 complete cycles of nivolumab 240 mg and Administration of at least 23 of planned 28 Radiation fractions (at least 41.4 Gy in total), end of week 15

Patients with locally advanced bladder cancer have a poor prognosis despite radical surgical therapy. The addition of perioperative combination chemotherapy did not add significant benefit to surgery alone. There is data indicating a synergistic effect of radiation and immunotherapy. Therefore, combined application of radiotherapy with Nivolumab before radical cystectomy might lead to improved cure rates and local control in this poor prognosis group with locally advanced bladder cancer. The aim of this phase-II study is to assess feasibility and safety of immunotherapy combined with neoadjuvant radiation before radical cystectomy.
