Phase II Study With Hiltonol and Dendritic Cells in Solid Tumors
In this phase II study, patients with solid tumors will receive treatment with hiltonol and autologous dendritic cells.
Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Hiltonol and autologous dendritic cells|RADIATION: Hiltonol, dendritic cells and radiation
Response rate, 8-10 weeks
Safety (Common Toxicity Criteria 4.0), 8-10 weeks
In this phase II study, patients with solid tumors will receive treatment with intratumoral hiltonol and two cycles of autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumor and administered subcutaneously. A new cohort will explore the role of radiation therapy, looking for an abscopal effect.
