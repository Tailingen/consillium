Ultrasound-guided Stellate Ganglion Block for Treatment of Chronic Migraine in Adult
To assess the 6-months effects and safety of stellate ganglion block(SGB) for Chronic Migraine (CM) patients who failure to undergo preventive therapy and are seeking a more suitable non-pharmacological therapy.
Chronic Migraine
PROCEDURE: Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB)|DRUG: standardized drug treatment
the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days, The primary outcome is the change from baseline in mean monthly (defined as 4 weeks) migraine days across 6-months follow-up period, which will be assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). Baseline is defined as the number of migraine days during the last 28 days prior to the randomization date. A migraine day is defined as a calendar day with symptoms of a migraine attack lasting at least 30 min., 6-month period
Proportion of patients achieved≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days, Proportion of patients achieved≥50% reduction, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|Total effective rate, Total effective rate = cure rate + markedly effective rate + effective rate, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|The mean Numeric Rating Scale(NRS) score during headache attack, The Numeric Rating Scale(NRS) scoring method typically uses a score range of 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain or symptoms and 10 indicating the most severe pain or symptoms., at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|Patients satisfaction (PS), Patients satisfaction (PS) evaluated by PS scores, which typically uses a score range of 0-10, with 0 indicating no patient satisfaction and 10 indicating the most patient satisfaction., 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|The six item headache impact test (HIT-6), The six item headache impact test (HIT-6) is a self-reported questionnaire measuring the "impact that headaches have on the ability to function on the job, at school, at home, and in social situations., at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|the Migraine Disability Assessment score(MIDAS), MIDAS is a reliable and validated scale measuring migraine-related disability regarding the need for medical care.. Higher MIDAS scores indicate more days with disability, at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), PSQI is a self-administered assessment of sleep disturbances that may affect sleep quality, including sleep apnoea, with a higher score indicating more severe sleep disturbances., at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery|adverse events, Proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events, at 0 day , 1 week, 2 week, 3 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 month，5 month and 6 month after surgery
The investigators aim to investigate whether the stellate ganglion block(SGB) is better than traditional medication treatment and provides medical evidence for the clinical application and promotion of SGB to provide a minimally invasive, safe, and effective treatment for patients with chronic migraine(CM) who failed to receive standardized drug treatment.
