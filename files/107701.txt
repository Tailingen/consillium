Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection (Marqibo速) in Combination With UK ALL R3 Induction Chemotherapy for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With Relapsed ALL
This is a pilot study utilizing Marqibo速 (vincristine sulfate liposome injection) combined with dexamethasone, mitoxantrone and asparaginase (UK ALL R3) for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
ALL, Childhood|Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute, Childhood|Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute
DRUG: Marqibo
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, The incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be measured at different dose levels., 5 weeks
The response rate after treatment., The rate of remission will be assessed after 1 courses of therapy. A bone marrow aspirate/biopsy and CBC will be conducted to assess response., Approx. 8 weeks
This study will utilize Marqibo速 as a replacement for standard vincristine in combination with chemotherapy for children with relapsed ALL. The hypothesis is that the incorporation of Marqibo速 with combination chemotherapy will be safe and feasible. In the context of this pilot study, overall outcomes and efficacy will be a secondary objective. It is hypothesized that data from this combination may show improved efficacy including, complete remission (CR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, and progression free survival (PFS) rates and safety (i.e., neurotoxicity) in comparison to outcomes in historical regimens, including the UK ALL R3 with standard vincristine.
