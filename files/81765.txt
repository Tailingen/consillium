A Clinical Study of PD-L1 Antibody ZKAB001（Drug Code） in Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, and multidose study, aiming to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics(PK) of ZKAB001 (a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the Programmed Death - Ligand 1 (PD-L1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system) administered every 14 days in subjects with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.

The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Lead-in period (Day -28), Treatment (up to 24 cycles or 1 year, whichever occurs first), and Follow-up (up to 1 year). There will be a lead-in period on Day -28 for each dose escalation cohort in which the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 will be characterized prior to initiation of continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment. The lead-in period duration, PK time-points, doses and/or regimens used in subsequent cohorts may be modified based on the exposure (AUC) observed during the lead-in period (although the number of PK samples will not be increased). Treatment of continuous dosing is up to 24 cycles or 1 year, until as per investigator's opinion, subjects experience disease progression (evaluated by RECIST 1.1 and immune-related response criteria irRECIST), no clinical benefit, or intolerable toxicity. If investigators suspect subjects experience pseudoprogression or has evidence to prove "mixed response", subjects can continue to accept treatment as investigator decided.

The study was divided into two stages. After the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is determined in the first stage, the sample size will be amplified with RP2D in the second stage. When a total of 15 cases are included in the two stages, an interim analysis will be conducted to decide whether to expand the total number of cases to 60 based on the results of the analysis. If more than 2 cases of response will be observed in 15 cervical cancer subjects, 45 cases (with a total sample size of 60 cases) could be included to further observe the safety and efficacy.
