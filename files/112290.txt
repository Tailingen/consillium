The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational intervention to improve quality of life in patients with lung cancer who are transitioning from active treatment to surveillance.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Five Psycho-educational Session(s)|BEHAVIORAL: One Psycho-educational Session(s)
Quality of life: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer, We will investigate longitudinal differences in quality of life between study groups (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer score range 0-144, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), Up to 12 weeks
Fear of cancer recurrence: Fear of Cancer Recurrence Scale 7, We will investigate longitudinal differences in fear of cancer recurrence between study groups (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Scale 7, score range 7-35, with higher scores indicating more fear of cancer recurrence), Up to 12 weeks|Symptom burden: Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, We will investigate longitudinal differences in symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale score range 0-90, with higher scores indicating more symptom burden), Up to 12 weeks|Psychological symptom burden: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, We will investigate longitudinal differences in psychological symptom burden (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score range 0-42 with higher scores indicating more psychological symptom burden), Up to 12 weeks|Social support: Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, We will investigate longitudinal differencs in social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support score range 12-84, with higher scores indicating more social support), Up to 12 weeks|Social isolaton: Campaign to End Loneliness Measurement Tool, We will investigate longitudinal differences in social isolation (Campaign to End Loneliness measurement tool score range 0-12 with higher scores indicating more social isolation), Up to 12 weeks
This is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational intervention relative to a control condition for improving quality of life in patients with lung cancer who are transitioning from treatment to surveillance.

In this study, participants will complete survey questions and will be randomly assigned to receive a 5-session program or a 1-session program.

It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study.
