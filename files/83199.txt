Ruxolitinib for Premalignant Breast Disease
This study is evaluating how ruxolitinib affects premalignant breast cells. One half of the study participants will receive ruxolitinib for approximately 15 days, and the other half will receive a placebo (sugar pill) for approximately 15 days. Once study participants have completed their ruxolitinib or placebo, participants will undergo surgery to remove the premalignant breast tissue.

Change in Apoptosis, The number of premalignant breast cells in apoptosis at the time of diagnosis will be compared to the number of cells in apoptosis following treatment with 15 (+/- 5) days of ruxolitinib or placebo., 15 days (+/- 5 days)
pSTAT5, To determine the difference in change in pSTAT5 levels between diagnosis and surgery as a function of ruxolitinib treatment versus placebo, 15 days (+/- 5 days)
