Neo-adjuvant Immunochemotheray Versus Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy for Resectable Esophageal Carcinoma
The effect of neo-adjuvant immunochemotherapy on survival of patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas remains unknown. One of our objectives is to evaluate whether the neo-adjuvant immunochemotherapy Toripalimab (JS001) with cisplatin and paclitaxel followed by right thoracic approach esophagectomy with total 2-field lymph node dissection improves the overall survival of thoracic esophageal cancer patients versus neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

The effect of immunochemotherapy in second line treatment of esophageal cancer got a positive results in the world. We tried to apply the immunotheray in resectable esophageal cancer and have planed this phase III clinical trials. The optimal management of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinomas may have a new chapter in the era of immunotherapy.
