Prostate Interstitial Brachytherapy With I125 Implant With Target Dose Supplementation in the Tumor Volume Guided by TRINITY® PERINE 3D System
The objective of the FOCUS-Boost project is to implant for the first time with a 3D ultrasound image fusion registration system (3D echo) implant of iodine 125 with precision in a target volume determined by positive biopsies.

OTHER: Interstitial Brachytherapy of the Prostate With Iodine 125 Implant With Target Dose Supplementation in the Tumor Volume Guided by the TRINITY® PERINE 3D
Implant for the first time, in a clinical situation, iodine 125 implants in a planned target volume, using a 3D echo-mapping fusion guidance system of positive biopsies., To evaluate the number of successful/failed iodine 125 implants (BOOST implants) implanted in the CTV-boost (Clinical Target Volume) defined from the mapping of positive biopsies.

The maximum number of BOOST implant implanted will be 4 implants, depending on the size of the target:

10 mm\< target ≤ 15 mm = 2 implants; 15 mm \< target ≤ 20mm = 3 implants; 20 mm \< target ≤ 30 mm = 4 implants; Success is defined as "the centre of the implant is in the target volume". Failure is defined as "the centre of the implant is outside the target volume". The primary endpoint is evaluated on the ultrasound acquisition performed with the Trinity® Perine probe, at the end of the BOOST implant insertion procedure, 24 hours
Assess toxicity (pre brachytherapy visit, M1, M3, M6, M12), with questionnaires, Assessment of toxicity by questionnaires (IPSS score + urinary symptom quality of life).

The interstitial brachytherapy procedure for the prostate does not allow for a robust focal treatment to accurately deliver additional dose to the tumour volume. FOCUS BOOST allows the precise implantation of 125 iodine implant with greater accuracy (using a 3D ultrasound image fusion registration system) in a target volume.

For this purpose, positive biopsies, performed in this research protocol, will be used prior to surgery. Prostate brachytherapy will be optimised thanks to the TRINITY® system and its guidance quality, by increasing the dose of the intra-prostate tumour volume (BOOST) without increasing the total dose delivered to the prostate. Increasing the dose to the tumour target volume could improve disease control and decrease the risk of recurrence.
