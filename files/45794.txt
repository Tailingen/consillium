Complex Peri-operative Intervention in Older Patients With Cancer
Incidence of digestive cancers increase and half of new cases will be people of 75 years or more in 2050. Surgery is one of the main treatment's strategy but post-operative morbi-mortality increases with age. Pre-operative Geriatric Assessment enable to identify frail or vulnerable patients at risk of post-operative complications.

The coordinating team postulate that a geriatric and surgical co-management with a combination of several targeted geriatric interventions with usual post-operative care could improve the post-operative care and decrease the risk of morbi-mortality in older patients with digestive cancers.
