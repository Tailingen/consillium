Person-Centered Oncology Care and Choices (P-COCC): Piloting and Initial Randomized Testing of a Combined Values Narrative Interview and Video Education Advance Care Planning Program in Gastrointestinal Oncology Patients
This study is being done to get individuals' feedback on advanced care planning and decision making.

This study is divided into two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The purpose of Part 1 is to survey people to find out what is important to people with advanced cancer (again, their values, such as their goals, concerns and sources of support). This has never been done before in the way the investigators are doing it, and that is why this is called a "pilot" study, which is where a new method or treatment is being created and evaluated.

The purpose of Part 2 is to see if combining a medical options video with a short interview about values helps people with how they feel about their medical situation, and what they know about their medical options for their medical situation.
