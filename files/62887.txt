Study Comparing Circular Stapler-assisted Colostomy vs Hand-stitching Colostomy of Colorectal Cancer Patients
Conventional hand-stitching colostomy involves extensive hand-stitching by the surgeon. There are significant variations in the outcome of surgery due to differences in the suture techniques of surgeons. The use of a circular stapler in colostomy seems more rapid and efficient colostomy than the conventional methods.But all those reports are single center retrospective cohort studyï¼Œno randomized controlled trials have been carried out so far.The aim of this study is to comparing the safety and efficiency of circular stapler-assisted colostomy with conventional hand-stitching colostomy in patients with colorectal carcinoma.
Colorectal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: circular stapler-assisted colostomy|PROCEDURE: conventional hand-stitching colostomy
colostomy associated complications, measure the colostomy associated complications,such like hemorrhage,necrosis, stenosis, prolapse, and para-stomal hernia., 2 year
It has been difficult to standardize the pull-out of the colon and the size, shape and sutures of the colostomy due to the different techniques employed and varying levels of skill of surgeons in different regions.Thus, various postoperative colostomy complications are inevitable after surgery. Surgeons have been looking for a simple and efficient way to standardize colostomy and reduce its complications.

So we want to compare the safety and efficiency of circular stapler-assisted colostomy with conventional hand-stitching colostomy in colorectal cancer patients.
