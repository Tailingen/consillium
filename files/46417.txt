CYNK-001 IV and IC in Combination With IL2 in Surgical Eligible Recurrent GBM With IDH-1 Wild Type
A Phase 1/2a Open Label Multicenter, Non-Randomized, Trial to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of CYNK-001 in Combination with Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 in Adults with Recurrent Resection Eligible IDH1 wild-type Glioblastoma. For phase I portion, the study objectives to assess the safety and feasibility CYNK-001 in combination with rhIL2 of Intravenous (IV) infusion and Intracavitary (IC) administrations following tumor resection and to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a Recommended Phase 2a Dose (RP2D) for IV and IC CYNK-001 administration. For Phase IIa, to evaluate efficacy and safety of CYNK-001 administrations in recurrent GBM as measured by Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS6M)
