A Clinical Study of Furmonertinib in the Treatment of EGFR-Mutated NSCLC With Leptomeningeal Metastases
This study adopts a retrospective design. Patients enrolled will include those who received furmonertinib (treatment duration ≥1 month) between March 3, 2021, and December 31, 2024, with concurrent therapies permitted (e.g., radiotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, surgical interventions such as ventriculoperitoneal shunting). A retrospective analysis will be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of furmonertinib-based therapy (with or without other treatments) in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with leptomeningeal metastasis.
Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Leptomeningeal Cancer
OS, overall survival, The time interval from the first administration of furmonertinib after the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis to the date of death from any cause（up to 60 months））
TTF, Time to Treatment Failure, Defined as the interval from the first administration of furmonertinib after the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis to the permanent discontinuation of furmonertinib therapy due to disease progression, toxicity, or any other reason（up to 12 months)）|ORR-LM, Objective Response Rate for Leptomeningeal Metastasis, The proportion of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in leptomeningeal lesions, observed from the first administration of furmonertinib after leptomeningeal metastasis diagnosis until disease progression(up to 12 months)
