Selpercatinib for the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors, Lymphomas, or Histiocytic Disorders With Activating RET Gene Alterations, a Pediatric MATCH Treatment Trial
This phase II pediatric MATCH treatment trial studies how well selpercatinib works in treating patients with solid tumors that may have spread from where they first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced), lymphomas, or histiocytic disorders that have activating RET gene alterations. Selpercatinib may block the growth of cancer cells that have specific genetic changes in an important signaling pathway (called the RET pathway) and may reduce tumor size.

Objective response rate (complete response + partial response) in pediatric patients treated with selpercatinib (LOXO-292), A responder is defined as a patient who achieves a best response of partial response or complete response on the study. Response rates will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patients who are responders. The revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) was used to determine response and progression in this study, with specific criteria outlined for the different subtypes of tumors (e.g., 2-dimensional measurements for central nervous system \[CNS\] tumors)., Up to 2 years from study entry
Progression-free survival (PFS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the 6 month PFS. PFS is defined as time from initiation of protocol treatment to disease progression, recurrence, death from any cause, or date of last contact., Up to 6 months from study entry|Percentage of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 adverse events, Evaluated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5. Any eligible patient who receives at least one dose of protocol therapy will be considered in the evaluation of toxicity., Up to 2 years from study entry
Profiling changes in tumor genomics, Will explore approaches to the profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid. A descriptive analysis will be performed and will be summarized with simple summary statistics. All of these analyses will be descriptive in nature., Up to time of disease progression or end of protocol therapy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in pediatric patients treated with selpercatinib (LOXO-292) with advanced solid tumors (including central nervous system \[CNS\] tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in the RET pathway.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with selpercatinib (LOXO-292) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in the RET pathway.

II. To obtain information about the tolerability of selpercatinib (LOXO-292) in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive selpercatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 on study. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also undergo positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET/CT, PET/MRI, and/or CT/MRI, scintigraphy, and x-ray imaging throughout the trial.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days, then periodically thereafter.
