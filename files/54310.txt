Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 7 Agonist, Cyclophosphamide, and Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer With Skin Metastases
This study is to find an optimal dose of Imiquimod (IMQ) in the first part (Phase I) and test the effectiveness of the combination treatment of IMQ, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and radiotherapy (RT) in patients with skin metastases from breast cancer in the second part (Phase II). Currently this trial is in its Phase II part.

Systemic Tumor Response Rates (Complete Response+Partial Response), The systemic tumor response refers to the response at the time of best overall response. The response criteria are specially adapted from Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor for Immunotherapies (Wolchok, et al., 2009)., 9 weeks from the start of the treatment of RT
Local Skin Tumor Response Rates (Complete Response + Partial Response), The response refers to the best overall response, based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's definitions for chest wall tumors (Kouloulias, et al., 2002)., 9 weeks from the start of the treatment
By harnessing the cytocidal and immunostimulatory properties of two local treatment modalities, RT and IMQ, an effective, adaptive immune response can be generated, resulting in systemic control of metastatic breast cancer after local treatment of cutaneous metastases. Additionally, based on investigators' recent preclinical data, the investigators intend to estimate in patients with metastatic breast cancer, if the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide can increase anti-tumor responses.

This trial originally had one treatment arm IMQ/RT(patients were treated with IMQ and RT). Recent evidence has emerged that the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide (CTX) increased anti-tumor responses, therefore the IMQ/RT arm is closed and the trial will continue with two additional cohorts (CTX/IMQ/RT and CTX/RT) which include cyclophosphamide.
