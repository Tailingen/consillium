Comparison of the Euploid Rate of Blastocyst Between PPOS and GnRH Antagonist Protocol in Women With PCOS Undergoing PGT-A
This randomized trial aims to compare the euploid rate of blastocysts between PPOS (progestin-primed ovarian stimulation) and GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone) antagonist protocols in patients with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) undergoing PGT-A (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy). Infertile women with PCOS will be recruited for study after explanation and counseling if they fulfill the inclusion criteria and do not have the exclusion criteria. Eligible women will be randomised into one of the two groups:

Antagonist group: Women will receive antagonist once subcutaneously daily from day 6 of ovarian stimulation till the day of the ovulation trigger.

PPOS group: Women will receive oral MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate)10mg qd from Day 3 till the day of ovulation trigger.

The primary outcome is the euploidy rate of blastocysts.
