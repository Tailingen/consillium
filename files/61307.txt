Gut Microbiome Modulation to Enable Efficacy of Checkpoint-based Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
A multi-institutional, single arm pilot study of antibiotics and pembrolizumab for the treatment of surgically resectable pancreatic cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the change in immune activation in pancreatic tumor tissue following treatment with antibiotics and pembrolizumab.
