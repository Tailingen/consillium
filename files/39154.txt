Feasibility Study on LITT for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
Multicenter, open-label, prospective designed study to characterize the performance of brain laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) ablation using the Monteris NeuroBlate System in combination with standard of care radiation therapy and temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastomas (GBM).
Glioblastoma
DEVICE: NeuroBlate System|DRUG: Radiation therapy and temozolomide
Adverse Events, Characterize adverse events experienced in glioblastoma subjects undergoing LITT using the NeuroBlate System. Adverse events will be collected based on subject reports and subject examination/testing., 2 Years
Progression-Free Survival Rate, To describe progression-free survival rate in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastomas treated with the NeuroBlate System, 2 Years|Overall Survival, To describe/estimate the overall survival of subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastomas treated with LITT using the NeuroBlate System, 2 Years|Changes in Quality of Life, Characterize the changes in quality of life in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who are undergoing LITT using the NeuroBlate System via Quality of Life and neurocognitive assessment tools, 2 Years
