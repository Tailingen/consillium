A Pilot Study of Activated T Cell Therapy for Refractory/Relapsed Neuroblastoma
Activated T cell were manufactured through in vitro T cell expansion of autologous T cell. We designed this study to determine the feasibility and safety of Activated T-lymphocyte cell therapy for refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma patients.
Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: Activated T lymphocyte
T cell count after in vitro expansion, T cell count after in vitro expansion

Evaluation of safety, up to 13 weeks
Number of participants who showed response with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, To determine the response rate

To evaluate 1 yr progression free survival and overall survival, up to 1 year
