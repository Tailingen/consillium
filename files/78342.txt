A Clinical Trial of Patients With Solid Tumours Receiving Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor as Primary Prophylaxis for Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia, in a Docetaxel Based Regimen
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the incidence and severity of neutropenia in patients being treated for solid tumours with a Taxotere® based regimen when Granocyte® 34 is being used as a primary prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

Secondary Objectives:

Haematological : To evaluate the incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (with or without antibiotics) and anaemia in patients being treated for solid tumors treated with a Taxotere based regimen when Granocyte is being used as a primary prophylaxis.

Non-Haematological : To evaluate the incidence and severity of the following adverse events: asthenia, anorexia, myalgia, nail changes and oral mucositis in patients with solid tumours treated with a Taxotere based regimen; when Granocyte is being used as a primary prophylaxis.
