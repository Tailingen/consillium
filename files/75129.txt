Study of TACE Combined With Lenvatinib to Prevent Postoperative Recurrence in Patients With MVI Positive HCC
single-center clinical trial studies have verified the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with lenvatinib in preventing postoperative recurrence of microvascular invasion (MVI) positive HCC patients. Explore a new clinical first-line treatment plan for patients with liver cancer microvascular invasion after surgery.
