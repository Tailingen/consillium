Photodynamic Therapy Using HPPH in Treating Patients With Stage 0 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as HPPH, that is absorbed by tumor cells. The drug becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy using HPPH in treating patients with stage 0 non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: HPPH
Toxicity as measured by NCI CTC v2.0, Daily while in-house, weekly after discharge, at 4-6 weeks and at 6 months
Tumor response, At 4-6 weeks and 6 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the maximally tolerated light dose (MTID) in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma in situ (CIS) or bronchogenic microinvasive carcinoma.
* To identify the systemic and normal tissue toxicity resulting from photodynamic therapy using HPPH in these patients.

Secondary

* To study tumor response in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Approximately 2 days later, patients undergo photodynamic therapy (PDT) using laser light passed through the biopsy channel of an endoscope. Patients undergo endoscopic debridement on day 5. If viable tumor is found outside of the initial treatment area, patients may receive another dose of laser light without additional HPPH at that time.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and periodically thereafter.
