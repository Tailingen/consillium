First-in-Human Study of LPM6690176 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
This study is a phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics characteristics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LPM6690176 capsules in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: LPM6690176
Number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), From the first dose of study drug treatment through Cycle 1 (28 days)|maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LPM6690176, From the first dose of study drug treatment through Cycle 1 (28 days)
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response (CR or PR) per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator, Approximately 2 years|isease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigato, Approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug treatment to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug treatment to the date of death (due to any reason) or documented last contact, Approximately 3 years|Maximum plasma concentration, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of LPM6690176 and its N-demethylated metabolite after a single dose and multiple dose, From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2 (28 days).|Time to maximum plasma concentration, Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of LPM6690176 and its N-demethylated metabolite after a single dose and multiple dose., From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2 (28 days).|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, Area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point (AUClast) of LPM6690176 and its N-demethylated metabolite after a single dose and multiple dose; Area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUCinf) of LPM6690176 and its N-demethylated metabolite after a single dose and multiple dose., From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2 (28 days).|Elimination half-life, Elimination half-life (t1/2) of LPM6690176 and its N-demethylated metabolite after a single dose and multiple dose., From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2 (28 days).
