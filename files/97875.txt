Gemcitabine and Cisplatin as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With High-Grade Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to see if getting chemotherapy with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for four 21 day cycles for a total of 12 weeks can help shrink the tumor before undergoing surgery for kidney cancer.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine and Cisplatin
To define the pathologic response rate (<pT2), of neoadjuvant Gemcitabine and Cisplatin regimen in patients with upper tract high-grade urothelial carcinoma. And is defined as the absence of high-grade carcinoma (\<pT2 disease) and the absence of microscopic lymph node metastases (N0) on the final nephroureterectomy specimen., The time to disease progression is measured from the time of initiation of chemotherapyuntil the first date that systemic recurrence is objectively documented.
To determine the time to disease progression, will be estimated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier in patients with upper tract high-grade urothelial carcinoma with neoadjuvant GC followed by radical nephroureterectomy., Time to progression is measured from the time of initiation of chemotherapy until the 1st date that systemic recurrence is objectively documented. Systemic recurrence for this trial is defined as either metastatic or local pelvic recurrence.|To determine overall survival of patients, will be estimated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier in patients with upper tract high-grade urothelial carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant GC followed by radical nephroureterectomy., 3 years|To evaluate the safety and tolerability, of neoadjuvant Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in this setting. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0., every 2 weeks per cycle
