A Study of CD8+ T Cell Imaging During Treatment in People With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study to learn whether PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) scans using an imaging agent (radiotracer) called zirconium Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam is a safe and effective way to identify CD8+ T cells

DRUG: Zirconium Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET/CT Scan
Difference between Zirconium Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam PET uptake at pre- vs post-TIL infusion and pre- vs post-ACZ redosing., Assess the distribution of the CD8+ cells during TIL therapy by measuring the largest difference in Zirconium Zr 89 crefmirlimab berdoxam PET uptake at pre- vs post-TIL infusion and pre- vs post-ACZ redosing., Baseline to two weeks
