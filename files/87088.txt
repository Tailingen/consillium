Weekly vs. Every 2 Week vs. Every 3 Week Administration of ABI-007 (Abraxane)/Bevacizumab Combination in Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized Phase II study in previously untreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of weekly dose-dense ABI-007 (Abraxane) compared to 2-weekly regimen vs the standard 3-weekly infusion. All patients will also receive concurrent bevacizumab.

The Percentage of Participants Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0), Using the RECIST response criteria version 1.0, the percent of participants achieving either a complete response (CR) defined as the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation or partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and no progression in non-target lesions based on confirmed responses from the investigator assessment of best overall response during study treatment., Up to 43 months|Participant Counts of the Most Severe Grade for Absolute Neutrophil (ANC) as Graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Experience (NCI CTCAE v3), Myelosuppression is a decrease in the ability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells. The lowest measured (nadir) ANC counts were graded using NCI CTCAE version 3:

Grade 0 = within normal limits; Grade 1 = \< lower limit of normal - 75.0\*10\^9L; Grade 2 = \<1.5 - 1.0\*10\^9L; Grade 3 = \<1.0 - 0.5\*10\^9L; Grade 4 = \<0.5\*10\^9L, up to 54 months|Participant Counts of the Most Severe Grade for White Blood Cells (WBC) as Graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Experience (NCI CTCAE v3), Myelosuppression is a decrease in the ability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells. The lowest measured (nadir) WBC counts were graded using NCI CTCAE version 3:

Grade 0 = within normal limits; Grade 1 = \< lower limit of normal -3.0\*10\^9/L; Grade 2 = \<3.0 - 2.0\*10\^9/L; Grade 3 = \<2.0 - 1.0\*10\^9/L; Grade 4 = \<1.0\*10\^9/L, up to 54 months|Participant Counts of the Most Severe Grade for Platelet Counts as Graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Experience (NCI CTCAE v3), Myelosuppression is a decrease in the ability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells. The lowest measured (nadir) platelet counts were graded using NCI CTCAE version 3:

Grade 0 = within normal limits; Grade 1 = \< lower limit of normal - 75.0\*10\^9/L; Grade 2 = \<75.0 - 50.0\*10\^9/L; Grade 3 = \<50.0 - 25.0\*10\^9/L; Grade 4 = \<25.0\*10\^9/L, up to 54 months|Participant Counts of the Most Severe Grade for Hemoglobin Levels as Graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Experience (NCI CTCAE v3), Myelosuppression is a decrease in the ability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells. The lowest measured (nadir) hemoglobin levels were graded using NCI CTCAE version 3:

Grade 0 = within normal limits; Grade 1 = \< lower limit of normal - 100g/L; Grade 2 = \<100 - 80g/L; Grade 3 = \<80 - 65g/L; Grade 4 = \<65g/L, up to 54 months|The Number of Participants With at Least One Dose Reduction for ABI-007, Participants with at least one dose reduction for ABI-007. ABI-007 (Abraxane) dose could be reduced according to protocol guidelines if the participant was experiencing toxicities. Participants were allowed two ABI-007 (Abraxane) dose reductions during the course of the trial. This outcome is considered to be both a safety and an efficacy outcome., Up to 53 months|The Number of Participants With at Least One Dose Delay for ABI-007, Participants with at least one dose delay for ABI-007. Treatment delays of no longer than 2 weeks allowed participants to recovery from acute toxicity. If treatment was delayed beyond 2 weeks, continuing treatment on protocol was at the physician's discretion, based upon the best interests of the participant. This outcome is considered to be both a safety and an efficacy outcome., Up to 53 months|The Number of Participants With a Dose Interruption of ABI-007, Number of participants who interrupted (omitted) a dose at some point in the treatment period. This outcome is considered to be both a safety and an efficacy outcome., Up to 53 months
Percentage of Participants With Stable Disease for â‰¥ 16 Weeks, or Complete or Partial Overall Response (i.e., Total Response) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0), Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0), the percentage of participants achieving either

* A complete response (CR) defined as the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation or
* A partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and no progression in non-target lesions or
* Stable disease (SD) defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease., Up to 43 months (until progressed)|Kaplan Meier Estimate for Time to Disease Progression (TTP), Time to progression was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the start of progression. Participants that did not have progression were censored at the last known time the patient was evaluated for progression. Participants that initiate other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated.

Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion., Up to 43 months (until progressed)|Kaplan Meier Estimate for Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from response to the time of disease progression for participants who achieve an objective confirmed complete (CR) or partial overall response (PR). Disease progression is based on the assessments by the investigator. Participants who did not have disease progression following a confirmed complete or partial target response were censored at the last known time that the participant was evaluated for response, Up to 43 months (until progressed)|Kaplan Meier Estimate for Participant Survival, Participant survival was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time of first dose of study drug to the last known time that the participant was alive. Participants that were alive at the end of follow-up would be censored at the last known time that the patient was alive., Up to 56 months|Kaplan Meier Estimate for Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the start of progression or patient death (any cause) whichever occurred first. Participants that did not have progression or have not died were censored at the last known time the participant was progression free. Participants that initiate other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated., up to 56 months
