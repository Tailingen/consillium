Study of TQB2450 Combined With Anlotinib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1),which prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors. As a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor for tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling，anlotinib is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have undergone progression or recurrence after ≥ 2 lines of systemic chemotherapy. The Phase III study showed that the Overall Survival (OS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Response Rate (ORR) were significantly better than placebo group.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TQB2450|DRUG: Anlotinib
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT defined as any of the following events occurring during the study related to drugs : （1） ≥grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, except for the following conditions: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, electrolyte imbalance that downgrade within 1 week after supportive treatment； Grade 3 fatigue ≤ 7 days duration； Grade 3 hypertension that can be controlled within 1 week by medication； Alopecia, fever caused by tumor or infection, and elevated alkaline phosphatase; （2）Grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemoglobin reduction confirmed by at least 2 tests within 2 days; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding tendency confirmed by at least 2 tests within 2 days; （3）Grade 3 neutropenia with fever confirmed at least 2 times within 2 days (neutrophil count \<1.0×109 / L; fever ≥38.5℃) （4）Immune-related interstitial pneumonia ≥ grade 2 ； （5）Decreased ventricular ejection fraction ≥ grade 2 ； （6）Retinal vein occlusion (RVO), uveitis ≥ grade 2 , and other more serious ocular, Baseline up to 21 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD defined as the highest dose level at which less than or equal to 2 of 6 subjects experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Baseline up to 21 days|Determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D defined as the lower dose level to MTD based on the safety profile, Up to approximately 18 months
Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), Up to approximately 18 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD), Up to approximately 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization until the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, Up to approximately 18 months|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.
