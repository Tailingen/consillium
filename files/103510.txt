Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab Followed by On-demand TACE or Initial Synchronous Treatment With TACE and Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab
Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of up-front atezolizumab/ bevacizumab (Atezo/Bev) followed by on-demand selective transarterial chemoembolization (sdTACE) and of initial synchronous treatment with TACE and Atezo/Bev in the treatment of unresectable HCC patients.
