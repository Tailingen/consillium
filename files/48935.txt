Sentinel Node Detection in Endometrial Cancer: A Consolidation Study on Detection Rates of Metastatic Disease
Evaluation of removal of Sentinel lymph nodes only for detection of pelvic lymph node metastases in high risk and low risk endometrial cancer.
Sentinel Lymph Node|Endometrial Cancer|Lymphedema
PROCEDURE: Injection of tracer ( ICG) and detection of sentinel lymph nodes
Detection rate of pelvic metastatic disease in endometrial cancer, The detection rate will be evaluated from a non-inferiority perspective based on a null-hypothesis of 4% less than an expected rate of 12% nodal metastases, 3 years from start inclusion with an interim analysis after 150 patients|Operative time used for the study intervention ( injection of ICG and identification and removal of sentinel lymph nodes, Exact measurements of time allocated for the SLN procedure as such., 3 years from start inclusion
Incidence of lymphedema after removal of sentinel lymph nodes, Objective measurement lymphedema defined by of leg volume before and after surgery, 4 years including at least one year follow up|intraoperative adverse events associated with the study intervention, Detailed registration of adverse events associated with the SLN procedure as such, 3 years from start inclusion or after 150 patients if study stopped at interim analysis
Consecutive patients with- and low risk endometrial cancer will be approached for eligibility for inclusion in a study evaluating the detection rates of pelvic metastatic disease by detection and removal of Sentinel lymph nodes only, i.e with no further lymphadenectomy.

A re-staging will be performed in case of metastatic Sentinel lymph nodes to guide adjuvant treatment.

The detection rate will be evaluated from a non-inferiority perspective against the expected rate of nodal metastases based on detailed final histological data.

Adverse events related the intervention ( Injection of tracer (ICG) and removal of sentinel nodes), time for the intervention, and an objective evaluation of lymphatic complications (lymphoedema) will be performed in addition to the use of a validated lymphoedema QOL questionnaire.
