A Phase I/II Trial of UCB4594 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
This clinical trial is looking at UCB4594. This is the first time the drug is being tested in humans. UCB4594 is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. It has been designed to work by targeting a protein called human leucocyte antigen G (HLA-G) that is found in high levels on some cancer cells. By attaching itself to this protein it may help the immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells.

The four main aims of the clinical trial are to find out:

1. The best dose of UCB4594 that can be given safely to participants in the trial.
2. What the side effects of UCB4594 are and how they can be managed.
3. What happens to UCB4594 inside the body and how it affects cancer cells.
4. Whether UCB4594 can cause cancer to shrink.

DRUG: UCB4594
Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of UCB4594, The RP2D will be the dose(s) of UCB4594 (in units of mg) selected for further evaluation and will be determined based on the maximum tolerated dose or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD) and all available safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic data (all modules - dose escalation \[module A\], monotherapy dose expansion \[module B\] and any combination modules \[module C\])., From Day 1 (date of first dose of UCB4594) up to Day 21.|Frequency of adverse events (AEs) considered at least possibly related to UCB4594 (up to 18 cycles)., AE data will be collected for UCB4594 (all modules) and/or other anti-cancer treatments (Module C), and the number of Grade 3, 4 and 5 AEs at least possibly related to UCB4594 (all modules) and/or other anti-cancer treatments (Module C) for up to 18 cycles (\~12 months) of dosing determined. AEs, including relatedness, seriousness and severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, will be assessed by the Investigator., From time of informed consent up to 12 months

AEs, including relatedness, seriousness and severity according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, will be assessed by the Investigator., AEs are collected from the date of informed consent until 6 months after the last dose of UCB4594.
What does the study involve?

This clinical trial is split into two phases.

Phase I (Module A) is the 'dose escalation' phase. This is where small groups of participants receive UCB4594 at a certain dose level starting with a low dose level. After reviewing the results obtained at each dose level, it will be decided whether or how much to increase the dose for the next group of participants. This part of the study aims to find the best dose to give that does not cause too many side effects.

Phase II is the 'dose expansion' phase. This starts when the dose escalation phase has worked out the best dose of UCB4594 to give. In this part of the trial UCB4594 will be given alone (Module B) or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs (Module C). This will allow us to find out more about how the drug is working and whether UCB4594 affects cancer. Details for Module C of the dose expansion phase will be added when the types of cancer and anti-cancer drugs are defined.

What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?

UCB4594 is a new drug that has never been given to humans before. Possible risks and benefits are based on laboratory tests and experience with similar drugs but there is not yet any information about the effects of UCB4594 in humans. Participants in the trial will be monitored closely to find out the effects of UCB4594.
