Prospective Observational Trial to Evaluate Quality of Life After Neoadjuvant or Definitive Chemoradiation in Patients With Esophageal Cancer
Prospective observational study to evaluate the Quality of life based on standardized EORTC questionaires as well as toxicities, functional and oncological outcomes in patients treated with neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation for esophageal Cancer.

Prospective observational study to evaluate the Quality of life based in patients treated with neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation for esophageal Cancer. QoL will be evaluated by standardized EORTC questionaires. Acute and late toxicity will be assessed according to CTCAE 4.03. Outcome measures will include local Control, distant Control, freedom from Treatment failure and overall survival. Correlations are planned between Patient- and physician-assessed functional Outcome.
