Melanoma Accuracy Study; Phase 2
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the process, accuracy and patient outcomes of pre-screening dermatology referrals in a clinical setting by a qualified nurse. The long-range goal of the proposed program is to improve referral wait times for patients to see a dermatologist for lesions suspicious for melanoma in comparison to normal standards of care in NS. If effective, this screening program would decrease wait times for those patients with lesions suspicious for melanoma providing earlier diagnosis and expedited treatment, and potentially reducing mortality rates.

Pre-screening lesions low to moderate risk for melanoma by a nurse, will facilitate a more timely diagnosis of melanoma., Pre-screening referrals to the Department of Dermatology by a qualified nurse for patients with lesions, low to moderate risk for melanoma, would facilitate a more timely diagnosis of melanoma, and appropriate triaging of benign lesions., 3 years
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the process, accuracy and patient outcomes of pre-screening dermatology referrals in a clinical setting by a qualified nurse using a dermatoscope, triaging suspicious lesions vs. benign lesions. The long-range goal of the proposed program is to improve referral wait times for patients to see a dermatologist for lesions suspicious for melanoma in comparison to normal standards of care in NS. If effective, this screening program would decrease wait times for those patients with lesions suspicious for melanoma providing earlier diagnosis and expedited treatment, and potentially reducing mortality rates.
