Phase Ia/Ib Study of RS-0139 in Patients with a Recurrent, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study designed as a multicenter, open label, two-step study to determine the optimum dose, pharmacokinetics, and the safety of RS-0139 in patients with a recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The research is planned as a two-step study (Phase Ia and phase Ib) and accelerated titration design (ATD) is used.
