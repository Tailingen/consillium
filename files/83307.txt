Study of Combination of Cetuximab and Radiotherapy Added to the Standard Treatment for Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of the combination between cetuximab and radiotherapy to the standard chemotherapy for resectable oesophageal cancer is safe and adds efficacy.
Resectable Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: cetuximab|RADIATION: radiotherapy to oesophageal tumour
pathological complete remission, determination of tumor residual cell content in surgical specimen, 1 month|Resectability rate defined as the number of patients abke to undergo resection after neo-adjuvant treatment, 6 months
Adverse events during neo-adjuvant treatment as defined by NIH CTCAE v3.0, 5 months|Complications in the post-operative period (defined as 4 weeks after surgery) that can be attributed to surgical procedures, 4 weeks|Progression free survival and overall survival, 5 years|Define local (locoregional lymphnode metastasis as defined by TNM classification/ malignant peritonitis/ solid masses within the anatomic region of the esophagus) vs distant metastases as first manifestation of recurrence, 5 years|The number of R0 resection determined by the pathologist, after surgery
This study aims at developing a novel strategy to optimize the treatment of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and gastro-oesophageal junctional tumors with curative intent. Surgery in combination with peri-operative chemotherapy, using the combination epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU, as defined by the recent MAGIC trial, results in 13% increase in 5-yr survival. To improve the outcome of patients with this disease we hypothesize that the addition of pre-operative combined cetuximab-radiotherapy (cetux-RT) treatment could improve the outcome of this patient category through better local control.
