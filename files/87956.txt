Phase 1-2 MAHCT w/ TCell Depleted Graft w/ Simultaneous Infusion Conventional and Regulatory T Cell
This study looks at giving specific types of immune cells, called regulatory T cells and conventional T cells, to patients with blood cancers who are receiving a stem cell transplant. These cells are added back to help the immune system recover and reduce complications after the transplant.

GvHD free Relapse free Survival (GRFS), GvHD-free is defined as no GvHD symptoms, and relapse free survival is defined as survival at 12 months without relapse., 12 months
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) was assessed as:

* Absolute neutrophil count \<500/ÂµL, to 28 day
* Cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reactions as CTCAE Grade 3 to 5
* Grade 3 to 4 acute GvHD. GvHD was staged as follows:

  * 1: Skin: rash \<25%. Liver: bilirubin (BIL) 2-3mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea (DIA) 500-1000 mL/day
  * 2: Skin: rash 25-50%. Liver: BIL 3-6mg/dL. Gut: DIA 1001-1500 mL/day
  * 3: Skin: rash \> 50%. Liver: BIL 6-15mg/dL. Gut: DIA \>1501-2000 mL/day
  * 4: Skin: generalized erythroderma. Liver: BIL \>15mg/dL. Gut: DIA \>2001 mL/day GvHD was graded as follows.
  * 1: Skin Stage 1-2; No Liver stage; No Gut stage
  * 2: Skin Stage 1-3 ; Liver Stage 1; +/- Gut Stage 1
  * 3: Skin Stage 2-3, Liver Stage 2-4; +/- Gut Stage 2-3
  * 4: Skin Stage 2-4; Liver Stage 2-4; +/- Gut Stage 2-4 The outcome is reported as the number of participants who received both Treg and Tcon cell infusions and had DLT events, per treatment level, a number without dispersion., 28 days|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) at 1 year was assessed as the number of participants per treatment level that received the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), and remained alive 12 months later, a number without dispersion., 1 year|Incidence and Severity of Chronic GvHD, Incidence and severity of chronic GvHD wil be assessed in participants who received the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

Stage of chronic GvHD was assessed as follows.

* Stage 1: Skin: rash \<25% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 2-3mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea 500-1000 mL/day
* Stage 2: Skin: rash 25-50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 3-6mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea 1001-1500 mL/day
* Stage 3: Skin: rash \> 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 6-15mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \>1501-2000 mL/day
* Stage 4: Skin: generalized erythroderma. Liver: bilirubin \>15mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \>2001 mL/day Grade of chronic GvHD was determined as follows.
* Grade 1: Skin Stage 1-2; No Liver stage; No Gut stage
* Grade 2: Skin Stage 1-3 ; Liver Stage 1; +/- Gut Stage 1
* Grade 3: Skin Stage 2-3, Liver Stage 2-4; +/- Gut Stage 2 to 3
* Grade 4: Skin Stage 2-4; Liver Stage 2-4; +/- Gut Stage 2 to 4 The outcome is reported as the number of participants by cGvHD grade and treatment level, a number without dispersion., 2 years|Incidence of Serious Infections, The outcome is reported as the number of serious infections per treatment level, in participants who received the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), a number without dispersion., 24 months|Concomitant Single-agent Immunosuppression, During Phase 2, stage 1, concomitant single-agent immunosuppression will be assessed as in participants receiving fresh Treg cells. The outcome is reported as number of such participants who received single-agent immunosuppression, by treatment level, a number without dispersion., 2 years
Primary Objectives:

* To determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of administration of several dose combinations of conventional T cells (Tcon) and regulatory T cells (Treg) in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with HLA matched donors (related or unrelated) using a T cell depleted graft \[CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells ("CD34+ HSPC")\], without immune suppression.
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of infused regulatory and conventional T cells in the matched donor setting
* To determine 1 year event free survival (EFS) post HCT

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the 1 year OS in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT with matched donors.
* To measure the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft vs host disease (GvHD)
* To measure incidence of serious infections
