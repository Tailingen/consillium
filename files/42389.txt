Study of CMAB009 to Treat KRAS Wild Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical response and safety of CMAB009 plus irinotecan versus irinotecan-only as second-line treatment after fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin failure in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: CMAB009 plus Irinotecan|DRUG: Irinotecan-only and sequential-CMAB009
Overall response rate, Tumor response was evaluated every 6 weeks and confirmed at least 4 weeks later, Time to progression, assessed up to two years
Progression-free Survival, The study was designed to evaluate the PFS as second end point, progression-free survival is defined as the period from date of randomization to date of disease progression, Time to progression, assessed up to two years
CMAB009 is a recombinant, human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds specifically to the extracellular domain of EGFR. It is composed of the Fv regions of a murine anti-EGFR antibody with human IgG1 heavy and k light chain constant regions and it is expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells. It has the same amino acid sequence as cetuximab (C225, ErbituxÂ®) , but it has slightly different abilities for glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, and it is developed by Shanghai Zhangjiang Biotechnology Limited Company and produced by Biomabs. Phase I study results suggest that CMAB009 showed well-tolerated safety profile and primary efficacy. This multicenter, open-label study was to determine whether adding CMAB009 to irinotecan increased the response rate and prolongs survival in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin.
