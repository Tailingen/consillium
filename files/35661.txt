EX02 CAR-T Cells for Relapsed and Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a early Phase 1 open-label, single-arm clinical study of EX02 CAR-T therapy for relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

Each participant will undergo leukapheresis after enrolment, receive treatment of the conditioning chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and an an intravenous infusion of CAR-T cells.

Each participant will proceed through the following study procedures:

* Screening
* Enrollment/Leukapheresis
* Conditioning chemotherapy
* CAR T treatment
* Post-treatment assessment
* Long-term follow-up
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|CAR-T
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T Cell Injection
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any adverse event that occurs within 90 days after the first injection of EX02 CAR-T, or that existed before treatment and worsened after treatment. All adverse events are graded according to CTCAE v4.0, classified, and then the incidence rate is calculated. In addition, according to the definition of this study, the occurrence of CAR-T cell therapy-specific CRS and ICANS, as well as their grading, management, and prognosis are evaluated, and the incidence rates are calculated separately, with specific patient details recorded., From the infusion (Day 0) to 3 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate=number of complete remission(CR) (including incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)) + number of partial remission (PR) / total number of treated cases, determined by the investigator according to the 2023 Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia)., From the infusion (Day 0) to Day 60
PFS, The time from the onset of leukocyte apheresis to the appearance of tumor progression or death, 12 months|OS, OS, The time between leukocyte apheresis and death from any cause, 12 months|ECOG scoring, Zubrod-ECOG-WHO method for assessing and comparing the physical status of patients before and after treatment, 2 months
