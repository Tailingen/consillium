PD:score 4(uptake moderately\>liver)/5(uptake markedly\>liver and/or new lesions) with increase in intensity of uptake from baseline; new fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid foci consistent with lymphoma at interim/EOT assessment; new FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma rather than another etiology; new/recurrent FDG-avid foci in bone marrow; an individual node/lesion must be abnormal with: LDi \>1.5 cm, increase by ≥50% from cross-product of LDi and perpendicular diameter (PPD) nadir, increase in LDi/shortest axis perpendicular to LDi from nadir, splenic length must increase by \>50% of extent of its prior increase beyond baseline. If no prior splenomegaly, increase must be ≥2 cm from baseline; new/recurrent splenomegaly; new or clear progression of pre-existing NMLs; new lesion; new/recurrent bone marrow involvement. OR is defined in outcome measure 3., From first documentation of CR or PR until first occurrence of PD or death from any cause or up to last date known alive in the study (maximum duration: 42.6 months)|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion date to the date of PD per Lugano classification or death from any cause or up to last date known alive in the study.

This study was intended to be a Phase 1/2. Enrollment was stopped prior to completion of Phase 1 portion of the study based on the sponsor's decision to end the program. No participants were enrolled in Phase 1 Cohort 5 and Phase 2.

After the study ends, participants who received an infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel and utomilumab will complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments in a separate Long-term Follow-up study, KT-US-982-5968 (NCT05041309).
