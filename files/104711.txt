A First-in-Human (FIH) Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of VVD-159642 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
A FIH study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of VVD-159642, a rat sarcoma viral oncogene-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (RAS-PI3Kα) inhibitor, as a single agent and in combination with either sotorasib or trametinib in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: VVD-159642|DRUG: Sotorasib|DRUG: Trametinib
Part 1: Incidence and Severity of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), From Day 1 to Day 21 of Cycle 1 [cycle length=21 days]|Part 2: Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Incidence and Severity of Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Signs, Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Incidence and Severity of Clinically Significant Changes in Laboratory Evaluations, Up to approximately 29 months
Part 1: Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) of VVD-159642 as a Single Agent, The RDE will be based on safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of VVD-159642 as a single agent during the dose escalation phase., Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of VVD-159642 as a Single Agent and in Combination with Sotorasib and Trametinib, The RP2D will be based on safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity of VVD-159642 as single agent, and in combination with sotorasib and trametinib during Part 2., Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from initial response of CR or PR to progressive disease or death, whichever comes first per RECIST version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the time of confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurs first per RECIST version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 29 months|Part 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR or PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST version 1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 29 months|Parts 1 and 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of VVD-159642 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Sotorasib and Trametinib, Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)|Parts 1 and 2: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of VVD-159642 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Sotorasib and Trametinib, Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)|Parts 1 and 2: Half-life (t1/2) of VVD-159642 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Sotorasib and Trametinib, Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)
