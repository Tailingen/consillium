3D Breast Ultrasound Elastography in Patients Under Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Breast Ultrasound Elastography is a complementary technique permitting a better characterization of breast lesions. 3D breast ultrasound elastography is a novel technique permitting a volumetric calculation of lesion stiffness. This could be particularly useful in patients with large breast tumors under pre-operative chemotherapy
Malignant Breast Tumours
DEVICE: 3D Ultrasound elastography by means of shear wave propagation into breast tissue
3D volumetric elasticity measurements, An utrafast shear wave imaging 3-plane acquisition provides several frames of breast lesion elasticity, that are reconstructed by means of a dedicated software thus permitting the direct volumetric elasticity measurements in kPa, 10min
3D breast ultrasound elastography provides volumetric lesion stiffness details in real time. 3D acquisition is compared to breast MRI in order to evaluate volume measurements calculated in ultrasound. Lesion elasticity is calculated in 3 planes with immediate reconstruction. The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the feasibility of this technique and compare the results to those of Breast MRI. For women receiving preoperative chemotherapy, this technique will be evaluated with regard to tumour shrinkage and lesion elasticity modifications under treatment.
