Dose Escalation Study of Teclistamab, a Humanized BCMA*CD3 Bispecific Antibody, in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and schedule assessed to be safe for Teclistamab and to characterize the safety and tolerability of Teclistamab at the RP2Ds.
Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: Teclistamab (IV)|DRUG: Teclistamab(SC)
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) are based on drug related adverse events and defined as any of the following events: hematological / non hematological toxicity of Grade 3 or higher., Up to Day 28|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 7 years and 3 months
Teclistamab Serum Concentrations, Concentration assessment will be done to evaluate the effect of Teclistamab., Up to 8 weeks|Number of Participants with Teclistamab Antibodies, Antibodies to Teclistamab will be assessed to evaluate potential immunogenicity., Up to 8 weeks|Preliminary Antitumor Activity of Teclistamab at the RP2D(s) in Part 2, Preliminary antitumor activity of Teclistamab will be done using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria., Up to End of Treatment (Approximately 91 days)|Biomarker Assessment, Biomarker assessment may be done to evaluate the effect of Teclistamab., Up to 8 weeks
The study will be conducted in 2 parts, separately for IV and SC administration: dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). It will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of Teclistamab administered to adult participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The overall safety of the study drug will be assessed by physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse event monitoring, and concomitant medication usage. Disease evaluations will include peripheral blood and bone marrow assessments at screening (performed within 28 days) and to confirm stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), or relapse from CR. The end of study (study completion) is defined as 2 years after the last participant in Part 3 has received his or her initial dose of teclistamab. Study record NCT04557098 is Phase 2 part of this study and study record NCT03145181 is Phase 1 part of this study.
