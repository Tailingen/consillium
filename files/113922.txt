The Prognostic Impact of Extracapsular Lymph Node Involvement in Ductal Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Extracapsular lymph node involvement (ECLNI) has been identified as a pathological variable associated with worse outcome in esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancer. No studies so far have studied its prognostic impact in ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma (DPAC). The goal of the investigators is to determine the prognostic value of ECLNI in a prospective consecutive series of 145 patients with DPAC, who underwent resection of their primary tumor between 1998 and 2005.
Pancreatic Neoplasms|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Pancreatic resection
Overall cancer-specific survival, 11/2007
Disease-free survival (DFS)& Correlation of ECLNI with other pathological variables, 11/2007
Presence and extent of extracapsular lymph node involvement (ECLNI) will be scored by reviewing all original pathological slides.

ECLNI is defined as metastatic adenocarcinoma extending through the nodal capsule into the perinodal fatty tissue.

Observers: 1 experienced board-certified GI pathologist, blinded for follow-up results.

Follow-up data are obtained by reviewing patients charts and by a telephone survey of the patient's GP/gastroenterologist in November 2007.

Statistical analysis:

* Common closing date: 1/11/2007
* Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Log-Rank, Wilcoxon)
* Cox logistic regression (uni/multivariate)
