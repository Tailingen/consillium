Single Arm Study of Induction Chemoradiotherapy Combined With Surgery in the Treatment of Locally Advanced SNMM
Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) is a very rare tumor, and SNMM is highly aggressive in nature, with a 5-year survival rate of about 20\~30%. Most patients underwent local recurrence and distant metastasis within one or two years of treatment.

There is no unified standard for the treatment of SNMM.The principle of treatment for surgically resectable stage T3 and partial T4 SNMM is complete resection of the primary tumor, combined with postoperative radiotherapy. While locally unresectable SNMM has a poorer prognosis, lower incidence, fewer clinical data have been reported.

This study will explore the role of preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy in improving the 2-year OS rate, loco-regional control rate and distant metastasis rate.
