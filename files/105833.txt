Effect of Anaesthesia on ER Stress in Cancer Patients
Investigate the change in endoplasmic reticulum stress after cancer surgery according to different anaesthetics including propofol and sevoflurane.
Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
DRUG: Propofol|DRUG: Sevoflurane
Change in endoplasmic reticulum stress, Change in endoplasmic reticulum stress, baseline, postoperative 1 hours and 24 hours
We hypothesize propofol and sevoflurane based anesthesia would show different pattern of endoplasmic reticulum stress after cancer surgery in patients with cancer
