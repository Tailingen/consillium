Identification of Early Markers of Response and Resistance to Trastuzumab
The study is a single arm prospective study, aiming at identifying biomarkers of early response to trastuzumab. It is a prognostic factor study recruiting all consecutive cases of HER-2 positive breast cancer eligible for a pre-operative treatment by trastuzumab, followed by breast conserving surgery. The investigators will study the association between the value of biomarkers measured at diagnosis and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response (partial and complete response) using a logistic regression (main analysis).
Untreated Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2(HER2)Positive Early Breast Cancer
OTHER: Blood test
Response rate, The response after 2 cycles of 3-weekly trastuzumab will be assessed as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST) 1.1 criteria and will be correlated with biomarkers., assessed after 6 weeks
Pathological complete response, According to Chevallier's classification, assessed after 6 weeks
