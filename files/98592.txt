Valproic Acid in Treating Patients With Kaposi's Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Valproic acid may help stop the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying valproic acid in treating patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: valproic acid
Toxicity-related discontinuation rate, 28 days|Lytic induction rate, 28 days|Clinical response rate, 28 days|Accelerated KS progression rate, 28 days
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the safety of valproic acid in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma.
* Determine the effects of this drug on human herpes virus 8 (KSHV) gene expression using polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine the effects of this drug on HIV, KSHV, and Epstein-Barr virus viral loads in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients.
* Determine clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

Patients receive oral valproic acid twice daily on days 1-28 followed by a drug taper over 2 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
