Nimotuzumab With Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Anal Canal Cancers
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using Nimotuzumab and radiation in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the anal canal in order to achieve a 65% local control rate with a better toxicity profile than the conventional treatment. Patients with high toxicity risks (HIV+ and fragile patients) will be selected for this study.
