Improving Decision-Making for Low Health Literate Prostate CA Patients
This study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether Healium (designed to target preference elicitation) is as efficacious as Healing Choices (a comprehensive education and decision tool) in improving outcomes for decision-making and emotional quality of life.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Healium
Decisional Conflict Scale, Decisional Conflict was measured with the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a well-validated scale consisting of 16 items that assess four dimensions: informed, clarity, uncertainty, and support. The response ranges are on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. To come up with a total score, the 16 items are summed, divided by 16 and multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict)., 6 weeks post-baseline|Decisional Conflict Scale, Decisional Conflict was measured with the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a well-validated scale consisting of 16 items that assess four dimensions: informed, clarity, uncertainty, and support.

Profile of Mood States- Short form, The Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a psychological rating scale used to assess transient, distinct mood states. It is made of subscales for depression, tension, fatigue, confusion, anger, vigor and esteem-related affect. It consists of 30 items, each measured on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" to "extremely". A total score is calculated by summing the totals for the negative scales and subtracting the totals for the positive scales., 6 weeks post-baseline|Profile of Mood States-Short form, The Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a psychological rating scale used to assess transient, distinct mood states.

Background: Elicitation of patients' preferences is an integral part of shared decision making, the recommended approach for prostate cancer decision making. However, existing decision aids for this population do not specifically focus on patients' preferences. Healium is a brief interactive web-based decision aid that aims to elicit patient's treatment preferences and is designed for a low health literate population. This study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether Healium (designed to target preference elicitation) is as efficacious as Healing Choices (a comprehensive education and decision tool) in improving outcomes for decision-making and emotional quality of life.

Method: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had not yet made a treatment decision were randomly assigned to the brief Healium intervention or Healing Choices, an extensive decision aid previously developed by our group that serves as a virtual information center on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Assessments were completed at baseline, 6-weeks and 3-months post-baseline, and included decisional outcomes (decisional conflict, satisfaction with decision, preparation for decision-making), and emotional quality of life (anxiety/tension and depression), along with demographics, comorbidities, and health literacy.
