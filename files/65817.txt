Cohort Study to Determine the Antitumor Activity of New CAR-macrophages in Breast Cancer Patients' Derived Organoids
Cell-based immune therapy using modified macrophages is a promising therapeutic approach in breast cancer. The objective of this cohort study is to collect tumor samples to develop patients' derived organoids to test the antitumor activity of newly developed CAR-macrophages. Other biological samples will be collected such as blood to analyze the host inflammatory status.
