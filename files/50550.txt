Irreversible Electroporation for Inoperable Hepatic and Pancreatic Malignancy
The objectives of this study are to study the safety and effect of IRE as a treatment for inoperable hepatic and pancreatic malignancy.
Hepatic Malignant Tumors|Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: IRE treatment|DEVICE: Ultrasound
Radiological assessment, CT scan will be performed. Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST criteria., 1 month
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a form of non-thermal local ablation for solid tumors, it induces apoptosis of tumor cells by creating irreversible damage in the cell membrane using electric current. The use of thermal ablation for tumors adjacent to major blood vessels is not advisable because the "heat-sink effect" owing to blood vessels render the thermal treatment not effective. On the other hand, application of thermal ablation to a tumor adjacent to blood vessels or bile ducts will cause thermal damage to these structures. It has been shown in animal experiments that IRE is effective in causing cell death while blood vessels, bile ducts, and nerves in the vicinity are preserved. Early evidence of clinical studies has shown that IRE is a reasonably safe and effective treatment for pancreatic and hepatic tumors.
