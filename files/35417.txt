Study Evaluating SC262 in Subjects With r/r Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (VIVID)
SC262-101 is a Phase 1 study to evaluate SC262 safety and tolerability, anti-tumor activity, cellular kinetics, immunogenicity, and exploratory biomarkers.
Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: SC262
Evaluate safety and tolerability of SC262, Safety and Tolerability: Proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, 24 months
Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of SC262, Preliminary anti-tumor activity: Proportion of subjects with an objective response (including partial response or complete response), 24 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of SC262, Cellular kinetics related peak (Cmax) in peripheral blood, 24 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of SC262, Cellular kinetics-related parameters evaluated by CAR T cell copy number, 24 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of SC262, Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) in peripheral blood, 24 months|Evaluate host immunogenicity to SC262, Incidence of anti-CD19-directed CAR antibodies, 24 months
This is an open-label, single arm, Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC262 administered intravenously (IV) following a standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in subjects with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who have received no more than 1 prior CD19-directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells (CAR T) cell therapy. This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Dose finding using a 3+3 design in subjects with NHL. Dose expansion to further evaluate safety and efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in subjects with Large B-Cell Lymphoma (LBCL).
