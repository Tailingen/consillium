Phase III, Randomized Trial: Lenalidomide vs Observation After Induction With Rituximab Followed by Cht and ASCT in MCL Adult Patients
A phase III multicenter, randomized study with Lenalidomide (RevlimidÂ®) maintenance versus observation after intensified induction regimen containing rituximab followed by high dose chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation as first line treatment in adult patients with advanced Mantle Cell Lymphoma: IIL study (MCL0208).
MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA
DRUG: Lenalidomide
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause.therapy to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) after completion of first-line high-dose chemotherapy additioned with rituximab and followed by ASCT in adult patients with MCL who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). PFS is defined according to Cheson et al (JCO, 2007) as the time from randomisation until lymphoma progression or death as a result of any cause., 30 months from randomisation
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause, 36 months from randomisation (42 months from accrual)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as the time between the date of enrolment and the date of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause., 36 months from accrual|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS will be defined in CR patients as the time between the date of randomization and the date of relapse or death as a result of lymphoma or acute toxicity of treatment according to the Cheson 2007, 30 months from randomisation (36 months from accrual)|Event-free survival (EFS), EFS will be defined in CR patients as the time between the date of randomization and the date of failure of treatment or death as a result of any cause according to the Cheson 2007, 30 months from randomisation (36 months from accrual)|Complete Response (CR) Rate, Proportion of CR according to the Cheson 2007 response criteria, up to 3 months from accrual|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to the Cheson 2007 response criteria, up to 3 months from accrual|Incidence of grade 3 or higher Toxicity measured by CTCAE v.4 at any time during therapy and follow-up., Toxicity amount of grade 3 or more as CTCAE, 30 months from accrual|Quality of life, EORTC QLQC30 questionnaire, baseline, 6-12-18-24 months from randomisation
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study to determine the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide as maintenance therapy versus observation in patients with MCL in complete or partial remission after first line intensified and high-dose chemotherapy additioned with rituximab and followed by ASCT. This study will be conducted in three phases: a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase and a Follow-up Phase
