A Randomized Trial of Avastin + Gemcitabine + 5-Fluorouracil (5FU)/Folinic Acid Versus Avastin + Oxaliplatin + 5FU/Folinic Acid in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of the study is to describe the tumor response rates for the two regimens being studied, and to determine how long patients live after receiving the treatment, how long patients are without return of their disease after they receive treatment, and how long the response they get from the treatment lasts. The amount and type of side effects/toxicities of each regimen will also be evaluated. The regimen including Oxaliplatin + 5FU/Folinic Acid is a current standard of care.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: avastin|DRUG: 5FU/folinic acid|DRUG: oxaliplatin
Tumor Response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria., baseline to measured progressive disease (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)
Time to Progressive Disease, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first date of disease progression. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to disease under study, whichever comes first (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause., randomization to the first date of progression or death from any cause (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death. For patients who are alive, overall survival is censored at the last contact., randomization to the date of death from any cause (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., date of first response until the first date of documented progression or death from any cause (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)
Tumor Response - Avastin Subgroup, Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria., baseline to measured progressive disease (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Time to Progressive Disease - Avastin Subgroup, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first date of disease progression. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to disease under study, whichever comes first (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Progression-Free Survival - Avastin Subgroup, Defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause., randomization to the first date of progression or death from any cause (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Survival at 12 Months and 24 Months - Avastin Subgroup, Percentage of participants who were alive at 12 months and 24 months., randomization to the date of death from any cause (up to 24 months)|Toxicity - Avastin Subgroup, Includes all Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities and all non-hematologic toxicities with either \>=1 Grade 4 or \>=2 Grade 3 adverse events, every cycle (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)|Duration of Response - A+FOLFOX4 - Avastin Subgroup, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., date of first response until the first date of documented progression or death from any cause (every 7-8 weeks for 2 cycles, monthly for 3 months, every other month for 6 months, then every 3 months up to 4.4 years)
