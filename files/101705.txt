This study is an open, multicenter dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of APL-102 and obtain the relevant data of APL-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the dose escalation stage, based on the incidence of dose limited toxicity (DLT) and adverse event (AE), explore and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and phase II recommended dose (RP2D). After RP2D and administration protocol are determined, an extended study will be conducted on 6-10 subjects to further evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of APL-102.
