Rivogenlecleucel Donor Lymphocyte Immunotherapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Blood Cancers After Stem Cell Transplant
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of rivogenlecleucel, and how well it works, in treating patients with blood cancer that has come back (recurrent) after stem cell transplant. Donor T-cell therapy (rivogenlecleucel) may help control transplant-related infections after stem cell transplant.

Global incidence of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) requiring rimiducid treatment, Will be reported, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The global incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (requiring rimiducid or not) will also be reported., 1 year after last rivogenlecleucel infusion|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of BPX-501, Will be reported, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The specific DLTs will be reported descriptively., 56 days after last rivogenlecleucel or rimiducid infusion (whichever is later)
Time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, Will be reported with cumulative incidence curves (with death as a competing risk), for all donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) combined and for each separate dose level., 1 year|Time to grade II-IV acute GVHD, Will be reported with cumulative incidence curves (with death as a competing risk), for all DLIs combined and for each separate dose level., 1 year|Disease response, Descriptive, due to the expected heterogeneity of enrolled subjects, 1 year|Survival, Descriptive, due to the expected heterogeneity of enrolled subjects, 1 year
This is a dose-escalation study of rivogenlecleucel.

Each subject may receive up to 3 doses of rivogenlecleucel intravenously (IV), at intervals of no less than 28 days. Subjects meeting protocol-specified severity criteria for acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), prolonged aplasia, or encephalopathy will be treated with rimiducid infusion(s).

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and then annually for 10 years.
