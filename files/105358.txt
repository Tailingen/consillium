Mother - Daughter Initiative (MDI) in Cervical Cancer Prevention
The Mother-Daughter Initiative (MDI) will test the feasibility and acceptability of a strategy to deliver comprehensive cervical cancer prevention services in Thailand and the Philippines by integrating the HPV vaccine for girls ages 9-13 into already successful screening and treatment programs for mothers.
Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HPV Vaccine (Gardasil)
Determine the population coverage of HPV vaccination of girls aged 9-13 offered within the context of cervical cancer screening and treatment of mothers, The aim of the study to assess whether we can fully vaccinate (all 3 doses),50% of girls aged 9 -13 in the participating districts, in an 18-month period. This corresponds to 4000 girls in Thailand and 4000 in Phillipines. The study will seek to undertand if this level of population coverage (50%), can be achieved through encouraging women that recive cervical cancer screening to bring in their daughters or relatives for vaccination., 18 months
Assess mothers' acceptability of having their daughters receive the full course of HPV vaccine after mothers receive screening and treatment services for cervical pre-cancer, Data on mothers knowledge of the vaccine, and intention to have their daughters vaccinated will be collected for a period of 1 year (or when the target number of 700 women/guardians is reached, whatever comes first).

Data will be collected on:

* Proportion of women with daughters who intend to vaccinate their daughters.
* Proportion of daughters of screened mothers who return to receive the vaccine.
* Proportion of girls who receive the first vaccine dose and are brought to the facility by a guardian/mother who did NOT recieve cervical cancer screening, 1 year|Inform future programs that aim to introduce the HPV vaccine in the context of secondary screening for cervical cancer by determining the factors related to screened women bringing daughters for HPV vaccination and the costs of vaccine introduction, Programmatic data will be collected for the duration of the project, including but not limited to:

* Cost required to implement the program
* Logistics required to ensure supply and appropriate maintenance of vaccine
* Human resources required to effectively adminster the vaccine as part of routine services.
* Key communication and outreach messages that effectively educate the community, 2 years
