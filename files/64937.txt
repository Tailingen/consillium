A Study of Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine in Unresectable Metastatic Hepatocellular Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well giving oxaliplatin and capecitabine together works in treating patients with liver cancer.
Liver Cancer|Hepatocellular Cancer
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 2 years
Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving these drugs together may kill more tumor cells.
