A Clinical Trial of TQB3117 Tablets in Patients With Advanced Malignant Cancer
The study is divided into two phases: dose escalation and dose extension. The dosing regimens include a single-dose study and a multiple-dose study. It adopts a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial design, where patients with advanced malignant cancer are selected to orally take TQB3117 tablets. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TQB3117 tablets in patients.
Advanced Malignant Cancer
DRUG: TQB3117 tablets
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT refers to occurrence of drug-related adverse events within the first treatment cycle after subjects receive single-dose or multiple-dose treatment, as defined by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 toxicity assessment criteria., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to evaluate RP2D of TQB3117 tablets in adult patients with advanced malignant cancer., Baseline up to 24 months
