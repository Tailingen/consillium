Sonoguided-microwave Uterine Myoma
This study mainly evaluates the resolution of uterine fibroids by microwave ablation. The medical equipment used is Ke Hui. "The Ampening ablation system is a percutaneous surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, it is directly ablated and soft, including problems that cannot be solved by partial or complete tissue ablation. "Hydrogen is used. If the expected range of ablation can be found, there is no need to wait for 3 to 6 months for ablation slowly like Haifu surgery. A fast, small, high-quality treatment that provides reference for medical treatment and helps doctors choose the most suitable treatment.

DEVICE: "Covidien" Emprint Ablation System with Thermosphere Technology
Uterine myoma ablation, The ablation range of fibroids can be reduced by 50%, measured by MRI cubic centimeter volume., 1 momth|Improve bleeding, The hemoglobin changes before and 3 months after the operation are used to evaluate the improvement of patients' bleeding problems., 3 momths
Reduce days in hospital, Reduce the number of hospitalization days for patients to be less than or equal to 4 days., 6 momths
A collection of 20 women suffering from uterine fibroids were treated with microwave fibroids ablation for symptoms of uterine fibroids, and they could be discharged the next day or two days after surgery. Schedule return visits and routine blood tests according to clinical needs, and follow up with ultrasound and questionnaires during routine return visits (1, 3, and 6 months) after surgery. In the third month after surgery, there will be another imaging report. Magnetic resonance imaging and blood tests are used to compare the changes of patients' fibroids, their physiological recovery status, and the degree of improvement in their quality of life.
