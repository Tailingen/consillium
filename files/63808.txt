Number of participants with complete histologic response, Number of participants who have complete histologic response following topical artesunate ointment, 18 weeks
Number of participants who have achieved viral clearance, Number of participants who achieve clearance of HPV genotypes present at screening. These genotypes become undetectable over the study window., Week 18|Number of participants who show partial response, Number of participants with documented partial response following topical artesunate, Week 18|Number of participants who have durable response, Number of participants with documented complete response who do not have recurrence of their vulvar HSIL over the study window, Week 18|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Number of participants who report artesunate-related serious adverse events, 8 weeks
Eligible participants in this study are randomized 2:1 to receive either artesunate or placebo ointment for the treatment of vulvar HSIL. Both groups receive four 5-day cycles of topical ointment, at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. Dosing visits may be done in person or as telehealth (ointment may be shipped directly to the patient). Participants are followed closely with vulvar examinations or colposcopies at weeks 8, 18, 6-months and 12-months.
