A Study of Erwinaze Administered Intravenously in Patients Who Had an Allergy to Frontline Asparaginase Therapy
This study will utilize Erwinaze via intravenous administration in patients between the ages of 1 and 30 who have experienced an allergy to their frontline therapy. The study will determine the proportion of patients with 2 day nadir serum asparaginase activity levels that are \>0.1 IU/mL during the first 2 weeks of treatment with 3 times per week IV dosing.

DRUG: asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi
Two Day Nadir Serum Asparaginase Activity (NSAA) Level, To report the mean 2 day NSAA levels (48 hour levels taken after the 5th dose) that are \> or = 0.1 IU/mL during the first 2 weeks of treatment with 3-times per week intravenous dosing of Erwinase at 25,000 IU/m2/dose., 48 hours post-dose 5
Proportion of Participants Achieving Sustained NSAA Values of >0.1 U/mL at 48 Hours, To report the proportion of participants achieving 2 day NSAA levels (48 hour levels taken after the 5th dose) that are \> or = 0.1 IU/mL during the first 2 weeks of treatment with 3-times per week intravenous dosing of Erwinase at 25,000 IU/m2/dose., 48 hours post-dose 5|Three Day NSAA Level, To report the mean 3 day NSAA levels (72 hour levels taken after the 6th dose) that are \> or = 0.1 IU/mL in the first 2 weeks of treatment with 3 times per week intravenous dosing of Erwinase at 25,000 IU/m2/dose., 72 hours post-dose 6|Proportion of Participants Achieving Sustained NSAA Values of >0.1 U/mL at 72 Hours, To report the proportion of participants achieving 3 day NSAA levels (72 hour levels taken after the 6th dose) that are \> or = 0.1 IU/mL in the first 2 weeks of treatment with 3 times per week intravenous dosing of Erwinase at 25,000 IU/m2/dose., 72 hours post-dose 6|Nadir Serum Asparaginase Activity Over Time, To describe the NSAA over time in participants with ALL/Lymphoblastic Lymphoma who have/had developed hypersensitivity to native E. coli asparaginase, Pegaspargase or Calaspargase pegol and are receiving intravenous Erwinaze 3 times per week for a prolonged duration (4-30 weeks)., 4 weeks to 30 weeks
