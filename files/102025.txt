Adaptation of the STEPPING ON Fall Prevention Program for Older Adults Receiving Cancer Therapy
Chronic disease self-management is the ability of the individual, in conjunction with family, community and healthcare professionals to manage symptoms, treatments, lifestyle changes and psychosocial, cultural and spiritual consequences associated with a chronic condition. Self-management strategies have been successfully used in supportive care and survivorship in oncology. Stepping On, a multi-component program using a small-group learning environment, reduces falls by 31%. It empowers participants with knowledge about fall-risk, exercise, medications and environmental hazards to self-manage their risk of falls over 7 weeks of educational sessions, followed by a home visit. The research in this proposal will yield the adaptation of the effective group-education-based fall-prevention intervention Stepping On, tailored to cancer patients, feasible for testing in a multi-institutional trial, and ultimately scalable in the oncology setting.

Percent of participants consented among approached potential participants, -The Pilot Waves will only be looked at for this outcome measure, Completion of accrual (approximately 18 months)|Fall rate during participation, -The Pilot Waves will only be looked at for this outcome measure, Completion of participation (approximately 20 weeks)|Changes in score in the Falls-Efficacy Scale - International as measured by fear-of-falling, -The Pilot Waves will only be looked at for this outcome measure, Completion of participation (approximately 20 weeks)|Behavior change intention in preventing falls, * The Pilot Waves will only be looked at for this outcome measure
* To measure behavior change intention in preventing falls the participant will be asked 24 questions about how they prevent falls. Answers to choose from include never, sometimes, often, always, or does not apply., Completion of participation (approximately 20 weeks)|Change in Pain Patient Reported Outcome (PRO), -5 questions to ask participant about their pain levels and how the pain interfered with their daily lives, answers range from not at all to very much, Completion of participation (approximately 20 weeks)|Measure changes in balance waves, -The Gait \& Balance Waves will only be looked at for this outcome measure, Baseline and 1 month after completion of participation (approximately 20 weeks)|Measure changes in gait waves, -The Gait \& Balance Waves will only be looked at for this outcome measure, Baseline and 1 month after completion of participation (approximately 20 weeks)
