A Study of Efgartigimod PH20 SC in Children Between 2 and Less Than 18 Years of Age with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
The purpose of this study is to measure the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of efgartigimod PH20 SC in pediatric participants with gMG aged 2 to \<18 years. The primary goal is to confirm an appropriate dose of efgartigimod PH20 SC for pediatric patients using PK and PD results from this study. Participants will receive injections of efgartigimod PH20 SC and will be monitored for safety until the end of the study. At the end of the follow-up period, eligible participants may roll over to an open-label extension (OLE) study.

The participants will be in the study for up to 14 weeks.
