Efficacy and Safety of Zanidatamab With Standard-of-care Therapy Against Standard-of-care Therapy for Advanced HER2-positive Biliary Tract Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zanidatamab plus CisGem (Cisplatin and Gemcitabine) with or without the addition of a programmed death protein 1/ligand-1 (PD-1/L1) inhibitor (physician's choice of either Durvalumab or Pembrolizumab, where approved under local regulations) as first line of treatment for participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive biliary tract cancer.
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Zanidatamab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Durvalumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS) in participants with Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ tumors, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression, or death from any cause., Up to 52 months
Overall survival (OS) in participants with IHC 3+ tumors, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death, due to any cause., Up to 68 months|Progression Free Survival for all participants, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression, or death from any cause., Up to 68 months|OS for all participants, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death, due to any cause., Up to 68 months|Number of participants achieving Confirmed objective response rate (cORR), Confirmed objective response rate is defined as achieving a confirmed best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), Up to 68 months|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the first objective response (CR or PR) to documented Progressive Disease (PD) or death, from any cause., Up to 68 months|Number of Patients reporting Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Up to 68 months|Maximum serum concentration of Zanidatamab, Up to 68 months|Number of participants who develop Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to Zanidatamab, Up to 68 months|Time to definitive deterioration (TDD) for participants with IHC 3+ tumors in patient-reported Physical Functioning (PF) domain score as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30, TDD is defined as the time from randomization to the first confirmed clinical meaningful deterioration or death. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30) final scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores reflect better functioning, Up to 68 months|TDD for all participants in patient-reported PF domain score as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30, TDD is defined as the time from randomization to the first confirmed clinical meaningful deterioration or death. EORTC QLQ-C30 final scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores reflect better functioning., Up to 68 months|TDD for participants with IHC 3+ tumors in patient-reported symptoms scores as measured by the EORTC QLQ-BIL21 (Pain, Jaundice, Abdominal Pain and Pruritis), TDD is defined as the time from randomization to the first confirmed clinical meaningful deterioration or death. EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder Cancer module (QLQ-BIL21) (Pain, Jaundice, Abdominal Pain, and Pruritis) final scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores reflect better functioning., Up to 68 months|TDD for all participants in patient-reported symptoms scores as measured by the EORTC QLQ-BIL21 (Pain, Jaundice, Abdominal Pain, and Pruritis), TDD is defined as the time from randomization to the first confirmed clinical meaningful deterioration or death.
