An Open-Label Study of INV-1120 As a Single Agent and in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Adult Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Phase 1, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the MTD of INV-1120 and RP2D, and to assess the DLT of INV-1120 as a single agent or in the combination with pembrolizumab. The safety, tolerability, and PK of INV-1120 as a single agent or in the combination with pembrolizumab will be assessed in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

Phase 1a: Determine DLTs and RP2Ds in INV-1120, To evaluate dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of INV-1120 in patients with advanced cancer and to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), 12 months|Phase 1b: Determine RP2D and DLTs of the combination of INV-1120 and pembrolizumab, To determine RP2D, and to assess DLT of the combination of INV-1120 and pembrolizumab administered to adult patients with advanced solid tumors., 12 months
Phase 1a: Determine the PK using AUC of INV-1120, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) using AUC of INV-1120 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses, 12 months|Phase 1b: Determine the PK using AUC of INV-1120, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) using AUC of INV-1120 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses in combination with pembrolizumab, 12 months|Phase 1a: Determine the PK using Cmax of INV-1120, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) using Cmax of INV-1120 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses, 12 months|Phase 1b: Determine the PK using Cmax of INV-1120, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) using Cmax of INV-1120 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses in combination with pembrolizumab, 12 months|Characterize investigator defined response overall response rate (ORR) etc using RECIST v1.1, To characterize Investigator defined ORR, PFS and DOR using RECIST v1.1, 12 months|Phase 1a: Characterize the safety of INV-1120 as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To analyze the safety profile of INV-1120 as a single agent by AE, clinical lab test results, ECG and Vital signs changes, 12 months|Phase 1b: Characterize the safety of the combination of INV-1120 and pembrolizumab as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To analyze the safety profile of the combination of INV-1120 and pembrolizumab by AE, clinical lab test results, ECG and Vital signs changes, 12 months
Phase 1a: Characterize investigator defined ORR using iRECIST, To characterize investigator defined ORR using iRECIST, 12 months|Phase 1a: Characterize investigator defined PFS using iRECIST, To characterize investigator defined PFS using iRECIST, 12 months|Phase 1a: Characterize investigator defined DOR using iRECIST, To characterize investigator defined DOR using iRECIST, 12 months
Phase 1a: it is anticipated that approximately 36 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation phase as a single agent of the study. Additionally, up to 9 additional patients may be enrolled to confirm the safety of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Phase 1b: approximately 36-42 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation and de-escalation phases in the combination with pembrolizumab. One or more combination dose levels that could represent the combination RP2D will be expanded to a total of 12-15 patients to confirm safety and tolerability of the combination.
