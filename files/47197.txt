A Prospective Cohort Study of Proton and Photon Therapy for Left-sided Breast Cancer.
The goal of this study is to investigate the differences in toxicity and efficacy between proton and photon hypofractionated radiotherapy following lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. What is the difference in the incidence of radiation-related grade 2 or higher adverse events within two years following proton versus photon therapy after breast-conserving surgery?
2. What is the difference in the incidence of radiation-related grade 2 or higher adverse events within two years following proton versus photon therapy after mastectomy?
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Proton radiotherapy|RADIATION: Photon radiotherapy
The rate of patients who develop radiation-associated toxicity (≥ 2 degree) in 2 years, We will record the incidence of ≥ 2 degree radiation-associated toxicity, such as breast or chest wall oedema, dermatitis, breast pain, esophagitis, rib fracture, radiation pneumonia and hypothyroidism and so on. The incidence of all the above is the primary outcome., Until 2 years after radiotherapy
Late toxicities after 2 years of radiotherapy, Evaluation of long-term adverse effects (greater than 2 years) after radiotherapy (including radiation pulmonary fibrosis, radiation skin fibrosis, rib fracture, brachial plexus injury, upper limb lymphedema, heart injury, hypothyroidism, etc.), Until 5 years after radiotherapy|Locoregional recurrence (LRR), To estimate and compare the rate of local recurrence between the proton and photon arms, Until 5 years after treatment.|Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival, defined as number of days from surgery until the first occurrence of local recurrence, distant metastases, tumor-related death, death without prior progression, or end of follow-up., Until 5 years after treatment.|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival time, defined as number of days from date of initial diagnosis until death or end of follow-up., Until 5 years after treatment.|uality of life, as measured by EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaires-B23, Impact on quality of life will be assessed by EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaires-B23；Which include functional domains, global health status and symptom scales., During last week of radiotherapy, at 3 months post radiotherapy and 1,3 and 5 years post radiotherapy|Cosmetic outcome, photographic cosmetic scores by BCCT.core, Until 5 years after treatment.
