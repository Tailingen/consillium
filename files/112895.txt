Potential Improvements in the Pre-emergency Department Care for Cancer Patients
The goal of this single center prospective cross-sectional study is to identify the facilitators and barriers in the course of the disease that starts when symptoms first arise until patients with solid and hematologic malignancies arrive in the emergency department (ED). The main question it aims to answer are: Is there a potential relation between the lag-time and the ED length of stay (LOS) and the chance of admission. Participants will be asked to participate in a one-time interview, that focusses on the pre-admission process.

The goal of this single center prospective cross-sectional study is to identify the facilitators and barriers in the course of the disease that starts when symptoms first arise until patients with solid and hematologic malignancies arrive in the emergency department (ED). The main question it aims to answer are: Is there a potential relation between the lag-time and the emergency department length of stay and the chance of admission. Participants will be asked to participate in a one-time interview, that focusses on the pre-admission process. The interview focuses on several parts of the (pre-)admission process: The first part is regarding the timeline that led to an ED visit. The investigators will establish, when and which symptoms were first detected. The second part are regarding the number and type of health care workers that were contacted before visiting the ED. The third part will be about the actions that were taken before the ED visit.
