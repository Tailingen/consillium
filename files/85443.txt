Axillary Node Dissection w or w/o LVB in Node Positive Breast Cancer Patients
Lymphedema is a devastating complication of breast cancer surgery that decreases the quality of life of up to 40% of breast cancer survivors. Most lymphedema in breast cancer patients is because lymphatics shared between the axilla and the arm are sacrificed during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) surgery, which removes an average of 15 lymph nodes in node positive patients. CCF's breast cancer plastic microvascular surgeons and breast surgical oncologists have collaborated to refine a surgical technique known as LVB that may be used either as a preventive measure (prophylactic LVB) or as a therapeutic intervention (therapeutic LVB). Lymphatic reconstruction with LVB may be an improvement to the current standard of care for node positive breast cancer patients undergoing ALND.
