Dentures and Dental Implants in Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery for Mouth Cancer
RATIONALE: The use of dentures and dental implants may help maintain chewing and speaking ability following surgery to remove tumors in the mouth.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dentures and dental implants in maintaining the ability to chew and speak in patients undergoing surgery for mouth cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: Implant
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether conventional or implant supported dental prostheses and current surgical reconstructive procedures restore oral function and quality of life to pre-cancer surgery levels in patients with early oral cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients complete a series of objective and subjective functional tests, questionnaires, and baseline examinations. Within 1-5 days, patients undergo the composite resection, including reconstructive surgery for the mandibulectomy group. Patients in the maxillectomy group receive an immediate maxillary surgical obturator. Approximately 6 weeks after ablative surgery, some patients receive radiotherapy for 5-7 weeks.

Patients receive 2-4 implants at 12-16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy or 8-16 weeks after ablative surgery. Patients then receive conventional dentures at 4-22 weeks after implant surgery. Implants are exposed during 27-48 weeks after placement and abutments connected for fabricating dental prostheses. Approximately 8 weeks are needed to fabricate the implant supported prosthesis.

Patients complete quality of life and other questionnaires prior to and at 8-21 weeks after surgery, 16 weeks after conventional denture insertion, and then 16 weeks after implant supported prosthesis insertion.

Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients (22 requiring maxillectomy and 40 requiring mandibulectomy) will be accrued for this study within 42 months.
