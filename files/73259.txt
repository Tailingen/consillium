Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Cetuximab Followed by Surgery, Docetaxel, and Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving docetaxel and cetuximab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy together with cetuximab followed by surgery, docetaxel and cetuximab works in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Docetaxel|PROCEDURE: Surgery|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Proportion of Patients With Pathologic Complete Response, After neoadjuvant therapy, participants underwent surgical resection. The excised tumor was examined by a pathologist. A pathologic complete response is defined as the absence of any histopathologic evidence of tumor in the resected esophageal and nodal tissue specimen., At time of surgery (which occurred 63 to 91 days after study entry)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with OX/5-FU/radiotherapy (RT) plus cetuximab in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

Secondary

* To evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with OX/5-FU/RT plus cetuximab in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of adjuvant therapy comprising cetuximab and docetaxel in these patients.
* To carry out exploratory studies to determine if activity of this regimen correlates with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related genetic and pathway activation markers and circulating endothelial and tumor cells.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29, cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, and 5-FU IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-35. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33. Patients then proceed to surgery.
* Surgery: Patients undergo surgical resection within 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab. Patients with an R0 or R1 resection proceed to adjuvant therapy. Patients whose tumors have not been completely resected or who have metastatic disease discontinue protocol therapy and receive further therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.
* Adjuvant therapy: Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3-5 years.
