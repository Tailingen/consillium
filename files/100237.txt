A Dose-Finding and Efficacy Study of Venetoclax, CC-486, and Obinutuzumab in Follicular Lymphoma
This study focuses on finding a safe and tolerable dose for a three-drug regimen that combines venetoclax (Venclexta Ⓡ), CC-486 (also known as oral azacitidine) and obinutuzumab (Gazyva Ⓡ) to treat cancer participants who have minimally pretreated follicular lymphoma and have experienced disease progression despite trying previous cancer therapies. If a safe and tolerable drug dose can be found in the first phase of the study, doctors leading the study will launch a second phase of the study within an expansion cohort. Participants in this expansion cohort will receive the dose established in the first phase of the study to determine the efficacy of the regimen/ established dose. Participants in the expansion cohort will also receive the same study drugs from the first phase of the study, but in a different order/combination (first pairing the two oral drugs, CC-486 and venetoclax, then adding the third drug, obinutuzumab to treatment). The end goal of this research is to establish a new chemotherapy-sparing treatment option for patients with follicular lymphoma that is just as effective (or better) than current standard of care options.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: CC-486
Phase I Objective: Maximum Tolerated Dose of Venetoclax and CC-486 As Assessed by Rate of Reported Dose Limiting Toxicities (Side Effects) According to CTCAE Criteria Version 5, The maximum tolerated dose of venetoclax and CC-486 in patients with minimally pre-treated follicular lymphoma. Doctors leading the study will find the maximum tolerated dose by assessing the rate of serious side effects (known as "dose limiting toxicities") according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) for Adverse Events Version 5., 336 days (the duration of phase 1 treatment)|Phase I Objective: Number of Participants Who Discontinue Venetoclax, CC-486 and Obinutuzumab Regimen Due to Reported Side Effects as Assessed by CTCAE Criteria Version 5, The number of participants who discontinue the three-drug regimen of venetoclax, CC-486, and obinutuzumab during phase 1 of the study due to serious side effects (grade 3/4) as assessed by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) for Adverse Events Version 5., 336 days (duration of phase 1 treatment)|Phase I Objective: Number of Participants Taking Venetoclax, CC-486 and Obinutuzumab Who Report Serious Side Effects As Assessed by CTCAE Version 5, The number of participants who report serious side effects in response to the three-drug regimen of venetoclax, CC-486 and obinutuzumab during phase 1 treatment. Serious side effects will be defined as grade 3/ 4 according to criteria set by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5., 336 days (duration of phase 1 treatment)].|4. Phase II Objective: Number of Participants Who Do Not Show Signs of Cancer After Taking CC-486 and Obinutuzumab (Oral Therapies) As Assessed by PET/CT Whole Body Scan (Based on Lugano Criteria), The number of participants who do not show detectable signs of cancer (also known as "complete response") after taking combined CC-486 and obinutuzumab as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET scan) based on Lugano criteria., 336 days (duration of phase 1 treatment)
Phase II Objective: The Length of Time That Half of Participants in the Expansion Group Are Alive After Receiving Phase 1 Dose of Treatment As Assessed at End of Study and 5 Years After Study is Complete, The length of time that half of the participants in the expansion/phase II study group are alive after taking the maximum tolerated dose established in the first phase of the study. This time, also known as "median overall survival," will be documented at the end of the study and five years after study completion., 55 months (at study conclusion) and 5 years after end of study|Phase II Objective: The Average Length of Time Participants Treated at Phase 1 Dose Live With Follicular Lymphoma Without Symptoms of Cancer Worsening As Assessed at End of Study and 5 Years After Study is Complete, The average length of time study participants in the expansion/phase II group of the study live with follicular lymphoma, but it does not get worse (also known as "median progression-free survival" of participants). This time will be assessed at the conclusion of study and five years after study completion., 55 months (at study conclusion) and 5 years after end of study|Phase II Objective: Number of Participants Who Do Not Show Signs of Follicular Lymphoma After Venetoclax and CC-486 As Assessed by PET Scan (Based on Lugano Criteria), Number of participants in phase II group who do not show signs of follicular lymphoma after receiving three cycles of venetoclax + CC-486 (combined oral therapy). This will be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET scan) based on Lugano criteria., 84 days (three cycles of combined oral therapies venetoclax and CC-486 oral|Phase II Objective: Number of Participants Who Do Not Show Signs of Follicular Lymphoma 30 Months After Treatment As Assessed by PET Scan (Based on Lugano Criteria, Number of participants who do not show signs of follicular lymphoma (also known as "complete response rate") 30 months after starting treatment. This will be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET scan) based on Lugano criteria., 30 months and 336 days (treatment period); approximately 3.4 years
