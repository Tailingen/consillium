Chiglitazar Sodium Combined With Venetoclax and Azacitidine (CVA) for the Treatment of R/R AML
To investigate the safety and efficacy of the CVA regimen, composed of Chiglitazar Sodium in combination with Venetoclax and Azacitidine, in the treatment of patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Relapse|Refractory AML
DRUG: CVA
Complete remission rate (CR), The absolute neutrophil count is ≥1.0 × 10\^3/μL, the platelet count is ≥1.0 × 10\^5/μL, independent of red blood cell transfusions, and the percentage of bone marrow blasts is \<5%. There are no circulating bone marrow blasts and blasts with Auer rods in the peripheral blood; no extramedullary disease is present., Up to 36 months|Complete Remission with Incomplete Count Recovery (CRi), Meeting all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia \<1.0 × 10\^3/μL (1000/μL) or thrombocytopenia \<1.0 × 10\^5/μL (100,000/μL). Dependence on red blood cell (RBC) transfusions is also defined as CRi., Up to 36 months|Partial remission rate (PR), Meets all hematological criteria for CR, but the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspirate sample has decreased by at least 50%, reaching between 5% and 25%., Up to 36 months
1. Sogletanib 48mg per dose, once daily; Venetoclax 400mg per dose, once daily for 4 weeks; Azacitidine 100mg, once daily, days 1-7. 28 days/cycle, at least 2 cycles.
2. The drug concentration of Venetoclax will be tested one week after oral administration, and the dose will be adjusted according to the concentration.
3. After 2 treatment courses, patients with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) may receive up to 1-2 additional courses. If the disease still shows no improvement, they will be withdrawn from the clinical study and other treatment options will be considered, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Note: In special circumstances based on the patient's condition, laboratory test indicators, and adverse reactions, etc.; for Venetoclax dosage, if the white blood cell count is \>25×10\^9/L before administration, hydroxyurea may be given first to reduce the count to less than 25×10\^9/L before adding Venetoclax, and then the concentration of Venetoclax will be tested and the dose adjusted according to the concentration.
