A Study To Observe Treatment Patterns and Outcomes in Patients With HER2-Positive Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This observational disease registry is a prospective, national, non-interventional study designed to enroll participants who have received an initial diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced (LA) or metastatic breast cancer (mBC), up to 6 months prior to registry enrolment. These participants will be prospectively followed for at least 5 years after study enrolment to evaluate their anti-cancer treatments. Data on participants' previous anti-cancer treatments for breast cancer will be collected retrospectively at study entry.
