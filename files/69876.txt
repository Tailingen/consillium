Amrubicin Chemotherapy as First Line in Metastatic or Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Primary Objectives

1. To evaluate the Response Rate (RR) for amrubicin in patients with metastatic or advanced sarcoma as first line therapy.
2. To evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS).

Secondary Objectives

1. To assess the safety and tolerability of amrubicin in this patient population.
2. To evaluate whether certain histologic subtypes of sarcoma demonstrate a differential response to amrubicin.
3. To investigate quality of response with radiographic evaluation using both Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Choi criteria.
4. To evaluate overall survival (OS).
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Amrubicin
Response Rate for Amrubicin in Patients With Metastatic or Advanced Sarcoma as First Line Therapy., Per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria (RECIST 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 48 months|Progression Free Survival, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT; time elapsed between treatment initiation and tumor progression or death. In target lesions, progression is defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In non-target lesions, progression is defined via RECIST v 1.1 as the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., six months
Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, 4 months|Overall Survival, This variable reviews the percentage of Overall Survival at 24 months and presents the percentage of participants who survived at 2 years., two years|Quality of Response With Radiographic Evaluation Using Both Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Choi Criteria., Per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria (RECIST 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Exploratory CT evaluations according to Choi response criteria will be also performed and correlated with RECIST response., 48 months|Differential Response to Amurbicin Among Certain Histologic Subtypes of Sarcoma., Per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria (RECIST 1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 48 months
