Clinical Trial of Lurbinectedin (PM01183) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Prospective, open-label, two-way crossover, phase Ib drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumors
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Lurbinectedin alone|DRUG: Lurbinectedin+Itraconazole co-administration
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: AUC(0-∞), The primary parameter of interest for the statistical analysis will be plasma doseadjusted AUC(0-∞), Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22 (Cycle 1,2,3) (each cycle is 21 days)
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: AUC(0-t), The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) will be calculated using the linear-log trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to infinity., Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22 (Cycle 1,2,3) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Cmax, The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will be obtained directly from the experimental data., Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22 (Cycle 1,2,3) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: T1/2, Terminal half-life (T1/2) will be obtained from the terminal rate constant calculated by linear regression using at least 3 observations., Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22 (Cycle 1,2,3) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Total body clearance, Total body clearance (CL), calculated by dividing the administered dose by the AUC with extrapolation to infinity., Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22 (Cycle 1,2,3) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Volume of distribution, Volume of distribution (both at steady state and based on the terminal phase) (Vss and Vz, respectively): Vss is an estimate that equals mean residence time times total body clearance. Vz, calculated dividing the administered dose by the product of the AUC with extrapolation to infinity by the terminal rate constant, Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22 (Cycle 1,2,3) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenetics, A genotype evaluation in genes relevant for lurbinectedin metabolism and transport will be investigated and reported in an independent report in order to determine whether the observed differences between patients in PK parameters are related to these genetic features., Before treatment start along with PK sample on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
Prospective, open-label, two-way crossover, phase Ib drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid tumors.

The study will include a pre-treatment (screening) phase (within 14 days before the first lurbinectedin or itraconazole administration) followed by a treatment phase consisting of two lurbinectedin cycles, one cycle in combination with itraconazole and one cycle as single agent (in different order depending on the study sequence), and one additional third cycle of lurbinectedin as a single agent for patients who meet the continuation criteria and obtain a clinical benefit after the first two cycles, and then follow-up of adverse events if any.
