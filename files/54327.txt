Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) When Combined With Cisplatin/Paclitaxel or Cisplatin/5-FU in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
Study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of BIBW 2992 when combined with backbone chemotherapies consisting in cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5 FU.

The overall safety, the pharmacokinetics and the anti-tumour efficacy will also be assessed.

Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in the First Cycle for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Number of participants with DLT in the first cycle (21 days) for the determination of the MTD., 21 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for Regimen A and Regimen B, The MTD was determined using a standard 3 +3 dose escalation cohort design. The sample size and the number of patients who receive each dose in this design depends on the frequency of DLT at each dose level in cycle 1., 21 days
Number of Patients With Objective Response, Objective tumor response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., Tumor assessment were performed at screening and every 2nd cycle until end of follow up (=end of treatment + 30 days +/- 7 days)|Maximum Concentration of Afatinib in Plasma at Steady State (Cmax,ss), Cmax,ss represents the maximum concentration of afatinib in plasma at steady state, 0.05hours (h) before administration and 1h, 2h, 2h 55 minutes (min), 4h, 4h 30min, 5h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 24h, 48h, 216h, 480h after administration
