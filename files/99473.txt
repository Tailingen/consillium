MEtoclopramide, DExamethasone or Axoli to Prevent or Delay Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting in Moderately Emetogenic Non-AC-based Chemotherapy
In this phase III non-inferiority trial, the aim is to evaluate whether metoclopramide and palonosetron prophylactic antemetic treatment are non-inferior to dexamethasone with regard to its efficacy to prevent delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) induced by non- anthracyclines plus cyclophosphamide (AC) based moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC).

DRUG: metoclopramide|DRUG: dexamethason|DRUG: palonosetron
efficacy, Primary efficacy endpoint: the proportion of patients reporting complete response during the overall 24 to 160 hours after initiation of the first cycle of moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic (MEC). Complete response is defined as no vomiting and nausea and no use of rescue medication. A diary will be used to document the date and time of any emetic episodes and use of rescue medication, as well as daily nausea ratings., 24 to 160 hours|tolerability, Primary tolerability endpoint: the proportion of patients with minimal or no antiemetic therapy-related side effects according to the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) questionnaire, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Aprepitant questionnaire during the first cycle of moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic (MEC)., 24 to 160 hours|cost-effectiveness, Primary cost-effectiveness endpoint: total antiemetic medication costs per treatment regimen during the first cycle of Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC). A diary will be used to document the use of antiemetics and rescue medication. Total medication costs will be calculated from this., 24 to 160 hours
