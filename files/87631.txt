Tislelizumabï¼ˆAnti PD-1), Lenvatinib and GEMOX Transformation in the Treatment of Potentially Resectable, Locally Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
The aim of this study is to assess the R0 resection rate of tislelizumab combined with Lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy in the conversion therapy of potentially resectable locally advanced BTC.

R0 resection rate, the ratio of the number of R0 resection cases to the total number of enrolled cases, 24 months
ORR, The proportion of patients whose best overall response (BOR) is evaluated as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time during study drug treatment, 24 months|DCR, Proportion of patients with CR, PR and SD, 24 months|PFS, Time from study treatment to disease progression or all-cause death as assessed by the investigator (whichever occurs first), 24 months|OS, The time from study treatment to the date of death of the subject, regardless of the cause of death, 24 months|CPR, The ratio of the number of pathological complete necrosis of excised specimens to the total number of surgical resections, 24 months|MPR, The ratio of more than 90% cases of pathological necrosis of resected specimens to the total number of surgical resections, 24 months|RFS, Proportion of patients without tumor recurrence or metastasis after surgery, 24 months
Translational therapy refers to methods such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and combined therapy to shrink tumors, reduce tumor biological behavior, and achieve secondary resection. The success rate of transformation depends on the objective response rate of the treatment method (Objective response rate, ORR). The latest review showed that 132 patients with unresectable ICC had undergone chemotherapy, chemoembolization, radiotherapy embolization or combination therapy, and 27 patients received downgrade resection. The research of our group using PD-1 antibody combined with lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of unresectable advanced cholangiocarcinoma (NCT03951597, 2020ESMO, 2021ASCO) showed that the ORR was 80% and the disease control rate (DCR) It reached 93.3% (28/30), of which 3 cases underwent successful radical resection after downstage. These data suggest that PD1 monoclonal antibody combined with lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy may be an ideal conversion therapy for patients with potentially resectable advanced biliary system tumors, but there is currently no evidence-based basis.

This study explores the efficacy and safety of PD1 monoclonal antibody combined with Lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy in potentially resectable advanced BTC conversion therapy. It has certain clinical significance in order to increase the R0 surgical resection rate of BTC patients and improve patient survival.
