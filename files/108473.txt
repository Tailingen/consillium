Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation With Nal-IRI and Capecitabine Guided by UGT1A1 Status in Patients With Rectal Cancer
This single-arm trial will explore the efficacy and safety of long-course neoadjuvant chemoradiation with liposomal irinotecan and capecitabine guided by UGT1A1 status in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

This is a single-center, single-arm, prospective clinical study. The aim of this study is to explore the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of total neoadjuvant therapy with irinotecan liposome in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients' nutritional status, quality of life, changes in symptoms, and adverse events will also be regularly assessed and registered during the implementation phase of the study, and patients will be treated promptly if symptoms are assessed as positive.
