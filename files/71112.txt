Beta- Probe and Surgery in GEP NET: Evaluation of a New Probe
Radioguided surgery (RGS) with beta- radioisotopes is a novel approach focused on developing a new probe which, detecting electrons and operating with low background, provides a clearer delineation of the margins of lesions with low radiation exposition for surgeons.

To validate this procedure, ex vivo specimens of tumours expressing somatostatin receptors, as small-intestine neuroendocrine (SI-NET), will be tested
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Y90-DOTA-Tyr3-Octreotide
Evaluation of sensitivity of a beta- probe, after receiving a small amount of radioactivity, patients will be operated and an evaluation of radioactivity on surgical specimens will be evaluated, 2 years
Small Intestinal neuroendocrine patients, with a positive Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT, will receive a small amount of beta- radiopharmaceutical (Y-90-DOTATOC), and then operated, as clinical indicated.

Tissue samples will be tested ex-vivo with a beta-probe prototype
