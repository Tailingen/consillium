MTD of oral continuous dosing of crenolanib (3 different doses) plus ramucirumab/paclitaxel in patients defined as the highest dose level in which <2 of 6 patients develop a DLT. The DLT is based on the 1st cycle adverse events., The DLT is based on the first cycle (35 days) adverse events.

This will constitute the first part of the study which will enroll a maximum of 18 patients., 5 weeks|Response rate (RR) of the combination in patients will be radiographically evaluated until progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, physician's decision, death or the completion of 6 cycles. adenocarcinoma patients, Bi-monthly for up to 6 months.
