Tivozanib in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Is Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of tivozanib and to see how well it works in treating patients with liver cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Advanced Adult Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Non-Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Tivozanib (1mg)|DRUG: Tivozanib (1.5mg)
PFS, Assessed Using Standard RECIST Criteria, Will be descriptively analyzed using standard Kaplan-Meier estimation along with the corresponding descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals., 24 weeks
Clinical Benefit Rate (CR, PR, and SD) by RECIST, The number of patients achieving clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD by RECIST)., Up to 3 years|Incidence of Adverse Events and Toxicities, Assessed Using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4, Toxicity frequency will be tabulated by grade across all dose levels and cycles for all patients in the safety sample and for the subset treated at the recommended phase 2 dose., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment until death or last follow-up., Up to 3 years
AFP Response, Defined as an AFP decrease greater than 50%., Up to 3 years|Antiviral Effects (if Any in Those With HBV or HCV Associated HCC), Up to 3 years|Drug Exposure, as Assessed by Steady State PK, Associations between drug exposure and response/survival and toxicity by quartiles of drug exposure., Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Progression free survival (PFS) at 24 weeks in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety of tivozanib in HCC. II. To determine the overall survival (OS) and clinical benefit rate (complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\] and stable disease \[SD\]) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

III. To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) baseline/change with tivozanib and use modeling to correlate exposure with biomarker change and the primary outcome measure of PFS.

IV. To determine the change in viral load (hepatitis B virus \[HBV\] and hepatitis C virus \[HCV\]) during therapy in patients with HBV or HCV associated HCC.

V. To determine the change in tumor marker (alfa fetoprotein) with tivozanib therapy is in the effect of tivozanib on several tumor-associated immune response markers.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
