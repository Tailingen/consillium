The PAI Trial for Breast and Colon Cancer Survivors
The purpose of the study is to determine if a Physical Activity Index (PAI) tool that collects measures on physical activity, strength training and sedentary behavior can be used in a clinical setting to monitor patient behavior and provide specific recommendations on how to achieve and maintain behavior goals. The tool will be used after treatment is completed in breast and colon cancer survivors and will test if physician counseling combined with patient self-monitoring improves physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior over time.
