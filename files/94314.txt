A Study of Dostarlimab in Combination With Carboplatin-paclitaxel in Japanese Participants With Primary Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to understand the effectiveness of dostarlimab and carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab monotherapy in participants with endometrial cancer
Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Dostarlimab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Durable response rate for 12 months (DRR12) assessed by Blinded independent central review (BICR), DRR12 is defined as the proportion of participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) lasting greater than or equal to (â‰¥) 12 months, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Approximately 18 months
DRR12 per RECIST 1.1, assessed by investigator, Approximately 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, assessed by BICR and investigator, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause, Up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first dose of study intervention to death from any cause, Up to approximately 3 years|Overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR, ORR is achieving a best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR. BOR is defined as the best confirmed response \[CR \> PR \> Stable disease (SD) \> Progressive Disease (PD) \> Not evaluable (NE)\] from treatment start date until disease progression, death or initiation of next line of therapy, whichever is earlier, Up to approximately 3 years|ORR per RECIST 1.1 assessed by investigator, Up to approximately 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR, Achieving a BOR of CR, PR, or SD, defined as the best confirmed response (CR \> PR \> SD) from treatment start date until disease progression, death or initiation of next line of therapy, whichever is earlier, Up to approximately 3 years|DCR per RECIST 1.1 assessed by investigator, Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented objective response to the date of first documented PD or death, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 3 years|DOR per RECIST 1.1 assessed by investigator, Up to approximately 3 years|Maximum concentration (Cmax) for dostarlimab, Up to 67 weeks|Minimum concentration (Cmin) for dostarlimab, Up to 67 weeks|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), Immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) by severity, Up to approximately 3 years|Number of participants AEs, irAEs, and SAEs leading to dose modifications such as dose delay or study intervention discontinuation, Up to approximately 3 years|Number of participants with AEs leading to death, Up to approximately 3 years
