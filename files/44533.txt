Study Evaluating Pyrotinib in Combination With Capecitabine In Patients With HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both EGFR and HER-2 receptors. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Pyrotinib in combination with capecitabine in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pyrotinib, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Pyrotinib To assess preliminary antitumor activity To determine preliminary regimen dose for phase II study
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: pyrotinib combined with capecitabine
The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of three experiences has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) upon completing one treatment cycle., DLT was difined as the cetain AEs which were observed during the first cycle (D1-D21ï¼‰of treatment., 21 days
