An Open-label, Phase 1 Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of ND-003 in Patients With Advanced Solid Cancers
This study is done to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of drug ND-003 tablets in patients with solid tumors. ND-003 is a highly potent and selective small molecular inhibitor of NTRK (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase) and RET (rearranged during transfection). The study also investigates how the drug is absorbed and processed in the human body.

Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as adverse events (graded according to NCI CTCAE ver5.0) assessed by the investigator to be definitely/probably/possibly related to the investigational product, 4 days after single oral administration and the first cycle of multiple administration (28 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which fewer than 1 of 6 subjects experienced DLT., 4 days after single oral administration and the first cycle of multiple administration (28 days)|Adverse Events (AE) assessed by CTCAE ver5.0., Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE ver5.0., through study completion, an average of 1 year
maximum concentration (Cmax), The drug maximum concentration reaches when the absorption rate is equal to the elimination rate at a single dose., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours after at a singe dose administration of ND-003|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Time required to reach peak drug concentration after a single administration., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours after at a singe dose administration of ND-003|Elimination Half-life (t1/2), Elimination Half-life (t1/2) refers to the time required to eliminate 50% of the drug from the body., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours after a single dose administration.|Clearance (CL/F), Clearance (CL) describes how the body effectively eliminate drugs from the systemic circulation, typically defined as the volume of drug-containing plasma eliminated from the body per unit time., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours after a single dose administration.|AUC from time 0 to last time of quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the initial administration to the last measurable concentration point, Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 hours after a single dose administration.|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST (version 1.1) ., Baseline through up to 6 cycles or until disease progression (each cycle is 28 days)|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first., Baseline through up to 6 cycles or until disease progression (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause and is measured in the intent-to-treat population., Baseline through up to 6 cycles or until disease progression (each cycle is 28 days)
The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial dose escalation phase of drug ND-003 tablets in patients with solid tumors will be followed by an expansion phase in subjects with solid tumors harboring NTRK or RET Fusion or Mutation.

The objectives of the study are to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles, as well as preliminary efficacy of orally administered ND-003 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
