Bortezomib Maintenance in High Risk DLBCL
This study is an Open-labeled, multicenter Phase II study of Bortezomib for maintenance therapy in patients with high risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Primary objective is 3 years relapse free survival (RFS) and Secondary objectives are 3 years overall survival (OS), 3 years event free survival (EFS),Toxicities profiles, Quality of Life (FACT\&GOG-Ntx)
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Bortezomib
3years relapse free survival, 3years relapse free survival will be assessed after starting maintenance therapy for 1year and then following up for 3years., from the date of first drug administration until the date of last follow up, assessed up to 4years
3years overall survival, 3years overall survival will be assessed after starting maintenance therapy for 1year and then following up for 3years., from the date of first drug administration until the date of last follow up, assessed up to 4years|3years event free survival, 3years event free survival will be assessed after starting maintenance therapy for 1year and then following up for 3years., from the date of first drug administration until the date of last follow up, assessed up to 4years|Toxicity profiles, Safety profiles will be evaluated using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., from the date of first drug administration until the date of the 30th day after last cycle of chemotherapy|Quality of life scale, Quality of life will be assessed after starting maintenance therapy for 1year and then following up for 3years by using FACT\&GOG-Ntx., from the date of first drug administration until the date of last follow up, assessed up to 4years
High-intermediate or high risk in IPI has a long-term chance of cure in the range about 50% in patients with DLBCL treated by R-CHOP. These high risk patients should be considered for additional new treatment to standard R-CHOP or investigational approaches in the context of clinical trials that are designed to ensure that potentially curative therapy.

Bortezomib has shown activity in vitro against DLBCL-derived cell lines. Single-agent bortezomib or chemotherapy combined bortezomib are feasible in follicular, mantle cell, marginal zone lymphoma and DLBCL with manageable toxicities. Bortezomib enhances the activity of chemotherapy in non-GCB but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic approach based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes.

High CR/CRu rate with bortezomib with standard R-CHOP suggests it may be a good backbone for additional maintenance leading to durable response. However, there is no study of bortezomib as maintenance therapy after treated with R-CHOP in high risk patients with DLBCL. So we applied additional bortezomib as maintenance therapy in order to assess improving efficacy and survival rates in high risk patients with non-GCB DLBCL who had been confirmed CR after treated with R-CHOP.
