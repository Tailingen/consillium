Hemostatic Powder Versus Clinical Management for the Treatment of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding From Tumor Lesions
This study evaluates the efficacy of the endoscopic hemostatic powder for the treatment of bleeding from malignant lesions of the upper GI tract. Half of participants will receive hemostatic powder and half will be submitted to standard treatment.

Gastrointestinal tumor bleeding is a challenging clinical condition with a high mortality rate. Several endoscopic hemostasis techniques have been tested, but results were disappointing. Re-bleeding and mortality rates are still high.

Hemostatic powder is a promising therapy for tumor bleeding, since it can be applied over large surfaces. Bleeding from a tumor lesion often occurs diffusely on the surface of the tumor rather than from a specific vessel.
