Metabolic Flexibility and Autonomic Control After Muscle Power vs Metabolic Power Training in Postmenopausal Oncological Women: the POWER Health Study
POWER Health is a randomized clinical trial with a two-arm parallel design whose objectives are 1) to study metabolic flexibility and autonomic function (both capacities that describe cardiovascular health) in a sample of postmenopausal oncological women vs postmenopausal untreated controls (CT); and 2) to analyze the impact of two different 8-week physical exercise supervised interventions: HIIT training vs strength training focused on muscle power, on both cardiovascular capacities in these populations.

Nowadays, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide, accounting for 30% of all cancers in Spanish women in 2023. Cancer is also the second leading cause of death in developed countries, following cardiovascular diseases, with which it shares a close relationship. Additionally, we know that the incidence of breast cancer increases with age, experiencing a rise after menopause. However, lifestyle and physical exercise are known to improve the prevention, prognosis, and survival of this disease, as well as enhance quality of life in these patients. Indeed, recent studies have highlighted the relevance of cardiovascular health in this oncological process, as well as the potential of physical exercise interventions to improve cardiovascular health following the disease.

POWER Health is a randomized clinical trial aimed at studying metabolic flexibility and autonomic health in a population of breast cancer recurrence-free women (RFC) compared to postmenopausal untreated controls (CT), along with the implementation of two supervised exercise interventions in both populations. These interventions will last for 8 weeks, one involving HIIT exercise focused on improving metabolic power (MPI), and the other one involving strength exercise focused on enhancing muscular power, with the hypothesis of better metabolic flexibility and autonomic function, and consequently, better cardiovascular health.

POWER health is a mixed method design: cross-sectional \& longitudinal study. Given the feasibility and simple application of POWER Health, this clinical trial will contribute to the prevention and improvement of the health of postmenopausal women, with an important clinical and economic impact, not only in the scientific community but also in clinical practice.
