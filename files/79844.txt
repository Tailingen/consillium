Disitamab Vedotin in the Treatment With HER2- Expression, Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Disitamab Vedotin in the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

This is a Multicenter Open Phase II to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of Disitamab Vedotin in the Treatment With HER2- Expression, Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The study plans to enroll 40 subjects with locally advanced or metastatic CRPC with HER2 expression (IHC 1+ and above) who have been treated with androgen deprivation therapy and novel hormone therapy. Eligible subjects were enrolled and received RC48 intravenous infusion at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Subjects received medication until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, active withdrawal, death, or study termination by the sponsor.
