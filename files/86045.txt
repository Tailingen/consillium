Acalabrutinib and Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell Therapy for the Treatment of B-cell Lymphoma
This phase I/II trial studies the safety of acalabrutinib and axicabtagene ciloleucel in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking key pathways needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel is engineered to target a specific surface antigen on lymphoma cells. Acalabrutinib may enhance the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma.

Incidence of adverse events, Toxicity as defined by the following: grade \>= 3 cytokine release syndrome, grade \>= 3 neurotoxicity within 30 days of infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Grading will be done in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 for neurotoxicity and the Lee Criteria for cytokine release syndrome, unless otherwise specified., Up to 30 days post axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion
Complete response rate following chimeric antigen receptor T-cells therapy (CART), Will be assessed per Lugano criteria., Up to 5 years post treatment|Overall survival, Up to 5 years post treatment|Progression-free survival, Up to 5 years post treatment|Response rate, Will assess response rate (complete response + partial response + stable response) following bridging prior to CART., Up to 3 weeks
OUTLINE:

Beginning up to 3 weeks and at least 24 hours prior to leukapheresis, patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive axicabtagene ciloleucel intravenously (IV) at 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years.
