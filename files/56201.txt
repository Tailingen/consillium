Could a Preoperative Feeding Jejunostomy Decrease Sarcopenia for Patients With Oesogastric Adenocarcinoma ?
The study of sarcopenia is a subject that is the subject of numerous research and publications, particularly because of its link with a poor prognosis for many cancers.

In an article published by the digestive surgery team, the role of feeding jejunostomy has been demonstrated: it allowed more patients to reach the 2nd stage of surgery and a better tolerance of chemotherapy.

Investigators wanted to study retrospectively the impact of feeding jejunostomy on radiological sarcopenia. Is the positive effect of jejunostomy in gastric cancers associated with a decrease in sarcopenia?
