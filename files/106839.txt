A Study of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin Beta (NeoRecormon) in Anemic Cancer Participants Treated With Chemotherapy
This study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) recombinant human erythropoietin beta (r-HuEPO) in participants with anemia and histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer.
Anemia
DRUG: r-HuEPO
Percentage of Participants With Response to Treatment, Response to treatment was defined as an increase of greater than (\>) 1 gram per deciliter (g/dL) in hemoglobin level (irrespective of the need of transfusion) from Baseline value at Week 4., Week 4
Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the time between the start of treatment and the increase in hemoglobin level \>1 g/dL compared to baseline hemoglobin level. Time to response was estimated using Kaplan Meier method., Baseline up to Week 4|Percentage of Participants With Response to Treatment After 2 Weeks of Study Treatment, Response to treatment after 2 weeks of treatment was defined as presence of any of the following criteria: reticulocytes \>40000 per microliter or \>25% increase in soluble transferrin receptor or \>0.5 g/dL increase in hemoglobin level., Week 2|Percentage of Participants With No Response to Treatment After 4 Weeks of Study Treatment, "No Response" to treatment after 4 weeks was defined as meeting any of the following criteria: \<1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin level or hemoglobin level \<8.5 g/dL or need of transfusion. If a participant had an increase in hemoglobin level of \>1 g/dL but required transfusion then the participant is considered as Non- Responder., Week 4|Percentage of Participants Who Required Transfusion, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Questionnaire Score at Week 4, FACT-An comprises of 4 subscales of 27-item (FACT-General scale \[FACT-G\]): physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotion well-being, functional well-being, and an additional concerns anemia subscale. All questions are rated on a scale from 0 to 4, where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The physical well-being subscale consists of 7 questions with score range from 0-28; social/family well-being subscale consists of 7 questions with score range from 0-28; emotion well-being subscale consists of 6 questions with score range from 0-24; functional well-being subscale consists of 7 questions with score range from 0-28; anemia subscale consist of 20 questions with score range from 0-80. Total FACT-An score ranges from 0-188., Baseline, Week 4
This study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) recombinant human erythropoietin beta (r-HuEPO) in participants with anemia and histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer.
