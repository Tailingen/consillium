Tumor Treating Fields for Locally Advanced NSCLC
The goal of this open-label, Phase 1 clinical trial is to determine the safety of TTFields started concurrently with SOC chemoradiation and during consolidation durvalumab in locally advanced, unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main question it aims to answer is, "What is the rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) with TTFields in addition to concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation durvalumab?"

Step 1

* All participants will be screened and enrolled in Step 1 prior to SOC concurrent chemoradiation.
* The purpose of the Step 1 Registration is to ensure that eligible participants are candidate for concurrent chemoradiation and do not have contraindications to TTF therapy or immunotherapy.

  * Starting Level: Participants in Device Duration Level 1 will receive standard of care concurrent chemoradiation following Step 1 Registration.
  * Escalation Level : Participants in Device Duration Level 2 will begin standard of care chemoradiation and treatment with TTFields following Step 1 Registration.

Step 2

* All participants will complete Step 2 screening and enrollment prior to receiving treatment with durvalumab consolidation therapy and TTFields.
* The purpose of the Step 2 registration is to ensure that eligible patients meet criteria for consolidation durvalumab after completion of CRT and do not have contraindications to TTF. therapy or immunotherapy.
