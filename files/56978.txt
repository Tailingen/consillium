Study to Compare Axicabtagene Ciloleucel With Standard of Care Therapy as First-line Treatment in Participants With High-risk Large B-cell Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical study is to compare the study drug, axicabtagene ciloleucel, versus standard of care (SOC) in first-line therapy in participants with high-risk large B-cell lymphoma.
High-risk Large B-cell Lymphoma (LBCL)
BIOLOGICAL: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone
Event-free Survival (EFS) by Blinded Central Assessment, EFS, is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest occurrence of death due to any cause, disease progression/relapse, initiation of any non-protocol specified subsequent new lymphoma therapy for the treatment of residual disease or Biopsy-proven residual disease at the Month 6 disease assessment or later, regardless of whether subsequent new lymphoma therapy is initiated or not., Up to 5 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Blinded Central Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|PFS by Investigator Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|Complete Response (CR) Rate by Blinded Central Assessment, CR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved CR per Lugano classification after treatment completion and prior to subsequent new off protocol anti-lymphoma therapy., Up to 5 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Deaths, First dose date up to 5 years plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinically Significant Changes in Safety Laboratory Values, First dose date up to 5 years plus 30 days|Change From Baseline in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a multi-item questionnaire measuring the following content: five (5) multi-item functional scales, three (3) multi-item symptom scales, six (6) symptom single-item scales, one (1) global health status scale, and one (1) global health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Each scale is measured from 0 to 100 after a linear transformation. Higher scores for functioning scales and for the Global Health Status or Global HRQoL scales indicate a higher level of functioning and a better HRQoL respectively, whereas higher scores in symptom scales represent a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, Month 18|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma High Grade Module (EORTC QLQ-NHL-HG29) Score, The EORTC QLQ-NHL-HG29 is a 29-item patient-reported assessment measuring patients' high-grade NHL-specific symptoms and functioning. The 29 items assess symptom burden due to disease and/or treatment, fatigue/physical condition, neuropathy, emotional impacts, and worries/fears health and functioning. Each scale is measured from 0 to 100 after a linear transformation. Higher scores for functional scales indicate a higher level of functioning and a better HRQoL, whereas higher scores in symptom scales represent a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, Month 18|Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Five Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Score, The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L comprises 2 components: a questionnaire covering 5 dimensions and a tariff of values based upon direct valuations of health states using a visual analog scale (VAS). Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health., Baseline, Month 18
Five years after randomization, participants who have received axicabtagene ciloleucel will transition to a separate long-term follow-up study (study KT-US-982-5968) to complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments.
