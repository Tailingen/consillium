Isatuximab, Pomalidomide, Elotuzumab and Dexamethasone in Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a multicenter, open-label phase II study in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma with at least two prior lines of therapy. The main study consists of three phases: a 28-day screening phase, treatment phase that consists of 28-day cycles of isatuximab with elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone and a follow-up phase.

The study is divided into two parts:

Part 1 (Run-in safety phase): In this safety-run in phase a total of six subjects will be enrolled at the coordinating site (Medical College of Wisconsin) to assess potential dose-limiting toxicities that may be associated with the addition of isatuximab with pomalidomide, elotuzumab and dexamethasone.

Part 2 (Expansion phase): In this part, up to 47 additional subjects will be enrolled.

The study hypothesis is that the isatuximab in combination with elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (Isa-EPD) will be safe and lead to superior response rates than seen with either isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone or elotuzumab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
