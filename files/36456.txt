Anti-depressants have been shown to be beneficial in cancer participants. They reduce depressive symptoms and improve quality of life. Randomized trials have shown that antidepressants can reduce the development of depression in non-depressed participants with breast, melanoma, and head and neck cancers. It has been shown that treating depression can impact survival in cancer participants. Additionally, depressed pancreatic cancer participants have worse survival. Therefore, anti-depressants may also have implications for cancer treatment.
