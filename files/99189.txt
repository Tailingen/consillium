A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of TEG002 in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is a single arm, open-label, multicenter phase I study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of autologous T cells transduced with a specific γδTCR, i.e. TEG002, in a dose escalation and expansion study in relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma patients.

The study will comprise of a Dose Escalation Segment and an Expansion Segment. The study consists of a screening period, leukapheresis of mononuclear cells, and conditioning chemotherapy, followed by TEG002. All subjects continue to be followed regularly for safety and efficacy assessments until 1 year after TEG002 administration.
