Feasibility of Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Contrast (BOLD) Breast MRI Induced by Breath- Holding
In this study, investigators intend to measure changes in BOLD contrast in the breast induced by breath-holding for subjects receiving radiation therapy to the breast. This study will provide the preliminary data and experience needed to successfully apply BOLD to quantify changes in oxygenation and blood flow of breast and tumor for a larger cohort of breast radiotherapy patients. The current study has the following objectives:

1. To determine the feasibility of BOLD contrast MRI of the breast, induced by breath-hold.
2. To measure the change in BOLD contrast of the breast and / or chest wall tissue for females undergoing radiotherapy
Breast Cancer
The change in BOLD contrast of the breasts and / or chest wall tissue will be measured by comparing breath hold sequences to normal breathing., Subjects will be evaluated holding their breath and during normal breathing., During MRI approx 1 hour|Feasibility as measured by a BOLD contrast signal in at least 30% of subjects, The imaging technique will be considered feasible if for any of the proposed imaging sequences, breath-holding induces a measurable (≥3× standard deviation of background) BOLD contrast signal in at least 30% of the subjects. Contrast will be measured by comparing breath hold sequences to normal breathing., During MRI approx one hour
11 subjects were consented to the trial. One subject voluntarily withdrew before any study procedures were performed.
