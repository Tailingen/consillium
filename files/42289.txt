Vaccination With GM-K562 Cells in Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) After Allogeneic Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this research study is to determine if the GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine can be safely given soon after allogeneic marrow or blood stem cell transplant. The GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine is composed of a cultured cell line that has been genetically modified to secrete GM-CSF, a naturally occuring substance in the body that stimulates the immune system. The vaccine is a mixture of the GM-K562 cells (radiated to prevent them from growing in the participants body) with the participant's previously frozen and killed leukemia cells. By mixing the GM-K562 with the leukemia cells, we would like to study whether this vaccine combination will stimulate the participant's new immune system to recognize and fight against their MDS/AML cancer cells.

* Participants will be given the GM-K562/Leukemia call vaccine as in injection under the skin a total of six times. The first 3 vaccines will be given weekly and vaccines 4 through 6 will be given every other week. Therefore, it is expected that the vaccines will be completed over a period of 9 weeks.
* During the 9 week vaccination period, participants will have physical exams to monitor for any side effects or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Bone marrow biopsies will be performed a the time of enrollment for this study, 4 weeks after completion of 6 GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccines, and 1 year after the participants transplant.
* As a way of testing whether the GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccine is triggering any immune response to the participants leukemia, we will be injecting a small amount of leukemia cells (after they are killed with radiation) under the participants skin to see if the body will generate a reaction to the leukemia cells. This test is called a leukemia cell delayed hypersensitivity test (DTH). This test will be performed three times during the study, on the weeks of the 1st vaccine, 5th vaccine and 4 weeks after the 6th vaccine.
* There are a total of 5 skin biopsies required as part of this study. Biopsies will be taken from the vaccination sites 2-3 days after the first and fifth vaccine. Similar biopsies will be taken from the DTH sites after the 1st vaccination, 5th vaccination and 4-6 weeks after the 6th vaccination.
