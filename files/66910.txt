Ultrasound Guided Central Vein Catheterization and Complications
There has been no study comparing the complication rates between internal jugular vein catheterization and subclavian vein catheterization when they are performed using sonographic view. This prospective study would reveal the sort of complication and its rate.
Brain Tumor
PROCEDURE: Catheterization of subclavian vein|PROCEDURE: Catheterization of internal jugular vein
complication, any one of arterial puncture, hematoma, pneumothorax, hemothorax, during central vein catheterization and operation day
Access time, from penetration of skin to aspiration of venous blood into the syringe, during central venous catheterization|Number of attempts, once/twice/three times, during central venous catheterization|catheter tip placement, After reviewing the postoperative chest X ray film, we will check the position of the central venous catheter tip. The possible pisition of catheter tip is as follows:

(1) Superior vena cava and Rirht Atrium junction (2)Right internal jugular vein (3)Left Internal jugular vein (4)Right Axillary vein (5)Lt. Axillary vein, postoperative 1 day
