Total Marrow Irradiation & Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Relapsed or Refractory Myeloma
The investigators hypothesize that conformal radiation will allow the administration of higher doses of external beam radiation to marrow based malignancies than total body irradiation (TBI)without increasing the toxicity to normal tissues beyond that induced by TBI. Further,the investigators hypothesize that this will result in an improvement in disease response and disease control for patients with multiple myeloma. This is a dose escalation study of TMI with the primary objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose of TMI when followed by aHSCT in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
