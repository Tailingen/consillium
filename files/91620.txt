In this pilot study with a randomized controlled trial design, we examine the effect of an intervention optimizing and integrating rehabilitation for breast cancer on psychological and physical symptoms as well as health behavior after breast cancer. In the intervention group, we systematically screen for psychological and physical symptoms as well as health behavior (smoking alcohol and physical activity) not in line with the recommendations. Patients who screen positive are offered a sequence of sessions with a navigator nurse who monitor rehabilitation needs, supports the patient, educate in self-management of symptoms and refer to existing rehabilitation services as well as to up to 6 free sessions with a psychologist specialized in cancer patients. The rehabilitation services that the nurse refers to include several hospital departments and municipality services as well as general practice and by thorough follow-up on the patients use of these, the intervention aims at developing an integrated treatment and rehabilitation trajectory. The control group receives standard care.
