Study of the Effects of Pre-surgical Aerobic Exercise on Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find the safest level of aerobic training for people about to undergo surgery for their cancer, and to learn what effects, if any, aerobic exercise has on these patients and the outcomes of their cancers. This part of the study (Phase 0) will evaluate the feasibility and quality of at-home exercise and assessment procedures and find out whether study participants are willing to practice continuous lifestyle monitoring using apps and electronic devices.

Phase 1a will compare the effects and feasibility of six different doses of aerobic exercise and will continue evaluating the quality of at-home study procedures, which includes the use of continuous lifestyle monitoring through apps and electronic devices.

In order to facilitate completion of the phase 1a component, we will backfill the 90, 225, and 300 mins/wk dosing cohorts with at least 4 patients in each dose cohort.

identify the recommended dose of aerobic training, The relative dose intensity is defined as the ratio of completed to planned aerobic training dose continually assessed at the end of the intervention period.49 Hence, the maximal feasible dose is defined as the highest dose at which \<30% of patients in a dosing cohort fail to achieve the target total cumulative relative dose intensity., 1 year
