Phase I Trial of BCMA-TGF-BETA CAR-T Cells in Relapsed, Refractory Myeloma
This is a phase I, interventional, single-arm, open-label, dose-finding treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interleukin-7(IL-7) / interleukin-15 (IL-15) manufactured CAR T cells in adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma that have failed prior therapies.

Number of Adverse Events After BCMA-TGFβ CAR-T Cell Infusion, Incidence of adverse events with grade 3 to 5 severity using NCI CTCAE version 5.0 and the Lee et al. consensus manuscript (which outlines the defining characteristics of each grade for cytokine release syndrome; please refer to the reference below)., from infusion until Day +28 post CAR T infusion
BCMA-Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) CAR-T cells will be administered either fresh or thawed after cryopreservation by IV injection. Patients will receive one of three dose levels of BCMA-TGFβ CAR-T cells based on our dose escalation design.

After the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an additional dose-expansion cohort of up to 9 patients (3 BCMA-naïve and 6 BCMA exposed) may be enrolled at that dose to further describe the safety and preliminary efficacy of that dose.
