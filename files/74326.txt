Effectivity and Safety of Ultrasound-guided Percutaneously Radiofrequency Ablation for Liver Cancer
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasonography (US) -guided radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors, the investigators used preoperative and postoperative US/CEUS(contrast-enhanced ultrasonography)/CT/MRI to assess lesions, and laboratory tests including the tumor markers to evaluate the general condition of patients. Intraoperative US/CEUS/CT would be applied to monitor ablation lesions.
Liver Cancer
PROCEDURE: US-guided RFA
Tumor size assessed by MRI, Tumor size was estimated by MRI., through study completion, an average of 2 year
Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) level assessed by ELISA, CEA level was assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) level assessed by ELISA, AFP level was assessed by ELISA., through study completion, an average of 2 year
