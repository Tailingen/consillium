Impact of Recombinant Human Interleukin-7 (CYT107) on Tumor Clearance and Immune Reconstitution in Multiple Myeloma Patients After Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
This is a two-arm, open-label, randomized, single-site, pilot study testing the addition of CYT107 following autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The hypothesis of this study is that recombinant human CYT107 can be safely administered after AHCT and will promote quantitative and qualitative T cell reconstitution, which will be associated with enhanced tumor cell clearance and reduced infectious complications. Patients will be randomized to either the intervention arm that will receive CYT107 + standard of care melphalan and AHCT or to the control arm that will receive standard of care melphalan and AHCT only.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Recombinant glycosylated human interleukin-7|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant
Rate of non-hematologic grade ≥3 CYT107 treatment-related AEs (excluding expected transplant-related AEs or AEs attributed to melphalan and ASCT) according to CTCAE v5, Treatment-related AEs will be defined as AEs occurring that are at least possibly related to the CYT107 treatment, or the combination of melphalan, AHCT, and CYT107., Through day 365
Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD), For the purposes of this study, a patient will be considered as having minimal residual diseases if a positive result (per 10-5 threshold) is obtained using the Adaptive Clonoseq MRD testing., At Day 100|Rate of response by IMWG of ≥ complete response (CR), * Stringent complete response (sCR):

  * CR as defined below
  * Normal free light chain ratio (0.26-1.65)
  * Absence of clonal cells in the bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence
* Complete response (CR):

  * Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine
  * \<5% plasma cells in the bone marrow aspirate
  * Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, At Day 100|Rate of ≥ grade 3 infections, Through day 365|Days from transplant until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) engraftment, Neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first day of 3 consecutive days of ANC ≥ 500 following the post-transplant nadir., Through Day 30|Feasibility of treatment schedule, The study will be feasible if 20% of patients are able to receive all 5 doses of CYT107 within the first month post-transplant., 1 month post-transplant (transplant is on Day 0)|Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery from pre-AHCT, Through Day 30
