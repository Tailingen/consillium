VR-CAP in the First-line Treatment for Patients With Marginal Zone Lymphoma
This is a prospective single arm, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to observe the efficacy and safety of VR-CAP (Bortezomib and Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and Prednisone) in the first-line treatment for patients with marginal zone lymphoma.

DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Prednisone
2-year progression-free survival, the total proportion of patients with no progression from date of the first day of treatment to the date of confirmed progressive disease or death which one occurs first, from the beginning day of the first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) of treatment to the date of confirmed progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first, up to 2 years after last patient's enrollment
objective response rate, the total proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), every 6 weeks from the beginning day of the first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) of induction chemotherapy treatment and every 8 weeks from the day of the first cycle of maintenance treatment to 18 months after last patient's enrollment|overall survival, from date of first day of treatment to the date of death by any cause, from the beginning day of the first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) of treatment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|incidence and relationship with study drugs of grade 3-4 adverse events, the incidence and relationship with study drugs of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (based on NCI CTC-AE v4.03, from the beginning day of the first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) of treatment to 6 months after last patient's enrollment
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a relatively common group of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The incidence rate is only inferior to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). Currently, NCCN guidelines recommend same treatment plan of FL like R-CHOP as the primary treatment for MZL. However, due to the great difference in cell origin and biological characteristics between FL and MZL, some patients can not achieve complete remission or relapse quickly after standard first-line treatment. A number of phase II clinical studies have evaluated the good efficacy of rituximab combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of MZL. Previous studies have shown that NF-κB signaling pathway is in abnormal activation state in MZL. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor targeting NF-κB pathway, has a promising therapeutic prospect in relapsed and refractory MZL. The goal of our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of VR-CAP (Bortezomib and Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and Prednisone) in the first-line treatment for patients with marginal zone lymphoma.
