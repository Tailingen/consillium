CARTALL: Chimeric-Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapy for Relapsed/ Refractory T-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-CD7 CAR T-cells in patients with refractory or relapsed T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

Proportion of participant who are flow cytometry minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at 1 month after Anti-CD7 PEBL CAR T-cell infusion., MRD levels will be determined by flow cytometry. The target sensitivity of flow MRD is \<0.01% when available., 30 days
Proportion of participant who are minimal residual disease (MRD) negative with molecular base assay at the end of 1 month after Anti-CD7 PEBL CAR T-cell infusion., MRD levels will be determined by molecular based MRD by Ig/TCR. PCR and oncogene fusion transcript (OFT)., 30 days|Proportion of patient who shows CAR T-cell persistence by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry in bone marrow, peripheral blood and CSF samples at multiple study time points following CAR T cell infusion, Flow cytometry will be performed on bone marrow, peripheral blood and CSF samples at multiple study time points following CAR T cell infusion, 1 month to 5 years
A major obstacle to the development of effective CAR T-cells for T-cell malignancies is that the surface marker profile of malignant T-cells largely overlaps that of activated T lymphocytes. We developed a CAR T-cell approach that targets CD7, a T-cell marker highly expressed in all cases of T-cell ALL, including ETP-ALL. Its expression is also highly stable even in T-ALL cells exposed to chemotherapy. To prevent fratricide effect of the T cells, surface CD7 expression are effectively downregulated with the expression of an anti-CD7 Protein Expression Blocker (PEBL). Patients will receive anti-CD7 PEBL CART-cells. This will allow targeting the entire leukemia cell population to induce deeper and more durable remissions.
