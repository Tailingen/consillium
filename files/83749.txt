Neoadjuvant Dose Dense MVAC in MIBC and Locally Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
The objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of four cycles of ddMVAC with G-CSF support in patients with MIBC and locally advanced UC
Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer|Urothelial Carcinoma|Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Rate of pathologic complete response (pCR rate), No residual tumor (ypT0N0) in surgical specimen, From date of enrollment until curative intended surgical treatment, assess up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Time from enrollment until death from any cause, From date of enrollment until death, assess up to 3 years|Event free survival (EFS), Time from enrollment until the earliest occurrence of disease progression in inoperablity, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, From date of enrollment until death, assess up to 3 years|Adverse events related with ddMVAC, Adverse events related with ddMVAC using CTCAE 4.0, From date of enrollment until 8 weeks after last chemotherapy of ddMVAC|Surgical treatment related complication, Surgical treatment related complication, From surgical treatment until 60 the days after surgical treatment
* Currently, most treatment guidelines including NCCN recommend a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) as a standard of care in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
* Although standard NAC regimen is controversial due to rare of head to head study between each regimens, cisplatin based multidrug combination regimens such as MVAC, GP, and dose dense MVAC (ddMVAC) with G-CSF supports are regarded as a backbone treatment on the basis of the results from previous studies.
* Application of NAC is still relatively slow adoption in real practice. These slow adoption result from intuitive concerns such as significant toxicity of multidrug combination chemotherapy represented by MVAC and delayed application of radical surgical treatment in non-responder
* The ddMVAC with G-CSF support regimen showed an improved efficacy compared with GP regimen, and tolerable compared with standard MVAC using application of routine G-CSF support and high intensity of cisplatin.
* In case of clinically lymph node evolvement (cN+) is not for strict NAC, but patient with cN+ UC have been treated induction chemotherapy of similar NAC regimens and surgical treatment. So, this study included MIBC plus cN+ UC as locally advanced UC.
* In Korea, there is a low adoption of NAC, additionally rare of ddMVAC with G-CFS in locally advanced UC. It is supposed concerns related with toxicity of ddMVAC. Although the concern is likely not true considering the previous result of the Western, there has not been studied ddMVAC as NAC in Asian including Korean.
* The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of four cycles of ddMVAC with G-CSF support in patients with locally advanced UC.
