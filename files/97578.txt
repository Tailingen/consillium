Auto-Allo Tandem Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The present study will be a multicenter, prospective phase II-study investigating safety and efficacy of the combination of auto-allo tandem stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma and age of \>_60 years, followed by maintenance therapy with low-dose Thalidomide and Donor Lymphocyte Infusions.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: Auto-Allo Tandem SCT and maintenance therapy with Thalidomide/ DLI|PROCEDURE: auto-auto Tandem stem cell transplantation and maintenance therapy with Thalidomide
Event-free survival 4 years after auto-allo/ auto-auto Tandem-SCT. Any of the following will be considered an endpoint event: recurrence or progression of primary disease, disease related mortality, or treatment related mortality., four years after Tandem stem cell transplantation
Incidence of acute GvHD, day +100 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|Incidence of chronic GvHD, at one year and at two years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|Toxicity of conditioning regimen and of maintenance therapy, Throughout conditioning regimen and maintenance therapy|cumulative incidence of relapse, four years after Tandem stem cell transplantation|Disease related mortality, four years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|Treatment related mortality, four years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation|overall survival, four years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation
