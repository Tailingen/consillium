A Trial of Intratumoral Injections of SD-101 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma or Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral SD-101 injections in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma or recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

This study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 evaluates SD-101 given in combination with pembrolizumab in melanoma populations (anti-PD-1/L1 na誰ve and anti-PD-1/L1 experienced with progressive disease) in up to 4 Dose Escalation cohorts to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be evaluated in up to 4 Dose Expansion cohorts in Phase 2. Phase 2 also includes up to 4 Dose Expansion cohorts of patients with HNSCC (anti-PD-1/L1 na誰ve and anti-PD-1/L1 experienced with progressive disease).
