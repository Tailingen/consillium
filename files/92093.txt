Pitavastatin in Combination With Venetoclax for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase I, dose-escalation, open-label clinical trial determining the safety and tolerability of adding Pitavastatin to Venetoclax in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These are subjects who are newly diagnosed subjects with AML who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy, relapsed/refractory CLL or newly diagnosed CLL.

DRUG: Pitavastatin|DRUG: Venetoclax
Maximum Tolerated Dose for PIT administered with VEN-containing Standard of Care (SOC) regimens, Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be utilized to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding to PIT to treatment with stable doses of VEN ± anti-CD20 antibodies (patients with CLL) or VEN with hypomethylating agents (patients with AML)., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Recommended Phase 2 Dose for PIT administered with VEN-containing SOC regimens, Determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be utilized to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding to PIT to treatment with stable doses of VEN ± anti-CD20 antibodies (patients with CLL) or VEN with hypomethylating agents (patients with AML)., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Identifying Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) for PIT administered with VEN-containing SOC regimens, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of administering PIT in combination with VEN-containing SOC in patients with AML or CLL ., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Identifying overall Adverse Event Profile of PIT when given with VEN-containing SOC regimens, To evaluate the adverse events are based on the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Complete Response Rate, Primary efficacy endpoint is the complete response rate of subjects who receive PIT when given with VEN-containing SOC regimens. The 2018 International Working Group for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) and 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) definitions of Complete Response (CR) will be utilized to determine the CR rate., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.
Partial Response Rates, Secondary efficacy endpoints are the rates for the other response categories of subjects who receive PIT when given with VEN-containing SOC regimens. The 2018 International Working Group for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) and 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) definitions of Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) and Progressive Disease (PD) will be utilized to determine the rates for each of these categories., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Stable Disease Rates, Secondary efficacy endpoints are the rates for the other response categories of subjects who receive PIT when given with VEN-containing SOC regimens. The 2018 International Working Group for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) and 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) definitions of Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) and Progressive Disease (PD) will be utilized to determine the rates for each of these categories., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Progressive Disease Rates, Secondary efficacy endpoints are the rates for the other response categories of subjects who receive PIT when given with VEN-containing SOC regimens. The 2018 International Working Group for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) and 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) definitions of Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) and Progressive Disease (PD) will be utilized to determine the rates for each of these categories., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Percentage of Responders, Responders are defined as individuals who either received a CR or PR. Responders = CR+PR., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.|Number of Participants with Abnormal Laboratory Values and/or Adverse Events that Are Related to Treatment, Changes in safety status, such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), performance status, vital signs and laboratory assessments throughout treatment through the trial., From the start date of treatment until 30 days after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 2 years.
Composite of PK parameters of VEN and PIT summarized by PIT dose level, Change in PK parameters from baseline to Cycle 1 to determine if concomitant administration of PIT affects concentrations of VEN when given in combination with PIT., Samples will be collected at the following timepoints: Pre-VEN dose during screening, Cycle 1 Day 1 Pre-VEN and PIT dose, Cycle 1 Day 1 Post dose sampling at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hours after first PIT dose. Each cycle is 28 days.|Composite of dynamic BH3 profiling in priming of ex vivo AML and CLL specimens, BH3 profiling on pretreatment and post-treatment bloods samples to assess whether add on treatment with PIT increases apoptotic priming. In dynamic BH3 profiling, the degree of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) after exposure to drug is compared to the untreated baseline to quantify the change in priming or induced by exposure to a drug., Samples will be collected for BH3 profiling at the following timepoints: prior to initiation of VEN treatment, Cycle 1 Day 1 Pre-PIT dose and predose Cycle 1 Day 2. Each cycle is 28 days.
