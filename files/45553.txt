SABR Including Regional Lymph Node Irradiation for Patients With High Risk Prostate Cancer (SATURN)
Current treatment options for high risk localized prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy +/- postoperative radiotherapy, radical radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy. Evidence has emerged that prostate cancer has a low α/β ratio in the range of 1-3 Gy. Even with high risk tumors, prostate cancer is hypothesized to have a greater sensitivity to large fraction sizes and high dose per fraction radiotherapy theoretically allows for biological dose escalation with fewer visits and no additional toxicity. Therefore, we hope to determine the toxicity, quality of life, biochemical and pathological control of SBRT for high risk prostate cancer incorporating ENI.
