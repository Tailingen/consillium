Study on the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumor With Revottack and PD-1 Inhibitor
This is a one arm, open clinical pharmacological exploration study initiated by researchers to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vesicular stomatitis oncolytic virus injection (Revottack) combined with PD-1 inhibitor in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity, immunogenicity, immune response, pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and shedding characteristics of Revottack injection combined with PD-1 inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This is a one arm, open clinical pharmacological exploration study initiated by researchers to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vesicular stomatitis oncolytic virus injection (Revottack) combined with PD-1 inhibitor in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.

This study is planned to enroll 6-10 patients with advanced solid tumors. Subjects will receive the administration of revottack and PD-1( Toripalimab)inhibitor at a given time.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity, immunogenicity, immune response, pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and shedding characteristics of Revottack injection combined with PD-1 inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumors.
