Building Resiliency Among Caregivers of Curvivors and Metavivors
The main purpose of this research study is to assess the feasibility and participants' satisfaction of the Stress Management and Resiliency - Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) and compare this treatment with SMART-3RP versus referral to a group-based, online support group to see which is better for improving resilience and decreasing distress of participants with cancer and their caregivers.

The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:

Smart-3RP (virtual, mind-body group treatment program).
Stress|Cancer Diagnosis|Distress, Emotional
BEHAVIORAL: Smart-3RP|BEHAVIORAL: Enhanced Usual Care
Proportion of Enrolled Participants (Feasibility), Defined as the percent of survivors/caregivers who are eligible enroll, or ≥ 45% enrollment of eligible participants (≥96 enrolled of 213 eligible participants)., At Screening|Proportion of Intervention Satisfaction (Acceptability), Defined as the percent of survivors/caregivers who report overall intervention satisfaction, as 4/5 on Likert scales, or ≥ 75% of participants ( (≥72 of 96 participants)., At 3 months
Proportion of Study Retention (Feasibility), Defined as the percent of survivors/caregivers who complete the 3-month follow-up survey, or ≥ 70% of participants (≥67 of 96 participants)., At 3 months|Proportion of Intervention Session Completion (Feasibility), Defined as the percent of survivors/caregivers who attend at least 6 out of 9 intervention sessions, or ≥ 70% of participants (≥67 of 96 participants), up to 6 months|Improvement in Resilience (Exploratory outcome), Assessed by the Current Experiences Scale (CES), a 23-item measure., At baseline and 3 months|Improvement in stress coping (Exploratory outcome), Assessed with the Measure of Current Status (MOCS-A), a 13-item scale., At baseline and 3 months|Health care utilization (exploratory outcome), Having seen a primary care provider in past year, At baseline and 6 months|Reduction of Chronic Stress, Assessed cortisol level of hair samples, At baseline and 6 months
This pilot, randomized controlled trial assesses the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the Stress Management and Resiliency - Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) for improving resiliency and decreasing distress among caregivers and cancer survivors compared to enhanced usual care.

Participants will be randomly assigned into one of the study groups: Smart-3RP versus referral to a group-based, online support group. Randomization means that a participant is placed into a group by chance.

Participation in this study is expected to last about 180 days.

It is expected about 96 people made up of 48 patients and 48 caregivers will take part in this research study.
