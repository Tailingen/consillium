Treatment Free Remission After Combination Therapy With Ruxolitinib Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
The purpose of this study is to determine if adding Ruxolitinib to a Tyrone Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), prior to a second attempt at stopping a TKI will lead to prolonged treatment free remission (TFR).
Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Phase
DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: BCR-ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)
12 Month Treatment Free Remission (TFR), TFR rate after completion of 12 cycles of combination therapy., 12 months
Adverse Events Possibly Related to Study Treatment, Establish the adverse event profile of ruxolitinib in combination with BCR-ABL TKIs: Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0, that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment., Up to 30 days post treatment, approximately 13 months per participant
Incidence of Improved Scores in Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire, Number of participants with an improved score in 2 or more categories of the questionnaire at the end of the TFR phase, when compared to the score for the same questions when completed at the end of 12 cycles of combination therapy., Up to 48 months
All participants will have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and must have previously attempted to discontinue TKI therapy. All participants must be restarted on a TKI at the time of relapse in order to be eligible for this trial.

After completion of 12 cycles of combination therapy, eligible participants will remain in the TFR phase of the study for up to 36 months, and will have central polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing during the first 24 months. Therefore, the total duration of the trial will be approximately 48 months (12 months on combination treatment phase + 36 months in the TFR phase).
