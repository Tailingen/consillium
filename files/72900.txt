Efficacy and Safety of Oral Azacitidine (CC-486) Compared to Investigator's Choice Therapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Angioimmunoblastic T Cell Lymphoma
This study is a multicentric, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial. The study will be conducted in select countries in Europe and South Korea sponsored by LYSARC and in Japan sponsored by Celgene. There will be a combined enrollment target of 86 randomized patients, with approximately 14 randomized patients from Japan.

The enrollment to the randomized study will start at European sites in parallel to a safety run-in part in Japan. A safety run-in will be conducted to confirm the tolerability of oral azacitidine at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg QD in Asian patients. Once oral azacitidine at 200 mg QD is confirmed as tolerable, Asian patients from Japan and South Korea will start to be randomized into the main study. Additional patients (non-randomized) are anticipated to enroll to the safety run-in.

DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Romidepsin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on Local Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression (local assessment using Lugano Response Criteria 2014) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If a participant has not progressed or died, PFS will be censored at the time of last visit with adequate assessment. C2 censoring rules were used per US FDA guidance 2015. Progression will be determined as per Response criteria for lymphoma: Lugano classification., From randomization up to documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 15 months)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. OS was censored at the last date that the participant was known to be alive., From randomization up to the date of death or date last known alive (up to approximately 27 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on IRC Assessment, PFS based on Independant Review Committee (IRC) is defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression (reviewed assessment by IRC using Lugano Response Criteria 2014) or death due to any cause. If a patient has not progressed or died, PFS will be censored at the time of last visit with adequate assessment per FDA's guidance 2015 Table C2. Progression will be determined as per Response criteria for lymphoma: Lugano classification., From randomization up to documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 37 months)|Overall Response Rates (ORR), Overall response rates are the percentage of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) per local assessment. Assessment of response will be based on Lugano Response Criteria 2014 for the radiologic response (CT based), the metabolic response (PET-CT based) and the best response between radiologic and metabolic response. Measurements occurred after Cycle 3, after Cycle 6, and at permanent treatment discontinuation. PR is defined as Score 4 or 5 with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size and ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites. CR is defined as target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi, no extralymphatic sites of disease, and Score 1, 2, or 3 with or without a residual mass on the 5 Point Scale. The Lugano 5-point scale is 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake mediastinum; 3, uptake mediastinum but liver; 4, uptake moderately liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions., Response rate will be measured after Cycle 3, after Cycle 6 (up to approximately 5.5 months)|Complete Response Rate (CRR), Complete response rate is the percentage of CR (complete metabolic response or CT-based CR) per local assessment before receiving any subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy. Assessment will be based on Lugano Response Criteria 2014 for the radiologic response (CT based), the metabolic response (PET-CT based) and best response between radiologic and metabolic response. Measurements occurred after Cycle 3, Cycle 6, and treatment discontinuation. PR is defined as Score 4 or 5 with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size and ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites. CR is defined as target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi, no extralymphatic sites of disease, and Score 1, 2, or 3 with or without a residual mass. The Lugano 5-point scale is 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake mediastinum; 3, uptake mediastinum but liver; 4, uptake moderately liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions., Response rate will be measured after Cycle 3, after Cycle 6 (up to approximately 5.5 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the time from attainment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per local assessment to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse (local assessment) or death from any cause. Participants alive and free of progression will be censored at their last visit with adequate assessment.CR: complete metabolic response or computed tomography (CT)-based CR; PR: partial metabolic response or CT-based PR before subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy., From randomization to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse (local assessment) or death from any cause (up to approximately 27 months)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response is defined as the time from randomization to the date of attainment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per local assessment until end of treatment. If a participant is not responder, time to response will be censored at the time of last visit with adequate assessment. CR: complete metabolic response or computed tomography (CT)-based CR; PR: partial metabolic response or CT-based PR before subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy., From randomization to the date of attainment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until end of treatment (up to approximately 37 months)|Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2) on Local Assessment, PFS2 based on local assessment is defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression on next-line treatment or death from any cause. Participants without next-line therapy who did not die and participants who did not relapse or not die after next-line therapy will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date., From randomization to objective tumor progression on next-line treatment or death from any cause (up to approximately 27 months)|Mean Change in Minimal Important Differences (MIDs) of the EORTC QLQ-C30 Health-related Quality-of-Life Domain Scores, The minimal important difference (MID) is the size of difference in Quality-of-Life score that is considered relevant (i.e. warranting a change in treatment or examinations). The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQC30) subscale values are the lower threshold for MID over time, based on within-group mean change. QLQ-C30 has 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain), a global health status / quality of life (QoL) scale, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each scale was scored on a range from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent a higher response level. Note that a high score for global health status or for a functional scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems., At baseline and on Day 1 of each cycle up to treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 27 months)
