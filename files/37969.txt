Study of Milciclib in Patients With Unresectable/Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The primary aim of this exploratory study is to test the safety and tolerability of milciclib when administered orally at 100 mg in patients with recurrent or metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma. The evaluation of the efficacy profile is a secondary objective of the study. Moreover, markers expression in tumor cells and plasma will be studied and described in association with the clinical outcome.

Eligible patients will receive milciclib orally on a daily schedule for 4 consecutive days a week in a 4-week cycle (4 days on/3 days off x q4 wks) for a total of 12 weeks (i.e. 3 cycles) unless patient refusal, consent withdrawal, Investigator's decision, unacceptable toxicity or death whichever occurs earlier.

At the end of Cycle 3, treatment will be stopped, and based on the results of the tumor assessment performed on Day 90 (±3 days) from treatment start, patients will be followed as here below detailed:

* patients with Complete Response (CR)/Partial Response (PR)/Stable Disease (SD) will be followed for safety until 30 days from last dose intake (or until a new anticancer therapy starts, whichever occurs earlier) and will be assessed for efficacy in the follow-up period up to Day 180 from treatment start;
* patients with progressive disease will be followed only for safety until 30 days from last dose intake (or until a new anticancer therapy starts, whichever occurs earlier).

After the completion of three cycles, patients who, in the Investigator's judgment, are benefiting from treatment with milciclib, will resume treatment and will remain on study up to Day 180 from treatment start, unless withdrawal criteria are met earlier.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Milciclib maleate
Overall Safety Profile, Overall safety profile, evaluated on the basis of laboratory (i.e. hematology and blood chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, ophthalmologic examinations) and adverse events emerging during the trial, will be determined. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 will be used for the severity grading of adverse events and of hematological and blood chemistry abnormalities, From Informed Consent signature to 30 days after last dose intake up to Day 180 from treatment start
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed CR. The objective tumor assessment will be made according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Conventional RECIST 1.1 will be also assessed. ORR will be assessed locally and confirmed by an Independent Central Review., At screening; During treatment at Day 45 and 90; During follow up at Day 180 for patients not progressed at previous assessments|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed PR.
