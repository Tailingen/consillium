Window of Opportunity Study in Colorectal Cancer
This is a window of opportunity translational study investigating the use of pre-operative pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in non-metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: CAPEOX|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Capecitabine/ 5-FU|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: CAPEOX/Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab alone|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection
Tumour immune gene expression signature, Gene expression of key immune genes will be assayed and immune gene expression scores such as IFN-gamma Gene Expression Profile (GEP) signature score (Ayers et al. 2017 JCI) will be compared before (biopsy) and after treatment (surgery)., From time of first tumour biopsy before treatment to time of tumour resection performed 1-3 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment|Pathology regression, A change in viable tumour after treatment will be measured by pathologist using tumour regression grade and major pathologic regression., From time of first tumour biopsy before treatment to time of tumour resection performed 1-3 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment|Immune T-cell infiltration before and after treatment, The change in immune cell infiltration will be measured by pathologists through immunohistochemistry and/or immuno-fluorescence., From time of first tumour biopsy before treatment to time of tumour resection performed 1-3 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment
Relative proportion/ percentage of the different immune cell states or immune cell types as inferred from single cell or bulk gene expression profiling, Single cell RNA sequencing, bulk genomics \& bulk transcriptomics will be used to describe the enrichment of different immune cell states or cell types, At time of tumour resection performed 1-3 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment|Relative distribution (percentage) of immune cells with specific expression of lineage markers, Flow cytometry will be used to determine the proportions of immune cell types with specific lineage marker expression including CD45, CD4, CD8, PDL1 and LAG3, At time of tumour resection performed 1-3 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment|Percentage of cell viability and cell death at fixed time points (e.g. 24 or 48 hours), Functional assays of immune cell immunoreactivity will be used to determine the proportion of target cell kill of paired immune cell and target cell, At time of tumour resection performed 1-3 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment
Patients with radiologically-assessed locally advanced non-metastatic colorectal cancer will receive the following treatment before surgery:

Newly Diagnosed Colon cancers:

One cycle of CAPEOX chemotherapy Two cycles of Pembrolizumab on Day 1 (concurrent with CAPEOX chemotherapy) and Day 22.

Newly Diagnosed Rectal cancers:

Following completion of chemo-radiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/ capecitabine, patients will receive 2 cycles of Pembrolizumab given 3 weeks apart.

Colon and Rectal Cancer Patients Referred for Pre-Operative Chemotherapy:

Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg 3-weekly for a maximum of 6 doses to be administered along with XELOX chemotherapy and additional 1 dose pembrolizumab 200 mg followed by standard of care (SOC) tumour resection.

Pre-operative biopsy and surgical samples as well as blood will be collected for translational studies.
