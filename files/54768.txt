Vibro-Acoustography Imaging in Finding Breast Microcalcifications and Lesions in Women
RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as vibro-acoustography imaging, may be an effective method of finding microcalcifications and lesions in the breast.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vibro-acoustography imaging works in finding breast microcalcifications and lesions in women.
Breast Cancer
Further development of a new method of in vivo imaging of the breast using vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging, one day
OBJECTIVES:

* To further develop a new method of in vivo imaging of the breast using vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging.
* To demonstrate and evaluate the capability of VA imaging in detecting microcalcifications and lesions inside the human breast.

OUTLINE: Participants undergo vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging of the breast using ultrasonography over 90 minutes. Participants may also undergo further imaging using clinical ultrasonography.
