Pirfenidone in Children and Young Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type I and Progressive Plexiform Neurofibromas
Background:

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, progressive genetic disorder characterized by diverse clinical manifestations. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of developing tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including plexiform neurofibromas, which are benign nerve sheath tumors that may cause severe morbidity and possible mortality. The histopathology of these tumors suggests that events connected with formation of fibroblasts might constitute a point of molecular vulnerability. Gene profile analysis demonstrates overexpression of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor in plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1. Pirfenidone is a novel antifibrotic agent that inhibits these and other growth factors. Clinical experience in adults has demonstrated that pirfenidone is effective in a variety of fibrosing conditions and pirfenidone is presently under study in a phase II trial for adults with progressive plexiform neurofibromas. A phase I trial of pirfenidone in children and young adults with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas was completed, and has established the phase II dose (the dose resulting in a mean drug exposure \[AUC\] not more than 1 standard deviation below the mean drug exposure \[AUC\] in adults who received pirfenidone at the dose level demonstrating activity in fibrosing conditions). Pirfenidone has been well tolerated.

Objectives:

To determine whether pirfenidone increases the time to disease progression based on volumetric measurements in children and young adults with NF1 and growing plexiform neurofibromas.

To define the objective response rate to pirfenidone in NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas.

To describe and define the toxicities of pirfenidone.

Eligibility:

Individuals (greater than or equal to 3 years to less than or equal to 21 years of age) with a clinical diagnosis of NF1 and inoperable, measurable, and progressive plexiform neurofibromas that have the potential to cause substantial morbidity.

Design:

The phase II dose will be used in a single stage, single arm phase II trial The natural history of the growth of plexiform neurofibromas is unknown. For this reason, time to disease progression on the placebo arm of an ongoing National Cancer Institute (NCI) Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over phase II trial of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 for children and young adults with NF1 and progressive plexiform neurofibromas.

For the detailed list of adverse events see the adverse event module., 5 years|Percentage of Participants Who Had an Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).

Quality of Life (QOL) Using the Impact of Pediatric Illness (IPI) Scale at Baseline, Quality of life was assessed by the Impact of Pediatric Illness scale for children 6-18 years of age. The child's primary caregiver completed the proxy Parent Form and children answered either the self-report Child or Adolescent (11-18 years) Form. The parallel IPI Scale forms assess four domains: adaptive behavior, emotional functioning, medical/physical status, and cognitive functioning. Responses to the 43 items are made on a 3-or5-point Likert scale (1 to 5 for Parent and Adolescent Form and 1, 3, 5 for the Child Form) ranging from "not at all" to "a lot". Item scores are transformed to a scale of 0-100, and then mean scores are calculated for the four domains and total scale with higher scores indicating better QOL. Baseline comparisons between child and parent total and domain scores were performed., Baseline|Longitudinal Total Quality of Life Scores Assessed by the Impact of Pediatric Illness Scale, Quality of life was assessed by the Impact of Pediatric Illness scale for children 6-18 years of age.
