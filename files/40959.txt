Preoperative Y-90 Radioembolization for Tumor Control and Future Liver Remnant Hypertrophy in Patients With Colorectal Liver Metastases
A prospective, interventional study evaluating the safety of Y-90 TARE for tumor control of the right side and induction of left liver hypertrophy as part of a planned single-stage or two-stage hepatectomy for patients with CLM and insufficient FLR at the time of presentation.

The evaluation from using the feasibility of Y-90 TARE directed to the right hemi-liver for induction of left liver FLR hypertrophy as part of a planned hepatectomy for patients with CLM., through study completion, an average of 1 year|The evaluation of using the safety of Y-90 TARE directed to the right hemi-liver for induction of left liver FLR hypertrophy as part of a planned hepatectomy for patients with CLM., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

To examine the safety and feasibility of Y-90 TARE directed to the right hemi-liver for induction of left liver FLR hypertrophy as part of a planned hepatectomy for patients with CLM.

Secondary Objectives:

* To describe changes in liver volume after Y-90 TARE, including:

  * The kinetic growth rate (KGR) of the FLR
  * Degree of hypertrophy 6 weeks after TARE
  * Atrophy of targeted right hemi-liver from TARE date to date of surgery
* To describe additional interventional procedures needed to induce additional hypertrophy if insufficient hypertrophy from Y-90 TARE
* To assess the proportion of TARE patients who undergo attempted and complete curative-intent resection of CLM
* To assess measures of disease control, including:

  * Tumor marker trend
  * RECIST/mRECIST criteria
  * CT morphologic response
  * PET CT response
* To describe Patient Reported Outcomes using MDASI-GI
* To assess FLR liver quality, right-sided surgical adhesions from TARE intraoperatively
* To describe dosimetry of individual liver lesions - using SPECT/CT, CT, and pathology correlation
* To describe change in liver function measured by the pre- and post-TARE HIDA SPECT/CT scans and hepatic function blood tests
