Clinical Effects of Large Segmental Bone Defects With 3D Printed Titanium Implant
The investigators apply 3D printed titanium implant to treat bone defects. Without using bone grafts and growth factors, the investigators anticipate the titanium implant alone can help bone reconstruction.
Large Segmental Bone Defect
DEVICE: 3D printed titanium implant
Bone reconstruction, X-rays and CT scans are used to evaluate the bone reconstruction, 1 year
Questionnaire of limb function, Restoration of limb function., 1 year
Questionnaire of patients' satisfaction degree, VAS score is used to evaluate the satisfaction degree. The score ranges from 0 to 10, 0 means very dissatisfied and 10 means very satisfied., 1 year
The investigators treat large segmental bone defects caused by three reasons, including trauma, infection and tumor. In this study, polyporous 3D printed titanium implant is applied to reconstruct the bone defects and the investigators will follow up patients' function and bone regeneration.
