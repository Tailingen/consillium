Phase I Clinical Trial of Human Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Injection (LDP) in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This is a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of LDP in subjects with advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Tumors
DRUG: Whole Human Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Injection (LDP)
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity (DLT), An DLT is defined as a ≥Grade 3 drug-related adverse event occurring within the first cycle (28 days) of dosing (excluding tumor flare causing local pain at sites of known or suspected tumor, localized rash, or a transient ≤Grade 3 infusion reaction) using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., At the end of Cycle 1 (28 days).|Maximum tolerable dose (MTD), MTD refers to the highest dose which can satisfy the first cycle of the same dose group and the proportion of DLT occurring is less than 1/3 in the incremental dose stage. The dose of MTD required confirmation by 6 subjects., At the end of Cycle 1 (28 days).
Pharmacokinetic parameters: Observed Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of LDP After Infusion, Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax for LDP, Up to 22 Days|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Sampling Time (AUC0-t) After Infusion AUC(0-t) for LDP, AUC(0-t) for LDP, Up to 22 Days|Pharmacokinetic parameters: Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-00) After Infusion Pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC(0-00) for LDP, Pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC(0-00) for LDP, Up to 22 Days|Pharmacokinetic parameters: Apparent Terminal Half-life (t1/2) of LDP After Infusion, Pharmacokinetic parameters T1/2 for LDP, Up to 22 Days|Immunogenicity indicators: Number of participants with positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Immunogenicity indicators: Number of participants with positive anti-drug, Up to 176 Days|Immunogenicity indicators: Number of participants with positive neutralizing antibodies, Immunogenicity indicators: Number of participants with positive neutralizing antibodies, Up to 176 Days|Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1., From first dose of LDP through 21 days after last dose of LDP up to 2 years.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with LDP until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From first dose of LDP through 21 days after last dose of LDP up to 2 years.
This trial is an open, dose escalation phase I clinical trial study of patients with advanced cancer who have failed standard treatment. The trial is divided into a dose escalation phase and an expansion phase.

Approximately 130 patients will be enrolled in this trial. The dose-increasing phase is about 30 cases, and the expansion stage is about 100 cases.
