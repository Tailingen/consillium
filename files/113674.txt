Confirmatory Clinical Evaluation of NovilaseÂ® Laser Therapy for Focal Destruction of Malignant Breast Tumors
Prior to this confirmatory pivotal study, the multicenter Br-002 feasibility study was completed. 98% of tumors less than or equal to 15mm were completely ablated in one procedure.This study will evaluate Novilase for the focal destruction of malignant tumors of the breast that are less than or equal to 15 mm against a performance goal for the standard of care, lumpectomy. The ASBrS' goal of less than 20% retreatment by 2020 was selected as a representative performance goal, i.e., 80.0%, and is consistent with published effectiveness rates for lumpectomy.
Malignant Neoplasm of Breast
DEVICE: Novilase Laser ablation
Percentage of target tumors completely ablated in one procedure, Efficacy: Rate of complete ablation by Novilase laser ablation, 4-6 weeks|Frequency of adverse events (categorized using the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 guidelines) post-laser ablation and post-surgery, Safety: frequency of AEs, 4-6 weeks
Patient reported rate of return to activities of daily living post-laser ablation and post-surgery, Rate of recovery, 4-6 weeks|Physician reported cosmetic satisfaction, utilizing the 4-point scoring system of breast cosmesis in protocol (e.g., excellent, good, fair, poor) post-laser ablation and post-surgery (4-6 weeks), Post-procedure cosmetic satisfaction, 4-6 weeks|Health related quality of life outcome measures at three timepoints via EORTC QLQ-C30 & QLQ-BR23 questionnaire (baseline and 4-6 weeks post-laser ablation and post-surgery), Health-related quality of life outcome measures, 4-6 weeks
Subjects with biopsy-diagnosed malignant breast tumors less than or equal to 15 mm will be invited to participate. Subjects will receive a screening MRI and if eligible will then have laser ablation, followed by MRI and an excision at 4-6 weeks following the laser procedure. This study will be deemed successful if the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients who have complete tumor ablation with one Novilase laser ablation procedure at 4-6 weeks post-procedure is greater than the performance goal. Specifically, Novilase will have demonstrated success if the complete tumor ablation rate is greater than 87.85%.
