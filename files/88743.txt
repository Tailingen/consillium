11C-Methionine PET as Prognostic Marker of Gliomas
This is a retrospective study that involves the revision of clinical, instrumental and pathologic data of an estimated cohort of maximum 145 patients with glioma treated with surgery with radical intent at our center.
Glioma
OTHER: No intervention
Correlation of SUVmax (Maximal Standardized Uptake Value) in patients with glioma undergoing surgery with IDH1 mutation, MGMT promoter methylation and 1p/19q co-deletion,, Baseline SUVmax up to 1 month before surgery.
This is a retrospective observation that involves the revision of clinical, instrumental and pathologic data of an estimated cohort of 145 patients with glioma treated with surgery with radical intent at our center.

We will review 11C-Methionine PET data acquired within 30 days prior to surgery and analyze its principal imaging characteristics with respect to IDH1 mutation status, MGMT promoter methylation and 1p/19q co-deletion. These markers will be studied on tumor tissue obtained at surgery, used for diagnostic purposes and stored in paraffin.
