Comparison Between Bilateral Infraorbital Block Versus Intranasal Bupivacaine in Transsphenoidal Pituitary Adenoma Resection
The study will evaluate the efficacy of bilateral infraorbital nerve block versus preoperative nasal packing with long-acting local anesthetic bupivacaine in term of maintaining hemodynamics intraoperative within 20% below baseline to achieve adequate hypotensive anesthesia and longer duration of postoperative analgesia up to 24 hours in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection.
Intraoperative Hypertension
PROCEDURE: infraorbital block|PROCEDURE: topical intranasal bupivacaine
Mean arterial blood pressure, at the time of mucosal dissection
Intraoperative need for magnesium sulphate, Intraoperative need for iv magnesium sulphate up to 3 mg to maintain blood pressure 20% below baseline, the entire duration of surgery|Intraoperative need for fentanyl, Intraoperative need for iv fentanyl blouses 0.5 μg/kg (maximum total dose 5 μg/kg for the entire procedure) if no response to magnesium sulphate, the entire duration of surgery|Intraoperative need for nitroglycerine, Intraoperative need for iv nitroglycerine infusion (5 - 100 mic/min iv) if no response to magnesium sulphate and fentanyl, the entire duration of surgery|Postoperative need of pethidine, Postoperative need of pethidine boluses 25 mg with max.100 mg, 24 hours postoprative|Postoperative pain assessed by Numeric pain score, Pain score will be assessed postoperatively (using the verbal Numeric Rating Scale \[NRS\] 0-100; 0 = Non ,100 = Worst imaginable pain), 24 hours postoprative
