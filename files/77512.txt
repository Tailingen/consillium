Postoperative recovery time, Postoperative day patient is ready for discharge, defined as the day the patient has the ability to walk alone, take care of herself, and ingest at least 75% of the daily caloric needs, Up to 30 postoperative days
Complications and Adverse Effects, Complications and Adverse Effects according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 2017, Up to 30 postoperative days|Readmissions, Readmission to the Hospital Facilities, Up to 30 postoperative days|Intensive Care Unit admission rates, Postoperative Intensive Care Unit admission and stay, Up to 30 postoperative days|Health-related Quality of Life, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), At Baseline, the week before surgery, then at postoperative days 7, 30 and 60|Compliance to the ERAS® program guideline, Compliance to ERAS® protocol and implementation of the program, Up to 30 postoperative days|Changes in anxiety and depression from baseline, Changes in anxiety and depression will be examined using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Scores for each sub scale (depression and anxiety) are summed-up and range from 0 to 21. Values from 0-7 indicate normal levels, 8-10 are border values and values from 11-21 are considered to be pathological., At Baseline, the week before surgery, then at postoperative days 7, 30 and 60|Changes in functional capacity from baseline, Patients will perform a 6-Minute Walk Test, At Baseline, the week before surgery, then at postoperative days 30 and 60|Change in muscle strength, Muscle strength is measured by using an dynamometer, At Baseline, the week before surgery, then at postoperative days 30 and 60|Change in body mass, Body mass is measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis, At Baseline, the week before surgery, then at postoperative days 30 and 60|Hospital stay, Days from surgical procedure to hospital discharge, Up to 30 days|Use of opioids in acute postoperative pain, Use and dosage of opioids in the postoperative period, Up to 30 days
Prospective, interventionist and randomized controlled trial in a 1: 1 ratio, open to multidisciplinary team and blind to surgeons and anaesthesiologists. The aim is test the effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation protocol in patients who will undergo gynecological surgery.

The multidisciplinary prehabilitation program will be applied to the intervention group. For the group participating in the prehabilitation and for the control group, specific recommendations for gynecological cancer defined by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) guidelines will be applied.
