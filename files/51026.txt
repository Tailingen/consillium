Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Modeling in Adult Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Sarcoma
Patients with recurrent or metastatic sarcoma will be consented to develop a patient derived xenograft (PDX or TumorGraft) model of their tumor to perform drug sensitivity testing. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of the patient derived xenograft (PDX) model in predicting patient clinical response to the same drug treatment.

OTHER: PDX drug sensitivity testing
Number of patients' whose personalized PDX model accurately predicts clinical response to therapy with same drug treatment., Overall accuracy as assessed by evaluating Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patient tumor and correlating to tumor regression in PDX model for same drug treatment., 3 years
Number of patients' whose personalized PDX model accurately predicts clinical response to therapy over subsequent lines of therapy., Overall accuracy as assessed by evaluating RECIST criteria in patient and correlating to tumor regression in PDX model for same drug treatment, over subsequent lines of therapy., 3 years|Factors that impact on engraftment success., % engraftment of tumor as a function of patient and tumor characteristics., 2 years|Factors that impact time to drug sensitivity testing., Time to PDX drug sensitivity testing as a function of patient and tumor characteristics., 2 years
