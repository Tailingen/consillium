Rituximab and/or Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma That is Not Refractory to Rituximab
Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Lenalidomide may also stop the growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving rituximab together with lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells. This randomized phase II trial is studying how well rituximab and/or lenalidomide work in treating patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is not refractory to rituximab.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|DRUG: lenalidomide
Overall Response Rate, Response is assessed by investigator according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria. A complete response requires disappearance of all evidence of disease. A partial response is a \>/= 50% decrease in the sum of products of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses as well as for splenic and hepatic nodules. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease., Duration of treatment (12 cycles)|Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from study entry until progression or death without progression. The median TTP with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 10 years
Outline:

This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Please see the "Arms" section for a description of each treatment arm. The primary and secondary objectives of the study are provided below.

Primary Objectives:

* To determine the response rate (overall and complete) after lenalidomide therapy and rituximab + lenalidomide in follicular NHL patients who have relapsed.
* To determine time to progression after lenalidomide therapy and rituximab and lenalidomide in follicular NHL patients who have relapsed.

Secondary Objectives:

* To compare the time to progression of the previous rituximab regimen to that obtained subsequently to lenalidomide therapy and rituximab + lenalidomide.
* To determine the toxicity profile of lenalidomide therapy and of rituximab and lenalidomide in follicular NHL patients who have received a previous rituximab regimen.
* To correlate Fc receptor polymorphism profiling with response to lenalidomide or rituximab + lenalidomide in previously treated patients with follicular NHL who have relapsed.
* To evaluate changes in Natural Killer (NK) cells, activated NK cells, activated T-cells and several plasma cytokines followed by rituximab therapy and correlation of observed changes to objective response rates.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 10 years from study entry.
