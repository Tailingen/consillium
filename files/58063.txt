Application Circulating Tumor DNA Dynamic Monitoring in Clinical Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Next-Generation Sequencing and whole transcriptome RNA sequencing were used to detect genomic variation and expression in tissues or blood, respectively. The treatment outcome of single targeted therapy or combined with immunotherapy was observed and followed up. Through this study, we intend to achieve RNA molecular classification of Chinese mRCC patients and to evaluate the correlation between ctDNA level, RNA molecular classification and treatment outcome, provide reference for metastatic RCC precise diagnosis and treatment.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: sunitinib or pazopanib|DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor combined with axitinib
progression-free survival, From drug taken until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 20 months
Objective Response Rate, From drug taken until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 20 months
