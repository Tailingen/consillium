A Study to Compare Immune Response of V503 to Gardasil in 16- to 26-year-old Men (V503-020)
Primary objective

To demonstrate that administration of V503 induces non-inferior Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) for serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, compared to GARDASIL in 16- to 26-year-old men
Papilloma Viral Infection
BIOLOGICAL: V503|BIOLOGICAL: GARDASIL
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to HPV Types 6/11/16/18, Serum antibodies to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were measured with a Competitive Luminex Immunoassay. Titers are reported in milli Merck Units/mL., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)
GMTs to HPV Types 31/33/45/52/58, Serum antibodies to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 were measured with a Competitive Luminex Immunoassay. Titers are reported in milli Merck Units/mL., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)|Percentage of Participants Who Are Seropositive for HPV Types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58, Serum antibodies to HPV types were measured with a Competitive Luminex Immunoassay. The serostatus cutoffs (milli Merck U/mL) for HPV types were as follows: HPV Type 6: ≥30; HPV Type 11: ≥16; HPV Type 16: ≥20; HPV Type 18: ≥24; HPV Type 31: ≥10; HPV Type 33: ≥8; HPV Type 45: ≥8; HPV Type 52: ≥8; HPV Type 58: ≥8., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)|Percentage of Participants With One or More Adverse Events, The percentage of participants with one or more adverse events was assessed., Up to 15 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With Study Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event, The percentage of participants discontinued from the study due to an adverse event was assessed., Up to Month 7|Percentage of Participants With One or More Injection-site Adverse Reactions, The percentage of participants with one or more injection-site adverse reactions (solicited or unsolicited) was assessed., Up to 5 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With Maximum Temperature ≥37.8 °C, The percentage of participants with a maximum temperature ≥37.8 °C was assessed., Up to 5 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With One or More Systemic Adverse Events, The percentage of participants with one or more systemic adverse events was assessed., Up to 15 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Events, The percentage of participants with one or more serious adverse events was assessed., Up to 15 days after any vaccination
Secondary objectives

* To evaluate the tolerability of V503 in 16- to 26-year-old men.
* To summarise humoral immune responses, including anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 GMTs and seroconversion rates at 4 weeks post-dose 3, in 16- to 26-year-old men who received V503 or GARDASIL
