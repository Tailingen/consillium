Visualizing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Producing Lesions in Von Hippel-Lindau Disease
Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHLD) is an inherited syndrome characterized by vascular malformations, kidney cancer, adrenal gland and pancreas tumors. The VHL protein is not functional in the different disease associated lesions which results in production of high amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Currently there are no clinical, radiographic or molecular markers that can predict the natural history of a given lesion. With 89Zr-bevacizumab positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, VEGF can be visualized and quantified.

The investigators hypothesize that 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging is a useful tool to predict the behaviour of disease associated lesions in patients with VHLD.

Adult patients with VHLD who have had routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of central nervous system (CNS) and abdomen will undergo a 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan. MRI will be repeated within 12 months.

Detection rate of VHL associated lesions with 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scans in patients with VHLD, An 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan will be performed within 6 weeks after routine MRI CNS investigation, MRI will be repeated within 12 months.
Progressive lesions within 12 months, defined as new lesions or lesions that show an increase in size of at least 5% of the longest diameter on MRI, or lesions that become symptomatic, The baseline MRI scan will be compared with a follow-up MRI scan within 12 months
