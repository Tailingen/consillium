Blood Sample Collection to Evaluate Biomarkers in Subjects With Untreated Melanoma
The primary objective of this study is to obtain de-identified, clinically characterized, whole blood specimens to evaluate biomarkers associated with cancer for diagnostic assay development.
Melanoma
OTHER: Blood Sample Collection
Blood-based biomarkers associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations., Biomarkers under evaluation include differential methylation of nucleic acids and altered expression of proteins in blood from subjects with melanoma at the pre-intervention stage., Point in time blood collection (1 day) at enrollment
Subjects will have been recently diagnosed with untreated melanoma. Subjects will have a blood sample collected at enrollment and provide medical history prior to initiation of treatment. There will be no further follow-up.
