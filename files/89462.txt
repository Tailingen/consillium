Interest of Procore NeedleÂ® for Diagnosis of Lung Cancer
The ProCore ultrasound biopsy needle, used primarily to obtain intra-abdominal tissue core biopsies, has not been widely used for endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In this study the investigators are going to evaluate the utility of the ProCore needle for sampling mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes during EBUS-TBNA versus standard 22 gauge needle for diagnosis of lung cancer.
