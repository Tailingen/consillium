Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of U3-1565 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open label study to assess the safety and tolerability of U3 1565, determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or establish maximum administered dose (MAD) safety and tolerability.
Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors|Advanced Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: U3-1565

determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or tolerability of maximum administered dose (MAD)., 12 months|Greatest percent reduction in the sum of longest diameters (SLD) of measurable tumors, if applicable, after U3 1565 treatment, 24 months|Changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers in blood and other body fluid specimens, Changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers in blood and other body fluid specimens (such as soluble HB-EGF and CA125 in serum and ascites) and tumor biopsies after U3 1565 treatment., 24 months|Changes in tumor perfusion and vascularity after U3-1565 treatment using Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE MRI), 24 months
This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a dose-escalation phase corresponding to Part 1 and a dose-expansion phase articulated in 2 concomitant parts (i.e., Parts 2a and 2b).

All parts of this study are single arm and open label. In all parts, tumor assessments will be performed at screening and every 3 cycles thereafter, while the subject remains on study. U3-1565 clinical activity will be assessed measuring tumor response by physical examination and imaging according to RECIST version 1.1, if applicable.
