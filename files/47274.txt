Molecular Guided Therapy for Refractory or Recurrent Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (ability to be done) of an experimental test to help plan your cancer treatment. This study plan is not studying the effectiveness of the proposed combinations of therapy for your cancer that you may receive after the experimental testing.

This study will look at an experimental technology to determine a tumor's molecular makeup (gene expression profile). This technology (called "OncInsights") is being used to discover new ways to understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with cancer in the future. The experimental technology has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Neuroblastoma
DEVICE: Guided Therapy
Percentage of Participants That Are Able to Meet Feasibility Parameters., Feasibility parameter defined as: Enrollment onto study, quality mRNA obtained, gene chip completed, tumor board held, medical monitor review and approval, start of treatment by 21 days post biopsy/surgical resection date, and then completion of 1 cycle of therapy.", 1 year
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, To determine the safety of allowing a molecular tumor board to determine individualized treatment plans, 1 year|Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants Using RECIST Criteria, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year|Activity of Treatments Chosen Based on Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 1 year
