Depression|Physical Activity|Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Print-based education|DEVICE: Fitbit|BEHAVIORAL: Active Living counseling|OTHER: Facility Access
Moderate-to-vigorous Physical Activity Measured by Actigraph Accelerometer, Assess changes in physical activity at 6 months following physical activity intervention., 6 months
Depressive Symptoms Measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report(QIDS-SR), Assess changes in depressive symptoms at 6 months following physical activity intervention.

Title: Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report(QIDS-SR) Scoring: ranges from 0-27, higher scores indicate more severe symptomatology, 6 months
The research project is a pilot study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors with depression. Individuals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention with a 6 month follow up. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, and facility access. Blood samples will be collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points during the intervention (Weeks 7, 13, and 25). Changes in physical activity will be assessed using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of moderate/vigorous activity.
