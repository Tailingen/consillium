GCTs arise from primordial germ cells, which migrate during embryogenesis from the yolk sac through the mesentery to the gonads (see
Figure 1
).[

] Childhood extracranial GCTs   can generally be divided into gonadal and extragonadal. These tumors can also be broadly classified as teratomas, malignant GCTs, or mixed GCTs.

Incidence
Childhood GCTs are rare in children younger than 15
years, accounting for   approximately 3% of cancers in this age
group.[
3
-
6
] In the fetal/neonatal age group, most extracranial GCTs are benign teratomas occurring at midline locations, including the head and neck, sacrococcyx, and retroperitoneum.[
7
,
8
]  Despite the small percentage of malignant teratomas that occur in this age group,  perinatal tumors have a high morbidity rate caused by hydrops fetalis and premature delivery.[
8
-
10
]
The incidence of malignant extracranial GCTs increases with the onset of puberty. These tumors   represent approximately 15% of cancers in male adolescents aged 15 to 19 years and 4% of cancers in female adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
3
]
Figure 2
shows the age-incidence profile by sex for malignant extracranial/extragonadal  GCTs (left panel) and malignant gonadal GCTs (right panel) between  2014 and 2018 for 23 U.S. Cancer registries that represent 66% of all U.S. children, adolescents, and young adults (blue triangles, females; green triangles, males).[
3
] For males, there is a peak in incidence in children younger than 2 years for both extragonadal and gonadal sites, which is followed by low rates between the ages of 2 and 12 years, and then higher rates throughout adolescence. For females, the peak in young children is present only for extragonadal tumors, with rates increasing after the age of puberty for both extragonadal and gonadal sites. However, the incidence of  each tumor is lower for females during adolescence than for males during adolescence.

Risk Factors
Cryptorchidism, the presence of an abdominal undescended testis, has been associated with a 10.8-fold increased risk of developing a GCT.[
11
] Gonadal dysgenesis, as well as the presence of Y-chromosome material in an abdominal gonad, also increases the risk of developing a gonadal GCT, especially gonadoblastoma. Gonadoblastoma is a rare gonadal tumor consisting of a mixture of germ cells and sex-cord stromal derivatives resembling immature granulosa and Sertoli cells.[
12
,
13
]
There are few data about the potential genetic or environmental risk factors
associated with childhood extragonadal extracranial GCTs.  Patients with
the following syndromes are at an increased risk of extragonadal extracranial GCTs:
Klinefelter syndrome: Increased risk of mediastinal GCTs.[
14
-
17
]
Most mediastinal GCTs in adolescents and young adults occur in males, and 22% to 50% have cytogenetic changes consistent with Klinefelter syndrome.[
15
,
18
] The age of  tumor presentation is younger in patients with Klinefelter syndrome, and testing all younger males for Klinefelter syndrome should be considered.[
15
,
18
]
Patients with GCTs were identified from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Childhood Cancer Research Network.  Twenty-nine patients in the study had mediastinal primary tumors, and nine patients (31%) had Klinefelter syndrome. In the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's large 2013 WONDER database, 3% of patients with GCTs had Klinefelter syndrome  (70% were mediastinal). In comparison, 0.2% of males in the general population have Klinefelter syndrome.[
17
]
Swyer syndrome: Increased risk of gonadoblastomas and seminomas.[
19
,
20
]
Turner syndrome: Increased risk of gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas.[
21
,
22
]
Histological Classification of Childhood Extracranial GCTs
Childhood extracranial GCTs comprise a variety of histological
diagnoses and can be broadly classified as the following:
Teratomas.
Mature teratoma
.
Immature teratoma
.
Malignant GCTs
.
The histological properties of extracranial GCTs are heterogeneous and vary by primary tumor site and the sex and age of the patient.[
23
,
24
] Histologically identical GCTs that arise in younger children have different biological characteristics from those that arise in adolescents and young adults.[
25
]
Mature teratoma
Mature teratomas can occur at gonadal or at extragonadal locations. They are the most common histological subtype of childhood GCT.[
10
,
26
-
28
]  Mature teratomas usually contain well-differentiated tissues from the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ cell layers. Any tissue type may be found within this tumor.
Mature teratomas are benign, although some mature teratomas may secrete enzymes or hormones, including insulin, growth hormone, androgens, and prolactin.[
29
,
30
]
Immature teratoma
Immature teratomas contain tissues from the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ cell layers. Immature tissues, primarily neuroepithelial, are also present.  Immature teratomas are graded from 0 to 3 on the basis of the amount of immature neural tissue found in the tumor specimen.[
31
,
32
] Tumors of higher grade are more likely to have foci of yolk sac tumor.[
33
] Immature teratomas can exhibit malignant behavior and metastasize.
Immature teratomas occur primarily in young children at extragonadal sites and in the ovaries of girls near the age of puberty. However, there is no correlation between tumor grade and patient age.[
33
,
34
] Some immature teratomas may secrete enzymes or hormones such as vasopressin.[
35
]
Malignant GCTs
Most childhood extragonadal GCTs arise in midline sites (i.e., head and neck, sacrococcygeal, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal). The midline location may represent aberrant embryonic migration of the primordial germ cells.
GCTs contain malignant tissues of germ cell origin and, rarely, tissues of somatic origin.  Isolated malignant elements may constitute a small fraction of a predominantly mature or immature teratoma.[
34
,
36
]
Malignant germ cell elements of children, adolescents, and young adults can be grouped broadly by location (see
Table 2
).

GCT Biology
Childhood extracranial GCTs develop at many sites, including testicles, ovaries, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, sacrum, coccyx, and head and neck (see
Figure 3
).[
7
] The clinical features at presentation are specific for each site.
Enlarge
Figure 3.  Extracranial germ cell tumors form in parts of the body other than the brain.  This includes the testicles, ovaries, sacrococcyx (usually originating from the coccyx and including the sacrum), mediastinum, and retroperitoneum.
The following biologically distinct subtypes of GCTs are found in children and adolescents:
Testicular GCTs
.
Ovarian GCTs
.
Extragonadal extracranial GCTs
.
Biological distinctions between GCTs in children and GCTs in adults may not be absolute, and biological factors have not been shown to predict risk.[
38
-
40
]
Testicular GCTs
Children (aged <11 years):
During early childhood, both testicular teratomas and malignant testicular GCTs are identified. The malignant tumors are commonly composed of pure yolk sac tumor (also known as endodermal
sinus tumor) and are generally diploid or tetraploid. Up to approximately 44% of testicular GCTs contain
the isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12 (i12p) that characterizes testicular cancer in young adults.[
38
,
41
-
45
] Deletions of chromosomes 1p, 4q, 
and 6q and gains of chromosomes 1q, 3, and 20q are reported as recurring chromosomal abnormalities for this group
of tumors.[
43
-
46
]
Adolescents and young adults (aged ≥11 years):
Testicular GCTs in the adolescent and young adult population almost always possess an i12p chromosomal abnormality [
47
-
50
] and are aneuploid.[
41
,
50
]
Ovarian GCTs
Ovarian GCTs occur primarily in adolescent and young adult females. While most ovarian GCTs are benign mature teratomas (dermoid cysts), a heterogeneous group of malignant GCTs, including immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed GCTs, do occur in females.    The malignant ovarian GCT commonly shows increased copies of the short arm of chromosome 12.[
51
]
Extragonadal extracranial GCTs
Extragonadal extracranial GCTs occur outside of the brain and gonads.
Children (aged <11 years):
These tumors typically present at birth or during early childhood. Most of these tumors are benign teratomas occurring in the sacrococcygeal region, and thus are not included in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data.[
52
,
53
] Malignant yolk sac tumor histology occurs in a minority of these tumors; however, they may have cytogenetic abnormalities similar to those observed for tumors occurring in the testes of young males.[
42
-
44
,
46
] Mediastinal GCTs in children  younger than 8 years share the same genetic gains and losses as do sacrococcygeal and testicular tumors in young children.[
18
,
54
,
55
]
Older children, adolescents, and young adults (aged ≥11 years):
The mediastinum is the most common primary site for extragonadal GCTs in older children and adolescents.[
27

Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation
Diagnostic evaluation of GCTs includes measurement of serum tumor markers and imaging studies. In suspected cases, tumor markers can suggest the diagnosis before surgery and/or biopsy. This information can be used by the multidisciplinary team to make appropriate treatment choices.
Tumor markers
Tumor markers are measured with each cycle of chemotherapy for all pediatric patients with malignant GCTs. After initial chemotherapy, tumor markers may show a transient  elevation.[
56
]
Common tumor markers include the following:
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).
The fetal liver produces AFP, and during the first year of life, infants have elevated serum  AFP levels, which are not associated with the presence of a GCT. Normal ranges have been described.[
57
,
58
] The serum half-life of AFP is 5 to 7 days.
Yolk sac tumors produce AFP. Most children with malignant GCTs will have a component of yolk sac tumor and have elevations of AFP levels,[
59
,
60
] which are serially monitored during treatment to help assess response to therapy.[
34
,
36
,
59
] Benign teratomas and immature teratomas may produce small elevations of AFP and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin  (beta-hCG).
A COG study measured AFP levels in children who received chemotherapy for GCTs. AFP decline was defined as automatically satisfactory if AFP normalized after two cycles of chemotherapy and was calculated satisfactory if the AFP half-life decline was less than or equal to 7 days after the start of chemotherapy. Other decline in AFP was defined as unsatisfactory.[
61
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The cumulative incidence of relapse was 11%  for patients with a satisfactory decline in AFP (n = 117) and 38% for patients with an unsatisfactory decline in AFP (n = 14).
Beta-hCG.
Beta-hCG is produced by all choriocarcinomas and by some germinomas (seminomas and dysgerminomas) and embryonal carcinomas, resulting in elevated serum levels of these substances. The  serum half-life of beta-hCG is 1 to 2 days.
MicroRNAs.
In a prospective multicentric study, the serum level of microRNA-371a-3p was shown to be a sensitive and specific  biomarker for adult testicular GCTs.[
62
] The study included 616 patients with GCTs of varying histologies and 258 controls without malignant GCTs. Elevation of microRNA-371a-3p levels was noted in all malignant histologies, including seminomas. Normal controls and patients with benign teratomas did not have the biomarker elevation. MicroRNA-371a-3p levels were related to tumor volume, and the levels decreased in response to chemotherapy. More studies about microRNA-371a-3p are needed to assess its use in patients with pediatric GCTs.
Imaging tests
Imaging tests may include the following:
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.
CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the primary site.
Radionuclide bone scan, if clinically indicated.
MRI of the brain, if clinically indicated.
Prognostic Factors
Prognostic factors for extracranial GCTs depend on many patient and tumor characteristics and include the following (obtained  from historical national GCT trials):[
59
,
63
-
65
]
Age (e.g., young children vs. adolescents).
Stage of disease.
Primary site of disease.
Histology (e.g., seminomatous vs. nonseminomatous).
Tumor marker decline (AFP and beta-hCG) in response to therapy.
Presence of gonadal dysgenesis.
To better identify prognostic factors, data from five U.S. trials and two U.K. trials for malignant extracranial GCTs in children and adolescents were merged by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor International Collaborative.  The goal was to ascertain the important prognostic factors in 519 young patients who received chemotherapy, incorporating age at diagnosis, stage, and site of primary tumor, along with pretreatment AFP level and histology.[
66
][
Level of evidence C2
] In this age-focused investigation of these factors in young children and adolescents, outcomes included the following (see
Figure 4
):[
66
]
Patients aged 11 years and older with stage III or stage IV extragonadal disease or stage IV ovarian disease had a less than 70% likelihood of long-term disease-free survival, ranging from 40% (extragonadal stage IV) to 67% (ovarian stage IV).
Boys (aged 11 years and older) with International Germ Cell Consensus Classification [
67
] intermediate-risk or poor-risk features also had inferior outcomes.
Presence of a yolk sac tumor predicted better outcome, but it did not achieve statistical significance at the .05 level.
Preoperative AFP levels were not prognostic. Postoperative AFP levels were prognostic in adult men.[
67
]
A subsequent study used a database of 11 GCT trials and identified 593 patients with metastatic testicular, mediastinal, or retroperitoneal GCTs. The distribution of patients by age groups included 90 children (aged 0 to <11 years), 109 adolescents (aged 11 to <18 years), and 394 young adults (aged 18 to ≤30 years).[
67
]; [
68
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was lower for adolescents (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62%–79%) than it was for children (90%; 95% CI, 81%–95%;
P
= .003) or young adults (88%; 95% CI, 84%–91%;
P
= .0002).
After adjusting for the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification risk group,[
67
] only the difference in EFS between adolescents and children remained significant (hazard ratio, 0.30;
P
= .001).
Although few pediatric data exist, adult studies have shown that an unsatisfactory decline of elevated tumor markers after the first cycle of chemotherapy is a poor prognostic finding.[
69
,
70
]
The presence of gonadal dysgenesis in patients with ovarian nondysgerminomas is associated with worse outcomes. In a report from the COG
AGCT0132
study, seven patients with gonadal dysgenesis and ovarian nondysgerminomas had  an estimated 3-year EFS rate of 67%, compared with  89% for 100 patients with nondysgerminoma ovarian tumors  who did not have gonadal dysgenesis.[
13
] These dysgenetic gonads contain Y-chromosome material, and intra-abdominal gonads with Y-chromosome material are at increased risk of tumor development.[
12
,
71
] In contrast to nondysgerminomas, gonadal dysgenesis was identified in 7 of 48 patients  with ovarian dysgerminomas in a report from the French Society of Pediatric Oncology. With a medium follow-up of 14 years, all patients survived.[

Follow-up After Treatment
The following tests and procedures may be performed at the physician's discretion for monitoring children with extracranial GCTs:
AFP and beta-hCG.
Monitor AFP and beta-hCG levels monthly for 6 months  (period of highest risk) and then every 3 months, for a total of 2 years (3 years for sacrococcygeal teratoma).
A COG trial of patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk GCTs reported the following results:[
73
][
Level of evidence C2
]
Forty-eight patients with elevated tumor markers at diagnosis relapsed during the surveillance phase.
At the time of relapse (after central review), 47 of 48 (98%) relapses were detected by tumor marker elevation.
Imaging tests.
MRI/CT may be performed  at the completion of therapy.
Guided imaging of the primary site may be performed every 3 months for the first year and every six months for the second year. Seminomas and dysgerminomas may recur later, so the imaging schedule may need to be extended.
Chest x-ray annually.
When tumor markers are normal at diagnosis, ultrasonography or CT/MRI may be performed every 3 months for 2 years and then annually for 5 years for germinomas.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.[
74
] Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
,
74
,
75
] During the period from 2002 to 2010, cancer mortality continued to decrease by 2.4% per year for children and adolescents with gonadal tumors, as compared with the period from 1975 to 1998 (plateauing from 1998 to 2001).[
74
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because late effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see

Stage
Extent of Disease
COG = Children's Oncology Group; CT = computed tomography; GCT = germ cell tumor.
a
Males younger than 50 years  are eligible for the AGCT1531 trial.
b
COG trials include patients younger than 15 years  with testicular GCT. Although data are scarce, patients between the ages of 11 years and 15 years might be more appropriately staged according to adult testicular guidelines. For more information about the staging of adult testicular GCTs, see
Testicular Cancer Treatment
.
I
(1) Tumor limited to testis (testes) with negative microscopic margins, completely resected by high inguinal orchiectomy;
(2) Tumor capsule cannot have been violated by needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, or tumor rupture. Patients who have undergone scrotal orchiectomy without violation of the tumor capsule and with removal of the spermatic cord to the level of the internal ring are stage I. Patients who have undergone excisional biopsy for frozen section analysis with complete orchiectomy and cord excision at the same operation can be designated stage I;
(3) No clinical, radiographic, or histological evidence of disease beyond the testes;
(4) Lymph nodes all <1 cm maximum short-axis diameter on multiplanar imaging. (Note: Nodes 1–2 cm require short-interval follow-up in 4–6 weeks. If nodes are unchanged at 4–6 weeks [1–2 cm], consider biopsy or transfer to chemotherapy arm. If growing, transfer to chemotherapy arm.)
II
(1) Complete orchiectomy with violation of the tumor capsule
in situ
(includes preoperative needle biopsy and incisional biopsy or intraoperative tumor capsule rupture);
(2) Microscopic disease in scrotum or high in spermatic cord (<5 cm from proximal end). Failure of tumor markers to normalize or decrease with an appropriate half-life;
(3) Lymph nodes negative.
III
(1) Retroperitoneal lymph node involvement, but no visceral or extra-abdominal involvement;
(2) Lymph nodes ≥2 cm or lymph nodes >1 cm but <2 cm on short axis by multiplanar imaging CT that fail to resolve on re-imaging at 4–6 weeks.
IV
(1) Distant metastases, including liver, lung, bone, and brain.
Testicular GCT Staging (Patients Aged ≥11 Years)
Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has not been required in pediatric germ cell trials to stage disease in males younger than 15 years.  Data on adolescent males with testicular GCTs are limited.  Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is used for both staging and treatment in adult testicular GCT trials.[
5
]
In males older than 15 years, there are only stage I tumors and metastatic tumors. Metastatic tumors are assigned risk according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification.[

Ovarian GCT Staging From FIGO
Another ovarian GCT staging system used frequently by gynecologic oncologists is the
FIGO staging system, which
is based on adequate surgical staging at the time of diagnosis.[
7
] This
system has also been used by some pediatric centers,[
2
] is most applicable to females older than 11 years, and is  described in
Table 5
. For more information about the FIGO staging system, see
Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment

Treatment  Option Overview for Childhood Extracranial  GCTs
In This Section
Treatment Options for Childhood Extracranial GCTs by Histological Type
GCTs with non-GCT elements (teratoma with malignant transformation)
Surgery
Surgery and Observation
Chemotherapy
Radiation Therapy
Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are very heterogenous.
On the basis of clinical factors and tumor histology, appropriate treatment for extracranial GCTs may involve one of the following:
Surgical resection followed by careful monitoring for disease recurrence.
Initial surgical resection followed by platinum-based chemotherapy.
Diagnostic tumor biopsy and preoperative platinum-based chemotherapy followed by definitive tumor resection.[
1
]
To maximize long-term survival while minimizing treatment-related long-term sequelae (e.g., secondary leukemias, infertility, hearing loss, and renal dysfunction), children with extracranial malignant GCTs need to be cared for at pediatric cancer centers with experience treating these rare tumors.
Treatment Options for Childhood Extracranial GCTs by Histological Type

overview of treatment options for children with extracranial GCTs.  Specific details of treatment by primary site and clinical condition are described in subsequent sections.

Treatment Options
BEP = bleomycin (weekly), etoposide, and cisplatin; JEb = carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin;  PEb = cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (bleomycin only on day 1 of each cycle).
a
Chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of children with stages II–IV immature teratoma. However, the role of chemotherapy in these patients has not been systematically studied. In postpubertal patients, chemotherapy remains the standard treatment, although studies are limited.[
2
]
b
In prepubertal females with reported stage I disease, but in whom strict surgical staging guidelines were not followed, chemotherapy (PEb) can be considered standard treatment.[
3

c
In postpubertal females with stage I disease, the strategy of observation after surgery has not been established. This treatment strategy is under investigation in a clinical trial (

GCTs with non-GCT elements (teratoma with malignant transformation)
The treatment of GCTs with other non-GCT somatic elements is complex, and few data exist to direct treatment.  In adolescents, central primitive neuroectodermal tumors and sarcomas have been found in teratomas.[
4
,
5
] The Italian Pediatric Germ Cell Tumor group identified 14 patients with malignant GCTs with a somatic malignancy, such as neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma, embedded in teratomas (<2% of extracranial GCTs).[
6
]
The optimal treatment strategy for GCTs with non-GCT elements  has not been determined. Separate treatments for both malignant GCTs and non-GCT elements may be required.
Surgery
Surgery is an essential component of treatment. Specific treatments will be discussed for each tumor type.
Surgery and Observation
For patients with completely resected immature teratomas of all grades and at any location, and for patients with localized, completely resected (stage I) seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs (testicular and ovarian), additional therapy may not be necessary. However, close monitoring of patients is important.[
7
,
8
] The watch-and-wait approach requires scheduled serial physical examination, tumor marker determination, and primary tumor imaging to ensure that a recurrent tumor is detected without delay.
Chemotherapy
In the United States, the standard chemotherapy regimen for both adults and children with malignant nonseminomatous GCTs includes cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Adult patients receive weekly bleomycin throughout treatment (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP]).[
9
-
12
] U.S. pediatric trials included patients aged 15 years and younger with testicular GCTs and patients aged 21 years and younger with ovarian and extragonadal GCTs. Patients received bleomycin only on day 1 of each cycle (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin [PEb]).[
3
,
13
]   The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (JEb) underwent clinical investigation in the United Kingdom in children younger than 16 years. Treatment with this regimen produced event-free survival (EFS) rates by site and stage similar to those produced using treatment with PEb.[

The use of JEb appears to be associated with fewer otologic toxic effects and renal toxic effects than does the use of PEb.[

]   In a retrospective meta-analysis of data from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group germ cell studies conducted contemporaneously, the multivariate cure model showed no difference in 4-year EFS rates. The 4-year EFS rate was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83%–89%) for patients who received the cisplatin regimen (n = 620) and 86% (95% CI, 79%–90%) for patients who received the carboplatin regimen (n = 163) (

The COG conducted a trial of compressed and reduced PEb chemotherapy (three cycles in 3 days) for patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk malignant GCTs. This study was designed as a noninferior trial with a

value of .1. The 4-year EFS rate of 89%  was significantly lower than  the rate for the historical control  model (92%;

] However, the number of patients in each stratum was small, and further investigation in patients with lower-stage disease may be warranted.
Radiation Therapy
Testicular and mediastinal seminomas in males and ovarian dysgerminomas in females are sensitive to radiation, but radiation therapy is rarely recommended because of the known late effects.

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Transplant surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website

Treatment of Mature and Immature Teratomas in Children
In This Section
Treatment of Mature Teratomas
Standard treatment options for mature teratomas (sacrococcygeal sites)
Standard treatment options for mature teratomas (nonsacrococcygeal sites)
Treatment of Immature Teratomas
Treatment options for immature teratomas
Follow-up After Treatment of Mature and Immature Teratomas
Current Clinical Trials
Mature and immature teratomas arise primarily in the sacrococcygeal region of neonates and young children and in the ovaries of pubescent girls. Less commonly, these tumors are found in the testicular region of boys younger than 4 years, the mediastinum of adolescents, and other sites.[
1
-
3
] The primary treatment for teratomas is surgery with complete resection. Surgical options for sacrococcygeal teratomas are complex.
Benign head and neck teratomas and immature teratomas can cause morbidity and mortality through obstruction. In preterm infants and neonates, head and neck teratomas and immature teratomas can cause significant airway compromise. In a single-institutional report, airway obstruction was overcome by using the ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure.[
4
] Complete resection of a teratoma can be achieved.
Treatment of Mature Teratomas
Standard treatment options for mature teratomas (sacrococcygeal sites)
The sacrococcygeal region is the primary tumor site for most benign and malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs) diagnosed in neonates, infants, and children younger than 4 years.  These tumors occur more often in girls than in boys; ratios of 3:1 to 4:1 have been reported.[
5
]
Sacrococcygeal tumors present in the following two clinical patterns related to the child’s age, tumor location, and likelihood of tumor malignancy:[
1
]
Neonates: Neonatal tumors present at birth protruding from the sacral site. However, saccrococcygeal tumors may extend into the retroperitoneal space without outward protrusion. They are usually mature or immature teratomas.
Infants and young children: In infants and young children, tumors present as a palpable mass in the sacro-pelvic region, compressing the bladder or rectum.  These pelvic tumors are more likely to be malignant.
The older the child at presentation, the more likely a malignant component is present in addition to the teratoma. An early survey found that the rate of tumor malignancy was 48% for girls and 67% for boys older than 2 months at the time of sacrococcygeal tumor diagnosis, compared with a malignant tumor incidence of 7% for girls and 10% for boys younger than 2 months at the time of diagnosis.[
6
]  The pelvic primary tumor site has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor. This could be due to a delayed diagnosis because it was overlooked at birth or incomplete resection at the time of original surgery.[
6
-
9
]
Standard treatment options for mature teratomas in a sacrococcygeal site include the following:
Surgery and observation.
Surgery is an essential component of treatment. Complete resection of the coccyx is vital to minimize the likelihood of tumor recurrence.[
2
]
Standard treatment options for mature teratomas (nonsacrococcygeal sites)
Standard treatment options for mature teratomas in a nonsacrococcygeal site include the following:
Surgery and observation.
Children with mature teratomas, including mature teratomas of the mediastinum, can be treated with surgery and observation and have an excellent prognosis.[
1
,
10
]
In a review of 153 children with nontesticular mature teratomas, the 6-year relapse-free survival rate was 96% for patients with completely resected disease and 55% for patients with incompletely resected disease.[
2
] Another series included 57 girls with mature teratomas of the ovary. Two patients experienced tumor recurrences (8 and 12 months after ovarian-sparing surgery), and seven patients developed metachronous tumors (as late as 79 months after initial diagnosis).[
11
][
Level of evidence C1
]
A multidisciplinary team should treat and monitor neonates with head and neck GCTs. Although most head and neck GCTs are benign, they  can be life-threatening and present significant challenges to surgeons, especially in newborns.[
4
] Some tumors develop malignant elements, which may change the treatment strategy.[
12
,
13
]
Mature teratomas in the prepubertal testis are relatively common benign lesions and may be amenable to testis-sparing surgery.[
14
]
Treatment of Immature Teratomas
Treatment options for immature teratomas
Treatment options for immature teratomas include the following:
Surgery and observation (stage I)
.
Surgery and observation or chemotherapy (stages I–IV)
. The use of chemotherapy is controversial. For more information, see
evidence on the role of chemotherapy for immature teratomas
.
Surgery and observation (stage I)
Immature teratomas in children are primarily managed with surgery and observation.
Evidence (surgery and observation for stage I disease):
A surgery-alone approach was investigated in a study by the Pediatric Oncology Group and Children's Cancer Group. Surgical resection followed by careful observation was used to treat patients with immature teratomas.[
15
]
Surgery alone was curative for most children and adolescents with resected ovarian immature teratomas of any grade, even when elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or microscopic foci of yolk sac tumor were present.
The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were  97.8% for patients with ovarian tumors, 100% for patients with testicular tumors, and 80% for patients with extragonadal tumors.
Surgery and observation or chemotherapy (stages I–IV)
The use of chemotherapy is controversial in the treatment of immature teratomas. There are no clinical trials supporting the use of chemotherapy in children. In adult women with ovarian tumors, surgery followed by chemotherapy has been the standard treatment approach since 1976.[
16
] As in children, there are no clinical trials supporting the use of chemotherapy in adults.
Evidence (role of chemotherapy for immature teratomas):
A seminal article published in 1976 reported that most women with ovarian immature teratomas were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. This approach has remained standard practice in postpubertal females.[
16
]
A report on  pediatric patients aged 15 years and younger in the United Kingdom found that immature teratomas did not respond to chemotherapy.[
17
]
A report from the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor International Collaborative (MaGIC) analyzed data from 98 pediatric patients and 81 adult patients with ovarian immature teratomas. Ninety pediatric patients underwent surgery alone. All 81 adult patients received adjuvant chemotherapy.[
18
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The 5-year EFS rate was 91% for pediatric patients and 98% for adult patients.
The overall survival (OS) rate was 83% for pediatric patients and 93% for adult patients.
There were no relapses in patients with grade I tumors. One adult patient with a grade II tumor relapsed after chemotherapy.
For pediatric patients with grade III, stage I/II tumors, the 5-year EFS rate was 92%. For patients with grade III, stage III tumors, the 5-year EFS rate was 52%.
For adult patients with grade III, stage I/II tumors, the 5-year EFS rate was 91%. For patients with grade III, stage III/IV tumors, the 5-year EFS rate was 65%.
Additional studies on the treatment of ovarian immature teratomas with chemotherapy are needed. For more information about the treatment of ovarian immature teratomas in postpubertal females, see
Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment
.
Treatment options under clinical evaluation for immature teratomas
Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the
NCI website
. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the
ClinicalTrials.gov website
.
The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted:
AGCT1531 (NCT03067181)
(Active Surveillance, Bleomycin, Carboplatin, Etoposide, or Cisplatin in Treating Pediatric and Adult Patients with GCTs)
:
Patients with ovarian pure-cell immature teratomas that are Children's Oncology Group stage I (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IA and IB), grade 2 or 3, and have an  AFP level of less than 1,000 ng/mL are eligible for surgery and observation on this trial.
Follow-up After Treatment of Mature and Immature Teratomas
After successful resection, neonates diagnosed with benign mature and immature teratomas are closely observed with follow-up exams and serial serum AFP determinations. These tests are done for several years to ensure that AFP measurements normalize to expected physiological levels and to facilitate early detection of tumor relapse.[
19
,
20
]  Several oncology groups have reported significant rates of recurrence among these benign tumors, ranging from 10% to 21%. Most relapses occur within 3 years of resection.[
5
,
19
,
21
,
22
]
While there is no standard follow-up schedule, tumor markers are measured frequently for 3 years in all children. With early detection, recurrent malignant GCTs can be treated successfully with surgery and chemotherapy (OS rate, 92%).[
23
]  Long-term survivors are monitored for complications of extensive surgery, which include constipation, fecal and urinary incontinence, and psychologically unacceptable cosmetic scars.[

Treatment options under clinical evaluation for malignant ovarian GCTs
Childhood Malignant Testicular GCTs
Malignant testicular GCTs in prepubertal males
The role of surgery at diagnosis for germ cell tumors (GCTs) depends on patient age and tumor site, and treatment must be individualized. All malignant testicular GCTs should be resected. Resection may be followed by subsequent excision of residual masses after chemotherapy.
Testicular GCTs in children occur almost exclusively in boys
younger than 5 years.[
1
,
2
] The initial surgical approach to evaluate a testicular mass in a young boy is important  because a trans-scrotal biopsy can risk inguinal node metastasis.[
3
,
4
] Radical inguinal orchiectomy with initial high
ligation of the spermatic cord is the procedure of choice.[
5
]
Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, with the additional information provided by elevated tumor markers, appears adequate for staging. Retroperitoneal
dissection of lymph nodes is not beneficial in the staging of testicular GCTs in young boys.[
3
,
4
] Therefore,  there may be no reason to risk the potential morbidity (e.g., impotence and retrograde ejaculation) associated with lymph node dissection.[
6
,
7
]
A revised risk stratification was developed by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor  International Consortium (see
Figure 4
).[
8
]
Standard treatment options for malignant GCTs in prepubertal males
Standard treatment options for malignant GCTs in prepubertal males (aged <11 years)  include the following:
Surgery and observation (stage I)
.
Surgery and chemotherapy (stages II–IV)
.
The treatment options for malignant GCTs in prepubertal males differ by stage of disease.
Surgery and observation (stage I)
Surgery and close follow-up observation are indicated to document that tumor marker levels normalize after resection.[
3
,
9
]
Evidence (surgery and observation for stage I disease in prepubertal males):
A  Children’s Cancer Group (CCG)/Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) clinical
trial evaluated surgery followed by observation for boys aged 10 years or younger with stage I
testicular tumors.[
3
,
4
]
This  treatment strategy resulted in a 6-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 82%.
Boys who developed recurrent disease received salvage therapy with four cycles of standard-dose cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEb), with a 6-year survival rate of 100%.
A subsequent Children’s Oncology Group (COG) study of 80 boys younger than 15 years with stage I disease included 15 boys aged 11 to 15 years who were treated with surgery and observation.[
10
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The 4-year EFS rate was 80% for the 65 boys younger than 11 years at diagnosis and 48% for the 15 boys aged 11 years and older  (
P
< .01). All patients' disease was eventually salvaged, with a 4-year overall survival (OS) rate of 100%.
Favorable prognostic factors were younger age, presence of pure yolk sac tumor, and lack of lymphovascular invasion by the primary tumor.
Adult testicular staging systems classify patients with lymphovascular invasion as stage IB. In the entire cohort, those with lymphovascular invasion had a lower 4-year EFS rate (62% vs. 84%).
A pooled analysis (from the studies above) provided more complete outcome data on patients with stage I disease who were treated with surgery and observation.[

][
Level of evidence C2
]
Most patients were prepubertal, but 13.2% of patients were adolescents (aged 13–15 years).
At a median follow-up of 56 months, all patients were alive.
There were 25 events.
On multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were age younger than 12 years (hazard ratio [HR], 8.87;
P
< .0001) and higher pT stage (pT2: HR, 7.31;
P
= .0017 and pT3: HR, 13.5;
P
= .0047).
A German study (MAHO 98) of 128 boys younger than 10 years with testicular GCTs, mostly stage I, also evaluated surgery followed by observation.[
12
][
Level of evidence C1
]
There were  49 patients with yolk sac tumors that  were staged as IA after inguinal orchiectomy. Stage IA includes no evidence of lymphovascular invasion. The 5-year EFS rate was 95%, and the 5-year OS rate was 100% for this group. Two patients relapsed and then were cured after chemotherapy.
There were 12 patients who initially had trans-scrotal orchiectomy who were pathologically confirmed to have no lymphovascular invasion (would be considered stage IA, if not for surgery). Ten patients were observed who had no adverse events. Two patients relapsed (17%) and remained in continuous remission after chemotherapy. No patients had hemiscrotectomy. A long-standing question has been whether trans-scrotal orchiectomy necessitates chemotherapy or hemiscrotectomy.
Surgery and chemotherapy (stages II–IV)
Surgery and chemotherapy with four cycles of standard PEb is a common treatment regimen for prepubertal males with stages II through IV disease. Patients treated with this regimen have OS rates exceeding 90%, suggesting that a reduction in therapy could be considered.[
13
,
14
]
Surgery and treatment with four to six cycles of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (JEb) is an alternative treatment regimen.[
9
]
Evidence (surgery and chemotherapy for stages II–IV disease in prepubertal males):
A  CCG/POG clinical
trial evaluated boys younger than 10 years with stage II tumors who were treated with four cycles of PEb after diagnosis.[
13
]
The 6-year EFS and OS rates were 100%.
In the same CCG/POG clinical trial, boys and adolescents (aged 14 years and younger) with stage III and stage IV testicular tumors were treated with surgical resection followed by four cycles of standard-dose PEb or high-dose PEb (HD-PEb) therapy.[
14
]
The 6-year survival rate for males younger than 15 years with stage III and   stage IV tumors was 100%.
The 6-year  EFS rate for males younger than 15 years was 100% for stage III tumors and 94% for stage IV tumors.
The use of HD-PEb therapy did not improve the outcome for these boys but did cause increased incidence of otologic toxic effects.
European investigators have reported excellent outcomes for boys with testicular GCTs using surgery and observation for stage I tumors and JEb and other cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens for stage II, stage III, and stage IV tumors.[
6
,
9
]
A phase III, single-arm COG trial (
AGCT0132
[NCT00053352]) included 210 intermediate-risk patients (stages II–IV testicular, stages II–III ovarian, stages I–II extragonadal, or stage I gonadal tumors with subsequent recurrence). These patients received three, rather than four, cycles of PEb and the schedule was compressed from 5 days to 3 days per cycle. A parametric comparator model specified that the observed EFS rate would not be significantly less than 92%.[
15
][
Level of evidence B4
]
The 4-year EFS rate was 89% (95% confidence interval, 83%–92%), which was significantly lower than the 92% threshold of the comparison model (
P
= .08).
In a post hoc analysis, the EFS rate was compared with similar patients treated with four cycles of PEb in two previous studies. Among 181 newly diagnosed patients, the 4-year EFS rate was 87%, compared with 92% for 92 comparable children in the historical cohort (
P
= .15).
The 4-year EFS rate was significantly associated with stage (stage I, 100%; stage II, 92%; stage III, 85%; and stage IV, 54%;
P
< .001).
These data do not support a reduction in the number of cycles of PEb from four to three.
Malignant testicular GCTs in postpubertal males
The
treatment options described for prepubertal males   may not be strictly applicable
to  postpubertal males.
In particular, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is a treatment option and  may play a crucial role [
16
] in the initial treatment of patients or in subsequent treatment of patients with  residual disease after chemotherapy for metastatic testicular GCT.[
17
,
18
]  A meta-analysis showed that patients older than 11 years were at higher risk of recurrence.[
8
] The number of males aged 11 to 15 years with GCT is small; it is possible that these patients should be treated according to adult standards. For more information about the treatment of malignant testicular GCTs in postpubertal males, see

AGCT1531 (NCT03067181)
(Active Surveillance, Bleomycin, Carboplatin, Etoposide, or Cisplatin in Treating Pediatric and Adult Patients with GCTs)
:
The aim of this trial is to reduce toxicity and maintain efficacy of treatment for patients with standard-risk GCTs.  Patients with stage I malignant GCTs (low risk, age 0–50 years) will be treated with surgery and observation.  Patients with intermediate-risk GCTs will be randomly assigned to receive cisplatin or carboplatin and bleomycin and etoposide. Children younger than 11 years will receive bleomycin with each cycle, and those aged 11 years and older will receive weekly bleomycin. Patients with pure seminoma or dysgerminoma are excluded from the trial.

Childhood Malignant Ovarian GCTs
Most ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents are of germ cell origin.[
19
]  Ovarian GCTs are very rare in young girls, but the incidence begins to increase in children aged approximately  8 or 9 years and continues to rise throughout adulthood.[
1
]
Childhood malignant ovarian GCTs can be divided into germinomatous (dysgerminomas) and nongerminomatous malignant GCTs (i.e., yolk sac carcinomas, mixed GCTs, choriocarcinoma, and embryonal carcinomas).
For more information about childhood mature and immature teratomas arising in the ovary, see the
Treatment of Mature Teratomas

Dysgerminomas  of the ovary
Standard treatment options for dysgerminomas of the ovary
Standard treatment options for dysgerminomas of the ovary include the following:
Surgery and observation (stage I)
.
Surgery and chemotherapy (stages II–IV)
.
The treatment options for dysgerminomas of the ovary differ by stage of disease.
Surgery and observation (stage I)
For stage I ovarian dysgerminomas, a cure can usually be achieved by unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, conserving the uterus and opposite ovary, and close follow-up observation.[

Evidence (surgery and observation for stage I dysgerminomas):
In three successive French Society of Pediatric Oncology studies (TGM-85, TGM-90, and TGM-95), the following was reported:[
24
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Fifteen patients were identified as stage I, and all patients survived.
Before 1998, eight patients were treated with adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. After a practice change in 1998, seven patients underwent surgery and observation.
One of the seven patients (14%) had a tumor event and responded to treatment with chemotherapy.
Surgery and chemotherapy (stages II–IV)
While advanced-stage ovarian dysgerminomas, like testicular seminomas, are highly curable with surgery and radiation therapy, the effects on growth, fertility, and risk of treatment-induced second malignancy in these young patients [
25
,
26
] make chemotherapy a more attractive adjunct to surgery.[
27
,
28
]  Complete tumor resection is the goal for advanced dysgerminomas. Platinum-based chemotherapy can be given preoperatively to facilitate resection or postoperatively (after debulking surgery) to avoid mutilating surgical procedures.[
23
]
Evidence (surgery and chemotherapy for stage II–IV dysgerminomas):
In a report from the French Society of Pediatric Oncology, 48 girls younger than 19 years (median age, 12.8 years) were registered; 20 patients had localized disease, 28 patients had locoregional disease, and no patients had metastases. Seven patients had positive para-aortic lymph nodes. Forty-seven patients underwent primary surgery. Before 1998, all patients with advanced disease received radiation therapy. After a practice change in 1998, patients were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.[
24
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The 5-year EFS rate was 91%, and the 5-year OS rate was 100%.
Side effects were not severe, and several patients became pregnant in later years.
A meta-analysis of patients with dysgerminoma by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor International Consortium reported the following:[
29
]
No difference was seen between  patients who were treated with cisplatin (n = 70)  (5-year EFS rate, 93%; OS rate, 96%) and patients who were treated with carboplatin (n = 56) (5-year EFS rate, 96%; OS rate, 96%).
This approach results in a high rate of cure and the preservation of menstrual function and fertility in most patients with dysgerminomas.[
27
,
30
]
Malignant nongerminomatous  ovarian GCTs
A multidisciplinary approach is essential for treatment of ovarian GCTs.  Various surgical subspecialists and the pediatric oncologist must be involved in clinical decisions. The surgical approach for pediatric ovarian GCTs is often guided by the expectation that reproductive function can be preserved.
The treatment of ovarian malignant GCTs that are not dysgerminomas or immature teratomas generally involves surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.[
31
,
32
]
The role for surgery at diagnosis depends on patient age and tumor site, and treatment must be individualized. The use of laparoscopy in children with ovarian GCTs has not been well studied.
The use of intraoperative frozen biopsy in pediatric and adolescent patients to determine the presence of malignancy to allow an ovarian-sparing procedure has been questioned. In a retrospective analysis from the COG
AGCT0132 (NCT00053352)
study, 60 of 131 eligible patients with ovarian tumors had both intraoperative frozen section and final paraffin section diagnoses available.[
33
] Intraoperative frozen section biopsy was incorrect 38% of the time (23 patients), and it confirmed the final diagnosis 76% of the time. In addition, central pathological review detected additional germ cell components in 23.7% of patients.
Pediatric surgical guidelines to determine stage I disease have been published.[
34
] Adult surgical guidelines to determine stage are more extensive. For more information about staging of ovarian GCTs in postpubertal females, see the
Stage Information for Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors
section in Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment.
Strict surgical staging guidelines need to be followed to determine true stage I disease. Historically, in both pediatric and adult studies, comprehensive staging guidelines have not been followed. If strict surgical staging guidelines are not followed, surgery followed by chemotherapy, rather than surgery followed by observation, is the standard treatment.[
9
,
13
,
35
]
A goal of surgical therapy for pediatric GCTs is to preserve reproductive function. If conservative surgery is the choice, a high rate of cure can be obtained with adjuvant chemotherapy, and adherence to strict surgical guidelines is not necessary.[
36
]
Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs
Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs in
prepubertal females
include the following:
Surgery and observation  (stage I following strict surgical staging guidelines)
.
Surgery and chemotherapy (PEb) (purported stage I and stages II–IV)
.
Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs in
postpubertal females
include the following:
Surgery and chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP]) (purported stage I and stages II–IV)
.
Standard treatment options for malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs that cannot be resected initially include the following:
Biopsy followed by chemotherapy and surgery (initially unresectable tumor)
.
Surgery and observation for prepubertal females (stage I following strict surgical staging guidelines)
When strict surgical staging guidelines are followed, surgery followed by observation may be an appropriate treatment choice for prepubertal females with stage I disease.
Evidence (surgery and observation for prepubertal females with stage I disease):
In a COG trial, 25 girls with stage I ovarian malignant GCTs were treated with surgery and observation.[
34
]
The 4-year EFS rate was 52%.
Relapse was detected in 12 patients by tumor marker elevation (mean time, 2 months). All patients later received salvage therapy with three cycles of PEb. The 4-year OS rate was 96%; one patient's disease was not salvaged.
Similar results have been reported in other international pediatric trials, but the number of patients has been small.[
9
]
Surgery and chemotherapy for prepubertal and postpubertal females (purported stage I and stages II–IV)
A revised risk stratification was developed by the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor  International Consortium (see
Figure 4
).[
8
]
Chemotherapy regimens with cisplatin (PEb) or  carboplatin (JEb) have been used successfully in children.[
9
,
13
,
14
,
20
] BEP is a common regimen in young women with ovarian GCTs.[
37
,
38
] BEP differs from PEb with the addition of weekly bleomycin.  This approach results in a high rate of cure and the preservation of menstrual function and fertility in most patients with nondysgerminomas.[
32
,
35
] For more information about the dosing schedules for BEP, PEb, and JEb, see
Table 8
.
In
prepubertal females
with purported
stage I ovarian tumors
(when strict surgical staging guidelines are not followed) surgery followed by chemotherapy (four cycles of PEb) is an appropriate treatment choice and results in EFS and OS rates of 95%.[
13
,
14
]
In
postpubertal females
with purported
stage I ovarian tumors
, chemotherapy after resection remains the standard treatment. In postpubertal females, the strategy of observation after surgery has not been established and is under investigation in the
AGCT1531 (NCT03067181)
trial.
In
prepubertal and postpubertal females with stages II, III, or IV ovarian tumors
, surgery and chemotherapy are considered standard treatments. Surgery and chemotherapy with four to six cycles of standard PEb is used to treat younger (prepubertal) girls,[
13
,
14
] and BEP is used to treat postpubertal girls.[
37
,
38
] Patients with normalization of tumor markers undergo imaging after four cycles of PEb, and any residual tumor is resected. Patients with residual viable tumor after surgery are considered refractory.
Alternatively, surgery and chemotherapy with four to six cycles of JEb is a treatment option (as demonstrated in one study in which all patients were younger than 15 years).[
9
]
Initially unresectable ovarian GCT
Primary resection of ovarian GCT is usually attempted. However, in rare instances, primary resection of the ovary is not possible without undue risk of damage to adjacent structures. In these cases, an appropriate strategy is biopsy for diagnosis, followed by chemotherapy and then subsequent surgery for patients who have residual masses after undergoing chemotherapy.

Standard Treatment Options for Malignant Extragonadal Extracranial GCTs in Postpubertal Children
Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Malignant Extragonadal Extracranial GCTs
Current Clinical Trials
In initial reports, children with extragonadal 
malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs), particularly those with advanced-stage (stage III or stage IV) disease, had the
highest risk of treatment failure for any GCT presentation.[
1
,
2
] Subsequently, an analysis of data from 25 years of pediatric GCT studies in the United States and United Kingdom reported that children younger than 11 years with extragonadal stage III and stage IV GCTs had an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 85%, and adolescents with stage III and stage IV extragonadal disease had poorer outcomes (expected EFS rate, <70%).[
3
]
The role of surgery at diagnosis for extragonadal tumors depends on patient age and tumor site, and treatment must be individualized. Depending on the clinical setting, the appropriate surgical approach may be primary resection,  biopsy before chemotherapy, or no surgery (e.g.,  for a mediastinal primary tumor in a patient with a compromised airway and elevated tumor markers). An appropriate strategy may be biopsy at diagnosis followed by chemotherapy and subsequent surgery in selected patients who have residual masses after chemotherapy.
Standard Treatment Options for Malignant Extragonadal Extracranial GCTs in Prepubertal Children
Standard treatment options for malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs in prepubertal children include the following:
Surgery and chemotherapy (stages I–IV)
.
Biopsy followed by chemotherapy with or without surgery (stages III and IV)
.
The treatment of malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs also depends on the site of disease. For more information, see the
Site-specific considerations for malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs
section.
Surgery and chemotherapy (stages I–IV)
Surgery and chemotherapy with four cycles of standard cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEb) is one treatment option. Patients with stage I and stage II disease treated with this regimen had an overall survival (OS) rate of 90%, suggesting that a reduction in therapy may be considered.[
1
,
4
] Patients with stage III and stage IV disease had OS rates of higher than 80%.[
1
]
An alternative treatment option is surgery and chemotherapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (JEb).[
5
] Stage III and stage IV patients treated with  JEb had an OS rate similar to that with the PEb regimen.[

Two pediatric intergroup trials for patients with high-risk disease investigated the use of high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m
2
) in a randomized study and a subsequent study that added amifostine to high-dose cisplatin.[
1
] No benefit in OS was observed, and 75% of patients required hearing aids. A Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial of patients with high-risk disease investigated the addition of cyclophosphamide to standard-dose PEb. The addition of cyclophosphamide was feasible and well tolerated at all dose levels, but there was no evidence that adding cyclophosphamide improved efficacy.[

Biopsy followed by chemotherapy with or without surgery (stages III and IV)
While outcomes  have improved remarkably since the advent of platinum-based
chemotherapy and the use of a multidisciplinary treatment approach, complete resection before chemotherapy may be possible in some patients without major morbidity.[
1
,
5
]
However, for  patients  with
locally advanced sacrococcygeal tumors, mediastinal tumors,  or large pelvic tumors, tumor biopsy followed by preoperative chemotherapy may facilitate subsequent complete tumor resection and improve ultimate patient outcome. No decrease in OS has been noted for patients with malignant extragonadal GCTs who have had delayed resection after receiving chemotherapy.[

Site-specific considerations for malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs
The treatment of malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs depends in part on the site of disease.
Sacrococcygeal site
Sacrococcygeal GCTs are common extragonadal tumors that occur in very young children, predominantly young females.[
10
]  The tumors are usually diagnosed at birth, when large external lesions predominate (usually mature or immature teratomas), or later in the first years of life, when presacral lesions with higher malignancy rates predominate.[
10
]
Malignant sacrococcygeal tumors are usually very advanced at diagnosis. Two-thirds of patients have locoregional disease, and metastases are present in 50% of patients.[
8
,
11
,
12
] Because of their advanced stage at presentation, the management of sacrococcygeal tumors requires a multimodal approach with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by delayed tumor resection.
Platinum-based therapies, with either cisplatin or carboplatin, are the cornerstone of treatment. The PEb regimen or the JEb regimen produces EFS rates of 85%.[
8
,
9
]  Surgery may be facilitated by preoperative chemotherapy. In any patient with a sacrococcygeal GCT, resection of the coccyx is mandatory.[
8
,
9
]
Completeness of surgical resection is an important prognostic factor, as shown in the following circumstances:[
8
,
9
,
13
]
Resected tumors with negative microscopic margins: EFS rates higher than 90%.
Resected tumors with microscopic margins: EFS rates of 75% to 85%.
Resected tumors with macroscopic residual disease: EFS rates lower than 40%.
Mediastinal site
Mediastinal GCTs account for 15% to 20% of malignant extragonadal
extracranial GCTs in children.[
5
] The histology of mediastinal
GCT is dependent on age, with teratomas predominating among
infants and yolk sac tumors predominating among children aged 1
to 4 years.[
7
]
Prepubertal children with mediastinal malignant teratomas are treated with tumor
resection, which is curative in almost all patients.[
7
] Children with
stage I to stage III nonmetastatic mediastinal GCTs who receive 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy have 5-year EFS and OS rates of 90%. However, patients with stage IV mediastinal tumors have EFS rates closer to 80%.[

Level of evidence C1
]
Retroperitoneal site
Malignant GCTs located in the retroperitoneum or abdomen usually present in children younger than 5 years. Most of these tumors are advanced stage and locally unresectable at diagnosis.[
15
] A limited biopsy followed by platinum-based chemotherapy to shrink tumor bulk can lead to complete tumor resection in most patients.  Despite the advanced-stage disease in most patients, the 6-year  EFS rate using PEb was 83% in the Pediatric Oncology Group/Children's Cancer Group intergroup study.[
15
]
Head and neck site
Although rare, benign and malignant GCTs can occur in the head and neck region, especially in infants. The airway is often threatened. Surgery for nonmalignant tumors and surgery plus chemotherapy for malignant tumors can be curative.[

Standard Treatment Options for Malignant Extragonadal Extracranial GCTs in Postpubertal Children
In a study of prognostic factors in pediatric extragonadal malignant GCTs, age older than 12 years was the most important prognostic factor. In a multivariate analysis, children aged 12 years and older with thoracic tumors had six times the risk of death compared with children younger than 12 years with primary nonthoracic tumors.[
17
] In a subsequent meta-analysis, adolescents with stage III and stage IV extragonadal disease had poor outcomes (expected EFS rate, <70%).[
3
] Extragonadal disease of any stage is considered a poor risk factor in adolescents and young adults.[
18
]
Standard treatment options for malignant extragonadal extracranial GCTs in postpubertal children include the following:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy (four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP]).
Chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove residual tumor.
Enrollment in a clinical trial.
As with sacrococcygeal tumors, primary chemotherapy is usually necessary to facilitate surgical resection of mediastinal GCTs, and the completeness of resection is a very important prognostic indicator.[
7
,
19
]  Survival rates for the older adolescent and young adult
population with mediastinal tumors are  generally  lower than 60%.[

The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted:
AGCT1531 (NCT03067181)
(Active Surveillance, Bleomycin, Carboplatin, Etoposide, or Cisplatin in Treating Pediatric and Adult Patients with GCTs)
:
The aim of this trial is to reduce toxicity and maintain efficacy of treatment for patients with standard-risk GCTs.  Patients with stage I malignant GCTs (low risk, age 0–50 years) will be treated with surgery and observation.  Patients with intermediate-risk GCTs will be randomly assigned to receive cisplatin or carboplatin and bleomycin and etoposide. Children younger than 11 years will receive bleomycin with each cycle, and those aged 11 years and older will receive weekly bleomycin. Patients with pure seminoma or dysgerminoma are excluded from the trial.

Treatment options for recurrent pediatric GCTs are modeled after treatment options in adult clinical trials.  Information about ongoing National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Standard Treatment Options for Recurrent Malignant GCTs in Children
Standard treatment options for recurrent childhood malignant GCTs include the following:
Surgery alone.
Surgery with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy
.
For information about salvage therapy after observation for patients with stage I disease, see the following sections:
Surgery and Observation
section of the
Treatment Option Overview for Childhood Extracranial GCTs
section.
Surgery and observation (stage I)
section of the
Malignant testicular GCTs in prepubertal males
section.
Surgery and observation for prepubertal females (stage I following strict surgical staging guidelines)
section of the
Malignant nongerminomatous ovarian GCTs
section.
Surgery with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy
Reports of salvage treatment strategies used in adult recurrent GCTs  include larger numbers of patients, but the differences between children and adults regarding the location of the primary  GCT site, pattern of relapse, and the biology of childhood  GCTs may limit the applicability of adult salvage approaches to children. In adults with recurrent GCTs, several chemotherapy combinations (most include the addition of paclitaxel and ifosfamide to a platinum compound) have achieved relatively good disease-free status.[
4
-
9
]  A combination of paclitaxel and gemcitabine has demonstrated activity in adults with testicular GCTs who relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).[
10
]
Among children with benign sacrococcygeal tumors who recur, a malignant component may be present at the primary tumor site. For these children, complete surgical resection of the recurrent tumor and  coccyx (if not done originally) is the basis of salvage treatment. Preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (PEb)  may assist the surgical resection. In patients who had a malignant sacrococcygeal tumor that recurred after PEb treatment, surgery and additional chemotherapy may be warranted.[
3
]
In a phase II Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trial (
AGCT0521 [NCT00467051]
), 20 patients younger than 21 years who relapsed after PEb therapy received two cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (TIC). Responses were then assessed by a combination of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and marker decline. Eight patients had partial responses, ten patients had stable disease, and two patients had progressive disease. This chemotherapy regimen produced a combined response rate of 44%.[
11
]
Nonstandard Treatment Options for Recurrent Malignant GCTs in Children
High-dose (HD) chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell rescue
The role of HD chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell rescue for recurrent pediatric GCTs is not established, despite anecdotal reports. In one European series, 10 of 23 children with relapsed extragonadal GCTs achieved long-term disease-free survival (median follow-up, 66 months) after receiving HD chemotherapy with stem cell support.[
12
]  Additional study in children and adolescents is needed. For more information about transplant, see
Pediatric Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
and
Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy for Cancer
.
HD chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue has been explored as a treatment for adults with recurrent testicular GCTs. HD chemotherapy plus hematopoietic stem cell rescue has been reported to cure adult patients with relapsed testicular GCTs, even as third-line therapy and in cisplatin-refractory patients.[

15
] A small study also demonstrated efficacy in adolescents and women with ovarian GCTs.[

15
,
17

18
] others do not.[
19
,
20
] Salvage attempts using HD chemotherapy regimens may be of little benefit if the patient is not clinically disease free at the time of HSCT.[
13
,
21
]
Radiation therapy followed by surgery (for brain metastases)
In a very small pediatric study, patients with nongerminomatous brain metastases responded to radiation therapy. In the German Maligne Keimzelltümoren (MAKEI) studies, radiation therapy and surgery for patients with brain metastases provided palliation and occasional long-term survival.[
