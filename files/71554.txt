Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) With Sorafenib for Breast Cancer Brain Metastases (BCBM)
Sorafenib is a new type of anti-cancer drug. It belongs to a new class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is thought to work against cancer in many ways. It helps decrease blood supply to the tumor. It also blocks some proteins that help the tumor cells to grow." Sorafenib is approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for treatment for other cancers like liver and kidney cancer. Sorafenib has also been studied in the treatment of breast cancer that has spread but is not specifically approved for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been studied both as a single agent and also in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for breast cancer. In laboratory models and in some patients with other cancers, sorafenib has been studied in tumors in the brain.

In this study, sorafenib will be given together with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Overall this research study is designed to answer 2 main questions:

1. What dose of sorafenib should be used together with WBRT?
2. What are the side effects of sorafenib and WBRT when given together?

RADIATION: Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT)|DRUG: Sorafenib
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Dose-escalation Phase: The proposed three dose levels of sorafenib during dose escalation are 200 mg, 400mg, and 600 mg administered daily orally. The dose-escalation phase is for 3-6 patients to be treated at each dose level. Assuming 3 dose levels during this phase, it will require a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 18 patients., 1 year|assessing toxicity by the number of adverse events, using the active version of the CTCAE version 4.0, 1 year
CNS progression-free survival, CNS-PFS is defined as the interval between the date of study entry and the date of intracranial tumor progression or death from any cause. We will evaluate this during follow-up MRI scans that will be performed as a standard of care using the Macdonald criteria., 1 year
