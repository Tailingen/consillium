Study of Quizartinib in Combination With Standard Therapies in Chinese Participants With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
20 mg or 40 mg of quizartinib will be given to Chinese patients who were just diagnosed with AML. The study drug will be given to them along with standard therapies. The purpose is to find out the highest dose they can stand.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Quizartinib
Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities, At the end of induction phase at approximately 56 days|Number of Participants with Adverse Events During the Trial, within approximately 19 months|Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Categories: quizartinib, active metabolite, within 56 days|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Categories: quizartinib, active metabolite, within 56 days|Area under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), Categories: quizartinib, active metabolite, within 56 days
Number of Participants with Response, Categories: Complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete platelet or hematological recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), no response (NR), within approximately 19 months|Response Rates, Categories: response rate (CRc + PR), composite CR (CRc: CR + CRi) rate, within approximately 19 months
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of quizartinib in combination with standard induction therapy and consolidation therapy in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed AML.

The quizartinib doses will be Level 1: 20 mg and Level 2: 40 mg. No increase in the quizartinib dose will be made in the same subject.

Dose-limiting toxicity associated with quizartinib occurring at each level will be assessed, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be decided using a 3 + 3 design.
