Study of BMS-275183 in Patients With Pretreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC (Non Small Cell Lung Cancer)
BMS-275183 given orally twice weekly to patients pretreated for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will show anti-tumor activity in any of the 3 separate cohorts of the patients enrolled:

* Cohort I: Patients previously treated with one taxane containing regimen.
* Cohort II: Patients previously treated with a platinum based but non-taxane containing regimen.
* Cohort III: Patients previously treated with both a chemotherapy regimen and one EGFR-TKI (epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) compound.

Patients in cohorts I and II should have not been treated with a prior EGFR-TKI compound. Prior treatment with a VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) inhibitor compound is allowed for all the patients provided that the VEGFR inhibitor is not also an EGFR inhibitor.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BMS-275183 (oral taxane)
To assess efficacy of BMS-275183 in pretreated NSCLC patients as measured by the tumor response rate
To further characterize the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of BMS-275183 in the same patient population|Assess the response duration|Assess the progression free survival time|Assess the overall survival time|Assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMS-275183
