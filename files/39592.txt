UNITE Study: Understanding New Interventions With GBM ThErapy
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of several ophthalmologic prophylactic treatment strategies for the management of ocular side effects (OSEs) in participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-amplified glioblastoma (GBM) who were being treated with depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414).
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Steroid eye drops|DRUG: Vasoconstrictor eye drops|OTHER: Cold compress|DRUG: Ophthalmic steroid ointment|DRUG: Depatuxizumab mafodotin|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Radiation
Percentage of Participants Who Required a Change in Ocular Side Effect (OSE) Management, Inadequate control of ocular side effects (OSE) was defined as either a ≥ 3-line decline from baseline (≥ +0.3 on LogMAR scale) in visual acuity (with baseline correction determined at the screening ophthalmology visit)) or ≥ Grade 3 OSE severity on the Corneal Epithelial Adverse Event (CEAE) scale., Within 8 weeks after the initial dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin
Maximum Change From Baseline on the Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) Scale, The LogMAR scale measures visual acuity on a continuous scale, with a LogMAR value of 0 equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity. Normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment. The baseline observation is defined as the last non-missing measurement collected prior to the first dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin., Within 8 weeks after the initial dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin|Time to Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) Intervention, The time to initiation of bandage contact lenses for those participants who required intervention due to inadequate control of ocular side effects (OSE) was calculated., Up to 9 months after the first dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin|Number of Participants With Depatuxizumab Mafodotin Dose Modifications Due to Ocular Side Effects (OSE), Dose modifications included depatuxizumab mafodotin withdrawal, interruption, and reductions in dose initiated due to OSEs., From the first dose of study drug until 49 days after last depatuxizumab mafodotin administration, up to 47 weeks|Cumulative Dose of Depatuxizumab Mafodotin Received During Chemoradiation and During Adjuvant Treatment, The cumulative dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin administered was tabulated., Up to 9 months|Treatment-Emergent Corneal Epithelial Adverse Event (CEAE) Grade at Each Visit, The corneal epithelial adverse event (CEAE) rating scale is designed to record symptoms associated with corneal epitheliopathy caused by antibody-drug conjugates and to grade the severity of findings. The overall CEAE grade is measured on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher values being more severe, reflecting the impact of corneal abnormalities on visual activities of daily living (ADLs). Additional detailed information is collected for specific domains that are commonly affected, with the following ranges (each in order of increasing severity): ocular discomfort (0 - 4), photophobia (0 - 3), and reading (1 - 3)., Up to 47 weeks|Change From Baseline In Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) Scale After Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) Intervention, The change on the LogMAR Scale from last assessment prior to BCL intervention to 2 weeks after BCL intervention was calculated. The LogMAR scale measures visual acuity on a continuous scale, with a LogMAR value of 0 equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity. Normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment., From the last assessment prior to BCL intervention to 2 weeks after BCL intervention|Percentage of Participants That Recovered to <3-line Decline From Baseline (≤ +0.3 LogMAR) in Visual Acuity After Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) Intervention, Recovery was defined as return to \<3-line decline from baseline (≤ +0.3 LogMAR) in visual acuity after BCL intervention., From the last assessment prior to BCL intervention to the end of BCL intervention|Number of Participants With Depatuxizumab Mafodotin Dose Modifications to Ocular Side Effects After Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) Intervention, Dose modifications included depatuxizumab mafodotin withdrawal, interruption, and reductions in dose initiated due to OSEs after BCL intervention., From the last assessment prior to BCL intervention to the end of BCL intervention, up to 38 weeks|Time to Restart Depatuxizumab Mafodotin if Interrupted Due to Ocular Side Effects After Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) Intervention, The time to restart depatuxizumab mafodotin treatment if it was interrupted due to ocular side effects after BCL Intervention was tabulated., From the last assessment prior to BCL intervention to the end of BCL intervention|Treatment Emergent Corneal Epithelial Adverse Event (CEAE) Grade at Each Visit After Bandage Contact Lens (BCL) Intervention, The corneal epithelial adverse event (CEAE) rating scale is designed to record symptoms associated with corneal epitheliopathy caused by antibody-drug conjugates and to grade the severity of findings. The overall CEAE grade is measured on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher values being more severe, reflecting the impact of corneal abnormalities on visual activities of daily living (ADLs). Additional detailed information is collected for specific domains that are commonly affected, with the following ranges (each in order of increasing severity): ocular discomfort (0 - 4), photophobia (0 - 3), and reading (1 - 3)., From the last assessment prior to BCL intervention to the end of BCL intervention, up to 38 weeks|Time to Ocular Side Effect (OSE) Symptom Resolution After Drug Discontinuation (Reversibility), The time from discontinuation of depatuxizumab mafodotin to OSE symptom resolution (reversibility) was to be recorded., From the first dose of study drug until 49 days after last depatuxizumab mafodotin administration, up to 47 weeks|Time to Re-initiation of Depatuxizumab Mafodotin After Dose Interruption, The time from dose interruption until re-initiation or permanent discontinuation of depatuxizumab mafodotin was to be recorded., Up to 9 months
This Phase 3b open-label, randomized, exploratory study included 2 phases during the treatment period: chemoradiation therapy (radiation plus temozolomide \[RT/TMZ\]) and adjuvant therapy (TMZ). All participants received depatuxizumab mafodotin during both phases of the treatment period plus 1 of 3 prophylactic ophthalmologic treatments (standard steroids; standard steroids with vasoconstrictors and cold compress; and enhanced steroids with vasoconstrictors and cold compress. The study comprised a screening period of up to 7 weeks after surgery, a 6-week concomitant Chemoradiation Phase, an Adjuvant Phase beginning approximately 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, and a Follow-Up Phase.
