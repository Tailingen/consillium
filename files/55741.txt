HAIC Combined With PD-L1 Plus Regorafenib in the Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Immunotherapy Failure
For patients with advanced liver cancer who have progressed after first-line targeted and immunotherapy , there is currently no standard treatment regimen for second-line therapy. this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of HAIC combined with PD-L1 and Regorafenib in patients with advanced liver cancer who have failed immunotherapy, not only providing new treatment options for second-line therapy of liver cancer, but also laying the foundation for research on the combination of HAIC and PD-L1 inhibitors plus Regorafenib, which has significant scientific research significance and clinical value.

This is A Single-center, Single-arm, Exploratory Clinical Study of Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy (HAIC) Combined with PD-L1 Plus Regorafenib in the Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Immunotherapy Failure.

In clinical practice, second-line liver cancer treatment still mainly relies on single-agent therapy, which may not provide additional clinical benefits for patients. On one hand, a real-world multicenter study published by ESMO in 2023 showed that the combination of ICIs and TKIs may still have potential efficacy in patients who progress after first-line targeted therapy for advanced liver cancer. Secondly, the combination of targeted therapy and local hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may provide a new opportunity for patients with advanced liver cancer who progress after targeted therapy. On the other hand, unlike PD-1 inhibitors, PD-L1 inhibitors can block the binding ability of PD-L1 with B7.1 on the surface of T cells, which is advantageous for comprehensive T cell activation. At the same time, PD-L1 monoclonal antibody only blocks the binding of PD-L1 with PD-1, preserving the function of PD-L2 and avoiding side effects such as interstitial lung disease (ILD), thus having better safety. Therefore, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of HAIC combined with PD-L1 and Regorafenib in patients with advanced liver cancer who have failed immunotherapy.
