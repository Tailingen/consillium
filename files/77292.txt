A Study of RO7293583 in Participants With Unresectable Metastatic Tyrosinase Related Protein 1 (TYRP1)-Positive Melanomas
This is a first-in-human, multi-center clinical study to determine the safety, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) as well as the optimal schedule for intravenous (IV) and/or subcutaneous (SC) administrations of RO7293583 with or without obinutuzumab pretreatment, in participants with unresectable metastatic TYRP1-positive melanomas who have progressed on standard of care (SOC) treatment, are intolerant to SOC, or are non-amenable to SOC. This study will include an initial single participant dose-escalation part one followed by a multiple participant dose-escalation part two with the possibility of expansion.

DRUG: RO7293583|DRUG: Tocilizumab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Adalimumab
Percentage of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were reported according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), except for Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which will be graded based on the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria., From Day 1 of Cycle 1 up to Day 1 of Cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product., Baseline up to 60 days after last RO7293583 treatment (up to 14 months)
Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|Time of Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|SC Bioavailability (F) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|Clearance (CL) or Apparent Clearance (CL/F) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of RO7293583, Up to 14 months|Percentage of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to RO7293583, From baseline until 60 days after last RO7293583 dose (up to 14 months).|Change from Baseline in RO7293583 ADA Titer, From baseline until 60 days after last RO7293583 dose (up to 14 months).|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed objective response (OR). Confirmed OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions â‰¥ 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Baseline up to 13 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). Per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline, or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Baseline up to 13 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of documented OR to disease progression, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline; or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Baseline up to 13 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from Cycle 1, Day 1 to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline; or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Baseline up to 24 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from Cycle 1, Day 1 to death from any cause., Baseline up to 24 months.
