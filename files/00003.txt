The purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) given a daily dosing schedule of decitabine.

DRUG: Decitabine
Number of Participants Who Achieved Overall Response, Overall Response = complete remission (disappearance of all target lesions) + partial remission (at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions), 1 year
Best Response and Overall Improvement, Overall Improvement = complete remission + marrow complete remission + partial remission + hematologic improvement (CR+mCR+PR+HI), 1 year
