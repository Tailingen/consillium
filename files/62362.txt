Genome Studies of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Developed in Hepatitis C Patients With Sustained Virological Response
In this international collaboration study, the research group will analyze somatic mutations of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed after sustained virological response (SVR) in patients treated with hepatitis C (HCV) therapy
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Hepatitis C
Characterisation of genomic mutations of HCC, developed in HCV patients with SVR, Genetic characteristics of HCCs will be compared to non-HCC tissue, 5 years
Method Paired liver tissue samples will be collected from the tumour sections and also from the adjacent non-tumour tissues, for comparison in each individual. The tissues have been collected as part of routine clinical work/other studies, by liver biopsies or at liver resection/liver transplantation. Data regarding the patient characteristic will be collected. Whole genome sequencing analyses are planned to be performed.
