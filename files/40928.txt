X-ray Psoralen Activated Cancer Therapy in Head and Neck, Breast, Sarcoma and Melanoma
In this Phase I trial for subjects with advanced head \& neck cancer, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma or melanoma all subjects will receive open label X-PACT treatment as a intra-tumoral injection. The primary objective will be to establish the safety of X-PACT when dosed with 5 intra-tumoral injections of the combination product (the phosphor device and methoxsalen sterile solution and subsequently exposing the tumor to X-ray energy) over a period of 6 weeks (on day D1, D3 and D5 of Week 1, on D1 of Week 2, and a booster on D1 of Week 6). After the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial response or unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two additional booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Treatment will be considered safe provided ≤ 2 out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the first intra-tumoral injection.
Advanced Solid Tumor Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: X-PACT
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The primary objective will be to establish the safety of X-PACT when dosed at the schedule described above, with X-PACT considered safe provided ≤ 2 out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the first intra-tumoral injection., First 6 weeks
Evaluate Local Response Rate (LRR), Evaluate local response rate by assessing treated tumor volume pre and post treatment, After first 6 weeks of treatment|Evaluate Durability of Response, Evaluate duration of local control, Post first 6 treatments to 2 years post last treatment|Evaluate Objective Response Rate (ORR), Evaluate the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy., After first 6 weeks of treatment|Evaluate Progression Free Survival, Evaluate the length of time during and after the treatment that the subject lives with the disease but it does not get worse., Post first 6 treatments to 2 years post last treatment|Evaluate Overall Survival, Evaluate the length of time subjects stay alive from the date of first treatment., Post first 6 treatments to 2 years post last treatment|PK Profile (C max) of Methoxsalen, Establish C max of methoxsalen when given as an intra-tumoral injection, First 6 weeks of study|PK Profile (AUC) of Methoxsalen, Establish AUC of methoxsalen when given as an intra-tumoral injection, First 6 weeks of study
The primary endpoint will be to establish the safety of X-PACT when dosed with 5 intra-tumoral injections of the combination product (the phosphor device and methoxsalen sterile solution and subsequently exposing the tumor to X-ray energy) over a period of 6 weeks (on day D1, D3 and D5 of Week 1, on D1 of Week 2, and a booster on D1 of Week 6). After the week 8 tumor assessment subjects demonstrating stable disease, partial response or unconfirmed progression assessed by iRecist, will be eligible to receive two additional booster treatments 4-6 weeks apart. Part C has been added to the study to allow patients who respond to treatment to receive an additional 12 treatments over 12 months. In part C, up to two tumors in up to two radiation fields may be treated. Treatment will be considered safe provided ≤ 2 out of 12 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 6 weeks after the first intra-tumoral injection. Subjects will have staging scans at baseline, day 8, week 7 and as per standard of care during the optional treatment and follow up study periods. There will be a two-year follow up period.
