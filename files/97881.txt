A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Bevacizumab in Combination With Tarceva for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study. Approximately 650 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: erlotinib HCl|DRUG: placebo
Overall Survival (OS) Among All Randomized Patients, Overall Survival was defined as the period from the date of randomization until the date of patient death from any cause. For patients who had not died, survival data was censored at the date of last contact., From the date of randomization until the date of patient death from any cause, or the date of last contact. (Up to 3.1 years)
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression, as determined by the investigator using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or death on study treatment, whichever occurred first., From randomization to documented disease progression or death on study treatment, whichever occurred first. (Up to 3.1 years)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response was defined as a complete or partial response determined by RECIST on two consecutive occasions \>= 4 weeks apart., The median duration of Objective response was up to 9.7 months|Duration of Objective Response, Duration of objective response was defined as the period from the date of the initial partial or complete response until the date of disease progression or death on study treatment from any cause. For patients who had not died, data was censored at the date of last contact., Period from Objective response until disease progression or death on study treatment. (Up to 29.5 months)
