Participation to Colorectal Cancer Screening With Fecal Occult Blood Test and Colonoscopy
Adherence rate to screening colonoscopy (TC) in the average-risk general population is still unclear. Aim of this study was to compare the uptake of TC screening with that of fecal occult blood (FOBT) in the general population of different Italian areas.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: colonoscopy|PROCEDURE: faecal test
Participation to colorectal cancer screening
A nationwide, population-based, multicenter, randomized trial comparing attendance to TC with that to FOBT was performed. Sixty-four general practitioners (GPs), overall including in their lists 9,889 average-risk subjects aged 55-64 years, were randomized between TC and FOBT screening programs. Eligible subjects were mailed a personal invitation letter co-signed by their GP and the coordinator of the area-reference GI centre. Attendance rate and detection rate for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer, adenoma \>10 mm or with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia) for each arm of the study were assessed.
