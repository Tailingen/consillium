68Ga-NK224 PET Imaging of PD-L1 Expression in Cancers
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-NK224 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in primary and/or metastatic tumors, compared with histopathological results.

The concordance between 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT and histopathological result in PD-L1 expression, For 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT parameter, the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) is measured by defining a region of interest (ROI) around the primary tumor. For histopathological results, the level of PD-L1 expression is quantified as low (\<1%), medium (1-49%), and high (\>49%), respectively. Finally, Kruskal-Wallis test will be used to test the concordance between 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT and histopathological result in PD-L1 expression., 30 Days
Evaluate the intra- and inter- tumor heterogeneity, To assess inter-tumor heterogeneity, a quantitative measure of intratumoral heterogeneity, the heterogeneity index (HI), was calculated by dividing SUVmax by SUVmean for each lesion. Differences in 68Ga-NK224 uptake related to inter-tumor heterogeneity (between primary tumors and metastatic lesions) were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test., 30 Days
Participants with cancer underwent 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT for an initial assessment. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) and mean SUV (SUVmean). In addition, the PD-L1 expression of lesions was confirmed by histopathological analyzing. The quantitative parameters of 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT were compared with histopathological result to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy.
