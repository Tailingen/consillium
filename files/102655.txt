Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy in Untreated Nonmetastatic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether surgery is more effective with or without radiation therapy in treating nonmetastatic retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy followed by surgery to see how well it works compared with surgery alone in treating patients with previously untreated nonmetastatic retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma.
Sarcoma
PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|RADIATION: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy
Number of Patients With Abdominal Recurrence or Death, Abdominal recurrence was defined by one of the following events: local/abdominal or distant progressive disease during preoperative radiotherapy (as per RECIST 1.1), tumor or patient becoming inoperable (ASA score of 3 or involvement of superior mesenteric artery, aorta, or bone), peritoneal metastasis found at surgery, macroscopic residual disease left in at surgery (R2 resection), or local relapse (after macroscopically complete resection). Liver metastases were regarded as distant metastatic events. Patients with distant metastases were followed until local failure was detected. Patients without one of these events were censored at the date of last follow-up., ARFS was measured from date of randomization to date of abdominal relapse or death, whichever occurred first, up to a maximum of 7 years.
Acute Toxicity Profile of Preoperative Radiotherapy., The acute toxicity was assessed in randomized patients who received at least one dose of preoperative radiotherapy (RT). It follows Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 in the RT safety population, assuming the following classification:

* Grade 0 No event reported
* Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
* Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
* Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.
* Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
* Grade 5 Death related to AE. For each item of the CTCAE, the worst grade of acute toxicity from the data of randomization prior to surgery was taken, From date of randomization to the date of surgical procedure, prior to surgery|Perioperative Complications, Adverse events and side effects possibly related to surgery were assessed according to the Dindo's classification. This scales the observed side effects as Grade 0 No event Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions Grade II Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications.

Grade III Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade IV Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications) requiring IC/ICU-management Grade V Death of a patient For each item, the frequency of the worst grade of the observed toxicity was tabulated by treatment group.

The perioperative period commence at the time of surgery (at the time of the induction anaesthesia) to the complete closure of the wound., From the date of surgery, up to 60 days following surgery|Late Complications, The late toxicities occurring more than 60 days after surgery. These were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. This scales the observed toxicity from Grade 1 to 5, assuming the following classification:

* Grade 0 no event
* Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
* Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
* Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.
* Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
* Grade 5 Death related to AE. Full AE reporting can be found in the Adverse Event Section., From day 60 after surgery till end of follow-up, up to 7 years|Tumor Response to Preoperative Radiotherapy, For patients that received preoperative radiotherapy, the tumor response was assessed using RECIST 1.1. Response criteria were essentially based on a set of measurable lesions identified at baseline as target lesions, and followed at the end of the radiotherapy. Response was not the primary endpoint, so a confirmatory CT-scan was not mandatory., Two weeks after completion of Pre-operative Radiotherapy, before Surgery|Number of Patients With an Abdominal Recurrence, Abdominal recurrence was defined in the ARFS section. The following are considered competing events:

* death in the absence of abdominal failure
* distant metastases diagnosed before abdominal failure Patients without one of these events were censored at the date of last follow-up., ARFI was measured from the date of randomization to the date of abdominal relapse, up to a maximum of 7 years|Number of Patients With Metastases or Death, Alive and metastases free patients will be censored at the date of last follow-up., Metastases free survival was measured from the date of randomization to the date of occurrence of distant metastases or death, whichever occurred first, up to a maximum of 7 years.|Number of Patients Alive, Alive patients were censored at the date of last follow-up. Causes of death were recorded and reported as a table., Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death, whatever the cause, up to a maximum of 7 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess whether there is a difference in abdominal recurrence-free survival between retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma patients undergoing curative intent surgery alone and those undergoing preoperative radiotherapy followed by curative-intent surgery.

Secondary

* To assess whether there is a difference in metastasis-free survival, abdominal recurrence-free interval, and overall survival between these patients.
* To assess tumor response in patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy.
* To assess toxicity of preoperative radiotherapy given prior to curative-intent surgery in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution and WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor mass within 4 weeks following randomization.
* Arm II: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (RT) or intensity-modulated RT within 8 weeks after randomization. RT continues 5 days a week for approximately 5.5 weeks. Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor mass within 4-8 weeks after the completion of RT.

Tumor tissue, normal abdominal wall fat, and peripheral blood may be collected during surgery to identify new prognostic factors for translational research.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at day 60 post-surgery and every 6 months thereafter.
