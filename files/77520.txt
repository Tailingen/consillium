Using Mass Spectrometry (EasyM) Detecting Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in Multiple Myeloma
The presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) is an important prognostic factor for multiple myeloma, while M-protein is a widely accepted biomarker used for multiple myeloma (MM) diagnose. Detecting MRD by monitoring M-protein using mass spectrometry (MS) is promising due to its high analytical sensitivity. To evaluate the correlation between MS-MRD and overall disease burden, over 60 patients with 500+ samples were identified for this study. The M-protein sequence and the patient-specific M-protein peptides of each patient were obtained by de novo protein sequencing platform using the diagnostic serum (\> 30g/L). The follow- up samples were then measured by a parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay.
