A Study of PD-1/CTLA-4 Bispecific AK104 in Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104，an anti- PD-1 and CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, in subjects with relapsed or refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma. The subject will receive AK104 450mg Q2W until unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or for a maximum of 24 months.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: AK104
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or PR according to the Lugano 2014 classification for lymphoma, assessed by the investigator., Up to 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD according to the Lugano 2014 classification for lymphoma., Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Number of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), The incidence and severity of adverse events, containing clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) results., From the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after the last dose of AK104|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable antidrug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104|Observed concentrations of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104
