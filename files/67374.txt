Superb Microvascular Intraocular Tumor Imaging Study (SMITIS)
The diagnosis and monitoring of intraocular tumors are based on multimodal imaging in addition to the clinical examination (ultra-widefield retinal imaging, echography, angiography). Nevertheless, it may be difficult in cases of retinal hemorrhage, small tumor size or atypical presentation. The study of microvascular flow (Superb Microvascular Imaging, SMI) of intraocular tumors could improve the confidence of differential diagnosis when evaluating these suspicious lesions, or even determine whether a lesion is benign or malignant by describing the vascularization of the lesion.

The investigators propose to study the microvascular flow patterns of intraocular tumors prior to proton therapy.

The ultrasound equipment available in ophthalmology does not have Doppler technology and does not allow the study of the vascularization and microvascularization of intraocular lesions. The interest in the system used in this study is to import SMI into ophthalmology to study tumor microvascularization. The study of tumor vascularization can help in the differential diagnosis and follow-up of tumors, and therefore can impact the management of patients with tumors.
