Chemotherapy With or Without Surgical Resection in Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer
In this randomized study, we plan to address the important question of optimum local treatment for patients with localized esophageal cancer. All patients will receive our previously studied neo-adjuvant regimen including paclitaxel, carboplatin, infusional 5-FU, and radiation therapy to 45 Gy. At the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy, patients will be randomized to undergo surgical resection, or to continue radiation to a total dose of 60 Gy, along with one additional course of chemotherapy.
Esophagus Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
To compare the efficacy of full dose radiation therapy versus preoperative radiation therapy plus surgical resection, when used in combination with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, in the treatment of localized esophageal cancer
To compare the toxicity of these two treatment approaches in localized esophageal cancer|To evaluate the utility of clinical restaging in guiding local therapy (surgical resection vs definitive radiation therapy) following neo-adjuvant treatment|To evaluate the toxicity of additional chemotherapy and radiation therapy following completion of neo-adjuvant treatment.
Upon determination of eligibility, all patients will receive neo-adjuvant therapy with:

Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + 5-Fluorouracil + Radiation

After neo-adjuvant therapy and restaging are completed, patients will be randomized to receive one of two treatments:

* Surgical resection (Arm A)
* Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation (Arm B)
