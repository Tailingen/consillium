Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Camrelizumab and Apatinib in Patients With GC/GEJC
This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line platinum-contained therapy. The primary study hypotheses are that camrelizumab (SHR-1210) combined with apatinib prolongs overall survival (OS) for participants with tumors that show positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
