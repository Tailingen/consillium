Why Are Fertility Preservation Patients Not Coming Back?
This is a single-center retrospective study carried out with a phone call follow-up to investigate women's decision not to return for criopreserved ovocytes use after cancer treatment. The study database includes all women who underwent fertility preservation cycles at a third-level university-affiliated center from January 2001 to December 2017.

Patients were asked a set of standardized questions whose purpose was to investigate their present health conditions, cancer treatment and any potential relapses, their family projects and sentimental status, any spontaneous conception, and why they had not yet returned for embryo transfer.

All data were recorded anonymously in our dataset.
