Epigenetic Modulation of the immunE Response in GastrointEstinal Cancers (EMERGE)
A multicenter phase II non-randomised trial assessing the efficacy of domatinostat (4SC-202) plus avelumab in patients with GI cancer
Cancer|GI Cancer
DRUG: Domatinostat|DRUG: Avelumab
Safety run-in phase: To establish a safe and tolerable dose of domatinostat in combination with avelumab for use in the main (Phase IIB efficacy) phase of the trial, Progression through dosing levels will be determined by the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities in the study population., The DLT period is 28 days following the first treatment with domatinostat and avelumab|Main Phase IIB (efficacy) phase: Objective response rate using RECIST 1.1 criteria, ORR defined as the proportion of patients with either CR or PR (assessed according to RECIST 1.1) by 6 months from combination treatment initiation. The best ORR will be presented as a proportion along side a 95% confidence interval, 6 months
Number of patients with adverse events (according to NCI-CTCAE version 4) as a measure of safety and tolerability, Safety of domatinostat and avelumab will be assessed by summarizing adverse events as a proportion, Up to 90 days after last dose|Progression free survival according to RECIST 1.1, PFS will be summarized using Kaplan Meier methods, presenting median survival with 95% confidence intervals. PFS is defined as the time from day of first treatment to disease progression or death from any cause. Patients without an event will be censored on day of last radiological follow up, upto 2 years|Overall survival, OS will be summarized using Kaplan Meier methods, presenting median survival with 95% confidence intervals. OS is defined as the time from say of first treatment to death from any cause. Alive patients will be censored at the last follow up date, upto 2 years|Disease control rate, The proportion of patients with best disease control (CR, PR or SD) at 6 months and 12 months from initiation of combination treatment will be presented with a 95% confidence interval, At 6 and 12 months on treatment|Duration of objective response according to RECIST 1.1, DoOR will be summarized using Kaplan Meier methods. DoOR is defined as the time between the initial response to treatment and subsequent disease progression or relapse. Patients without an event will be censored on day of last radiological assessment, upto 2 years
During this phase II non randomised trial patients with microsatellite stable colorectal or gastroesophageal cancer which has previously been treated with chemotherapy will be treated with domatinostat plus avelumab.
