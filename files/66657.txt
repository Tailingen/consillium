Study of Revlimid With Doxil and Avastin for Patients With Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer
This study will test the feasibility of combining 3 drugs, Revlimid with Doxil and Bevacizumab,and gather preliminary data on the potential activity of the combination in patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide, Liposomal Doxorubicin, Bevacizumab|DRUG: Revlimid, Doxil, Avastin
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the 3 drug combination and recommend a dose for phase II studies., 6-8 months
Progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment with Revlimid plus Avastin and Doxil., 6-8 Months|Acute and subacute toxicities of Lenalidomide plus Doxil and Avastin for the treatment of ovarian cancer., 6-8 Months
The combination of Doxil with Avastin has several aspects of interest to ovarian cancer treatment: 1) independent single-agent activity, 2) enhanced localization of Doxil is possible tumoral interstitial pressure via increased half-life (if liposomal egress is diminished) and decreased \[42\], 3) improved Doxil distribution, and 4) likely favorable toxicity profile since Doxil's only common problematic toxicity is to the skin (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE). Lenalidomide has also antiangiogenic properties, with a different mechanism of action than Avastin. Given the preliminary results of the effect of the combination of Doxil with Avastin, showing an increase in progression-free survival, we are interested in using a new thalidomide analog to maximize the angiogenic inhibition. This study will test the feasibility of combining all 3 drugs, and gather preliminary data on the potential activity of the combination in patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
