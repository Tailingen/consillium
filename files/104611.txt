Phase II Study of Gemcitabine+Romidepsin in the Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Patients
Pilot clinical trial - Phase 2a, multicenter, single arm, open label trial - to evaluate efficacy and safety of concomitant combination treatment with Gemcitabine and Romidepsin (GEMRO) regimen as salvage treatment in relapsed/refractory PTCL (peripheral T-cell lymphoma) in a selected population of patients.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Romidepsin + Gemcitabine
Complete Remission (CR) Rate, Complete Remission is disappearance of all target lesions per the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007)", 18 months
Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival, The time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first. PFS (progression-free survival) data will be censored on the day following the date of the last radiological assessment of measured lesions documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and are still on study at the time of an analysis, are given antitumor treatment other than the study treatment or stem cell transplant, or are removed from study prior to documentation of objective tumor progression. Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose will have their event time censored at 1 day. Percentage of participants is an estimate based on Kaplan-Meier method., 24 months|Overall Survival is Measured From the Date of Study Entry to the Date of Patient's Death, OS (overall survival) is measured from the date of study entry to the date of patient's death. If the patient is alive or his vital status is unknown, the date of death will be censored at the date that the patient is last known to be alive., 24 months|Safety - Frequency of Toxicities Grade 3 and 4, Frequency of toxicities was reported by type and grade according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0)., 24 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR the proportion of patients who achieve CR (complete response), CRu (complete remission unconfirmed) or PR (partial response) relative to the per-protocol population. Disease response and progression will be evaluated according to the "Revised Response Criteria" for malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007)., 24 months
Objectives will be focused on preliminary dose-response, type of patients, frequency of dosing, and safety and tolerability profile.
