Long-term Outcomes of Endoscopic Resection (ER) of Lesions of the Duodenum and Ampulla
This research project, 'Outcomes of endoscopic resection of mucosal and submucosal lesions in the duodenum and ampulla'. The research project is aiming to determine the most effective and safe way to remove such lesions.
Adenoma, Villous
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
Observed procedural data: Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability Outcomes, 14 days
Analysis of the costs of this procedure compared to previous treatments, Perform cost-utility analyses comparing different treatment approaches for duodenal and ampullary lesions, 14 days
Endoscopic resection (ER) of superficial lesions of the duodenum and ampulla is a safe and effective surgery sparing modality in experienced hands. It is often curative of dysplastic lesions and is associated with minimal complications and high patient acceptance (1-5). Westmead Hospital has accumulated a significant amount of experience in the removal of such lesions; however, there is limited research to document the long term outcomes of patients undergoing endoscopic resection.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of ER of superficial lesions of the duodenum and ampulla.
