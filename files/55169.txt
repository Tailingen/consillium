Perception of Cohesion Within a Relationship (Dyadic Adjustment) on the Quality of Life of Patients With Prostate Cancer With Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone.
The general hypothesis put forward in this study is that the degree of cohesion (agreement) in the relationship, or dyadic adjustment affects a patient's quality of life and clinical course during the first few critical months following diagnosis and the introduction of treatment. The level of cohesion in the relationship is certainly not the only parameter associated with changes in the quality of life. Other factors must also be investigated such as level of education, circumstances surrounding the diagnosis (new diagnosis or relapse), management (single therapy or adjuvant therapy), the level of physical activity, the patient's age and the presence of functional disorders, etc.
