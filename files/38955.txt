Panitumumab IRDye800 Optical Imaging Study
Phase I trial to evaluate the safety of escalating dose levels of conjugated panitumumab-IRDye800 in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that undergo surgery with curative intent.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab IRDye 800|DEVICE: da Vinci Firefly|DEVICE: IMAGE1 + ICG Hopkins telescope and/or VITOM
Safety profile of panitumumab conjugated panitumumab IRDye800 will be measured by assessing number of Grade 2 or higher adverse events, Safety profile of panitumumab conjugated to IRDye800CW (panitumumab IRDye800) will be measured by assessing number of Grade 2 or higher adverse events which have been determined to be clinically significant and definitely, probably or possibly related., 30 days
Efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 will be measured by tumor to background ratio, Efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 will be measured by tumor to background ratio. Fluorescence intensity of tumor tissue compared to that of normal surrounding tissue., 7 days|Optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize tumor to background ratio, Fluorescence intensity of tissue obtained from patients undergoing surgery at different time points in various cohorts, 7 days
This is a Phase I trial that is designed to evaluate the safety of escalating dose levels of conjugated panitumumab-IRDye800 used in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that undergo surgery with curative intent. Safety data from this trial will be studied to assist in the selection of dose levels of panitumumab-IRDye800 for future research. It is hoped that this study will also help in finding better methods for identifying cancer intraoperatively for a more complete surgical resection.
