A Study of an Investigational Medication for the Treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Dialysis Patients
This 6 month long study will assess an investigational medication for patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The study will look at the effects on parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus levels.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism|End Stage Renal Disease
DRUG: AMG 073|DRUG: Placebo
To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 073 compared with placebo by determining the proportion of subjects with a mean intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) value <= 250 pg/mL (26.5 pmol/L) during the efficacy assessment phase., efficacy assessment phase (last 14 weeks of treatment)
To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 073 compared with placebo by determining: percentage change from baseline in mean calcium x phosphorus product (Ca x P) during the efficacy assessment phase, efficacy assessment phase (last 14 weeks of treatment)|To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 073 compared with placebo by determining: changes in self-reported cognitive function from baseline to the end of the efficacy assessment phase, efficacy assessment phase (last 14 weeks of treatment)|To evaluate the safety of AMG 073 compared with placebo., entire study
