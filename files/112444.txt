Efficacy Study of Risedronate to Prevent Cancer Treatment-Induced Bone Loss in Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer patients treated with LHRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide) lose bone mineral density. This is similar to post-menopausal osteoporosis. Risedronate is approved to prevent osteoporosis. We hypothesize that risedronate may also be effective in prostate cancer patients treated with LHRH agonists.

IV bisphosphonates have proven effective in treating bone loss in prostate cancer patients treated with LHRH agonists. However, it is yet to be determined if an oral bisphosphonate such as risedronate could offer the same benefits.
