DRUG: CC-486|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Methodology, PFS was defined according to the FDA Methodology as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (documented by computed tomography scan, not including symptomatic deterioration) or death for (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Those who did not have disease progression or had not died as of the data cutoff date were censored at the time of the last radiologic assessment where the participant was documented to be progression-free prior to the data cutoff date. Progressive disease includes at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion., From Day 1 of study drug treatment to the date of disease progression; up to the clinical cut-off date of 12 April 2017; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on European Medicines Agency Methodology, Progression-free survival was defined according to EMA methodology as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (documented by computed tomography scan result, not including symptomatic deterioration) or death for (any cause) on or prior to the data cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the last known time that the participant was progression free. However, occasional missing observations or initiation of subsequent new anticancer therapy would not result in censoring for this analysis. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion., From Day 1 of study drug treatment to the date of disease progression; up to the clinical cut-off date of 12 April 2017; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for a Minimum Duration of 18 Weeks Compared to Baseline, Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed stable disease, complete or partial response during the course of study, according to RECIST v1.1, as evaluated by the investigator.

RECIST v 1.1 is defined as:

* Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline
* Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease
* Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion. When stable disease was believed to be the best response, it must have met the minimum duration of 10 weeks from randomization., Response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until DP, new anticancer initiation, or withdrawal of consent; maximum treatment exposure for CC-486 + PBZ was 61 weeks and 60 weeks for PBO +PBZ|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time in months between day 1 of treatment and death from any cause. Participants who were still alive as of the clinical cut-off date had their OS censored at the date of last contact or clinical cut-off, whichever was earlier. Participants who were lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study or who were withdrawn from the study were censored at the time of last contact., From Day 1 of treatment up to the clinical cut-off date of 12 April 2017, whichever occurred earlier; median follow-up time for OS was 11.3 months in the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 12.2 months in the PBZ + Placebo arm|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Overall Response of Complete Response or Partial Response, The best overall response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an objective confirmed complete response or partial response according to RECIST v1.1, compared with baseline where baseline was the last computed tomography (CT) scan obtained prior to or on day 1 of study treatment.

RECIST v1.1 is defined as:

* Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline
* Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease
* Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion., Response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until DP, new anticancer initiation, or withdrawal of consent; maximum treatment exposure for CC-486 + PBZ was 61 weeks and 60 weeks for PBZ + PBO|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the investigational product (IP) through 28 days after the last dose of IP. In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 and based on the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild; Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life threatening Grade 5 = Death., From date of first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of IP; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC∞) of CC-486, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 extrapolated to infinity, calculated as \[AUCt + Ct/ λz\]. Ct is the last quantifiable concentration. No AUC extrapolation was performed with unreliable λz. If AUC % extrap is ≥25%, AUCi inf was not reported., Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUCt) of CC-486, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, calculated by linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing., PK blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of CC-486, Maximum observed plasma concentration, obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data., PK blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of CC-486, Time to maximum observed plasma concentration obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data., PK blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Terminal Phase of Half-life (T1/2) of CC-486, Terminal phase half-life in plasma, calculated as \[(ln 2)/λz\]. t1/2 was only be calculated when a reliable estimate for λz could be obtained., PK blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Apparent Total Plasma Clearance (CL/F) of CC-486, Apparent total plasma clearance (CL/F) of CC-486 was calculated as Dose/AUC∞, PK blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vd/F) of CC-486, Apparent volume of distribution, was calculated according to the equation: Vd/F = (CL/F)/λz, PK blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after CC-486 administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind study to assess the safety and efficacy of CC-486 and pembrolizumab combination therapy versus pembrolizumab plus placebo in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had received one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.

Approximately 100 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive CC-486 plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab as follows:

* Arm A: CC-486 300 mg administered orally daily on days 1 to 14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle
* Arm B: Placebo administered orally daily on days 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle

Randomization will be stratified between treatment arms by histology (non-squamous versus squamous).

The decision to discontinue a patient, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor, remains the responsibility of the treating physician. However, prior to discontinuing a patient, the Investigator may contact the medical monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion.

In the follow-up phase, anticancer treatment administered following the last dose of investigational product (IP) and survival will be followed every 8 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost-to follow-up, whichever occurs first, or the End of Trial.

The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

Primary analysis will be conducted when 70 Progression Free Survival (PFS) events have occurred.
