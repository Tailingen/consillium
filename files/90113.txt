PET Imaging-guided Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Since multiple studies have demonstrated that PET can identify responders and non-responders to induction chemotherapy, using FDG-PET imaging to guide treatment decisions has prompted interest in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether changing chemotherapy regimen during radiation based on PET response to induction chemotherapy can improve clinical complete response (cCR) in patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Neoplasm, Esophageal|Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Leucovorin|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy|DEVICE: PET
clinical complete response, RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria was used to determine the tumor response. Tumor response was evaluated 3 months after the completion of treatment based on CT or PET-CT scans, endoscopy with biopsies., 3 months after the treatment (plus or minus 7 days)
Overall survival, From the enrollment to the date of death from any cause or date of lost follow-up, 3 years after randomization|Progression-free survival, From the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or last follow-up, 3 years after randomization|Chemoradiotherapy-related toxicity, Treatment-related toxicity, From the date of randomization to the 3 months after treatment
A total of 216 patients with baseline PET scan were randomized to one of 2 induction chemotherapy arms: paclitaxel/cisplatin (TP) on days 1, 22 or FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-FU) on days 1, 15, 29. Repeat PET was performed on days 36-42 and changes in max standardized uptake value (SUVmax) from baseline were assessed. Using a predefined cut-off value of a 35% decrease in SUVmax, PET responders (â‰¥35% decrease in SUVmax) continued on the same chemotherapy regimen during radiotherapy, whereas PET non-responders (\<35% decrease in SUVmax) crossed over to an alternative chemotherapy regimen concomitantly with radiation. All patients received external-beam radiation using intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The prescribed dose is generally 50-60 Gy in 25-28 fractions, 5 days per week.
