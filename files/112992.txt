PediRISE Feasibility
The goal of this research study is to learn whether investigators can successfully give the PediRISE program to families-in other words, whether most families are interested in participating in a study about the PediRISE program, including a 50-50 chance of receiving standard usual care, and a 50-50 chance of receiving the PediRISE support program.

The names of the study groups in this research study are:

* PediRISE Program Group
* Usual Care Group
Pediatric Cancer|Financial Stress|Financial Hardship|Disparities
BEHAVIORAL: PediRISE Resource Program
Rate of Participant Consent, Feasibility of intervention is defined as \>75% of screened participants consent to randomization., 1 Day|6-Month Follow Up Rate for PediRISE Program Group, Feasibility of the intervention is defined as \<20% of randomized participants who do not complete 6-month survey in PediRiSE Program group., At 6 months|6-Month Follow Up Rate for Usual Care Group, Feasibility of the intervention is defined as \<20% of randomized participants who do not complete 6-month survey in Usual Care Group., At 6 months
This is a pilot, multi-center, randomized research study for the feasibility of the administration of the PediRISE program among 40 poverty exposed children with newly diagnosed cancer. Randomization means there is an equal chance of being assigned to the PediRISE Program Group or the Usual Care Group.

Study procedures include screening for eligibility, study visits, and completion of surveys and questionnaires.

Participation in this study will last for about 6-months.

It is expected that about 40 pediatric participants with parents/guardians will take part in this research study.

This study is being supported by grants from the American Cancer Society and the Children's Cancer Research Fund.
