Evaluating Factors Affecting Survival in Colon and Rectum Cancer
Colorectal cancers are frequent among cancers of the gastrointestinal system. Whether there are any differences between survival in rectum and colon cancer patients is controversial. This study aimed to compare survival in the surgically treated rectum and colon cancers and determine the factors affecting survival.

Colorectal cancers are frequent in the gastrointestinal system. It is the 4th most common cancer after lung, prostate, and bladder in the male population and it is the 3rd after breast and thyroid cancers in the female population according to World Health Organization. It is considered significant morbidity and mortality cause and is estimated to develop in more than 1.000.000 individuals annually worldwide. Colorectal cancers form 10% of all cancers in the female and male populations. It is the 2nd most common cause of death among cancers in the United States of America.

In studies, it is stated that the risk of developing colorectal cancer in an individual is 5-6%. Also, the risk of death of an individual due to colorectal cancer was determined as 3%. In the last 50 years, the rate of colorectal cancer mortality decreased in the female population while it did not change in the male population. Whether there is a difference in survival time between rectum and colon cancers is controversial.

With the development in neoadjuvant treatment approaches, poor prognosis in past years got better. Recent studies show that the prognosis in rectum cancers is better than in colon. Nevertheless, factors affecting prognosis other than treatment for both colon and rectum cancers are not clarified.

In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the surgically treated rectum and colon cancer patients' survival and factors affecting survival time.
