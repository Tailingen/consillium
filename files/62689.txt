A Study of a Retroviral Replicating Vector Combined With a Prodrug Administered to Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma
This is a multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose trial of the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of Toca 511, a Retroviral Replicating Vector (RRV), administered to patients with recurrent high grade glioma (rHGG) who have undergone surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Patients will receive Toca 511 either via stereotactic, transcranial injection into their tumor or as an intravenous injection given daily for 3 \& 5 days, depending on cohort. Approximately 3-4 weeks following injection of the RRV, treatment with Toca FC, an antifungal agent, will commence and will be repeated approximately every 6 weeks until study completion. After completion of this study, all patients will be eligible for enrollment and encouraged to enter a long-term continuation protocol that enables additional Toca FC treatment cycles to be given, as well as permits the collection of long-term safety and survival data.
