A Study of AK119 (Anti-CD73) in Combination With AK104 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1a/1b, Multicenter, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-tumor Activity of AK119 (Anti-CD73) in Combination with AK104 in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: AK119|BIOLOGICAL: AK104
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after the last dose of study drug|Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be assessed during the first 6 weeks of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first 6 weeks of treatment., During the first 6 weeks
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1, Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for â‰¥8 weeks) based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AK119 and AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK include serum concentrations of AK119 and AK104 at different timepoints after study drug administration., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after last dose of study drug|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK119 and AK104 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK include serum concentrations of AK119 and AK104 at different timepoints after study drug administration., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after last dose of study drug|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK119 and AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable antidrug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of study drug through 90 days after last dose of study drug
