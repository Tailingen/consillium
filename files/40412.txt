Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: O6-benzylguanine|DRUG: carmustine
Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with O6-benzylguanine and carmustine., Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with O6-benzylguanine and carmustine.
* Evaluate tumor tissue biochemical and immunohistochemical predictors of response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Correlate carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the peripheral blood with response in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive O6-benzylguanine (BG) IV over 1 hour and carmustine IV over 1 hour (beginning 1 hour after completion of BG infusion) on day 1. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.7-3 years.
