MRI Guided HIFU for Palliation of Painful Skeletal Metastases in Children
The Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU system is expected to be effective in reducing pain intensity and/or reducing analgesic use in patients with painful uncomplicated bone metastases. No serious adverse effects are expected to result from this treatment.

DEVICE: MRI Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
Change in pain intensity scores from baseline as measured on pain diaries., As measured on the pain diaries before and at day 2, 7, 14, 30 and 90 days following treatment., 2, 7, 14, 30 and 90 days following treatment
Improved patient quality of life after MR-HIFU using a quality of life questionnaire., Using age appropriate quality of life questionnaire that involves interviewing patient and/or parent/guardian before and 2, 7, 14, 30 and 90 days post treatment., 2, 7, 14, 30 and 90 days post treatment
The objective of this study is to determine if MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is an effective technique for alleviating the pain associated with bone metastases in paediatric cancer patients. This technique meant to be an adjunct therapy to the standard-of-care, which includes radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Safety of the technique will be assessed through evaluating non-targeted heating using MRI-based temperature mapping, and inspecting patients post-treatment for skin burns. or other signs of serious adverse events. Efficacy of the technique will be assessed by evaluating/recording patients observed pain, quality of life, and pain medication usage both before and up to 3 months following treatment.
