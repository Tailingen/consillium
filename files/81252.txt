To evaluate the efficacy of KA2507 (an orally active potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitor) in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) previously treated with standard of care chemotherapy.

ABC-11 is an open-label, multi-centre study of HDAC6 inhibition using KA2507 in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer previously treated with standard of care chemotherapy.

This is a single-arm single-stage phase II study designed using A'Hern's methodology.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of KA2507 in patients with advanced BTC previously treated with standard of care chemotherapy

A fixed daily dose of KA2507 (800mg BID) will be administered to all patients based on a phase I study, KTP-003.
