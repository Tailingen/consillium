Treatment of Patients With Everolimus and Imatinib Mesylate Who Have Progressive Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) and Are Resistant to Imatinib Mesylate
The purpose of this multicenter, single-arm, Simon two-stage, phase II trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with Imatinib mesylate in patients with previously treated, histologically proven GIST whose disease has recurred or progressed while receiving 400 mg/day of Imatinib mesylate at any time during at least a 2 months' treatment period.
Progressive Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
DRUG: Imatinib mesylate
Tumor assessments should be performed by a CT or MRI scan after 4 months. Response to treatment with RAD001 plus Imatinib mesylate at 4 months (defined as progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months)., at 4 months
Tolerability and safety assessed by AEs and SAEs. Objective tumor response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) assessed by CT or MRI PFS at month 12 for patients with data available from follow up observation (optional), At 12 months
