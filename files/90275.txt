Dose Escalation/De-escalation Study of Pre-operative Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases(RAD 1002)
This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of changing the order of receiving radiation therapy for treating brain cancer. The investigators hope that changing the sequence of radiation therapy will lower the risk of cancer spreading throughout your spinal fluid, which covers your brain and spinal cord.

RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgery (15 Gy)|RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgery (12 Gy)
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastasis, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose of stereotactic radiosurgery delivered pre-operative at which no more than 2 out of 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., one year
Acute Toxicity with preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), Any possible, probable, or definite treatment-related AE or SAE (assessed by CTCAE 4.0) occurring within six months or less from the date of stereotactic radiosurgery was received., 6 months|Late Toxicity with preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), Any possible, probable, or definite treatment-related AE or SAE (assessed by CTCAE 4.0) occurring more than six months from the date of stereotactic radiosurgery was received., 1 year|Rates of Local Control, This will be assessed by MRI Imaging obtained post-operatively at follow-up visits., 2 years|Rates of Leptomeningeal Dissemination, Leptomeningeal Dissemination (LMD) defined as diffuse carcinomatosis and/or distant focal pachymeningeal (dural) tumor and assessed by MRI Imaging for the study period., 2 years
This study will attempt to determine the maximum tolerated dose of pre-operative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the treatment of brain metastases. Patients will be placed in one of two dose groups based on index tumor size, and dose will be adjusted according to presence or absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

Group A: Index Tumor \> 2 cm and up to 4 cm in maximum diameter Group B: Index Tumor \> 4 cm and up to 6 cm in maximum diameter

Dose escalation or de-escalation will be conducted via a modified 3+3 method at the following levels. Group A will start at dose level II. Group B will start at dose level I.

Dose Level I: 12 Gy Dose Level II: 15 Gy
