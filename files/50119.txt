Measurements Of Zinc Concentration On Specimens Taken During Trans-Perineal Prostate Biopsy
The purposes of this study are to: i) confirm and improve the accuracy of the correlation between levels of Zinc in prostate tissue and the grade of prostate cancer in that tissue as determined through pathology; and ii) determine the levels of zinc in prostate tissue declared as non-cancerous by pathology and located in the vicinity of tissue declared as cancerous by pathology, and verify that the Zinc levels for the declared non-cancerous tissue are lower (statistically significantly) than the levels for benign tissue not in the vicinity of cancerous tissue.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: prostate biopsy
Verify the existence of correlation between low levels of Zinc concentration in a biopsy specimen and the prostate cancer grade for that specimen determined by pathology., Zinc measurements on biopsy specimens are performed during the biopsy session; pathology classification is typically performed within 2-4 weeks.
Verify that the levels of zinc in non-cancerous specimens located in the vicinity of a specimen declared as cancerous by pathology are lower (statistically significantly) than the levels for benign specimens not in the vicinity of the cancerous specimen., Time frame for pathology: within 2-4 weeks
