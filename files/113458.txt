Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases.
Metastatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: monoclonal antibody Me1-14 F(ab')2
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of 131-iodine-labeled monoclonal antibody fragment Me1-14 F(ab')2 administered intrathecally in patients with neoplasms metastatic to the leptomeninges. II. Identify objective therapeutic responses to this treatment.

OUTLINE: Radioimmunotherapy. Iodine-131-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody Fragment Me1-14 F(ab')2, 131I-Me1-14 F(ab')2.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to 6 patients will be treated at each dose studied.
