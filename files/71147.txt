Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Plus CRT Versus Neoadjuvant CRT for Locally Advanced Resectable ESCC
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility and outcome of anti-PD-1 antibody (Tislelizumab, BeiGene) combined with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy for locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cII-III Stage) patient.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Stage II|Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Stage III
PROCEDURE: Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy|DRUG: Tislelizumab|PROCEDURE: Ivor-Lewis or Mckeown Esophagectomy(Mckeown Esophagectomy recommended)
Pathological response rate(pCR), The resected specimen following neo-adjuvant treatment are assessed by using standardized work up of the resection specimen in the pathology department and standardized histological criteria for tumor regression grading. The degree of histomorphologic regression is clarified into four categories as follows: grade 1, no evidence of vital residual tumor cells (pathological complete response); grade 2, less than 10% vital residual tumor cells; grade 3, 10 to 50%; and grade 4, more than 50%., Up to the date of pathological reports obtained since the date of randomization, up to 12 months|Overall survival(OS), Up to the date of death of any causes since the date of randomization, up to 36 months
Treatment related complications, Number and severity of adverse events that are related to treatment of each patients (including adverse events associated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, immunotherapy(irAE) and surgery), and hospital re-admission. Treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 1 month after surgery since the data of randomization, up to 13 months|Progression-free survival(PFS), Disease recurrence is defined as locoregional (esophageal bed or anastomotic or regional lymph nodes) or metastatic (supraclavicular lymph nodes or distant organs), Up to the date of disease recurrence since the date of randomization, up to 36 months|R0 resection rate, No vital tumor is presented at the proximal, distal, or circumferential resection margin, it is considered to be R0 resection. If a vital tumor is shown at 1 mm or less from the proximal, distal, or circumferential resection margin, it is considered to be microscopically positive (R1)., Up to the date of pathological reports obtained since the date of randomization, up to 12 months|Number and Location of positive lymph nodes, According to pathological reports, record the number and location of positive lymph nodes, Up to the date of pathological reports obtained since the date of randomization, up to 12 months|Overall Quality of life, Overall Quality of life is respectively evaluated at randomization and 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and yearly after surgery among patients by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 Scale (EORTC QLQ-C30), Up to the end of follow-up since the data of surgery, up to 36 months|Quality of life in eating and swallowing function, Quality of life in eating and swallowing function is respectively evaluated at randomization and 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and yearly after surgery among patients by using the EORTC QLQ-OES18 Scale, Up to the end of follow-up since the data of surgery, up to 36 months|Recurrence-free survival (RFS), RFS is defined in resected patients who achieved an R0 or R1 resection as the time interval from surgery to the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant) or death, whichever comes first., Up to the date of disease recurrence since the date of surgery, up to 36 months|Correlation between genetic profile and tumor response, Genetic profile (assessed by whole exome sequencing, T-cell receptor sequencing, RNA sequencing) .illumina HiSeq and Nanostring platforms will be used to evaluate the patient's genetic profile. The tumor response will be evaluated by an experienced thoracic tumor pathologist in our center through Tumor regression grading (TRG) systems., Up to the end of follow-up since the data of surgery, up to 36 months
It is a prospective randomized phase II\&III clinical trial sponsored by Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital with other twelve hospitals in China participating in. 476 patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cII-III Stage) are recruited and randomly assigned into the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy group (nCRT plus anti-PD-1 Group) and the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group (nCRT Group) according to the proportion of 1:1. The safety, efficacy of protocols and prognosis of patients are compared between the two regimens.
