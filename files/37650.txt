Diet and Physical Activity Program in Colorectal Cancer Survivor: a Randomized Controlled Trial
Colorectal cancers (CRC) represent the 1st digestive cancer and the 3rd cancer in the world. The World Cancer Research Fund summarized evidence from observational studies and concluded that low dietary fiber, and high red and processed meat (RPM) intakes were associated with higher risk of (CRC), whilst physical activity (PA) protected against developing colon cancer.

Post-treatment management is essential for improving the health and quality of life of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. The number of cancer survivors is continually increasing, which is causing a corresponding growth in the need for effective post- treatment management programs. To date, there is insufficient information available from the published literature as to the most effective way in promoting lifestyle changes in CRC survivors. Moreover, none of these interventions have been conducted in an African population. We aim to assess whether the proposed program may effectively modify the targeted behaviors, to evaluate whether the dietary and PA interventions of the "Moving Bright, Eating Smart" program are effective in reducing the consumption of red and processed meat (RPM) and refined grain (RG), increasing the physical activity (PA) levels in north African (Libyan and Tunisian) adult colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors and to assess the efficacy of behavioral interventions on cancer outcomes (overall survival, disease free survival).
