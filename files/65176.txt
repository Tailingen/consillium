Baclofen-Amitriptyline Hydrochloride-Ketamine Gel in Treating Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Chemotherapy in Patients With Cancer
RATIONALE: Baclofen-amitriptyline-ketamine (BAK) gel may lessen peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether BAK gel is more effective than a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy .

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying BAK gel to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.

Total Sensory Neuropathy as Measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life [QLQ] - Chemo-induced Peripheral Neuropathy [CIPN20], The scoring algorithm for the parent instrument, the EORTC QLQ-C30, was applied for linearly converting items and subscales of CIPN-20 to 0-100 scales so that a high score corresponds to better condition or less symptom. The primary analysis was the change in sensory neuropathy subscale of the CIPN-20 from baseline to week 4. The area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to week 4 was calculated for each patient's sensory neuropathy score. The average AUC for the placebo arm was compared to the average AUC for the topical amitriptyline HCl/ baclofen/ ketamine arm using a Wilcoxon rank sum test., From baseline to 4 weeks
Motor Neuropathy as Measured by the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 at Baseline and Week 4, The scoring algorithm for the parent instrument, the EORTC QLQ-C30, was applied for linearly converting items and subscales of CIPN-20 to 0-100 scales so that a high score corresponds to better condition or less symptom. The secondary analysis was to compare changes from baseline at 4 weeks for the motor neuropathy subscale of the CIPN-20. To analyze this endpoint, the area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to week 4 was calculated for each patient's motor neuropathy score. The average AUC for the placebo arm was compared to the average AUC for the topical amitriptyline HCl/ baclofen/ ketamine arm using a Wilcoxon rank sum test., From Baseline to week 4|Autonomic Symptoms and Functioning as Measured by the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 at Baseline and Week 4, The scoring algorithm for the parent instrument, the EORTC QLQ-C30, was applied for linearly converting items and subscales of CIPN-20 to 0-100 scales so that a high score corresponds to better condition or less symptom. The secondary analysis was to compare changes from baseline at 4 weeks for the autonomic neuropathy subscale of the CIPN-20. To analyze this endpoint, the area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to week 4 was calculated for each patient's motor neuropathy score. The average AUC for the placebo arm was compared to the average AUC for the topical amitriptyline HCl/ baclofen/ ketamine arm using a Wilcoxon rank sum test., Up to 4 weeks|Mood States and Total Mood Disturbance as Measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Each mood scale (0 - 100, higher is better mood) will be analyzed as an endpoint along with the total mood disturbance score., At 4 weeks|Pain Severity and Interference as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at Baseline and Week 4, Pain severity, defined by the four items addressing worst, least, and average pain and pain right now as measured by the BPI will be analyzed identical to the primary endpoint. Additionally, total pain interference as measured by the BPI will be transformed onto a 0-100 ( higher is less pain) point scale. The area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to week 4 was calculated for each patient's score. The average AUC for the placebo arm and the topical amitriptyline HCl/ baclofen/ ketamine arm are reported., Up to 4 weeks|Numbness, Tingling, and Pain as Measured by the Peripheral Neuropathy Questionnaire at Baseline and Weekly for 4 Weeks, The Peripheral Neuropathy Questionnaire was used to analyze this endpoint. Patient neuropathy symptoms were scored on a 0 - 100 scale (higher score represents less symptomatic). The area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to week 4 was calculated for each patient's score. The average AUC for the placebo arm and the topical amitriptyline HCl/ baclofen/ ketamine arm are reported., Up to 4 weeks|Adverse Event Profile of Topical Amitriptyline HCl/ Baclofen/Ketamine > Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events Reported by the Patient in the > Symptom Experience Diary and Evaluated Through Clinical Assessment by NCI CTCAE v3.0, Frequency and severity of adverse events reported by patients in weekly diary and evaluated through clinical assessment by NCI CTCAE v3.0. The number of patients reporting grade 3 or higher events are reported in this outcome measure. For a full list of all events, please refer to the Adverse Events section of this report., Up to 4 weeks
OBJECTIVES Primary

* Compare the effectiveness of baclofen-amitriptyline hydrochloride-ketamine (BAK) gel versus placebo, in terms of improving sensory neuropathy, in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy\> Secondary\>
* Compare motor and autonomic symptoms and functioning, mood states, pain, and peripheral neuropathy in these patients.
* Assess the adverse event profile of topical BAK gel.
* Explore whether topical BAK gel is absorbed systemically. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy (active vs non-active), current use of opioids or oral pain medications (yes vs no), pain rating (4-7 vs 8-10), and prior ineffective pharmacologic treatment for peripheral neuropathy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
* Arm I: Patients apply 1 spoonful of baclofen-amitriptyline hydrochloride-ketamine gel topically to each area of pain, numbness, and/or tingling on the feet and/or hands twice daily for 4 weeks.
* Arm II: Patients apply 1 spoonful of placebo gel topically to each area of pain, numbness, and/or tingling on the feet and/or hands twice daily for 4 weeks.

Some patients in both arms may choose to continue on the active gel or, if on placebo, begin the active gel for an additional 8 weeks off study. Patients complete health, pain, mood, and quality of life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study. Patients also record adverse symptoms weekly in a Symptom Experience Diary.
