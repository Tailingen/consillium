A Study of VS-6766 and Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Doctors leading this study hope to learn about the safety of combining the study drug VS-6766 with another drug called cetuximab in colorectal cancer. This study is for individuals who have advanced colorectal cancer and their cancer has progressed while getting previous treatment or individuals who cannot take/tolerate previous treatments. If you choose to participate, your time in this research will last up to 24 months.

DRUG: VS-6766/avutometinib|DRUG: Cetuximab|OTHER: Pill Diary
Phase I Primary Objective: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of VS-6766 combined with Cetuximab, The maximum tolerated dose of VS-6766 in combination with cetuximab in participants who have KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer after disease progression or evidence of intolerance to fluorouracil (5- FU) /capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab (if indicated). Doctors leading the study will find the maximum tolerated dose by assessing the rate of serious side effects (known as "dose limiting toxicities") among participants according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) for Adverse Events Version 5., 2 years|Phase 2 Primary Objective: Objective Response Rate of Participants Who Take Phase I /MTD Dose of VS-6766 combined with Cetuximab, Objective response rate or participants who take the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VS-6766 combined with cetuximab that was established in phase 1 (the dose-finding portion) of the study. The objective response rate (how the participant's cancer responds to the study drugs) will be measured and assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., 2 years
Phase 1 Objective: The Number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (Serious Side Effects) Reported Among Participants Taking VS-6766 and Cetuximab, The number of dose-limiting toxicities reported among participants who take VS-6766 and cetuximab at dose levels set by study doctor. Dose-limiting toxicities will be graded/measured using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 5.0., 2 years|Phase 1 Objective: Frequency/ Type of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (Serious Side Effects) Reported Among Participants Taking VS-6766 and Cetuximab, The type of dose-limiting toxicities and their frequency reported among participants who take VS-6766 and cetuximab at dose levels set by study doctor. Dose-limiting toxicities will be graded/measured using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 5.0., 2 years|Phase 2 Objective: Duration of Response, The date at which the participant's earliest best objective status is first noted to be either a complete response or partial response at the earliest date progression is documented, or death if no prior evidence of disease progression. Duration of response will be assessed according to clinical study records and statistical analysis of study data., 2 years|Phase 2 Objective: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from study entry to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause as determined by Response Evaluation In Solid Tumors Criteria 1.1 and statistical analysis of study data (Kaplan-Meier method)., 2 years|Phase 2 Objective: Two-Month Progression-Free Survival, Two-month progression-free survival defined as the proportion of subjects who did not die nor progress with disease two months after starting therapy as assessed by clinical notes/ study records and statistical analysis of study data., 2 months|Phase 2 Objective: Overall Survival, The time from study entry until death from any cause according to clinical notes/study records., 2 years|Phase II Objective: Complete Response, Complete response for at least 4 months while on treatment as assessed by clinical notes/study records., 4 months|Phase II Objective: Partial Response, Partial response for at least 4 months while on treatment as assessed by clinical notes/study records., 4 months|Phase II Objective: Stable Disease, Stable disease for at least 4 months while on treatment as assessed by clinical notes/study records., 4 months
The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of VS-6766 in combination with cetuximab. Doctors leading this study want to find out if combining two medications (cetuximab and VS-6766) is better or worse than the usual approach for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The usual approach for treating colorectal cancer after it progresses involves chemotherapies like Fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, irinotecan and possibly a medication like bevacizumab. This study will instead combine cetuximab and VS-6766 to find out if the two medications can help people living with advanced colorectal cancers with certain mutations (differences) called KRAS mutations.
