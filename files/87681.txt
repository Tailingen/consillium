Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Patients Affected by Metastatic Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
The main objective of the trial is to document the progression free survival (PFS) in advanced or metastatic small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) patients previously treated with at least one therapeutic regimen
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: NGR-hTNF|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Antitumour Activity Defined as Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until disease progression, or death due to any cause or the last patient was known to be alive. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (Recist v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition the appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression, From the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 150 weeks
Tumor Growth Control Rate (TGCR), evaluated according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST V1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI:

* Complete Response (CR):Disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the base line sum LD
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., Assessed every 6-12 weeks, up to 150 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival was defined as the time from the baseline CT scan to death due to any cause, or the last date the patient was known to be alive., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Experimental Imaging Study (DCE-MRI), To document possible modifications on vessels permeability by imaging techniques, during the study|Number of Adverse Events, Reported by Severity and Relation to Treatment, Evaluation according to NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events (version 3.0), Through study completion, an average of 3 years
This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized study that will be conducted in patients affected by advanced or metastatic SCLC, previously treated with at least one therapeutic regimen, that will be conducted using Simon's two-stage design method.
