Study to Evaluate TNG348 Alone and With a PARP Inhibitor in Patients With BRCA 1/2 Mutant or HRD+ Solid Tumors
The goal of this interventional clinical trial is to learn about TNG348, a ubiquitin specific peptidase 1 (USP1) inhibitor, alone and in combination with olaparib in patients with BRCA 1/2 mutant or HRD+ solid tumors.

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent and combination therapy
* to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2 of single agent and combination therapy
* to determine the pharmacokinetics of TNG348 as a single agent and in combination therapy
* to evaluate the initial antineoplastic activity as a single agent and in combination therapy

Participants will receive study treatment until they experience an undesirable side effect, their disease progresses or until they withdraw consent.

This is a first-in-human Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion study designed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) and evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of TNG348 single agent and in combination with olaparib in participants with BRCA1/2 mutant or other HRD+ advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

In Phase 1 (dose escalation), the single agent component will explore escalating oral doses of TNG348 administered alone and in combination with olaparib.

Participants in Phase 2 (dose expansion) will be dosed at the RP2D(s) determined from Phase 1 based on safety and tolerability demonstrated, along with the available PK data and studied during Phase 1, as applicable.

In the Phase 2 portion of the study, both single agent and combination therapy may be evaluated to assess an early signal of clinical benefit, as well as for confirmation of safety and tolerability.
