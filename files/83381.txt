Clinical Trial of HuMax-CD4, a New Drug to Treat Early Stage T-Cell Lymphoma in the Skin.
The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of HuMax-CD4 as a treatment for early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Almost all participants who are affected by CTCL have cancerous cells which bear a receptor called CD4. HuMax-CD4 is an investigational drug directed against this receptor. There is no placebo in this trial; all participants will be treated with HuMax-CD4. During the trial, the response rates, duration of responses, relief of symptoms, and safety profile of HuMax-CD4 will be evaluated.
