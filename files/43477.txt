A Study of RC118 in Patients with Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Malignant Solid Tumors
In Phase I, This study will explore the tolerability and safety of RC118 in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant solid tumors with positive Claudin 18.2 expression, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose in phase II clinical trials (RP2D); In Phase IIa, to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of long-term use of RC118 at RP2D doses for patients with different tumor types。
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: RC118-ADC
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), In the DLT evaluation window (observation period 1-28 days after the first administration), according to the NCI-CTCAE v5.0 grading standard, the investigator or the sponsor believes that toxic reaction which are reasonably related to RC118 treatment, 28 days after first treatment.|The incidence and severity of adverse events (AE), Adverse events was assessed by investigator(s) according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, From the day of ICF sign to 28 days after the day of the last treatment|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 15 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease(SD), 15 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 15 months|Duration of Remission (DOR), Duration of response is the length of time that a tumor continues to respond to treatment without the cancer growing or spreading, 15 months|Pharmacokinetic index, Tmax ，etc., 15 months|Immunogenicity, Anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive samples, etc., 15 months|Overall survival（OS）, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to approximately 2 years
this study is an open, single arm, multi-center Phase I /IIa clinical study. In the phase I, patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant solid tumors (gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) that are positive for Claudin 18.2(positive membrane staining observed in any tumor cells) will be included. in Phase I dose escalation phase, 7 dose groups will be preset：0.25 mg/kg、0.5 mg/kg、1.0 mg/kg、1.5 mg/kg、2.0 mg/kg、2.5 mg/kg、3.0mg/kg; In phase I dose confirmation phase, it is initially considered to set up 1\~2 dose groups according to the dose-escalation phase MTD/MAD, with 3\~6 subjects in each group. In the phase IIa cohort expansion phase, with reference to the results of the phase I study, subjects were grouped according to different tumor types, there are 30 subjects in each group, initially considering the inclusion of Claudin 18.2 positive(a clear cut-off value will be defined based on the results of Phase I) locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and pancreatic cancer patients.(The specific tumor types and groups will be further adjusted based on the results of the phase I study).
