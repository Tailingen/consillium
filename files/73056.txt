Efficacy and Safety of Almonertinib Combined With or Without Chemotherapy as an Adjuvant Treatment for Stage II-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma Following Complete Tumour Resection
This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase III study.
Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Almonertinib|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cisplatin
Disease free survival (DFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Disease free survival (DFS), Defined as the proportion of patients alive and disease free at 2, 3 ,4and 5 years, respectively, estimated from Kaplan Meier plots of the primary endpoint of DFS at the time of the primary analysis., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until date of death due to any cause., Start of study drug to Survival Endpoint through study completion, an average of 5 years, assessed up to 100 months|Patient health-related quality of life and symptoms (HRQoL) by SF-36v2 Health Survey, Defined as a patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section and the scores range from 0-100. A score of 0 is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., From date of randomization until treatment completion or discontinuation, assessed up to 100 months
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), AEs graded by CTCAE version 4.0, From date of randomization until 28 days after treatment completion
This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase III study assessing the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib combined with or without chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC following complete tumour resection: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either Almonertinib alone (110mg, po, once daily) or Almonertinib (110mg, po, once daily) plus pemetrexed (500mg/m2, iv) and cisplatin (500mg/m2, iv) or pemetrexed (500mg/m2, iv) plus cisplatin (500mg/m2, iv) in a 3:2:1 ratio.
