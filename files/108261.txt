A Phase lb/ll, Open Label, Single Arm Study With Olinvacimab and Capecitabine in mCRC Patients (OLCAP)
The aim on this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody olinvacimab and the capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who failed two prior chemotherapies
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Olinvacimab added to Capecitabine
Maximal tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase ll dose (RP2D) of olinvacimab in combination with capecitabine, Through phase 1b, up to 6 month|Progression free survival, Progression free survival of olinvacimab plus capecitabinel, 3 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Determination of the ORR will be calculated based on the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR using the RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigators., 2 years|overall survival, overall survival, 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR will be calculated based on the proportion of patients achieving CR, PR, or who have SD at least 6 weeks after receiving first dose of study treatment., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR will be calculated from the time of initial response (CR or PR) documentation to the time of progressive disease (PD). If a subject who had CR or PR dies without the evidence of disease progression, the case will be censored at the time point of death when analyzing DOR, 2 years|Time to response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) will be calculated from the first dose of study drug to the time point of initial response (CR or PR)., 2 years|Toxicity by CTCAE v5.0, Safety assessments should be conducted for all subjects who received olinvacimab plus capecitabine at least once. Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0., 3 years|Quality of life by FACT-C v4.0, Quality of life as measured by FACT-C v4.0, 2 years
This is a phase lb/ll, multicenter, open label, single arm study to assess efficacy and safety of the anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody olinvacimab and capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who failed two prior standard chemotherapies.

The primary objective of phase lb is to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase ll dose (RP2D) of olinvacimab in combination with capecitabine. the primary objective of phase ll is to assess the efficacy of olinvacimab plus capecitabine as a salvage regimen in metastatic colorectal carcinoma.
