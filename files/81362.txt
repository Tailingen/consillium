ROLE OF FOLIC ACID IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY-INDUCED HOT FLASHES IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS
The study's objective is to investigate the role of folic acid administration in the management of hot flashes associated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer.
THERAPY-INDUCED HOT FLASHES IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS
DRUG: Folic Acid 1 Mg Oral Tablet|DRUG: Folic Acid 5 Mg Oral Tablet
Reduction in Hot Flash Frequency and Severity, It is measured using the daily hot flash diary, which tracks the number and intensity of hot flashes over the study period., 3 months
Improvement in Quality of Life, Assessed through the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), which evaluates how hot flashes interfere with daily activities and overall well-being., 3 months|Correlation with Folic Acid Blood Levels, Folic acid levels in the blood will be measured to explore the relationship between serum folate concentrations and changes in hot flashes symptoms., 3 months
Folic acid is one of the B vitamins that when absorbed into its active form is converted to tetrahydrofolate. Folate is an essential cofactor for the biosynthesis of norepinephrine and serotonin. Studies have also noted that folate, with a mechanism like hormone replacement therapy (HRT), can improve hot flashes by interfering with monoamine neurotransmitters called norepinephrine and serotonin .The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of folic acid administration in the management of hot flashes associated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer.
