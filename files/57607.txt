The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and toxicity of focal salvage high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR BT) for patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive external beam radiotherapy. Furthermore, the investigators want to assess, whether it is feasible to perform salvage HDR BT as a focal treatment based on multiparametric (mp) pelvine MRI and PSMA PET/CT.
