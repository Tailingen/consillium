Assessment of PK Similarity of FYB206 in Comparison With Keytruda in Resected Stage II or III Melanoma Patients
Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its colour. 'Resected' means the melanoma has been completely removed with surgery.

Pembrolizumab is an anti-cancer therapy that works with the immune system to fight cancer cells. Some cancer cells develop a way to hide from the body's immune system and, thus, allow the cancer cells to spread and grow. Pembrolizumab helps the immune system recognize and kill these cancer cells that want to hide.

Pembrolizumab is a biologic drug (produced by living organisms) available in the market under the brand name Keytruda. Keytruda is approved globally for the treatment of a variety of cancers and as an addon or after therapy to primary cancer treatment like surgery. This helps prevent the cancer from returning, improving overall survival.

FYB206 is a proposed biosimilar to Keytruda. A biosimilar is not identical but very similar to its original biologic. Biosimilars are expected to have a similar effect and safety to the original biologic. To learn what happens to a drug once it is in the body is called pharmacokinetics (PK). PK for biosimilar drugs is expected to remain similar to the original biologic. This study is to show that PK of FYB206 is similar to the reference product Keytruda for patients with completely resected Stage IIB/IIC or Stage III melanoma.
