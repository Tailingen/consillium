Nurse-Led Mobile App Effect on Symptom Management for Breast Cancer Patients After Surgery
Background: The use of the Nurse-Led Mobile App (NL-Mapp) is a current and important option for educating patients about the symptoms that may arise from breast cancer surgery.

Introduction: Given the precise information and counseling services offered to breast cancer patients, NL-Mapp is considered an appropriate choice to support postoperative self-care.

Methods: This quasi-experimental study aimed to determine the impact of NL-Mapp on breast cancer patients after surgery. The study included 45 patients in the intervention group and 45 patients in the control group. First, NL-Mapp was developed by the research team. Patients were then taught how to use the app to manage their symptoms after breast cancer surgery, and online counseling was provided for patients' questions. The intervention started before surgery, and follow-up visits were made before discharge and in the first month.
