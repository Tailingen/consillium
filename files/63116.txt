Radiotherapy Plus Xevinapant in Older Patients With Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, triple blind, phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of xevinapant with radiotherapy in older patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.

Upon confirmation of eligibility, subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to:

* Arm A: 3 cycles of xevinapant (200 mg/day from Day 1 to 14, per cycle) + intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) followed by 3 cycles of xevinapant in monotherapy phase (200 mg/day from Day 1 to 14, per cycle)
* Arm B: 3 cycles of placebo (from Day 1 to 14, per cycle) + IMRT followed by 3 cycles of placebo in monotherapy phase (from Day 1 to 14, per cycle).

Patients will be stratified by institution, disease location/p16 status (p16 positive oropharyngeal cancer, versus others), G8 score. Three strata for the G8 will be used (\>14, versus 11-14 versus \<11).

Patients will undergo imaging in week 20 and upon clinical suspicion of progression/recurrence. Clinical examination will take place every 12 weeks in the first 3 years.

Response to treatment by RECIST 1.1, To estimate the added value of xevinapant over RT alone in terms of response to treatment., 5 years after first patient in|Progression Free Survival as assessed by the local investigator, To estimate the added value of xevinapant over RT alone in PFS., 5 years after first patient in|Overall Survival, To estimate the added value of xevinapant over RT alone in OS., 5 years after first patient in|Safety according to the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0 for toxicity and Serious Adverse Event reporting, To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities according to CTCAE v5.0 in the two arms., 5 years after first patient in|HRQOL as assessed by global health/QoL and physical functioning scales at week 20 (Fatigue scale from the Quality of Life Core-30 (QLQ-C30) and pain in the head and neck scale from Item List-225 (IL225))., To assess non-inferiority of xevinapant arm compared to placebo in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health/QoL and physical functioning scales.

The questionnaires employ 50 4-point Likert scales with responses from "not at all" to "very much" and two 7-point Likert scales for global health and overall HRQoL. For functional and global HRQoL scales, higher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100 scale. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents more severe symptoms., 5 years after first patient in
