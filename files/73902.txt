A Feasibility Study of Image Guided Noninvasive Single Fraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Brain Metastases
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a way to accurately treat brain tumors. SRS involves the use of a special head frame to keep the head from moving during treatment. The head frame makes very accurate treatment possible. The frame must be attached to the skull with special pins. It feels very tight and can hurt. A special immobilization device can be used to keep the head from moving.

This device does not need any pins and does not hurt. We would like to see if the new way of holding the head still can be used for SRS. This is the purpose of the study. New X-Ray machines can be used to find if the head has moved in the mask. We hope that we can use these new tools to treat brain tumors just as accurately without using a head frame. It will make treatment more comfortable for the patient. This is why we are asking patients to join the study.

Use the kilovoltage On-Board Imager (kVOBI) to precisely measure the setup accuracy of conventional, invasive frame SRS on 10 patients, conclusion of study
Use the kilovoltage On-Board Imager (kVOBI) to precisely measure the accuracy of an image guided non-invasive (Aktina stereotactic localizer) immobilization system on the same 10 patients as in above., conclusion of study|Compare setup accuracy of both systems above, and investigate the feasibility of 'system B' as replacement for 'system A' for single fraction SRS, conclusion of the study|Compute mean and standard deviation of the intra-fractional motion for non-invasive SRS., conclusion of the study
