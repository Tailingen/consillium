Generally, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are the methods of choice for the removal of benign and early malignant neoplasms of the colon. However, there are certain difficulties in terms of the EMR technique - this is an increase in the frequency of fragmentation with a lesion size of more than 20 mm, which in turn increases the risk of recurrence; with regard to ESD technique, this is a long procedure time; high incidence of complications; significant time required for teaching the technique; technical difficulties. In this regard, it is worth paying attention to the method of "endoscopic mucosal resection with circumferential mucosal incision" (C-EMR). This method deserves interest due to the fact that it allows more often to perform en-block resections in comparison with the classical method of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR - endoscopic mucosal resection); technically easier to do; takes a short procedure time.
