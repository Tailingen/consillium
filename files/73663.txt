PET Imaging Using 64Cu-Tz-SarAr and hu5B1-TCO in People With Pancreatic, Colorectal, Bladder Cancer or Cancers With Elevated CA19.9
The purpose of this study is to find the highest safe dose of hu5B1-TCO and the best dosing schedule of hu5B1-TCO and 64Cu-Tz-SarAr for finding cancer cells that are CA19-9 positive. This study will also help to find out how much radiation the body is exposed to when 64Cu-Tz-SarAr is used, and provide information on the way the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of 64Cu-Tz-SarAr.
