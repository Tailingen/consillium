In-Vitro Maturation of Oocytes From Polycystic Ovarian Patients Undergoing IVF
Retrieval of immature oocytes from women with polycystic ovaries, their in-vitro maturation, fertilization and embryo transfer can prevent hormonal treatment that can lead to ovarian hyperstimulation. In addition, it can decrease discomfort and side-effects of routine daily administration of hormones and it can be cost-effective. Thirty healthy women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome aged 20-35, with BMI 18-30 kg/msq will be included in the study. Their immature oocytes will be retrieved from small follicles without any hormonal treatment. The oocytes will be fertilized post in-vitro maturation. The developed embryros will be transferred to the patients as in a routine IVF cycle.
