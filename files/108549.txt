Vemurafenib Plus Copanlisib in Radioiodine-Refractory (RAIR) Thyroid Cancers
The purpose of this study is to develop a new drug treatment to reverse tumor resistance to radioiodine in BRAF mutant tumors so that radioiodine can be given to shrink tumors. This study is also being done to find out the highest doses of copanlisib and vemurafenib that, when given in combination, do not cause serious side effects, and whether the study treatment will make radioiodine therapy work better in patients with BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers.

Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), The primary objective of this study is to determine the MTD of vemurafenib plus copanlisib inpatients with advanced BRAF mutant RAIR thyroid cancer. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients treated at that dose experience a DLT., 6 months
