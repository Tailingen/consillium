Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients with Recurrent Primary Ovarian or Uterine Cancer
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with ovarian or uterine cancer that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.

Maximum Tolerated Dose, This will be accomplished using the standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be determined through the NCI CTCAE version 4.03., After the completion of SBRT treatment through 3 months of followup.
One Year Local Control, Local Control will be defined as Stable Disease (SD), Partial Response (PR) or Complete Repsonse (CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Assessed using Kaplan Meier survival curves., After the completion of SBRT treatment, throughout followup, or death, whichever comes first, up to one year.|Progression Free Survival, The amount of time a patient survives without worsening of disease, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Assessed using Kaplan Meier survival curves., After the completion of SBRT treatment, throughout followup, or death, whichever comes first, up to one year.|Overall Survival, The amount of time a patient survives, with or without progression of disease. Assessed using Kaplan Meier survival curves., After the completion of SBRT treatment, throughout followup, or death, whichever comes first, up to one year.|Chemotherapy-Free Interval, The amount of time a patient survives without having to undergo re-initiation of chemotherapy. Assessed using Kaplan Meier survival curves., After the completion of SBRT treatment throughout followup to the re-initiation of chemotherapy, up to one year.|Acute Toxicities, Acute toxicities will be assessed by the NCI CTCAE version 4.03., During SBRT treatment, throughout followup, or death, whichever comes first, up to 6 weeks post treatment.|Late Toxicities, Delayed toxicities will be assessed by the NCI CTCAE version 4.03., After the completion of SBRT treatment, throughout followup, or death, whichever comes first, up to one year.|Quality of Life Assessment through Survey, Quality of life will be assessed through the EORTC QLQ-C30 and OV28 questionnaires., After the completion of SBRT treatment, throughout followup, or death, whichever comes first, up to one year.|Functional Imaging, DCE-CT scans using the Siemens AS open scanner will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Prior to completion of SBRT, immediately after the completion of SBRT, and 6 weeks after the completion of SBRT.|Profile of SBRT-Associated Immune Response, The Human Immune Monitoring Shared Resource will preform cytometry and cytokine arrays, as well as characterizing activation markers., Prior to completion of SBRT, 2 weeks after the completion of SBRT, and 6 weeks after the completion of SBRT.
This is a phase I study with a primary objective to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 3 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for abdominopelvic recurrences of ovarian cancer (OC) and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). This is a dose escalation study that employs a 3+3 design to determine the MTD. Patients are then monitored closely to determine side effects and adverse events, as well as success rates and tumor response to the radiation therapy.
