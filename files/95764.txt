CPX-351 or CLAG-M Regimen for the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Other High-Grade Myeloid Neoplasms in Medically Less-Fit Patients
This phase II trial studies how well CPX-351 or the CLAG-M regimen (consisting of the drugs cladribine, cytarabine, G-CSF, and mitoxantrone) works in treating medically less-fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia or other high-grade myeloid neoplasms. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CPX-351, cladribine, cytarabine, G-CSF, and mitoxantrone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving CPX-351 or the CLAG-M regimen at doses typically used for medically-fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia may work better than reduced doses of CPX-351 in treating medically less-fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia or other high-grade myeloid neoplasms.

3-month overall survival (OS), Will evaluate whether CPX-351 or cladribine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and mitoxantrone (CLAG-M), at doses typically used for medically-fit adults with AML, improve 3-month overall survival in medically-unfit adults with AML compared to attenuated dose CPX-351 as used in our previous institutional trial (32 units/m2 per dose)., Up to 3 months from date of start of protocol therapy

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms in a 1:1 fashion. ARM I = CPX-351; ARM II = CLAG-M.

ARM I (INDUCTION): Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a response other than an MRDneg CR receive a second course of CPX-351 intravenously IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM I (POST-REMISSION): Patients who achieve a CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) receive a reduced dose of CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 for up to 4 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II (INDUCTION): Patients receive cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, and mitoxantrone IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a response other than an MRDneg CR receive a second course of cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, G-CSF SC on days 0-5, and mitoxantrone IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II (POST-REMISSION): Patients who achieve a CR/CRi receive an intermediate dose of cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-6 for up to 4 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
