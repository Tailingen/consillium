Tislelizumab Combined With Fruquintinib for Metastatic pMMR/MSS Colorectal Cancer
This is an open-label phase II study, with the aim of investigating the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab + Fruquintinib combination therapy in ARID1A-mutated pMMR/MSS metastatic colorectal cancer who have been treated with standard chemotherapy that includes fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Patients with hypermutated CRC that carries POLE/POLD1 mutations cannot be included.

In this open-label phase II study, patients with ARID1A-mutated pMMR/MSS metastatic colorectal cancer who have been treated with standard chemotherapy that includes fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, will be scheduled for Tislelizumab (200mg ivdrip Q3W day1) + Fruquintinib (5mg/day Q3W day1-14) until intolerable toxicity, disease progression or death. Primary endpoint of this study is ORR and secondary endpoints are OS, PFS, DCR and safety.
