An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs., Up to approximately 10.75 years|Percentage of Participants With CD19 + /CD5+ B Cells or CD14+ Monocytes, Baseline up to approximately 10.75 years|Percentage of Participants With Human-Anti-Human Antibodies, Baseline up to approximately 10.75 years|Percentage of Participants Recorded as Premature Study Withdrawals, Up to approximately 10.75 years|Plasma Concentrations of Venetoclax, Pre-venetoclax dose (0 hour) and 4 hours post- venetoclax dose on Day 1 Cycle 4|Serum Concentrations of Obinutuzumab, Pre-obinutuzumab infusion (0 hour) and end of obinutuzumab infusion on Day 1 Cycle 4|Change From Baseline in M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-CLL (MDASI-CLL) Score, The MDASI-CLL is a questionnaire of 25 items related to CLL specific symptoms that a participant may have experienced in the past 24 hours. Participants were asked to rate the severity of 13 symptoms called mean core symptom severity (i.e., pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distressed, shortness of breath, remembering things, lack of appetite, drowsy, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, and numbness or tingling), 6 disease-specific symptoms called mean module symptom severity (night sweats, fevers and chills, lymph node swelling, diarrhea, easy bruising or bleeding, and constipation) and 6 mean interference on life questions (i.e., general activity, walking, work, mood, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life) on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 indicating that the symptom is "not present" or "did not interfere" with the participant's activities and 10 indicating "as bad as you can imagine" or "interfered completely". Scores were averaged (range 0 to 10) for each of three parts., Baseline up to approximately 10.75 years|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQC30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated and reliable self-report measure consisting of 30 questions incorporated into five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social scales), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting scales), and a global health status/global quality-of-life scale. The remaining single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) assess the additional symptoms experienced by patients with cancer and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The 28 function and symptom items were scored on a 4-point scale that ranged from "not at all" to "very much," and the 2 global health status/global quality-of-life items were scored on a 7-point scale that ranged from "very poor" to "excellent." Raw average scale scores were linearly transformed to range 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher response levels (i.e., higher functioning, higher symptom severity)., Baseline up to approximately 10.75 years|Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire is a generic, preference based health utility measure that assesses 5 health states (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and is used to build a composite of the patient's health status. The EQ-5D-3L was employed in this study to calculate health utilities for economic modeling, which ranged 0-1. The EQ-5D-3L also contained a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the participant's overall health, which ranged from 0-100 with a higher score indicating a worse health status., Baseline up to approximately 10.75 years
