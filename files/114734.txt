Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab (TPCA) in Metastatic Esophageal and Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to determine if the combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab will help shrink metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer and how the cancer responds to this combination. Bevacizumab is a new drug that is believed to stop the formation of new blood vessels that carry nutrients to tumors. Bevacizumab is approved for use in metastatic colon and rectal cancer. Docetaxel, cisplatin and irinotecan are traditional chemotherapy agents that have been tested together in another clinical trial for esophageal and gastric cancer. It is hoped that adding bevacizumab to this regimen will make the treatment more effective.

10-month Progression-Free Survival Rate, 10-month progression-free survival rate is the probability of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 10-months from study entry estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 cycles on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Relevant for this endpoint was disease status at 10 months.
Best Response, Best response on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria: Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Both require confirmation no fewer than 4 weeks apart. CR/PR assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Stable disease is defined as any condition not meeting above criteria., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 cycles on treatment. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment duration was a median of 6 cycles/18 weeks given 3-week cycle length (range 1-26 cycles).|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive and estimate using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods., Patients in the study cohort were followed for a median of 12.2 month (up to 40 months).|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from the study or death. Patients alive and progression-free at last follow-up are censored. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 cycles on treatment. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment duration was a median of 6 cycles/18 weeks given 3-week cycle length (range 1-26 cycles).
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

To determine the 10-month progression-free survival rate for the combination of TPC and Bevacizumab in patients with metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer

Secondary

* To determine the response rate (RECIST) and median duration of response
* To determine overall survival
* To determine toxicity

Exploratory

* To explore if 7/7 and 7/6 UGT1A1 polymorphisms correlate with grade III/IV irinotecan-related diarrhea and neutropenia when irinotecan is given at relatively low dose to patients with esophageal and gastric cancer
* To correlate expression of tumoral and serum VEGF with response and survival
* To correlate TGF alpha levels and tumor microvessel density with clinical activity
* To examine circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as surrogate markers of antitumor activity of bevacizumab

DESIGN This trial will use a single stage design to differentiate a \>/= 50% rate of 10-month progression-free survival from a \</= 30% rate. The proposed regimen would be promising if at least 15 of 35 patients were alive and progression-free at 10 months.
