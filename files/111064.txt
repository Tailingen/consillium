HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer and Endocrine Resistance
This is a randomized, 2-arm, open-label, multicenter, international phase II trial. A total of 196 patients will be included.

The study will include patients with metastatic Hormone Receptor positive / Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER2) negative breast cancer with progressive disease after endocrine treatment.

Patients will be randomized (1:1) between two treatment arms: A. palbociclib + fulvestrant and b. capecitabine.
Breast Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression free survival (PFS), as assessed locally by the investigator., Time to progression will be measured according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1). Response criteria are essentially based on a set of measurable lesions identified at baseline as target lesions, and - together with other lesions that are denoted as non-target lesions - followed until disease progression., Time from the date of randomization to the date of progression, assessed up to 5 years.
Health related quality of life score EuroQol (EQ-5D), Change from baseline to Health related quality of life score EuroQol (EQ-5D), Baseline to progression up to 2 years|Health related quality of life score EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Instrument (EORTC QLQ-C30)., Baseline to progression up to 2 years|Health related quality of life score EORTC QLQ-BR23, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BR23)., Baseline to progression up to 2 years|Correlation of efficacy measures with tumor Biomarkers, PgR IHC status (10% cut-off), will be correlated with PFS, Correlative analyses will be performed after the end of the trial. PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of progression assessed up to 5 years..|Correlation of efficacy measures with tumor Biomarkers, Ki67 IHC status, will be correlated with PFS, Correlative analyses will be performed after the end of the trial. PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of progression assessed up to 5 years.|Correlation of efficacy measures with tumor Biomarkers, ESR1 DNA somatic mutation status, will be correlated with PFS, Correlative analyses will be performed after the end of the trial. PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of progression assessed up to 5 years.|Correlation of efficacy measures with tumor Biomarkers, Somatic mutations in cancer genes identified by sequencing, will be correlated with PFS, Correlative analyses will be performed after the end of the trial.
