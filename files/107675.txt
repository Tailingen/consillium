Decitabine and Gemcitabine for Pancreatic Cancer and Sarcoma
The purpose of this Phase 1b study is to assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Decitabine in combination with Gemcitabine among previously treated patients diagnosed with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma or sarcoma (soft tissue and bone).
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Sarcoma
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Dose Limiting Toxicity - To examine the toxicity related to the therapy by measuring the number of treatment related adverse events in patients, Non-Hematologic - Any grade 3,4 solid organ toxicity not explainable by another cause in the opinion of the principal investigator, All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s) up to 30 days after the last date of any study therapy|Tumor Response Rate - Change at evaluations, Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) \[Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009\].

Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria., Change on two consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart up to 30 days after the last date of any study therapy
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)., Patients will be evaluated weekly during each cycle of treatment up to 30 days after the last date of any study therapy|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Patients will be evaluated weekly during each cycle of treatment up to 30 days after the last date of any study therapy|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to death due to any cause., Patients will be evaluated weekly during each cycle of treatment up to 30 days after the last date of any study therapy
The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine in previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and advanced sarcoma and to define the recommended Phase II dose and describe the dose-limiting toxicity of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine. The preliminary efficacy parameters of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine will be estimated in terms of response rate, disease control rate and progression-free survival.
