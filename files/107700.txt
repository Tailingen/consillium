Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab Plus Androgen Axis Blockade Prior to Prostatectomy for High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer
Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Enzalutamide will be administered at dose of 160 mg orally every day. All patients will be required to have at least one high-risk criteria.

The investigators propose to study the effects of pembrolizumab combined with intensive androgen receptor (AR) targeting prior to prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection in subjects with high-risk localized prostate cancer (HRLPC).

Trial Design- single arm, single-stage, open label Phase II of neoadjuvant immune-hormonal therapy in high-risk localized prostate cancer.

Objectives To evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab combined with intensive AR targeting prior to prostatectomy in subjects with high-risk localized prostate cancer (HRLPC).

Primary Endpoint Pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as absence of detectable malignant cells in the prostatectomy specimen evaluated by standard histologic techniques.
