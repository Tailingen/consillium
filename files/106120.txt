Hippocampus-sparing WBRT and Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Multiple Brain Metastases From NSCLC
This study evaluates hippocampus-sparing whole-brain radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost for patients with multiple brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer. The primary endpoint is intracranial progression free survival, and secondary endpoints are verbal neurocognitive function, overall survival, adverse events according to CTCAE v4.03, and quality of life.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: WBRT with hippocampus-sparing and SIB
Intracranial progression free survival, Time from the date of start of radiotherapy to the date of death or intracranial progression, until 12 months
Verbal neurocognitive function (Seoul Verbal Learning Test-Elderly, SVLT-E), The relative decline in SVLT-E score from baseline to below time frame; ΔSVLT = (SVLTB - SVLTF) ÷ SVLTB, where B=baseline and F=follow-up., 3,6,12 months|Overall survival, Time from the date of start of radiotherapy to the date of death from any cause, until 12 months|Adverse events, CTCAE v4.03, 3,6,12 months|Quality of life, EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN20, 3,6,12 months
