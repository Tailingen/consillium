Dual PET/CT Imaging in Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare conventional PET/CT scan performed 1 hour after injection of the radioactive tracer FDG (PET/CT\[1\]) with PET/CT performed after 3 hours (PET/CT\[3\]) in a group of patients with biopsy verified lung cancer or high suspicion of lung cancer after initial work-up (chest x-ray and CT of thorax/upper abdomen), who are potentially operable.

OTHER: Dual FDG-PET/CT
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, To find the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in PET/CT 1h and 3 h in the staging of lung cancer (N-/M-stage). Our gold standard is pathology, when not possible - follow-up, After staging or 1 year of follow up
Occurence of relapse, â€¢ To compare SUVmax, RI, tumor/liver ratio, GLUT1 and G-6-Pase with the occurrence of relapse within a year after curative surgery, 1 year follow up after surgery
The investigators also want to:

* To find the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in PET/CT 1h and 3 h in the staging of lung cancer (N-/M-stage). Our gold standard is pathology, when not possible - follow-up (se Gold Standard 6.1.1)
* To compare SUVmax with the expression of GLUT1 and G-6-Pase in tumors
* To compare the expression of GLUT1 with the activity of G6Pase
* To compare SUVmax, RI, tumor/liver ratio, GLUT1 and G-6-Pase with the occurrence of relapse within a year after curative surgery
