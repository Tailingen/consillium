A Study of Tabalumab (LY2127399) in Participants With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma (MM)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational drug called tabalumab in participants with Multiple Myeloma (MM) who have tried at least one other therapy in the past. Tabalumab will be given in combination with standard doses of two other drugs that are often used to treat MM. Study doctors will collect information about the effectiveness and side effects of this therapy.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Bortezomib|BIOLOGICAL: Tabalumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. If a participant does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time is censored at the enrollment date, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression (Increase of \> 25% from lowest response in serum M component, urine M component, bone marrow plasma cell percentage, development of bone lesions) or death has been observed for the participant. If a participant is not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time is censored at the last complete objective progression-free disease assessment date., Baseline up to Objective Disease Progression or Death From Any Cause (assessed up to 9 months)
Overall Survival, Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death from any cause. For participants who were alive, overall survival was censored at the last contact., Baseline to Death From Any Cause (assessed up to 19 months)|Time to First Skeletal-Related Event (SRE), Time to first SRE is defined as time from randomization to any one of the following related to multiple myeloma: New Pathological Fracture, Spinal Cord Compression, Surgery to the Bone, Radiation to the Bone collected until participant death, study closure or lost to follow up. Participants not known to have had an SRE at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of their last complete documented assessment for SRE., Baseline to Date of First Skeletal Related Event (assessed up to 19 months)|Number of Participants With >30% Reduction in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - Worst Pain Score, BPI is assessed by 7 questions rated "0" for "no pain" and higher numbers indicated more pain., Baseline through End of Treatment (19 months)|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first observed objective progression or death due to study disease. Time to progression will be censored as for PFS for those participants not known to have progressed or that died from other causes., Baseline to Objective Disease Progression or Death (assessed up to 9 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is measured by the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria: from the date of first evidence of a confirmed response to the date of objective progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier. If a responder is not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date, the DOR time will be censored at the last complete objective progression-free disease assessment date. Progressive disease is an increase of 25% from baseline in Serum M, Urine M, bone marrow plasma cell increase of 10 %, development of new bone lesions, development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions, hypercalcemia \>11.5 milligrams per deciliter, decrease in hemoglobin of 2 grams per deciliter, rise in serum creatinine by 2 mg/deciliter., Time from Response to Objective Disease Progression (assessed up to 38 months)|Time to Next Treatment (TNT), TNT is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of the first poststudy treatment course of anticancer therapy or death from any cause. Time to next treatment will be censored at the date of the last visit for participant who did not initiate additional anticancer therapy., Baseline to Initiation of New Cancer Treatment or Death From Any Cause (18 Months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Tabalumab, Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Tabalumab., Cycle (C)1 Day (D)1: Predose, 3O minutes, 2 hours Postdose; C1 D4, 8, 11: Predose, (D11 only, 30 minutes Postdose); C2 and C6-C10 D1: Predose and immediately Postdose; C2 D 4, 8, 11: Anytime|PK: Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Tabalumab, C1 D1: Predose, 3O minutes, 2 hours Postdose; C1 D4, 8, 11: Predose, (D11 only, 30 minutes Postdose); C2 and C6-C10 D1: Predose and immediately Postdose; C2 D 4, 8, 11: Anytime|PK: Area Under the Curve Over the Dosing Interval (AUC-T) for Tabalumab, C1 D1: Predose, 3O minutes, 2 hours Postdose; C1 D4, 8, 11: Predose, (D11 only, 30 minutes Postdose); C2 and C6-C10 D1: Predose and immediately Postdose; C2 D 4, 8, 11: Anytime|Number of Participants Developing Anti-tabalumab Antibodies, Baseline through Cycle 8|Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR) in Each Category, Stringent Complete Response-Complete Response and normal free light chain ration and no clonal cells in bone marrow Complete Response- no monoclonal protein (mp) in blood, no serum or urine mp, less than 5% plasma cells in bone marrow Very Good Partial Response-more than 90% decrease in mp and urine protein Partial Response- over 50% decrease in serum mp Stable Disease- less than 25 percent decrease of monoclonal protein Progressive Disease- 25% increase compared to lowest value of serum mp, urine mp, no measurable mp, Baseline to Objective Disease Progression or Initiation of New Cancer Treatment (28 Months)|Number of Participants With a Given Best Objective Myeloma Response (Quality of Response [QoR]), Response categories in order of decreasing quality are: Stringent Complete Response(sCR),Complete Response(CR), Very Good Partial Response(VGPR),Partial Response(PR),Minimal Response(MR),Stable Disease(SD), or Progressive Disease(PD), according to the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma.SCR:normal free light chain ration and no clonal cells in bone marrow;CR-no monoclonal protein(mp) in blood, no serum/urine,\<5% plasma cells in bone marrow; VGPR-more than 90% decrease in mp and urine protein; PR-\>50% decrease in serum MP;SD-\<25% decrease in mp; PD-25% increase compared to lowest value of serum mp, urine mp and no measurable mp., Baseline to Objective Disease Progression or Initiation of New Cancer Treatment (up to 28 Months)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants that had a response., Baseline to Objective Disease Progression or Initiation of New Cancer Treatment (28 Months)
