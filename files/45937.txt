Study of Monalizumab and Cetuximab in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
The objective of this study is to evaluate in a 3 +3 design, the safety of escalating doses of Monalizumab given IV in combination with cetuximab in patients who have received prior systemic regimen(s) for recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

Cohorts expansion will evaluate antitumor activity of monalizumab and cetuximab with or without anti-PD(L)1
