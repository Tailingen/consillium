mXELOXIRI Combined With Molecular Targeted Drug in mCRC
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified XELOXIRI combined with molecular targeted drug as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine-Oxaliplatin-Irinotecan Combination
ORR, Overall response rate, Up to 36 months|PFS, Progression-free survival, Up to 18 months|R0 rate, resection rate, Up to 18 months|OS, Overall Survival, Up to 36 months|Incidence of adverse events, Adverse events were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. All adverse events was collected in duration from starting treatment to whichever shorter "after 30 days from withdrawal treatment" or "later treatment, Up to 36 months
It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified XELOXIRI combined with molecular targeted drug as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC. Eligible patients will receive 8 cycles of mXELOXIRI with cetuximab or bevacizumab and then the maintenance therapy until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Study evaluation time is defined as up to 16 weeks after the first dosing of the last patient.
