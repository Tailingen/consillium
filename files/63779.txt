Dynamic CtDNA-guided Targeted Therapy in DLBCL
This is a prospective, single-arm, noninferiority trial involving patients with previously untreated CD20-positive DLBCL. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment stratified based on ctDNA dynamic changes after one cycle of chemotherapy and the targeted therapy based on DLBCL genotype.

A total of 108 patients were planned to be enrolled in this trial, and the patients were stratified according to the dynamic changes of ctDNA after one cycle of chemotherapy: the chemotherapy-sensitive group continued the original R-CHOP regimen, and the potential drug resistance group received genotype-guided targeted drug combination. The whole trial included a screening period (day -28 to day -1), a treatment period, and a 2-year follow-up period.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
DRUG: R-CHOP + X
Complete response (CR) rate, CR rate at the end of treatment. Defined as the proportion of participants who achieved CR at the end of treatment., End of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)
2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, PFS, defined as the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse using the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first; as determined by the investigator. The 2-year PFS rate was the percentage of patients who did not experience disease progression or death within two years of enrollment., 2 years|2-year Overall survival (OS) rate, OS defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause. The 2-year OS rate was the percentage of patients who did not die within two years of enrollment., 2 years|The incidence and severity of adverse events were determined according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 rating scale, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., From enrollment to study completion, a maximum of 4 years
