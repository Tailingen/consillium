Incidence and Risk Factors of Early Onset Colorectal Cancer
Early onset colorectal cancer (cancer in person younger than 50 years) has increasing incidence last years. The aim of our study was to assess the real-life incidence of early onset colorectal cancer, advanced neoplasias (colorectal cancer and/or advanced adenoma) and all neoplastic lesions in total in a single non-university endoscopic center.
Colorectal Neoplasms
OTHER: colonoscopy
incidence of early onset colorectal neoplasias, risk factors, the real-life incidence of early onset colorectal cancer, advanced neoplasias (colorectal cancer and/or advanced adenoma) and all neoplastic lesions in total in a single non-university endoscopic center, the risk of sex and family history of colorectal cancer, 10 years
The investigators retrospectively assessed the incidence of all neoplastic lesions, advanced neoplasias and colorectal cancer in population under 50 years of age compared to population 50 years and older. The investigators collected the data from all colonoscopic examinations performed in non-university hospital Frydek-Mistek from January 2012 to the end of June 2021.
