Rapid Learning for Lung Cancer
A retrospective, data mining project that re-uses routine patient care data for decision support systems.
Lung Cancer
Survival, Retrospective data will be collected from each included patient from start of radiotherapy until end of study or death (an expected average of 10 years)., From radiotherapy until death
Local control, Data will be collected from inclusion in the study until end of study of death (an expected average time frame of 10 years) concerning the local control of this tumour., From start of treatment until death,|Distant metastases, Data concerning the possible occurence of distant metastases will be collected from each patient from inclusion until end of study or date of death (an expected average time frame of 10 years)., From treatment until end of study|Dyspnea, From each included patient, dyspnea scores will be collected from start of treatment until end of study or date of death (an expected average time frame of 10 years)., From inclusion until end of study|Dysphagia, Dysphagia scores will be collected from each participating patient from treatment until end of study or date of death (an average time frame of 10 years), From treatment until end of study
By installing tools that extract clinical data from electronic health records and image data from the Picture Archiving and Communication System, decision support systems are built and validated that can predict survival and treatment toxicities of lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.
