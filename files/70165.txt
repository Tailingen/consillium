AB8939 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The primary objective is to define the safety and tolerability of AB8939 in patients with AML by determining the dose-limiting toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended dose for dose expansion study.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia Refractory|Acute Myeloid Leukemia, in Relapse|Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: AB8939|DRUG: Azacitidine
Rate of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Identification of the Maximal Tolerated Dose for different dosing schedules, Up to 56 days
Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy, Up to 56 days
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, 2-part study in patients with refractory and relapsed AML and refractory myelodysplastic syndrome.

Study AB18001 has a multi-stage design. The first part is a dose escalation study that aims to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of consecutive daily intravenous administration of AB8939 in patients with refractory or relapsed AML or patients with refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, and to determine the recommended dose for the second-stage dose expansion study. This dose expansion study aims to determine the schedule for a Phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and to also provide an early efficacy assessment of AB8939.
