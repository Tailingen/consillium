A Phase 2 Study of CRLX101(NLG207) in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare median overall survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with CRLX101 to patients treated with best supportive care (BSC).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: CRLX101|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
To Compare Overall Survival of Patients Treated With CRLX101 + BSC to Those Patients Treated With BSC Only, Comparison of survival among patients treated with CRLX101 + best supportive care vs patients treated wiht best supportive care only., Up to 18 months
Assess Objective Response Rate (ORR) of CRLX101+ BSC Compared to BSC Only, Comparison of objective response rate in subjects treated with CRLX101+BSC versus subjects treated with BSC alone., 12 months
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer. The development of targeted therapies has changed the approach to treating NSCLC significantly over the past decade with targeted therapies generally possessing safety advantages over traditional cytotoxic regimens. However, combination paradigms and resistance patterns complicate the use of these agents. CRLX101 is a nanoparticle comprised of camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to a cyclodextrin-based polymer. CRLX101 is designed to increase the exposure of tumor cells to CPT while minimizing side effects.
