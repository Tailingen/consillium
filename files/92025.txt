Radiomics of Immunotherapeutics Response Evaluation and Prediction
This study aims to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of CT radiomic analysis which serves as a high through-put analytical strategy applied to image big-data resource in evaluating and predicting the response of immunotherapeutics. A multi-center retrospective diagnostic test has been designed for this aim to compare the predictive performance of clinical model, qualitative model incorporating semantic CT features and image-based quantitative radiomic model. The reference standard of therapeutic effect is determined by the latest evaluation result utilizing iRECIST within 365 days after recruited. This study intends to enroll 400 participates who had been diagnosed with advanced somatic solid tumor confirmed by histo- or cyto-pathological examination and were planning to receive immunotherapy.
