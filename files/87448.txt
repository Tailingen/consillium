Circulating Tumour DNA (ctDNA) in Patients With Colorectal Cancer and the Relationship to Imaging Features of Extramural Venous Invasion
This study does not involve randomization or treatment. Eligible patients have colorectal adenocarcinoma with no metastases eligible for curative surgery. A pre operative staging scan must have been completed within 6 weeks prior to surgery. Two x 20ml blood samples will be taken from each patient, one prior to and one during or within 24hrs after surgery. Patients are annually followed up to 3 years.

To determine if there is a link between EMVI status and ctDNA, Proportion of patients who are EMVI positive demonstrating higher % mutation frequency of circulating cell-free and tumour specific DNA compared with patients who are EMVI negative., Up to 2 years
To investigate whether ctDNA levels change during surgery according to EMVI status, Measure the intraoperative % mutation frequency of ctDNA in EMVI positive compared with EMVI negative patients, Up to 2 years|To investigate the effect of ctDNA status on patient survival outcomes, Record survival outcomes of patients who are: EMVI negative with low ctDNA levels, EMVI negative with high ctDNA levels, EMVI positive with low ctDNA levels, EMVI positive with high ctDNA levels, At 1, 2 and 3 years
A multicentre observational study, ctDNA aims to provide the evidence base for metatstatic disease being caused by vascular methods of spread by determining if there is a link between EMVI status and ctDNA
