Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Lenvatinib, Pembrolizumab and Hypofractionated Pelvic Radiation Therapy for pMMR Recurrent/Unresectable Endometrial Carcinoma
The purpose of this research study is to see if it is feasible to combine a fixed dose of pembrolizumab and a daily dose of oral lenvatinib, along with daily treatments of an abbreviated course of pelvic external beam radiation therapy, to support cancer cells in multiplying and spreading to other body sites.
