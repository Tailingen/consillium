Does Protein Restriction Inhibit Prostrate Cancer Growth
The Purpose of the Protein Study is to investigate whether a reduced protein diet can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in humans.

The Investigators hypothesis is that a reduced protein diet will inhibit expression of genes that are involved in the growth of prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Protein restrictive diet
Group1--Expression of genes and proteins of the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Group 2--PSA values obtained every three months, The investigators will be looking at the increase or decrease of PSA values between control and protein restricted diet participants obtained for the length of study., group 1- (4-6 weeks), group 2 -(52 weeks)
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether or not a low protein diet has an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cell growth.

The primary outcome measures relative to the investigators primary objectives are:

For Group 1 the expression of genes and proteins of the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. For Group 2 the PSA values obtained every three months.
