A Study to Evaluate and Compare the Efficacy and Safety of XZP-3621 Versus Crizotinib
This randomized, multicenter, Phase III, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of XZP-3621 versus crizotinib and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of XZP-3621 in Chinese participants with treatment-naive ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. Participants will be randomized 1:1 into one of the two treatment groups to receive either XZP-3621 (500 milligrams \[mg\] once daily \[QD\]) or crizotinib (250 mg BID) orally, respectively.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1 or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to overall period of approximately 30 months)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression, as Determined by Blind Independent Central Review(BICR)Using RECISTv1.1., or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to overall period of approximately 30 months).|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, as Determined by the investigator and Blind Independent Central Review (BICR) Using RECISTv1.1, From randomization until death (up to approximately 30 months).|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and by investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1, From randomization until death (up to approximately 30 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from date of first documented CR or PR to date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, From randomization until death (up to approximately 30 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD), Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study (up to overall period of approximately 30 months)|Intracranial Objective Response Rate (IC-ORR), IC-ORR as Determined by BICR and investigator Using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM), Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study (up to overall period of approximately 30 months)|Intracranial Duration of Response (IC-DoR), IC-ORR as Determined by BICR and investigator Using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM), Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study (up to overall period of approximately 30 months)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of XZP-3621 and Its Metabolite, AUC was collected for both XZP-3621 and its major metabolite, and was based on their concentrations in plasma over time., Pre-dose (within 1 hour before XZP-3621), 4 hours post-dose at first dosing day and Week 4; Pre-dose (within 1 hour) at Week 8,12,16 (up to 4 months)|Maximum Plasma Concentration Observed (Cmax) of XZP-3621 and Its Metabolite, Cmax was collected for both XZP-3621 and its major metabolite, and was based on their concentrations in plasma over time., Pre-dose (within 1 hour before XZP-3621), 4 hours post-dose at first dosing day and Week 4; Pre-dose (within 1 hour) at Week 8,12,16 (up to 4 months)|Time to Deterioration by EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module 13 (LC13), The EORTC QLQ-LC13 module generated one multiple-item scale score assessing dyspnea and a series of single item scores assessing chest pain, arm/shoulder pain, pain in other parts, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. All the scales and single-item scores were linearly transformed so that each score ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score on the global health and functioning subscales is indicative of better functioning. Confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration in lung cancer symptoms is defined as a \>or=10-point increase from baseline in a symptom score that must be held for at least two consecutive assessments or an initial \>or=10-point increase above baseline followed by death within 5 weeks from the last assessment., Baseline, Week 4, thereafter every 4 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 2 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 30 months)|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life as Assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, HRQoL: perceived quality of participant's life, includes self-reported multidimensional measures of physical and mental health. Patient-reported symptoms (PROs) and HRQoL will be collected by administering the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life (QLQ)-C30 questionnaire. EORTC-QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. The 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into overall score ranging from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate better QOL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline, Week 4, thereafter every 4 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study and 4 weeks after permanent discontinuation (up to overall period of approximately 30 months)|Percentage of Participants with Non-serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Percentage of Participants with Non-serious, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product, Up to overall period of approximately 30 months
This is a randomized, active controlled, multicenter Phase III open-label study in patients with treatment-naive ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. Patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of the two treatment arms to receive either XZP-3621 or crizotinib. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed PFS.

Central randomization will be performed via a web-based response system using the following stratification factors: chemotherapy (yes vs. no) and CNS metastases at baseline (yes vs. no).

The experimental arm will receive XZP-3621 at 500 mg orally once daily (QD), taken with food. The control arm will receive crizotinib at 250 mg orally BID, taken with or without food.

Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. After disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1), patients should discontinue the study medication. After disease progression, patients will be treated at the discretion of the investigator according to local practice. Information regarding the nature and the duration of subsequent therapies will be collected.
