A Study of Tolinapant in Combination With Oral Decitabine/Cedazuridine and Oral Decitabine/Cedazuridine Alone in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (R/R PTCL)
The primary purpose of the study is to assess safety, and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tolinapant in combination with oral decitabine/cedazuridine in Phase 1 and to assess preliminary efficacy as determined by overall response rate (ORR) in Phase 2.
Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Tolinapant|DRUG: Decitabine + Cedazuridine
Phase 1: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), This will be evaluated by looking at the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), which are medical problems severe enough to stop study doctors from increasing a treatment dose., Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Antitumor Activity Assessed by Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on 2014 Lugano Classification Using Computerized Tomography (CT) Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months
Phase 1: Number of Participants With TEAEs, SAEs and DLTs in the Oral Decitabine/Cedazuridine Arm, Up to 54 months|Ph 1 & 2: AUC: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve, Up to 50 months|Ph 1 & 2: Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration, Up to 50 months|Ph 1 & 2: Cmin: Minimum Observed Plasma Concentration at Steady State, Up to 50 months|Ph 1 & 2: Tmax: Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration, Up to 50 months|Ph 1 & 2: tÂ½: Apparent Elimination Half-Life, Up to 50 months|Phase 2: Duration of response (DOR) Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Partial Response (PR) Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR) Assessed as Percentage of Participants With Disease Control Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS) Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Imaging as the Primary Modality, Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With DOR, CR, PR, PFS, DCR,and OS Based on the Lugano Classification Using CT Along With PET Imaging Assessments, Duration of response (DOR), complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR)and overall survival (OS), Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Anti-Tumor Activity Based on Assessment Using 2014 Lugano Classification With Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC), Anti-tumor activity in terms of ORR, DOR, CR, PR, and PFS will be evaluated based on assessment using 2014 Lugano Classification with LYRIC., Up to 54 months|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Anti-Tumor Activity Based on PTCL Subtypes Anti-tumor activity in terms of ORR, DOR, DCR, CR, and PR will be evaluated based on PTCL subtypes (using both pathology and molecular markers)., Up to 54 months
The primary purpose of the study is to assess safety, and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tolinapant in combination with oral decitabine/cedazuridine in Phase 1 and to assess preliminary efficacy as determined by overall response rate (ORR) in Phase 2.
