lead-in FOLICOLOR Trial: Following Therapy Response Through Liquid Biopsy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
Detection of progressive disease by neuropeptide Y (NPY) methylation in liquid biopsies in patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type, unresectable, metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line treatment FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Liquid biopsy sampling
Optimize cutoff value, Optimization of the cutoff value for NPY methylation in liquid biopsies (ctDNA) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab to discriminate between progressive and non-progressive disease as determined by CT scans based on RECIST criteria 1.1. To this end, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve will be developed with data of this study., Start cycle 1 of first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab therapy until the day on which the first CT scan is performed following the liquid biopsies taken 9 months after the start of first-line therapy, or when 11 months of follow-up is reached.
Determine progression free and 9-month survival, To determine the progression free and 9-month survival of RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The progression free survival is defined as time from inclusion to the date of first disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death. The 9-month survival will be determined as percentage surviving at 9 months after the start of first-line therapy., Start cycle 1 of first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab therapy until the day on which the first CT scan is performed following the liquid biopsies taken 9 months after the start of first-line therapy, or when 11 months of follow-up is reached.
Exploratory objective 1, To compare the use of NPY methylated ctDNA and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to predict progressive disease., Start cycle 1 of first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab therapy until the day on which the first CT scan is performed following the liquid biopsies taken 9 months after the start of first-line therapy, or when 11 months of follow-up is reached.|Exploratory objective 2, Further exploration of ctDNA in liquid biopsies and searching for novel biomarkers., Start cycle 1 of first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab therapy until the day on which the first CT scan is performed following the liquid biopsies taken 9 months after the start of first-line therapy, or when 11 months of follow-up is reached.|Exploratory objective 3, To assess the quality of life and the patient experience in the patient population with regard to the use of liquid biopsies for follow-up through questionnaires. This will include, but will not be limited to the following: burden of extra blood samples (extra blood samples during routine blood test), burden of CT scan with intravenous contrast, confidence in liquid biopsy guided therapy (ctDNA analysis) compared to CT scan guided therapy and preference between extra blood sample and CT scan (taking into account: burden, pain, time in the hospital, extra travel time to the hospital, confidence in technique...)., Start cycle 1 of first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab therapy until the day on which the first CT scan is performed following the liquid biopsies taken 9 months after the start of first-line therapy, or when 11 months of follow-up is reached.
Prospective, multicentric interventional study to optimize the cutoff value of NPY methylation in liquid biopsies in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab.

Inclusion is possible after histologically or cytologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma with metastatic lesions according to RECIST 1.1 at the start of first-line treatment using FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab. Patient must have a proven RAS and BRAF wild-type tumor.

Patients will be followed by study protocol up to and including the first CT scan following the last liquid biopsies taken, or when a follow-up period of 11 months is reached, until death, until metastasectomy, until lost to follow-up or until (consent) withdrawal.
