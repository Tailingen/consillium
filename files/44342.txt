A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Loncastuximab Tesirine in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma or High-grade B-cell Lymphoma With Hepatic Impairment (LOTIS-10)
The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended dosing regimen of loncastuximab tesirine in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) participants with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.
