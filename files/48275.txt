A Study of Vericiguat in People With Breast Cancer and Cancer Therapy-Related Cardiac Dysfunction
The purpose of this study is to find out if adding vericiguat to standard treatment for cancer therapy related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is more effective than standard treatment alone. The addition of vericiguat to the usual treatment could help improve cardiac function, but it could also cause side effects. This study will help researchers find out whether this different treatment is better, the same as, or worse than the usual approach.

change in CRF (measured by VO2peak), For the primary analysis, intervention effect will be evaluated by comparing differences in mean VO2peak changes from baseline to month 6 between the investigational and control groups using the analysis of covariance approach (ANCOVA)., up to 6 months
CRF response rate, assessed by the number of participants with a change in VO2peak ≥ 1.32 ml O2 • kg-1 • min-1 (technical error of CRF measurement) from baseline to month 6. A change in VO2peak ≥ 1.32 ml O2 • kg-1 • min-1 will be considered a response, whereas a change in VO2peak \< 1.32 ml O2 • kg-1 • min-1 will be considered a non-response., up to 6 months
