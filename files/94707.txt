METR-NK Cells in Combination With Anti-angiogenic Neoadjuvant Therapy for Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
To further evaluate and observe the efficacy and safety of solantinib combined with METR-NK neoadjuvant therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer by using solantinib combined with METR-NK neoadjuvant therapy
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: METR-NK cells combined with Solvatinib
R0 resection rate, the percentage of patients received R0 resection after METR-NK cells as neoadjuvant therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, 3-month
Overall Response Rate (ORR) After Neoadjuvant treatment, 3-month|Pathological complete remission rate, 3-month|Disease control rate, 3-month|Progression free survival, 2-years|Survival rate, 3-years|Adverse event, 3-month
Sorafenib 250mg po qd, 3 weeks as a course, a total of 3 courses. Dilute METR - 200 mL of NK cells in 37 â„ƒ 1500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride physiological saline, intraperitoneal infusion, flow rate \> 150 drops/min, each METR - venous back to the throughput of NK cells is lower than 2 x 107 cells/kg, abdominal cavity to throughput of no less than 4 x 107 cells/kg, Three consecutive reinfusion days were taken as a course, and four consecutive reinfusion courses were given, with an interval of 14 days between each course. The position was changed every 15 min after the end of each infusion to ensure that the cells were evenly distributed to the tumor surface to achieve the therapeutic effect.
