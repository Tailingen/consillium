Venous Thromboembolism in Primary Pancreatic Tumour Resection
This study will evaluate the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and possible determinants in patients with primary pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreatic cancer resection.

Cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) is the second cause of death, in oncologic patients after tumour progression itself. Patients suffering from malignancies are at increased risk for both venous (4-20%) and arterial (2-5%) thrombotic events. Moreover, cancer is one of the most important acquired risk factors for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most deadly cancer world-widely and has been recognised as the most prothrombotic malignancy, with a reported incidence of VTE (8-18%), followed by renal and ovarian cancer (VTE 5.6%). Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood it seems that pancreatic cancer induces a prothrombotic and hypercoagulable state.

Aims

* To evaluate the predictive value of preoperatively or early postoperatively obtained NLR, in patients with primary pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreatic cancer resection, for VTE up to the 30rd postoperative day
* To evaluate the predictive value of preoperatively or early postoperatively obtained coagulation biomarkers/parameters, in patients with primary pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreatic cancer resection, for VTE up to the 30rd postoperative day
* To evaluate the incidence of VTE in patients with primary pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreatic cancer resection
* To assess the perioperative coagulation status of patients with primary pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreatic cancer resection
* To evaluate any possible determinant or predictive factor for VTE among the coagulation parameters or patients' baseline characteristics
