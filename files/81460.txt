Palbociclib and Pembrolizumab in Sarcoma
This is a single-arm open-label window of opportunity clinical study assessing the impact of pre-treatment with palbociclib in patients with soft tissue sarcomas for which PD-1 inhibitors are approved (includes undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, or alveolar soft part sarcoma).
Sarcoma
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and adverse events (AEs) per CTCAE v5, Confirm the safety of the combination of Palbociclib and pembrolizumab in sarcomas for which PD-1 inhibitors are approved as defined by the incidence of DLTs, The dose limiting toxicity period is 4 weeks after starting the first dose of pembrolizumab
Response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria, To assess the response (per RECIST 1.1 criteria) of patients with advanced UPS with the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitor and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, 8 weeks following treatment intiation
Progression free survival, To assess progression free survival as calculated by the time from start of treatment until the time of progression of disease or death due to any cause, Up to two years following completion of treatment
Patients will be given palbociclib for 2 weeks following a pre-treatment ultrasound guided biopsy used to establish immunological baseline of the tumor microenvironment. After 2 weeks of palbociclib therapy, a second biopsy will be performed to assess the impact of palbociclib on the tumor microenvironment. Pembrolizumab will be started the same day as the second biopsy. After 2 doses of pembrolizumab, a third (optional) biopsy may be performed if the subject consents. At 8 weeks of therapy disease response will be assessed as per standard of care.
