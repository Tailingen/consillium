A Study of DB-1303/BNT323 vs Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy in HER2-Low, Hormone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (DYNASTY-Breast02)
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of DB-1303/BNT323 compared with investigator's choice chemotherapy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the HR+, HER2-low (immunohistochemistry \[IHC\]2+/in situ hybridization \[ISH\]- and IHC 1+) population.

The study is a Phase III, Randomized, Multi-center, Open-label study in HER2-low, HR+ metastatic breast cancer subjects whose disease has progressed on at least 2 lines of prior ET or within 6 months of first line ET + Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting. The primary purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of DB-1303/BNT323 compared with investigator's choice single agent chemotherapy in the target population. Approximately 532 subjects with HER2 IHC 2+/ISH- and IHC 1+ (HER2-low\] expression will be randomized 1:1 across approximately 255 centers globally to receive either DB-1303 or investigator's choice single agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 defined disease progression (PD), unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another criterion for discontinuation is met.
