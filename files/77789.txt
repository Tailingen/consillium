Evaluation of Efficacy of Trifluridine/Tipiracil Plus an Anti-IL-1Î± True Human Antibody Versus Trifluridine/Tipiracil Plus Placebo in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients After Failure of Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, Fluoropyrimidine
Unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains an incurable disease. After failure of conventional treatments involving fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in combination or not with biotherapies targeting EGFR and VEGF; regorafenib shows a modest improvement in overall survival. Recently, trifluridine/tipiracil has also shown efficacy in phase 3 with an overall survival of around 7 months. Trifluridine/tipiracil has become the standard of care for advanced mCRC in most western countries. However, the objective response rate remains very low and the survival gain remains moderate (+2 months). Therefore, new strategies are needed to ensure that mCRC patients who have received multiple lines of therapy can receive more effective treatments.

Based on previous clinical trials on IL-1 inhibition and our preclinical data, IL-1 inhibition may increase the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil. The goal is to test whether the addition of XB2001 to trifluridine/tipiracil could be synergistic.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: trifluridine/tipiracil + XB2001|DRUG: trifluridine/tipiracil + placebo
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of XB2001, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall survival, 6-month
This project proposes to evaluate trifluridine/tipiracil plus XB2001 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan in combination or not with an anti-angiogenic and an anti-EGFR for RAS Wild type tumor.

The project will consist of a randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, non-comparative, multi-center Phase II study with two treatment arms:

* Experimental arm: trifluridine/tipiracil + XB2001
* Control arm: trifluridine/tipiracil + placebo
