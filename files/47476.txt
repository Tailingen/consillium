A Study of Zilovertamab and Ibrutinib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This is a Phase 3 study to investigate the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, zilovertamab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Lugano Classification is superior for ibrutinib plus zilovertamab compared to ibrutinib plus placebo among subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that had a PR or SD after 16 weeks of ibrutinib monotherapy., Approximately 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessed by BICR per Lugano Classification, among the subjects who received the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib compared with the subjects who received ibrutinib plus placebo., Approximately 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Assessed by BICR per Lugano Classification, among the subjects who received the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib compared with the subjects who received ibrutinib plus placebo., Approximately 4 years|Complete Response Rate, Assessed by BICR per Lugano Classification Classification among the subjects who received the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib compared with the subjects who received ibrutinib plus placebo., Approximately 4 years|Proportion of subjects experiencing Grade 3 to 4 neutrophil count decrease, Proportion of subjects experiencing Grade 3 to 4 neutrophil count decrease among the subjects who received the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib compared with the subjects who received ibrutinib plus placebo based on laboratory abnormalities., Approximately 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS among the subjects who received the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib compared with the subjects who received ibrutinib plus placebo., Approximately 4 years|Overall Safety Profile, Overall safety profile among the subjects who received the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib compared with the subjects who received ibrutinib plus placebo. This would include incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory abnormalities., Approximately 4 years
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will be conducted in multiple phases in patients with R/R MCL. The study phases will include a Screening Phase, an Open-Label Ibrutinib Monotherapy Treatment Phase, a Randomized Double-Blind Treatment Phase, and a Long-Term Follow-Up Phase. When patients meet all study eligibility requirements in the Screening Phase, they will enter the Open-Label Ibrutinib Monotherapy Treatment Phase and will receive ibrutinib alone daily. After approximately 16 weeks patients who have a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) will enter the Randomized Double-Blind Treatment Phase and will be receive an intravenous infusion of zilovertamab or placebo and will continue to receive ibrutinib daily. Patients who discontinue study drug will enter the Long-Term Follow-Up Phase.
