Utility of Digital Dermoscopy in the Skin Cancer Clinic
This feasibility study aims to evaluate the use of the BARCO NV digital dermatoscope (non-CE marked device) in the skin cancer clinic. All eligible patients attending the Dermatology outpatient skin cancer clinic will be invited to participate. Patients who consent to the study will undergo standard care which will include medical photography of skin lesion(s) and appropriate management as determined by the Consultant Dermatologist in clinic. In addition to standard care, patients will undergo photography of the same lesion(s) using the BARCO NV digital dermatoscope. There will be no other intervention and no additional hospital visits in relation to the study. Use of the device will not influence the clinical management of the patient.

A detailed experience questionnaire will be administered to all clinicians using the BARCO device to explore their opinion on its ease of use and features.

All standard macroscopic \& dermoscopic images will be taken by OUH medical illustration department and stored on the 'Fotoweb' database (in keeping with current standard practice). Trained Dermatology Consultants, Dermatology Registrars, Research nurses or Medical Photographers, will take BARCO NV device images. A database of all BARCO images will be collected and stored on a dedicated NHS computer separate from the patient clinical record. Standard medical photography images will be stored on Fotoweb as per standard NHS clinical care.

Data will be anonymised and collated and then sent securely to BARCO for further analyses to enable optimization of the BARCO device and for development of diagnostic algorithms in the future.
