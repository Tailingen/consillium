Subjects must provide sufficient archival or newly obtained tumor tissue samples to determine PD-L1 expression level to be eligible for screening.During the screening phase, eligible subjects will be stratified by use of bevacizumab (yes vs no), prior concurrent chemoradiation therapy (yes vs no), and PD- L1 level (CPS \< 1 vs 1 ≤ CPS \< 10 vs CPS ≥ 10) and randomized 1:1 into the experimental or control arm.Experimental: QL1706 + Chemotherapy (Paclitaxel-cisplatin/Carboplatin) ± Bevacizumab;Control group: placebo + chemotherapy (paclitaxel-cisplatin/carboplatin) ± bevacizumab
