Patient exit interviews after doctor visits about what happened during the visits, such as what was discussed, what tests and consults were ordered and what medications were added or changed.
Patients are randomized into one of three groups. Before a single visit with diabetes care provider, the patient is called to answer interview questions about their health, diabetic care and behavior habits. After a patient visits with their doctor, they are called again to answer question about the visit they just had. If a patient is place into group A or B, based on their answers to the questions they are mailed a printed report before their doctor visit. The report will indicate how things are going the patient's diabetic care and recommended questions to ask his/her health care provided about diabetes. Group A feedback report will emphasize the risks from diabetes and the feedback reports for Group B will emphasize things to do to protect oneself from problems from having diabetes. Participants randomized to Group C will only receive printed reports after a doctors visit. No extra visit will be scheduled with the participants doctor, no travel is required, no blood tests are required and ther doctor will not be involved in the study unless the study participant chooses to discuss it with his/her doctor.
