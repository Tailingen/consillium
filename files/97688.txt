Efficacy and Safety of Nilotinib (AMN107) Compared With Current Treatment Options in Patients With GIST Who Have Failed Both Imatinib and Sunitinib
The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nilotinib versus current treatment in adults with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) who have either progressed or who were intolerant to the first and second line treatments.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Nilotinib|OTHER: Best Supportive Care (BSC) +/- imatinib or sunitinib
Progression-free Survival (PFS) From Central Radiology Review Based on Primary Analysis (Data Cut-off: June, 2008), Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from date of randomization to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a participant has not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the time of last adequate tumor assessment. Progression is defined according to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (modified RECIST) criteria as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, worsening of the non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 16 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) From Local Investigator's Assessment Based on Treatment Crossover Analysis Set, PFS is defined as the time from the first date of cross-over to nilotinib therapy from the control arm to the date of the first observation of documented disease progression. Tumor assessment was based on the local investigator's measurement using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (modified RECIST) criteria. Progression is defined according to modified RECIST criteria as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, worsening of the non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 34 months
Overall Survival Based on Primary Analysis (Data Cut-off:June, 2008), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a participant is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the date of last contact., Up to 16 months|Overall Survival During Core and Extension Phases of the Study, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a participant is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the date of last contact. This analysis included both Core and Extension data as well as survival follow up data., Up to 50 months (including core, extension and follow up period)|Overall Survival for Treatment Crossover Analysis Set, For patients who crossed-over to nilotinib from the control arm, the overall survival was the time from the first dose date of nilotinib after switching from control arm to the date of death due to any cause. If death was not observed, the OS was censored at the latest date the patient was known to be alive., Up to 34 months|Number of Responders With Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) From Central Radiology Review During Primary Analysis (Data Cut-off: June, 2008), The best overall response is the best response recorded from randomization until disease progression. The CR/PR must be confirmed by at least two determinations at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Using modified RECIST criteria, a Complete Response is defined as disappearance of all lesions, and a Partial Response is defined as either 1) at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and no new lesions or progression of non-target lesions or 2) disappearance of all target lesions but persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)., Up to 16 months|Number of Responders With Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) From Local Investigator's Assessment Based on Treatment Crossover Analysis Set, The best overall response (CR/PR) must be confirmed by at least two determinations at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Using modified RECIST criteria, a Complete Response is defined as disappearance of all lesions, and a Partial Response is defined as either 1) at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and no new lesions or progression of non-target lesions or 2) disappearance of all target lesions but persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)., Up to 34 months|Overall Clinical Benefit (Complete Response [CR]/Partial Response [PR] or Stable Disease [SD]) From Central Radiology Review Based on Primary Analysis (Data Cut-off: June, 2008), The overall clinical benefit includes the best overall responses of CR, PR, or SD. The best overall responses of CR/PR must be confirmed by at least two determinations at least 4 weeks apart before progression. The best overall response of SD must have at least one SD (or better) at least 6 weeks (or 6 months or 12 months as applicable) after randomization but before progression., Up to 16 months|Overall Clinical Benefit (Complete Response [CR]/Partial Response [PR] or Stable Disease [SD]) From Local Investigator's Assessment Based on Treatment Crossover Analysis Set, The overall clinical benefit includes the best overall responses of CR, PR, or SD. The best overall responses of CR/PR must be confirmed by at least two determinations at least 4 weeks apart before progression. The best overall response of SD must have at least one SD (or better) at least 6 weeks (or 6 months or 12 months as applicable) after randomization but before progression., Up to 34 months
