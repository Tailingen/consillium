A Cohort Study for the Following up of Conization
This study is to investigate the oncologic and obstetric outcomes in patients with conization for uterine cervical lesions from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2019 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

The primary objectives consist of following:

1. The cumulative incidences of precancerous lesions and cancers of lower genital tract in patients who accepted conization for high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL), carcinoma in situ and stage IA1 cancer (FIGO 2009)
2. The cumulative pregnancy rates in patients sparing the fertility

The secondary objectives consist of following:

1. The effects of surgical protocols (modified Sturmdorf method and "8" figure suture) and energy equipment (cold knife and monopolar electrical cautery) on the oncologic and obstetric outcomes, and on the histological components.
2. A full description of histological components of the conization specimens
3. The cytological and virus outcomes after conization, based on the thin prep liquid-based cytology test (TCT) and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing
