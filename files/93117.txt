Occupational Exposure to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and Prophylactic Vaccination
Currently there are no standards for healthcare worker vaccination with the HPV, Gardasil-9 vaccine. For health care workers, the CDC only recommends for vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza virus, Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR), Chickenpox (Varicella), Tetanus, Diptheria, and Pertussis (Tdap), and meninogococcal infections6
Papillomavirus Vaccines
BIOLOGICAL: Gardasil-9
# of participants with elevated HPV antibody titers from baseline to 7 months, baseline change at 7 months post vaccine series. The antibody titer laboratory test will be used to record the levels, baseline and 7 months
Initial antibody titers will be measured immediately prior to initial vaccination (month 0). This will entail a blood-draw sample (less than 1 teaspoon) that will be sent to FOCUS labs for evaluation. This will be paid for by funding received from Merck.

The three-dose vaccination schedule will be followed with injections at month 0, 2, and 6. Gardasil 9 dosing will be per the recommended and approved labeled guidelines. Post-vaccination titers would be measured at month 7, which is in alignment with the methods of previous studies. This will entail a blood-draw sample (less than 1 teaspoon) that will be sent to FOCUS labs for evaluation.
