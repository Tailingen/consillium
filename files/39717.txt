Association of Conformational High-dose Radiotherapy and of Hyperselective Transarterial Chemoembolization in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Indication : Hepatocellular carcinoma, maximum size 9 cm, with single or multiple nodes whose total tumor mass can technically be irradiated, non-resectable, and not a candidate for percutaneous therapy with recommended treatment via hyperselective transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: TACE|OTHER: TACE+ RTC
Time of tumor progression radiologically (CTScan) measured by mRECIST (Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor)., up to 18 months
Evaluation of the acute toxicity at the participants, within 90 days after the treatment|Evaluation of the late toxicity at the participants, after 90 days of treatment|Evaluation of the quality of life (assessed by QLQ-EORT C30), the day of randomization (week 0), at week 12 and week 24|Evaluation of the rate of complete, partial response and stable disease after treatment (by RECIST criteria ), at week 24,week 48 and week 72|Compare the health economic implications of these regimens in these patients., up to18 months (week 72)|overall survival, within 3 years after first cure of TACE-DC BEADS
: Phase II controlled randomized trial, multicenter, comparing the benefit of additive conformational radiotherapy after therapy with hyperselective chemoembolisation (TACE) with treatment using three TACE treatments (standard of care).
