Water Immersion and Polyp Detection: A Randomized Controlled Trial
We plan to conduct a randomized trial of tandem colonoscopies comparing water infusion and air insufflation for inspection of mucosa on withdrawal. In one randomized group, water infusion will be employed as the first method for mucosal inspection while in a second group, CO2 insufflation will be used first. This study will be different than usual care since the participants will receive two successive or tandem colonoscopies versus one
Adenoma|Colonic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Water Infusion first|PROCEDURE: CO2 Insufflation First
Adenoma Miss Rate, Adenoma-level miss rates will be calculated as the number of additional adenomas detected during the second examination divided by the total number of adenomas detected during both examinations, Through procedure, an average of 1 hr
Patient-level Miss Rate, Patient-level miss rates will be calculated as the number of patients with one or more adenomas detected during the second examination, divided by the total number of patients with at least one adenoma in either examination, 1 hour or the duration of the procedure|Adenoma < 6mm Detection Rate, Adenoma-level miss rates will be calculated as the number of additional adenomas \< 6 mm detected during the second examination divided by the total number of adenomas\< 6 mm detected during both examinations., 1 hour or the duration of the procedure
