A Study of BMS-986504 in Participants With Pre-treated Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Homozygous MTAP Deletion
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMS-986504 monotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with homozygous MTAP deletion after progression on prior therapies.
