HoLEP Prior to Radiation Therapy for Patients With LUTS/Retention and Concurrent Prostate Cancer
To determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and/or urinary retention alters the treatment course for patients concurrently diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
PROCEDURE: Holmium Laser Enucleation of Prostate (HoLEP)
Improvement in Quality of Life - One Year Post Operatively, The primary object is to determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) improves the quality of life in patients with concurrent prostate cancer who may undergo radiation therapy as well. Quality of life will be assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 26. This instrument evaluates patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment using 26 items and scored on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating a better health related quality of life., Quality of life will be assessed one year post-operatively|Improvement in Quality of Life - Five Years Post Operatively, The primary object is to determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) improves the quality of life in patients with concurrent prostate cancer who may undergo radiation therapy as well. Quality of life will be assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 26. This instrument evaluates patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment using 26 items and scored on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating a better health related quality of life., Quality of life will be assessed five years post-operatively
Prostate Cancer Treatment Course - One Year Post Operatively, The secondary objective is to determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) alters the prostate cancer treatment course in patients. This will assessed by comparing the time from enrollment to the time of initiation of radiation therapy in patients in both arms., Prostate Cancer Treatment Course will assessed one year post-operatively|Prostate Cancer Treatment Course - Five Years Post Operatively, The secondary objective is to determine if holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) alters the prostate cancer treatment course in patients. This will assessed by comparing the time from enrollment to the time of initiation of radiation therapy in patients in both arms., Prostate Cancer Treatment Course will assessed five years post-operatively
The investigators propose a prospective trial to investigate pre-radiation holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP) in men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and prostate cancer who have elected for radiation therapy as the primary treatment modality for their prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that pre-radiation HoLEP may decrease their overall LUTS and may decrease their need for subsequent radiation therapy. The goal with this study is to better understand the overlap between prostate cancer and LUTS, as well as determine if primary surgical treatment for the LUTS with HoLEP can also serve as a possible treatment modality for concurrent prostate cancer. This information may provide further information to inform future standard of care practices for patients with prostate cancer.
