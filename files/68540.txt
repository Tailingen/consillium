Contribution of MRI in the Evaluation of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
The main objective of the study is to assess the sensitivity and the specificity of the variation of apparent diffusion coefficient for prediction, after a course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or after modification of the treatment sequence, the pathological response at the end of chemotherapy
Assess the Variation of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient
OTHER: MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging)
Variation of apparent diffusion coefficient before / after a cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or before / after modification of the treatment sequence and correlated with histologic response, One year
