TACE in Combination With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors and Molecular Target Therapies for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular target therapies in patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors+VEGF-TKI/bevacizumab|PROCEDURE: TACE
Overall Survival(OS), The OS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to death due to any cause., up to approximately 2 years
Progression free survival(PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), The PFS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to the first documented progressive disease (according to RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|PFS per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), The PFS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to the first documented progressive disease (according to mRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate(ORR) per RESCIST 1.1, The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) per RECIST 1.1., up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RESCIST 1.1, DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR or PR until the first documented disease progression (according to RESCIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RESCIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)per RESCIST 1.1., up to approximately 2 years|ORR per mRECIST, The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR or PR per mRECIST., up to approximately 2 years|DOR per mRECIST, DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR or PR until the first documented disease progression (according to mRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|DCR per mRECIST, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per mRECIST., up to approximately 2 years|Adverse event(AE) per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) 5.0, The percentage and degree of patients who experience at least one AE, whether or not considered related to the treatment, according to CTCAE version 5.0., up to approximately 2 years
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can induce immunogenic cell death and tumor-specific immune response which results in the release of tumor antigens and transform "cold" tumors with lacking immune effector cells into "hot" tumors with immune effector cells infiltration. This provides a theoretical basis for TACE combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular target therapies(including, VEGF-TKI/ bevacizumab) in patients with advanced-stage HCC. This real-world study also would like to explore the optimal combined treatment and subgroup of HCC patients for providing further information for clinical practice and trials.
