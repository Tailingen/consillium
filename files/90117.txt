ASIA Study : French Register of Inflammatory Eye Disease
New anticancer therapies based on lifting the inhibition of the immunological synapse are used in the therapeutic arsenal of a growing number of neoplasias (melanoma, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, etc.). These "immune check points" inhibitors "(ICPI) target molecules that usually allow immunity to destroy malignant cells. At the systemic level, this results in a loss of immune homeostasis and facilitation of the inflammatory response which may be responsible for dysimmune manifestations distant from the neoplastic site. Thus, since their introduction, ICPIs have been of interest to immunologists, rheumatologists and internists who often find themselves in the first line to deal with this type of side effect (immunotherapy-related adverse events, IRAEs). The frequency of these ARIs between 70% and 90%, depending on the immunotherapy used and the severity of these ARIIs (grade 1-2 vs. 3-5). The overall increase in the number of cancers, the multiplication of available molecules and the expansion of their indications should exponentially increase the number of IRAEs to be supported. Little is known about the epidemiology, risk factors and efficacy of treatments.

In these IRAEs, inflammatory ophthalmological manifestations have been described with an estimated prevalence of between 0.4 and 1% of the patients treated. These attacks are rare and protean (uveitis, scleritis, retinitis, inflammatory orbitopathies, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada -like...) and reported most often in the form of clinical cases.

The Main objective is to describe the inflammatory ophthalmic disorders linked to anti-cancer immunotherapy.
