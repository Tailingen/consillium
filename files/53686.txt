* Tumor Response based on the Investigator's assessment using RECIST v1.1 \[categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD)\]
* Best Overall Response (BOR), defined as the best tumor response recorded between the data of first dose and the last on-study tumor assessment (prior to any subsequent cancer therapy)
* Overall Response Rate, defined as the proportion of subjects with BOR responses of CR or PR
* Disease Control Rate, defined as the proportion of subjects with BOR responses of CR, PR or SD
* Progression-Free Survival (or PFS), defined as time from first dose to either progressive disease, initiation of subsequent off-study therapy, or death, Screening (within 30 days prior to Day 1), Every 8 weeks, End of Treatment or 30-Day follow-up visits (approximately 18 months)
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of daily doses of BMS-986115 in subjects with advanced solid tumors
