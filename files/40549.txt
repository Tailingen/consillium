A Study of the Safety and Tolerability of IBI321 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This first-in-human open-label,dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and primary efficacy of IBI321 in participants with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable tumors for whom standard therapy does not exist, has proven to be ineffective or intolerable.
