The efficacy and safety of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases remain unknown. This multicentre, prospective, open-label, single-arm trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases. The primary endpoints are the progression-free survival rates of liver target lesions. While the secondary endpoints include the safety, tumor control, and the distribution characteristics of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres.
