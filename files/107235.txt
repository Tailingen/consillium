Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of the Combination of NaviFUS System With Re-irradiation for rGBM Patients
This is an open label, single arm, prospective, and pilot study. Eligible patients will be enrolled after acquiring the signed informed consent and then will receive the treatment of re-RT combined with FUS (FUS + re-RT) on an outpatient basis. The re-RT in FUS + re-RT treatment will include fractioned stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment (FUS + SRS) or conventional radiotherapy (cRT) treatment (FUS + cRT). The treatment of SRS or cRT treatment given to patients is determined by the investigator depending on the volume and location of the treatment region.
