Clinical Outcome of Palliative Surgery After Translational Therapy for Metastatic Gastric Cancer Versus Maintenance Chemotherapy for Metastatic Gastric Cancer
This single-center, prospective study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of palliative surgery after translational therapy in the treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. The primary endpoint was 2-year overall survival (OS) rate. Secondary endpoints were median OS, progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year OS, adverse events (AE), severe AE, the quality of life (QOL) and treatment cost.
