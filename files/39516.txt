BNCT and IG-IMRT for Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer
This is a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) combined with image-guided intensity modulation radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) for patients with previously irradiated and locally recurrent head and neck cancer. The primary end points are treatment toxicities and response rate. The secondary endpoints are time to tumor progression, progression-free survival, overall survival and change quality of life.

Head and neck(H \& N) carcinomas that recur locally after conventional irradiation pose a therapeutic challenge. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture reaction that occurs when non-radioactive boron is irradiated with neutrons of thermal energy to yield high energy alpha particles and recoiling lithium nuclei. The effect of alpha and 7Li is primarily limited to boron-containing cells. Preferential uptake of boron into cancerous tissue is achieved using boron carriers such as a derivative of phenylalanine, boronophenylalanine (BPA). After administration of BPA by intravenous infusion, the tumor site is irradiated with neutrons, the source of which is currently a nuclear reactor, like the Tsing Hua Open-Pool Reactor (THOR), a 2MW research reactor at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Taiwan. Since it is a target radiotherapy, low complication rate after BNCT can be obtained. However, further local recurrence after BNCT for recurrent H \& N cancer was reported in several publications.

Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is the process of frequent two and three-dimensional imaging, during a course of radiation treatment, used to direct radiation therapy utilizing the imaging coordinates of the approved radiation treatment plan. IGRT such as Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) using an On-Board Imager (OBI) enhance delivery and further improve outcomes as the treatments create a higher level of precision. By combining BNCT and IG-IMRT, we expect to procure high control rate of recurrent H \& N cancer with acceptable toxicity. This study will be the first BNCT plus IG-IMRT trial to treat head and neck cancer in Taiwan.
