Transthoracic Needle Biopsy Using 3D Printed Navigational Template: A Phase I Feasibility Trial
This study evaluates the feasibility of three-dimensional printed template in transthoracic pulmonary nodule biospy. Investigator planned to include 20 patients with lung nodule biopsy schedule to receive template-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
Lung Neoplasms
DEVICE: navigational template
Success rate of needle insertion, Clinician evaluate the relative position between biopsy needle and the target lesion on CT images after needle insertion., 15 minutes
procedural length, The length of procedural time is measured from the time a patient is lying on the examining bed of the CT scanner to the time he/she complete the biopsy procedure and step off the CT table., 1 hour|radiation dosage, How much radiation exposure patients would receive in the whole process of transthoracic needle biopsy., 1 hour
In previous study,a navigational template has been created to simplify the procedure of preoperative lung nodule localization. It was reported that localizer deviation was 10(0-20)mm.In this trial,Investigator explores the utility of this navigational template in transthoracic lung nodule biopsy.
