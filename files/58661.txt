Thalidomide, Cyclophosphamide, Oral Idarubicin and Dexamethasone (T-CID) in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
Background: In some studies, thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis.

Induction therapy: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, oral idarubicin and dexamethasone (T-CID) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Maintenance therapy: Randomized trial to compare efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide and thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy in patients with at least stable disease after T-CID.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: thalidomide|DRUG: idarubicin
Induction therapy: response rate, overall survival, death rate|Maintenance therapy: progression-free survival, overall survival, number of patients discontinuing therapy due to toxicity
Induction therapy: number of patients discontinuing therapy due to toxicity, number of patients experiencing toxicity grade 3 or 4|Maintenance therapy: dose intensity, number of patients experiencing toxicity grade 3 or 4
Background: In some studies, thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis.

After 3-8 cycles of T-CID patients with at least stable disease will be randomized to receive thalidomide or thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy for at least one year or until progression.
