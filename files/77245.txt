Dose Confirmation and Dose Expansion Phase 1 Study of IO-108 and IO-108 + Anti-PD-1 in Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of IO-108 monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab or tislelizumab in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 3 parts, including Part A IO-108 monotherapy dose confirmation; Part B IO-108 + anti-PD-1 dose confirmation, and Part C dose expansion.
