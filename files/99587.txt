Clinical Trial to Assess Efficacy and Safety of NNG-TMAB (Trastuzumab) on Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
Targeted therapy in the treatment of breast cancer targets HER2 receptor (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor). HER2 receptor plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation (5). However, when HER2 overexpresses, it may lead to cancer. HER2 positive malignance exacerbates pathology and worsens clinical outcome, such as shortened overall survival (OS) compared with non-HER2 overexpression patients (6), (7). About 20-30% overexpression HER2/neogene breast cancer patients and patients having HER2 overexpression tumor have disease progression and poor prognosis in metastatic process (8), (9).

Currently, targeted therapeutic, which attaches to the HER2 receptor, inhibiting the growth of cancer cells has been approved. One of these products is Trastuzumab.

The study processed on 128 females aged between 18 and 65, recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients with positive HER2.

The subjects were randomly distributed in 2 groups as NNG-TMAB + docetaxel or Herceptin® + docetaxel, in blocks of 4 in a 1: 1 ratio (NNG-TMAB: Herceptin®). In each block of 4 will be 2 patients in the experimental group and 2 patients in the control group

Primany endpoints is Overall Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1. ORR includes Complete Response Rate and Partial Response Rate. ORR will be independently evaluated by an Independent Tumor Evaluation Board (ITEB).

This trial is intended to assess the biosimilarity of efficacy and safety between NNG-TMAB (Trastuzumab) and Herceptin® in combination with Docetaxel on recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients with positive HER2.

Progressive Disease Rate (PDR) according to RECIST 1.1, Progressive Disease Rate (PDR). PDR will be independently evaluated by an Independent Tumor Evaluation Board (ITEB)., PDR will be evaluated every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) through the end of study (up to 128 days)|Stable Disease Rate (SDR) according to RECIST 1.1, Stable Disease Rate (SDR). SDR will be independently evaluated by an Independent Tumor Evaluation Board (ITEB)., SDR will be evaluated every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) through the end of study (up to 128 days)|Progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between the date patient signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and the date of disease progression or death from any cause., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 128 days (6 cycles - each cycle is 21 days))|Evaluate the patient's quality of life, Quality of life of patients according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire combined with EORTC QLQ-BR23 at week 24. All scores were linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, according to international guidelines before assessment. A high or healthy level of functioning is represented by a high functional score. A high QOL is represented by a high score for global health status or QOL. More severe symptoms or problems are represented by high symptom scores or items.

(i) EORTC QLQ-C30: is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions.

(ii) EORTC QLQ-BR23: is a breast-specific module that comprises of 23 questions., At week 24th|Anti-drug antibody evaluation, Percentage of participants with positive Anti-drug antibody, At baseline,after 3 cycles of treatment, after 6 cycles of treatment (each cycle is 21 days)|Rate of AE and SAE occurence, Frequency of adverse events, including clinical examination, vital signs and laboratory tests, up to 128 days (6 cycles - each cycle is 21 days)
