RT, Temozolomide, and Bevacizumab Followed by Bevacizumab/Everolimus in First-line Treatment of GBM
In this phase II trial the investigators plan to incorporate two targeted agents, bevacizumab and everolimus, into the first-line multimodality therapy of glioblastoma. In the first portion of the treatment, bevacizumab will be added to standard concurrent radiation therapy plus temozolomide. After completing radiation therapy, patients will continue treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and everolimus.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever comes first., 18 months
Number of Participants Experiencing Toxicity After This Novel Multimodality Regimen, The toxicity assessments were made according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE version 3.0) of the National Cancer Institute. Number of participants with Grade 1 to 5 adverse events are reported here., 18 months|Overall Survival of Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme Following Treatment With This Novel Multimodality Regimen, Overall survival was defined as the interval from the first day of study treatment until the date of death., 18 months|Objective Response Rate of Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme Following Treatment With This Novel Multimodality Regimen, Response to treatment was assessed by MRI using the MacDonald criteria based on the assessment of the MRI scan for measurable, evaluable, and new lesions. The objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with improvement and or decreased extent of lesions compared to baseline., 18 months
Although this maintenance regimen departs from the standard treatment with single agent temozolomide, we feel this approach may add to the overall efficacy of treatment for the following reasons: 1) results with bevacizumab/everolimus in renal cell carcinoma suggest there is at least an additive efficacy when these drugs are used in combination; 2) the efficacy of single agent temozolomide following standard concurrent radiation therapy/temozolomide has not been proven, 3) the use of the three-drug maintenance program (i.e., bevacizumab/everolimus/temozolomide) would probably not be tolerated well on a chronic basis in this patient population; and 4) the bevacizumab/everolimus combination has potential advantages as a maintenance therapy, since it has been well tolerated for many months in patients with other malignancies.
