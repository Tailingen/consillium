Phase 1 First in Human Study of ZN-d5 as a Single Agent
Phase 1 dose escalation study of ZN-d5 in subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: ZN-d5
Observed Dose Limiting Toxicities, Observed Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in DLT-evaluable subjects., Through completion of Cycle 1; 1 to 2 months.|Incidence and severity of AEs, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v 5.0, Safety profile of ZN-d5., Through study completion, typically < 12 months
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ZN-d5 - Cmax, Characterize the Pharmacokinetics of ZN-d5 in subjects with NHL and AML using peak plasma concentration (Cmax)., approximately 6 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters for ZN-d5 - Tmax, Characterize the Pharmacokinetics of ZN-d5 in subjects with NHL and AML using the time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax)., approximately 6 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters for ZN-d5 - AUC, Characterize the Pharmacokinetics of ZN-d5 in subjects with NHL and AML using area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)., approximately 6 months|For NHL, evaluate response according to the Lugano 2014 classification, Evaluate response according to the Lugano 2014 classification for NHL subjects. The Lugano Classification is based on a 5-point scale for scoring of metabolically active lesions detected by PET-CT in FDG-avid lymphomas, and lesion size for non-FDG-avid tumors. A complete metabolic response would require a score of 1 or 2 on target and non-target lesions and the spleen for high-risk disease, and a score of 1,2, or 3 for low-risk disease. A partial response, no response, or progression would require a score of 4 or 5 for low-risk disease, and a score of 3, 4, or 5 for high-risk disease., Through study completion, typically < 12 months|For AML, remission rate based on European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria, Evaluate remission rate according to the European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria (Overall Response Rate (ORR) defined as Complete Remission (CR) + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) + Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLFS) + Partial Remission (PR)) for AML subjects., Through study completion, typically < 12 months|For AML, duration of remission based on European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria, Evaluate duration of remission according to the European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria., Through study completion, typically < 12 months
This is an open-label multicenter Phase 1 dose escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the novel BCL-2 inhibitor ZN-d5 in subjects with (NHL) or (AML) in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of ZN-d5.
