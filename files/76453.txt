A Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of NBM-BMX Administered Orally to Asian Patients With Advanced Cancer
NBM-BMX is an orally available new chemical entity to inhibit HDAC8 activity specifically, being developed as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic by NatureWise. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of NBM-BMX as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors (Arm A) or in combination with the standard of care treatment (i.e., concomitant RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ) in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (Arm B).
Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: NBM-BMX softgel capsules
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of NBM-BMX [Safety and Tolerability], Toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0, up to 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NBM-BMX [Safety and Tolerability], The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which at most one of six patients experiences a DLT after 28 days of treatment have occurred, with the next higher dose having at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients experiencing a DLT., up to 28 days
Preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) [Efficacy], at least 8 weeks|AUC(0-last) of NBM-BMX [Pharmacokinetics], AUC(0-last): area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to the time of the last measurable concentration, Day 1, 8 and 15 for Cycle 1 only (each cycle is 28 days)|Cmax of NBM-BMX [Pharmacokinetics], Cmax: maximum plasma concentration, Day 1, 8 and 15 for Cycle 1 only (each cycle is 28 days)|Tmax of NBM-BMX [Pharmacokinetics], Tmax: time to maximum plasma concentration, Day 1, 8 and 15 for Cycle 1 only (each cycle is 28 days)|T(1/2) of NBM-BMX [Pharmacokinetics], T(1/2): terminal elimination half-life, Day 1, 8 and 15 for Cycle 1 only (each cycle is 28 days)
