Investigating Facilitator-driven, Multi-level Implementation Strategies in Federally Qualified Health Centers to Improve Provider Recommendation and HPV Vaccination Rates Among Latino/a Adolescents
The purpose of this study is to determine the provider- and practice-level characteristics that influence the impact of implementation strategies guided by practice facilitation in each clinical practice, to test whether the facilitator-driven provider- and practice-level implementation strategies increase provider recommendations and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination rates and to evaluate implementation and future sustainability of the facilitator-driven implementation strategies across nine clinical practice sites
