Genetic Determinations for Side Effects and Response Rate for Patients Receiving Chemotherapy With Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether people have genes that make them more likely to respond to chemotherapy and/or have side effects from chemotherapy for diffuse large cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma|Diffuse Large Cell
PROCEDURE: Blood draw
Negative [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan after 2 cycles of R-CHOP, Approximately 42 days (2 cycles of R-CHOP)
Response after six cycles of R-CHOP, Approximately 126 days (6 Cycles of R-CHOP)|Progression free survival, 3 years|Grade 3-4 toxicity, Approximately 156 days
Upon enrollment in the study, patients will have a blood sample collected for genotyping of the FCGR3A gene (immunoglobulin Fc G receptor IIIa), the ABCB1 gene (ATP Binding Cassette Beta 1; also called MDR1), and other candidate genes. Patients will be treated with R-CHOP for six cycles, which is standard therapy for advanced stage DLCL. Response will be monitored by an FDG-PET scan performed after 2 cycles of R-CHOP and restaging exams performed upon completion of chemotherapy. Gene polymorphisms will be analyzed to establish which polymorphisms predict response to R-CHOP.
