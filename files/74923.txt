99mTc-DARPinG3 SPECT/CT for Non-invasive HER2-AX in Breast Cancer With Metastatic Lymph Nodes Before Targeted Therapy
An open-label, single center study with 99mTc-DARPinG3 SPECT/CT and biopsies of primary tumour and metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer patients, where the primary endpoint of the study is to find out the correlation between the HER2 expression measured by 99mTc-DARPinG3 SPECT/CT and standard histopathology from relevant tumor and lymph node biopsies.

DRUG: 99mTc-DARPinG3 SPECT/CT
SPECT/CT-based 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake in tumor lesions, SPECT/CT-based 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake value in tumor lesions (counts)/SUV of 99mTc-DARPinG3 focal uptake coinciding with tumor lesions is assessed using SPECT/CT at 4 hours after injection and measured in counts and SUV, 4 hours|SPECT/CT-based 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake value in metastatic lymph nodes, SPECT/CT-based 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake value in metastatic lymph nodes (counts)/SUV of 99mTc-DARPinG3 focal uptake coinciding with tumor lesions is assessed using SPECT/CT at 4 hours after injection and measured in counts and SUV, 4 hours|Tumor-to-background ratio (SPECT), The SPECT-based tumor-to-background ratio will be calculated as follows: the value of 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions (counts/SUV) will be divided by the value of 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake coinciding with the regions without pathological findings (counts/SUV), 4 hours|LN-to-background LN ratio (SPECT), The SPECT-based LN-to-background LN ratio will be calculated as follows: the value of 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake coinciding with LN lesions (counts/SUV) will be divided by the value of 99mTc-DARPinG3 uptake coinciding with the regions without pathological findings (counts/SUV), 4 hours
Morphological and immunohistochemical verification of 99mTc-DARPinG3 accumulation, Comparison of the 99mTc-DARPinG3 accumulation in the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with the results of morphological and immunohistochemical studies, 4 hours
Overall goal of the project: To determine HER2 expression level in primary breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastases before chemo/targeted therapy.
