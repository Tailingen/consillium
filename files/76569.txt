Newer Breast MRI Sequences for the Evaluation of Breast Cancer -FIESTA, Vibrant-DE and IDEAL: Feasibility Evaluation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate new computer software on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The information from this study may help doctors and scientists develop better ways to find breast cancer, and may help future patents with cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: new software sequences, FIESTA and Vibrant-DE and IDEAL
To evaluate the feasibility of three new pulse sequences for breast MRI using newly developed software; FIESTA, Vibrant DE and IDEAL, conclusion of the study
To quantitatively and qualitatively assess performance of the three breast pulse sequences, and compare these results with the same parameters on standard breast MRI sequences., conclusion of the study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate new computer software on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The information from this study may help doctors and scientists develop better ways to find breast cancer, and may help future patents with cancer.
