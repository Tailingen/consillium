Mesenteric Approach vs. Conventional Approach for Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the advantage of mesenteric approach during pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The design of this study is multicenter randomized clinical trial, comparing oncological and surgical outcomes between mesenteric approach and conventional approach during PD for PDAC.

Mesenteric approach starts from dissection of lymph nodes around the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and finally performs Kocher's maneuver during PD. The aims of this approach are 1) decrease of intraoperative blood loss volume, 2) increase of R0 rate, and 3) prevention of squeezing cancer cells out into the vessels. However, there have been no evidence of the efficacy of this procedure. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mesenteric approach during PD for PDAC, by multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing oncological and surgical outcomes between mesenteric approach and conventional approach during PD for PDAC.
