A Trial in Patients With Diffuse Large-B-cell Lymphoma Comparing Pixantrone Against Doxorubicin
The purpose of this study is to compare the standard CHOP-R regimen of Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone, and Rituximab to CPOP-R (same regimen, but substituting Doxorubicin with Pixantrone). The objective is to show that CPOP-R is not inferior to CHOP-R.

Overall Survival, Overall Survival time frame is from the interval between the date of randomization and death due to any cause and measures the total number of deaths., The interval between the date of randomization and death due to any cause (up to 100 weeks)|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), The interval between the date of randomization and the event of disease progression or relapse, institution of a new anticancer treatment or death., From the date of randomization to the first documented disease progression or death (up to 100 weeks)|Overall Objective Response Rate, Subjects followed for 5 years post treatment|Time to Treatment Failure, Subjects followed for 5 years post treatment
In preclinical studies, pixantrone has shown significantly less cardiotoxicity than other anthracyclines or anthracenediones. In addition, patients with relapsed disease, who have received prior maximum doses of anthracyclines, have tolerated high doses of pixantrone with minimal added cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone is currently being studied in a Phase III study in 3rd line aggressive NHL.
