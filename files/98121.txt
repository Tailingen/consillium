Malignant Obstruction ZILVER Against Routine Therapy (MOZART I)
This study compares the 6 mm nitinol Zilver biliary endoprostheses and the 10 mm nitinol Zilver biliary endoprostheses to the 10 mm Wallstent in appropriate patients in need of palliative treatment of malignant obstructive jaundice.
Biliary Tract Neoplasms|Pancreatic Neoplasms|Jaundice, Obstructive
DEVICE: 6 mm Nitinol Zilver Stent|DEVICE: 10 mm Nitinol Zilver Stent|DEVICE: 10 mm Stainless Steel Wallstent
Patency, Number of days of stent patency: The time to stent occlusion requiring re-intervention, death, loss to follow-up, or patients alive at study end without an occlusion (\>= 6 months after placement)., up to 32 months|Closure or Blockage of the Stent (Occlusion), Biliary stents may become closed or blocked. This is also termed "Occlusion." Data for this outcome measure involve stent occlusions that required re-intervention., up to 32 months|Number of Days to Occlusion, up to 32 months|Number of Deaths, up to 32 months|Time to Death, Overall Survival, up to 32 months
This research is being done to determine if the new, FDA-cleared Zilver metal biliary stent is better than the conventional stents. The new Zilver stent may permit more accurate placement, may avoid some potential complications and last longer than the conventional stents. The study will also examine to find the best diameter of stent by comparing standard 10 mm stents to 6 mm Zilver stents.
