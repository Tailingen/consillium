This is a prospective, multi-center, real-world study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel versus paclitaxel or docetaxel in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

5-year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) rate, Invasive disease free survival was defined as the time from enrollment until the date of first occurrence of one of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, local/regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence (including first metastasis), invasive contralateral breast cancer, second primary invasive cancer (nonbreast, not including squamous or basal cell skin cancers, or new in situ carcinomas of any site), or death from any cause. 5-year IDFS rate is thepercentage of participants with IDFS from enrollment through 5 years., up to 60 months
