Study of PD-1 Inhibitors After CD30.CAR T Cell Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
LCCC1852-ATL is a prospective 2-arm study designed to determine if chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells result in immunomodulation which can be subsequently exploited by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies to achieve clinical responses in subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).

Objective response, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at 12 weeks after initiating anti-PD-1 therapy, Response will be determined by the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria in order to evaluate the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy in relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL)., 12 weeks
Peripheral T-cell receptor frequency per 100,000 clones on Day 1, Day 21, and Day 42 of anti-PD-1 therapy., To measure the change in peripheral blood T-cell receptor clonality during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy., 42 days|Percent change in peripheral blood T-cell subsets, Percent change in peripheral blood T-cell subsets will be measured by FluidigmÂ® based mass cytometry from Day 1 of anti-PD-1 therapy to Day 21 and Day 42 of anti-PD-1 therapy., 42 days|Progression free survival, Progression free survival of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy will be defined as the duration of time from the first day of anti-PD-1 therapy to clinical progression or death as a result of any cause. Response will be determined by the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria., From first day of anti-PD-1 therapy to clinical progression or death, up to 15 years
In this study, investigators will enroll subjects with relapsed/refractory cHL being treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. The study will examine the treatment of relapsed/refractory cHL in this population in , two arms with 10 subjects each: (1) Arm 1: 10 subjects who have previously received anti-PD-1 therapy and experienced progression and more recently received CD30 CAR-T cell therapy and have evidence of progression, and (2) Arm 2 : 10 subjects who have never received CD30 CAR-T therapy and have evidence of progression are initiating treatment with anti-PD1 therapy. In both arms of the study subjects will be offered anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab, at the discretion of treating oncologist), as per standard of care in r/r cHL

The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy in study Arm 1 subjects within r/r cHL. The secondary objectives will be to measure the change in T-cell receptor clonality during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression after CD30 CAR-T therapy in these subjects, the change in peripheral blood immunophenotype during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy and progression free survival (PFS) of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy.

Preliminary data from subjects treated with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression following CD30 CAR-T cell therapy has suggested surprisingly robust clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, this study is an important advancement for understanding both immunomodulation after CD30 CAR-T cell therapy, as well as clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy. This study will serve as a baseline for clinical response and immunomodulation for future clinical trials evaluating the combination of anti-PD-1 therapy and CD30 CAR-T cell therapy.
