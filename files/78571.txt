Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Vascular Reactivity in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM)
The goal is to characterize vascular reactivity and cardiac pulsatility of normal appearing white matter in patients with CCM during hypercarbia/hypocarbia using quantitative real-time high-speed multi-echo fMRI to develop prognostic biomarkers for CCM formation
Cerebral Cavernous Malformation
OTHER: Hyperventilation and CO2 challenge
Hemodynamic Response, Primary end point of the study is to measure the amplitude and frequency response of hemodynamic response function during hypercarbia/hypocarbia using task-based functional MRI, 12 Months|Resting state connectivity, To measure the strength of resting-state connectivity during hypercarbia/hypocarbia using high-speed multi-echo resting-state functional MRI., 12 month
Cardiac Pulsatility, Measure the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the cardiac pulsatility during hypercarbia/hypocarbia in functional MRI time series that are acquired using high-speed multi-echo functional MRI, 12 Months|First Harmonic, To measure the amplitude ratio of the first harmonic of the cardiac pulsatility relative to the cardiac base frequency in these data, which is a biomarker of vascular compliance.speed multi echo fMRI., 12 Months
