Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer
This is a prospective population based study to examine the relationship of oral and pancreatic microbiome, and their functions, to pancreatic cancer risk.

The identification of specific oral bacteria and their functional relationship to pancreatic cancer will advance scientific knowledge on the etiology of pancreatic cancer. This could provide a new microbially-based research paradigm, possibly leading to new drug targets for this disease. Second, the oral bacteria may serve as a readily accessible, non-invasive biomarker for subsequent pancreatic cancer risk, which help to identify people at high risk of this disease. Finally, the identified oral bacteria may lead to microbial prophylactic preventions, with antibiotic therapy aimed at eradicating the specific species associated with increased cancer risk or, alternatively, combined with probiotics to introduce species that are associated with a decreased cancer risk. Thus, the study outcomes will lead to actionable means for pancreatic cancer prevention.

Presence or absence of bacterial taxa will be compared in oral and pancreatic samples., For the taxa present at both sites, correlation between the abundance of taxa will be examined between the two sites. To adjust for confounders, multivariate linear regression will be used with abundance of oral taxa (exposure) and that of pancreas taxa (outcome)., 4 Years
A history of periodontal disease and the presence of circulating antibodies to selected oral pathogens have been associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer; however, direct relationships of oral microbes with pancreatic cancer have not been evaluated in prospective studies. Investigators examine the relationship of oral microbiota with subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer in a large nested case-control study.
