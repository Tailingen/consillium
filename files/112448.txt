Decitabine + BUCY vs BUCY Conditioning Regimen for Myeloid Tumors Undergoing Allo-HSCT
Recent studies have demonstrated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) could be a valuable treatment choice for myeloid tumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Unfortunately, some patients relapsed after allo-HSCT. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in myeloid tumors undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.

Recent studies have demonstrated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) could be a valuable treatment choice for myeloid tumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative regimen for myeloid tumors undergoing allo-HSCT. However, it appears to have higher relapse rate and lower survival. To reduce the relapse rate and improve the survival, decitabine is added in the conditioning regimen. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in myeloid tumors undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
