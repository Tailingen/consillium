Immune Mobilization of Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Using Interleukin-2 and GM-CSF
We postulate that the combination of IL-2 and GM-CSF immunotherapy will efficiently mobilize autologous peripheral blood stem cells and activated immune effector cells in patients with a hematologic malignancy. These activated effector cells will improve the immune function of the graft. These hypotheses will be tested using this proposed clinical trial to mobilize autologous peripheral blood stem cells pre-transplantation.

DRUG: GM-CSF|DRUG: IL-2
Can IL-2 be administered with GM-CSF to efficiently mobilize autologous peripheral blood stem cells. This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 and the optimal biological dose with GM-CSF for stem cell mobilization., 5 Years
Will immune-mobilized stem cell products be well tolerated once infused into patients and will engraft normally following high-dose chemotherapy and APBSCT., 5 Years
