A Phase Ib/II Study of Adebrelimab in Combination with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in Cancer
In this study, the combination of Adebrelimab (PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) on the basis of standard treatment (two-drug chemotherapy regimen of fluorouracil and platinum drugs) may enhance the immune response in order to enhance the killing effect on tumor cells and bring survival benefits to patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

This study is divided into two phases: Phase Ib is a study on the tolerance and safety of Adebrelimab combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors; Phase II is a single-arm, open-label clinical study to observe and evaluate the improvement of objective response rate (ORR) in advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with adebrelimab combination therapy. A total of 52 subjects are expected to be enrolled in this study.
