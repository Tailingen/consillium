Enhancing Optune Therapy With Targeted Craniectomy
The present study proposes a new and potentially superior clinical approach to Optune™ therapy of selected glioblastoma patients. The approach is based on combining TTFields with targeted surgical skull remodeling, such as minor craniectomy or a distribution of burr holes, designed for the individual patient. Pre-clinical modeling results suggest that such procedures may enhance the induced electrical field strength by up to \~100% and thereby potentially improve the clinical outcome of treated patients to a significant extent.

The study is an open label phase 1 clinical pilot experiment designed to investigate feasibility, safety and efficacy of the concept. Fifteen patients with first recurrence of glioblastoma will be included in the trial. All patients will receive TTFields therapy with targeted craniotomy and best physician's choice chemotherapy.
