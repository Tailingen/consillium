Dissecting the Pathways of Therapy Resistance in Early Breast Cancer
Within the 1st step MINDACT patients who have already relapsed will be asked to participate. For these patients a biopsy of the metastasis should have been taken. A molecular analysis of the stored primary tumor sample and of the metastatic sample, using new technologies, will be performed, and the characteristics of both samples will be compared.

Within the 2nd step a prospective collection of the metastasis samples will be implemented and analysis of biological material from relapsing MINDACT patients is foreseen.

This process will provide insights on the biology of breast cancer and allow us to better understand mechanisms of resistance to therapies, contributing to overcoming this important problem.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: collection of the biopsy, blood samples
Number of enrolled patients per year with adequate clinicopathologically annotated biological material and clinical data., Collection of tissue from the first site of relapse or new primary breast cancer, and blood samples for patients still alive that have relapsed (retrospective collection) or will relapse (prospective collection), 2 years after FPI|Disease progression, Characterization of disease progression using molecular characterization of tumour and germline molecular markers in tissue and blood., 2 years after FPI|Treatment resistance, Treatment resistance studies aiming to verify if a given mechanism is responsible for the relapse after exposure to anticancer agents will be performed using molecular characterization of tumour and germline molecular markers in tissue and blood.., 2 years after FPI
