GEN1046 Safety and PK in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of acasunlimab (also known as GEN1046) administered as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in Japanese study participants with malignant solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Acasunlimab|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants with Dose limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Determine the DLT profile of acasunlimab administered as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. The DLTs will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) criteria version 5.0., During first cycle (Cycle length=21 days) in each cohort|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product., From first dose date up to end of the safety follow up period, 90 days after last dose|Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of Acasunlimab, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints of each cycle (Cycle length=21 days)|Maximum (Peak) Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Acasunlimab, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints of each cycle (Cycle length=21 days)|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of Acasunlimab, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints of each cycle (Cycle length=21 days)|Plasma Trough (Pre-dose) Concentrations (Cthrough) of Acasunlimab, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints of each cycle (Cycle length=21 days)|Elimination half-life (t 1/2) of Acasunlimab, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints of each cycle (Cycle length=21 days)
Number of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) to Acasunlimab, Serum samples will be screened for ADAs to acasunlimab and the titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported., Up to 2 years
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of acasunlimab (also known as GEN1046) administered as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in Japanese study participants with malignant solid tumors.
