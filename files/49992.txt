Study of TAC-101 as Second Line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Received Sorafenib as First Line Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine whether TAC-101 as a second line therapy for participants who received Sorafenib as first line therapy is effective in slowing tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The study is also looking at the safety of TAC-101 following treatment with Sorafenib.

A serious AE (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. TEAEs were defined as AEs (both serious/non-serious) that occur from the initiation of any study medication administration, and do not necessarily have a causal relationship to the use of the study medication., From Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose (maximum duration: up to 7.2 months for Placebo and up to 7.9 months for TAC-101)|Change From Baseline in Plasma Levels of the Tumor Marker Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP is a tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and elevations in AFP values could precede clinical deterioration and tumor recurrence in participants. Baseline was defined as the last value obtained within 72 hours prior to study treatment administration on Cycle 1 Day 1., From the date of randomization to date of tumor disease progression or up to 1 year post last participant was randomized, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: up to 21.3 months)|Percent Change From Baseline in Plasma Levels of the Tumor Marker Alpha Fetoprotein-L3 (AFP-L3), AFP-L3 is a tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and elevations in AFP-L3 values could precede clinical deterioration and tumor recurrence in participants.

The 24-hour sample was collected prior to dosing on Day 2., Cycle 1-day 1: 4, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of study drug|Overall Exposure-response Analysis: Area Under Curve (AUC0-inf) of TAC-101, AUC(0-inf): Area under the curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity. PK blood samples were collected at 4 hours (± 1 hour), 8 hours (± 1 hour), and 24 hours (± 1 hour) post-dose on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. The 24-hour sample was collected prior to dosing on Day 2., Cycle 1-day 1: 4, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of study drug|Changes From Baseline in Plasma Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 (IGF-2), RAR related factors are markers for disease progression in hepatocellular carcinoma participants. In hepatocellular carcinoma participants, IGF-2 is a characteristic biomarkers and its levels are higher in responder cells. The detection of IGF-2 levels showed the efficacy of TAC-101 in IGF-2 influenced malignancy., From Baseline up to end of study treatment or up to tumor disease progression or up to death or up to 1 year post last participant was randomized, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: up to 21.3 months)|Changes From Baseline in Plasma Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFβ2), TGF-β is responsible for tissue regeneration, cell differentiation, embryonic development, and regulation of the immune system. TGF-β2 levels are higher in non-responder cells hence helps in detection of such cells., From Baseline up to end of study treatment or up to tumor disease progression or up to death or up to 1 year post last participant was randomized, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: up to 21.3 months)|Changes From Baseline in Plasma Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3), IGFBP-3 acts as a mediator of antiproliferative signals in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation is associated with upregulation of IGFBP-3. Retinoic acid response element (RARE) exists on the promoter region of the IGFBP-3., From Baseline up to end of study treatment or up to tumor disease progression or up to death or up to 1 year post last participant was randomized, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: up to 21.3 months)|Changes From Baseline in Plasma Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-6 (IGFBP-6), IGFBP-6 has an IGF-2 binding specificity and inhibits growth of a number of IGF-2-dependent cancers.

Tumor imaging was done at Baseline any time within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 and every 6 weeks (±1 week) during treatment, regardless of a dose delay. If participant discontinued study treatment for a reason other than disease progression (PD), data collected every 6 weeks until PD and following PD, data collected optionally every 6 weeks until death or up to 1 year after the last participant was randomized., From the date of treatment discontinuation to date of tumor disease progression or death or up to 1 year post last participant was randomized, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: up to 21.3 months)|Relationship Between Tumor Gene Expression of Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Ratio of Co-activators, Co-repressors and Efficacy Parameters, The assessment of correlative factors was to be conducted on tissue removed prior to the study, if available. Tumor tissue assessments included investigation of the relationship between tumor gene mRNA expression of co-activators and co-repressors and efficacy parameters., At Baseline (prior to treatment after consenting informed consent form [ICF]) up to last dose of study treatment, assessed every 6 weeks (maximum duration: up to 21.3 months)
Advanced metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not treatable by surgical approaches or locoregional therapies such as hepatic artery hemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) which are effective in controlling localized tumors. Currently marketed systemic chemotherapy agents, with the exception of sorafenib, provide marginal benefit. Despite the demonstrated survival benefit from sorafenib, it is still imperative to improve to the effectiveness of systemic therapy in this patient population. Studies of TAC-101, a synthetic retinoid, indicate that although TAC-101 may not induce tumor regression, it appears to have a stabilizing effect, prolonging survival over what was expected historically. This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAC 101 as second line treatment in patients with advanced HCC following treatment with sorafenib as first-line therapy. Sorafenib has recently been approved as first line treatment for HCC in the EU and the US and is expected to become the standard of care for the first-line treatment of advanced HCC. Aside from best supportive care, there is no second line therapy available for HCC. It is hypothesized that TAC 101 treatment can extend Overall Survival (OS) after discontinuation of sorafenib.
