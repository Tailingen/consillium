Efficacy Study of Intra-hepatic Administration of Therasphere速 in Association With Intravenous Chemotherapy to Treat Cholangiocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and tolerance of intra-hepatic administration of Yttrium 90-labelled microsphere (Theraspheres速, Nordion) in association with intravenous chemotherapy with Gemcitabin and Cisplatin for the treatment of intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma
RADIATION: Therasphere速 in association with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin
