Chemotherapy Plus Gefitinib for Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma and Sensitive EGFR Mutations: a Randomized Controlled Trial
The purpose of this study is to compare chemotherapy and gefitinib in combination with gefitinib alone as first-line therapy for adenocarcinoma, in terms of efficacy and safety.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Pemetrexed plus carboplatin combined with gefitinib|DRUG: Gefitinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), 16 months
overall survival (OS), 32 months|Objective response rate (ORR), 6 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 6 months
The primary endpoints is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of pemetrexed plus carboplatin combined with gefitinib to gefitinib alone as first-line therapy for lung adenocarcinoma.

In addition, the overall survival and safety index will be collected for analyses.
