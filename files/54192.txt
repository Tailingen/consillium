68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Patients With Various Types of Cancer
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions, efficacy assessment and recurrence monitoring in various types of cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Positron-Emission Tomography
DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11
Standardized uptake value (SUV), Standardized uptake value (SUV) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 for each target lesion of subject or suspected primary tumor or/and metastasis., 30 days
Diagnostic efficacy, The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were calculated., 30 days
Subjects with various types of cancer underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were calculated.
