Validation of a New Prognostic Score for Adult Patients With RAS Wild-type mCRC Treated With Vectibix® and FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in First Line (VALIDATE)
A safety and efficacy study of first line therapy with Vectibix® in combination with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX to validate a prognostic score in adult patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in a real world setting (VALIDATE)
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|RAS Wild-type
DRUG: Panitumumab
Overall Survival (OS) of pre-defined risk groups low vs. high, OS is defined as time from start of first line therapy to the date of death. For patients without date of start of first line therapy, date of informed consent will be the relevant date., From date of start of first line therapy to date of death due to any cause (assessed up to 84 months)

Patient-reported general and health-related quality of life ('VALIDATE PRO'), Quality of life will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Colorectal Modul QLQ-CR29 patient questionnaires during first line treatment and correlated with outcome., From date of start of first line therapy to date of progression or death due to any cause (assessed up to 84 months)|Adverse Drug Reactions, Adverse Drug Reactions of Panitumumab, From start of first line therapy until 30 days after the end of treatment with panitumumab (assessed up to 84 months)
This is a non-interventional, prospective, open-label, single-arm, 3-cohort, multicenter study in Germany and Austria. In total, 606 patients will be enrolled in approx. 120 oncological sites (office-based medical oncologists, oncology outpatient-centers, and university hospitals) in a time period of 48 months. Of these, 202 patients with high risk, 202 patients with intermediate risk, and 202 patients with low risk, as a priori assessed by the metastatic colorectal cancer prognostic score (mCCS), will be included. Overall survival of the pre-defined prognostic groups will be analyzed as primary endpoint to validate the mCCS.

Patients have been scheduled to receive first line combination therapy with panitumumab and FOLFIRI or FOLFOX according to the current SmPC valid for Germany and Austria, respectively. Data on efficacy in terms of tumor response evaluation / survival and safety (ADRs) will be collected during first line therapy. A subset of patients participating in the 'VALIDATE-PRO' project (n=303) will be assessed for general and health-related quality of life with patient questionnaires. Biomarker status beyond RAS will be collected at baseline. The documentation of defined patient data including survival will continue until the end of the individual study participation which is latest 36 months after last patient in. The end of study will be at latest at 36 months after last patient in (LPI).
