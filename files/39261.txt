Efficacy of INCMGA00012 in Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ORPHEUS)
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INCMGA00012 in Advanced Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Penile Cancer
DRUG: Retifanlimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is the ORR. The ORR is defined as the number of patients with CR and PR divided by the number of patients in the analysis set. Tumor response will be defined as best response based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v.1.1., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months
Efficacy Determined by Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the number of patients with CR, partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) (for at least 12 weeks) divided by the number of patients in the analysis set., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months|Efficacy Determined by Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment until the first documented PD based on RECIST v1.1. or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v1.1., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months|Efficacy Determined by 6-months PFS, 6-months PFS rate is defined as the proportion of patients who are alive and progression-free at 6 months from the date of first dose of study treatment based on iRECIST criteria., Baseline up to 6 months|Efficacy Determined by Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause, based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v1.1., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months|Efficacy Determined by Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment until death by any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months|Efficacy Determined by Maximum Tumor Shrinkage, Maximum tumor shrinkage is defined as the percentage of tumor shrinkage from baseline (obtained from the sum of largest diameters of the target lesions), based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v1.1., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months|Safety Adverse Events (AEs), Number of patients with treatment-related AEs (Grade 3 and 4 AEs and serious adverse events \[SAEs\]) by using the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0., From baseline until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 10.3 months
Men age ≥ 18 years with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PSqCC stage 4 (i.e. T4 or N3 or M1) that are presenting with radiologic progression of disease (PD) following or not standard treatment with chemotherapy.

After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will receive INCMGA00012 500 mg by intravenous infusion on Day1 of each cycle, once every four weeks for up to 2 years.

Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.

Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every 3 months (± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product until the end of study (EoS).
