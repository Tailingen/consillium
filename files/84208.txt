by Cushing QoL at Individual Level, The Cushing's Disease Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (Cushing QoL) (version 1.0) was developed to evaluate quality of life in patients with Cushing's syndrome (Webb et al 2008). The Cushing QoL is comprised of 12 items that capture patient responses on seven concepts: daily activities, healing and pain, mood and self-confidence, social concerns, physical appearance, memory and concern about the future. Each questionnaire of the Cushing QOL has a scale of 1-5 where '1' corresponding to 'Always' or 'Very much' and '5' to 'Never' or 'Not at all'. The lower the score, the greater the impact on HRQoL. The score is the sum of all the item response and can range from 12 (worst) to 60 points (best)., Baseline, Week 12 (day 85), Week 24 (day 169) and Week 48 (day 337)|Total Scores in Patient-Reported Outcomes Health-related Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-ll) Depression Score at Individual Level, The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) is a patient reported instrument that consists of 21 items designed to assess the intensity of depression in clinical \& normal patients in the preceding two weeks. Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a particular symptom of depression. Each of 21 items corresponds to a symptom of depression and the sum of total score will be calculated where each item has a four-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, leading to a total score from zero to 63., Baseline, Week 12 (day 85), Week 24 (day 169) and Week 48 (day 337)|Plasma Concentrations of Osilodrostat (LCI699) at Week 0, Osilodrostat plasma concentration data at each time-point were summarized by incident dose.

This was a Phase II, single arm, open-label, dose titration, multi-center study which consisted of two distinct Study Periods plus an optional extension period in non-CD patients with CS. The 3 Study Periods (two distinct Study Periods plus an optional extension period) were as follows:

Study Period I \[Week 0 (Day 1) to Week-12\]: Study Period I was the dose titration period to achieve a stable therapeutic dose and to assess the efficacy and safety of osilodrostat.

The dosing regimen of osilodrostat in this study was titrated according to the following escalation sequence: osilodrostat 2 mg bid, 5 mg bid, 10 mg bid, 20 mg bid, and 30 mg bid. Dose adjustments were based on the serum cortisol values measured by the local lab at each site. Osilodrostat titration was done weekly for the initial 4-weeks, up to a maximum dose of 10 mg bid.

The mean of three 24-hour UFC (mUFC) values were measured to evaluate the efficacy in this period.

Study Period II (After Week-12 to Week-48): Study Period II was the period to assess the sustainability of efficacy and long term safety.

During Study Period II, only patients who tolerated and agreed to continue osilodrostat treatment continued on the study. The patient was administered with the stable therapeutic dose which was achieved in the Study Period I.

Optional extension period (After Week-48): Patients who continued to receive clinical benefit, as assessed by the study Investigator and who wished to enter the extension period were reconsented at Week-48. Patients who entered the extension period continued to be treated with the study drug without interruption to be assessed for efficacy and safety. Patients who continued to benefit from study treatment as assessed by the study investigator and who completed Week-72 were offered to participate in a separate long-term safety follow-up study. The optional extension period ended after all patients had completed Week-72 or had discontinued early.

Post-treatment Follow-up: All patients had 30 days safety follow-up after the last dose of study treatment.
