Assess Efficacy & Safety of Selumetinib in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients Receiving 2nd Line Treatment for v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) Positive NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of selumetinib in combination with docetaxel (75mg/m2) vs placebo in combination with docetaxel (75mg/m2) in patients with locally advance or metastatic NSCLCs that harbor mutations of KRAS. This study will also assess the PK, safety, patient reported outcomes (PRO) and tolerability profile of the selumetinib/docetaxel combination, compared to placebo in combination with docetaxel
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIb - IV
DRUG: Selumetinib|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Pegylated G-CSF
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (RECIST 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), Measured at baseline until the date of first documented objective disease progression. Estimated final completion : approximately 3 years after first subject in (FSI)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause., Measured at baseline until date of death due to any cause. Estimated final completion : approximately 3.5 years after FSI|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number (%) of subjects with at least one overall visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: CR - disappearance of all target lesions; PR - \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesion. (Non-target lesion and new lesion results are also taken into account for the overall visit result), Measured at baseline until the date of first documented objective disease progression. Estimated final completion : approximately 3 years after first subject in (FSI)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of objective disease progression (RECIST 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), Measured at baseline until the date of first documented objective disease progression. Estimated final completion : approximately 3 years after first subject in (FSI)|Symptom Improvement Rate Using Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), The symptom improvement rate will be defined as the number (%) of patients with two consecutive assessments at least 18 days apart (ie 21 days allowing a visit window of 3 days) which showed a clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms from baseline (defined as a decrease in the ASBI from baseline ≥10). LCSS-Lung Cancer Symptom Scale; ASBI-Average symptom burden index., Measured from date of randomisation until 30 days post treatment discontinuation or 30 days post progression (if study treatment is discontinued before progression). Estimated final completion : approximately 3 years after first subject in (FSI)|Time to Symptom Progression Using Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), Time to symptom progression will be defined as the time from randomization until the date of first clinically meaningful symptom deterioration (defined as an increase in the ASBI from baseline ≥10), or death (by any cause). LCSS-Lung Cancer Symptom Scale; ASBI-Average symptom burden index., Measured from date of randomisation until 30 days post treatment discontinuation or 30 days post progression (if study treatment is discontinued before progression). Estimated final completion : approximately 3 years after first subject in (FSI)
A Phase III, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) (Hyd-Sulfate) in Combination with Docetaxel, in Patients receiving second line treatment for KRAS Mutation-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage IIIB - IV) (SELECT-1)
