Study of Oral cMET Inhibitor INC280 in Chinese Patients With EGFR Wild-type Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
A phase II study to evaluate antitumor activity of oral cMET inhibitor INC280 in adult Chinese patients with EGFR wild-type, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received one or two prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease as measured by overall response rate (ORR). The study will also evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of INC280.
