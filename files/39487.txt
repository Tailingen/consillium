Safety and Efficacy of XmAb18087 ± Pembrolizumab in Advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma or Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2, multiple-dose study designed to describe safety and efficacy, and to assess PK and immunogenicity of XmAb18087 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with metastatic Merkel cell (MCC) or locoregional MCC that has recurred after locoregional therapy with surgery and/or radiation therapy, and mAb18087 monotherapy in participants with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has progressed after standard therapies.

This study was terminated by the sponsor. No participants enrolled in Part B.

Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant treated with study drug. The TEAE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. TEAEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of preexisting conditions. A summary of all Serious Adverse Events and Other Adverse Events (nonserious) regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported Adverse Events' Section.", Day 1 (after dosing) up to end of study (up to 163 days)|Overall Response Rate as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Up to end of study (up to 163 days)|Complete and Partial Response Rate as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Up to end of study (up to 163 days)
