Anlotinib Hydrochloride Combined With EGFR TKIs in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
After the second-line treatment of patients with non-T790M mutations, chemotherapy with platinum-containing drugs was used, and chemotherapy-related toxicity was high. Studies have shown that bevacizumab combined with EGFR TKI have a good trend of benefit. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride combined with first-generation EGFR TKIs as second-line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer . The patients with IV non-small lung cancer have acquired resistance to prior first-generation EGFR TKIs and have non-T790M mutation.
