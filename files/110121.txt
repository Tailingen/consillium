Selective TrkA Inhibitor VMD-928 to Treat TrkA Overexpression Driven Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of orally administered VMD-928 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma that have progressed or are non responsive to available therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists

This is an open-label, Phase I, FTIH, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and cohort expansion multi-center study conducted in three parts to identify a safe and pharmacologically active dose and regimen for VMD-928 monotherapy, which can be implemented in Phase 2 studies (the RP2D). The regimen will be identified using an adaptive design, multiple-ascending dose study in cancer patients. To conserve patients in the lower dose cohorts, dose escalation will begin with an accelerated titration scheme. A second part of the study will assess antitumor activity at the RP2D. The third part of the study will collect tumor samples before and after treatment to assess biological activity.
