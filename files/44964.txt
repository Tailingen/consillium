Pilot Study for High Output Drainage Removal After Gastrectomy
\*Objective: The study aims to evaluate whether there is a difference in intra-abdominal complication rates between patients discharged with or without a drainage tube following gastrectomy with high postoperative drainage (≥300ml/day).

\*Study Design: This is an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving two groups. Patients will be randomly assigned to either maintain the drainage tube (control) or have it removed (experimental) before discharge. The primary endpoint is the incidence of intra-abdominal complications within one month post-surgery.

\*Participants:

The study targets 60 patients (30 per group) who meet the following criteria:

Diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and underwent curative gastrectomy (R0 resection).

Postoperative drainage of 300-500 ml/day on the 4th day after surgery. Patients with stage IV cancer, peritoneal metastasis, or postoperative complications requiring additional intervention are excluded.

\*Methods: All participants will follow standard postoperative care except for the removal or retention of the drainage tube. Follow-up will occur at 1 and 3 weeks post-discharge, with clinical examinations and imaging (if necessary) to monitor for complications such as infection or abscess. The study's total observation period will last four weeks from the surgery date.

\*Data Collection: Data will include patient demographics, surgical details, postoperative management, and the occurrence of complications. Drainage volumes will be recorded daily for those discharged with a tube, and tube removal will occur based on specific criteria.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Arm I (Drainage tube removal)
Incidence of Intra-Abdominal Complications, Complications include infections, abscesses, or any clinically significant intra-abdominal issues that require medical intervention., up to 1 month
Drain-Related Complications, The occurrence of complications related to the drainage tube in the control group, such as infection at the insertion site or mechanical issues., up to 1month|CRP Level Changes, The comparison of C-reactive protein (CRP) level changes between the intervention and control groups during the 4-week postoperative follow-up. CRP levels will be measured to assess inflammation and potential early signs of complications., up to 1month
