Vitamin D in Patients With Stage I-III Colon Cancer or Resectable Colon Cancer Liver Metastases
This study seeks to learn more about the vitamin D receptor and its relationship to colon cancer. The Vitamin D receptor is found in colon cancer cells. When Vitamin D binds to the receptor in the cancer cells, it may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally and may cause cancer cell death. Vitamin D has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that Vitamin D may help in the treatment of colon cancer.

Participants will receive either high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D. The study drug will be given 14-28 days prior to your surgery. The number of days will depend on when the surgery is scheduled.
Stage, Colon Cancer|Stage I-III Colon Cancer|Stage IV Colon Cancer With Resectable Liver Metastases
DRUG: Vitamin D3|DRUG: Placebo
VDR Binding Sites, For patients undergoing primary colon resection, the goal is to identify VDR binding sites in malignant and normal colonic tissue collected from colon cancer patients treated with high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo.

ChIP-Seq will be performed on frozen tumor tissue and adjacent normal colon tissue to determine VDR binding sites, which will be compared between the high-dose vitamin D and placebo arms, and between malignant tumor and normal colon tissue., 14 to 28 days
Changes in TME, For patients undergoing liver resection, the goal is to characterize changes in the TME of liver metastases collected from colon cancer patients treated with high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo.

Tumor microarrays will be constructed from FFPE tissue to evaluate the densities and co-localization of TILs and other immune cell types with tumor epithelial cells using custom multiplex immunofluorescence assays with supervised machine learning. A custom vitamin D-immune panel will also be used to measure nuclear VDR and cytoplasmic CYP27B1 expression at the single cell level in pan-CK+ tumor epithelial cells, numerous immune cell populations (CD3+CD4+ T helper cells, CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD68/CD163+ macrophages, CD45+ total immune cells), and pan-CK-/CD45- stromal cells., 14 to 28 days|Number of Participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, Grade of severity in accordance with the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 guideline, Baseline, 14 days to 28 days
The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary to keep track of when they take the study drug. The participant will be taking the study drug once every day, for 14 - 28 days, prior to their surgery.

* Run-In Phase: The first 6-12 participants will receive high-dose vitamin D prior to surgery. The number of participants in this phase will be based on the results of the analyzed research samples.
* Randomized Phase: Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the participant will be "randomized" into one of the study groups: high dose vitamin D or standard dose vitamin D.

  * 48 Participants will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D. Randomization means that the participants are put into a group by chance. Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group the participant will be in. The participant will have an equal chance of getting assigned to each arm (like flipping a coin). The randomized phase will enroll to two groups at the same time:

    * Group A: 24 participants with a recent diagnosis of stage I, II or III colon cancer will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D.
    * Group B: 24 participants with resectable liver metastases from colon cancer will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D.

Additional research procedures to be performed on study:

* Blood samples will be collected for research purposes (a little more than 2 teaspoons of blood). The samples will be collected immediately prior to the participant's surgery and used to study the vitamin D receptor and pathway, as well as its relationship to colon cancer. Some of this blood will be stored to be used for future cancer research.
* Tumor tissue will be collected for research purposes at the time of the participant surgery. This tissue will also be used to study the vitamin D receptor and pathway, as well as its relationship to colon cancer. Some of the tumor tissue collected will be sent for use in a separate, but related study. In this study, the participant's tumor will be used to grow cell lines. This means the participant's tumor cells will be multiplied in the lab. These cell lines will be used to study the binding sites in the genes of participants and learn more about vitamin D's role in preventing colon cancer.
