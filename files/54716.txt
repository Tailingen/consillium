To Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of AMG 386 When Used in Combination With AMG 706, Bevacizumab, Sorafenib, or Sunitinib.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AMG 386 when used in combination with AMG 706, bevacizumab, sorafenib, or sunitinib and that at least one dose level from each combination will be safe and well tolerated.

AMG 386 is a man-made medication that is designed to stop the development of blood vessels in cancer tissues. Cancer tissues rely on the development of new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis, to obtain a supply of oxygen and nutrients to grow.
