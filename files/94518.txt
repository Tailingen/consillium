To evaluate cosmetic outcomes after conservative surgery for breast cancer with INTRABEAM followed by hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Intraoperative Radiotherapy (IORT)|PROCEDURE: Breast conservative surgery|RADIATION: External Beam Hypofractionated Radiotherapy (EBRT)
Changes in Cosmetic results - BCCT, It will be measured by the BCCT.core software programme. This software uses 4 photographies of the breast for each timepoint and evaluates cosmetic outcome based upon symmetry, skin colour changes and surgical scar appearance. The lower the calculated score, the better the cosmetic outcome (1=excellent, 2=good, 3=fair, 4=poor), Baseline and every 12 months until 60 months|Changes in Cosmetic results - Self Evaluation using YBT, Questionnaire for cosmetic self-evaluation from the Young Boost Trial (YBT) that consists s of 8 questions about various aspects (size, shape, skin colour, massiveness of the breast, nipple position, general appearance, visibility of the surgical scar, and overall satisfaction) to evaluate the degree of satisfaction of the patients themselves about the cosmetic results., Baseline and every 12 months until 60 months
Changes in Quality of life (QOL) - General, It will be measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires QLQ-C30, Baseline and every 12 months until 60 months|Toxicity (acute and late), Defined according to the NCI criteria published in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, Baseline and every 12 months until 60 months|Local control, Defined as histologically-confirmed evidence of tumour recurrence in the ipsilateral breast, Baseline and every 3 months after completion of EBRT and thereafter every 6 months for 5 years|Changes in Quality of life (QOL) - Breast, It will be measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires QLQ-BR23, Baseline and every 12 months until 60 months
To evaluate cosmetic outcomes following conservative surgery (with or without oncoplastic surgery) for breast cancer with intraoperative radiotherapy (INTRABEAM) followed by hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy
