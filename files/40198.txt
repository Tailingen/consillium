Pilot Study to Evaluate 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography /Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in Prediction of Early Response to Chemotherapy in Ovarian Cancer.
We hypothesize that 18FDG Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) imaging, carried out after the first cycle of chemotherapy, will identify responders, thus permitting early termination of potential toxic therapy in non- responders leading to a significant decrease in morbidity and cost. The value of PET imaging as an early predictor of response to chemotherapy has been shown in other cancers.
Ovarian Cancer
PROCEDURE: 1: FDG PET
Partial metabolic response (PMR) - A reduction of a minimum of 15-25% in tumour 18FDG SUV after one cycle of chemotherapy, and greater than 25% after more than one treatment cycle., Conclusion of the study|Partial metabolic response (PMR) - A reduction of a minimum of 15-25% in tumour 18FDG SUV after one cycle of chemotherapy, and greater than 25% after more than one treatment cycle., Completion of study|Complete metabolic response (CMR) - Complete resolution of 18FDG uptake within the tumour volume so that it was indistinguishable from surrounding normal tissue., completion of study|Progressive metabolic disease- increase in 18FDG tumour SUV of greater than 25% within tumour region defined on the baseline scan, visible increase in the extent of 18FDG tumour uptake (>20% in the longest dimension)., completion of study|Stable metabolic disease (SMD) -An increase in tumour 18FDG SUV of less than 25% or a decrease of less than 15% and no visible increase in extent of 18FDG uptake in tumor (>20% in the longest dimension)., completion of study
