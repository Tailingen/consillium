Subjects who commence treatment with another anticancer agent will be censored at the day before the other anticancer treatment starts., Up to 2 years from the last treatment of the last subject|Change of Tumor markers/Bio-markers, tumor markers/biomarkers, including α-fetoprotein (AFP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), Baseline, the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), 2 months(C2D1), 3 months(C3D1), 4 months(C4D1), 5 months(C5D1), 6 months(C6D1) and/or Early termination (before 6 months)|AEs, Serious/ Adverse Events, From ICF singed to 30 days after EOT|Vital signs, evaluate at every administration and the end of treatment, Baseline, first treatment(C1D1), 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 weeks from the first treatment and/or Early termination (up to 24 weeks)|Resting 12-lead ECGs, 12-Lead ECGs, Baseline, the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), 2 months(C2D1), 3 months(C3D1), 4 months(C4D1), 5 months(C5D1), 6 months(C6D1) and/or Early termination (before 6 months)|Hematology, evaluate at every administration and the end of treatment, Baseline, first treatment(C1D1), 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 weeks from the first treatment and/or Early termination (up to 24 weeks)|Clinical chemistry, evaluate at every administration and the end of treatment, Baseline, first treatment(C1D1), 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 weeks from the first treatment and/or Early termination (up to 24 weeks)|Urinalysis data, Urinalysis Lab Values, The first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), 2 months(C2D1), 3 months(C3D1), 4 months(C4D1), 5 months(C5D1), 6 months(C6D1) and/or Early termination (before 6 months)|PK parameters, including AUC, Cmax and Tmax of S,S-TLC388, S,R-TLC388, metabolites TLC-U1, TLC-U2, and topotecan, PK parameters, 0, 15, 29, 33, 40, 50 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8 hour after the start of infusion of the 1st treatment and 1 week (2nd treatment); 0, 29 minutes and 4 hour after the start of infusion of the 3, 5, 6 and 7 weeks (the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th treatment)
A Phase II, open-label, single-arm, two-stage, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lipotecan® monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and had failed sorafenib treatment due to sorafenib intolerance or radiographic progressive disease (PD).

Eligible patients received 40 mg/m2 of Lipotecan®, given as a 30-minute (+3 minutes) intravenous infusion, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle for maximum 6 cycles. Inter-cycle and intra-cycle dose delays were allowed within 21 days of the scheduled date to be reduced to 35 mg/m2 and further to 30 mg/m2 if a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) met the criteria for dose reduction.

Tumor response was assessed every 2 cycles until Cycle 6, or at the early termination according to RECIST Version 1.1 judged by site investigator. The favorable response of CR, PR or SD would be confirmed within 28-35 days. Safety evaluations were conducted on a weekly basis from the day study treatment administered throughout each cycle.
