Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy Plus Palbociclib in Operable, Hormone Sensitive and HER2-Negative Primary Breast Cancer
The study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial with the primary objective of demonstrating the efficacy of palbociclib in combination with Endocrine therapy over Endocrine therapy alone measured by PEPI and EndoPredict™ EPclin Score in women with operable HR+, HER2 negative breast cancer . The Clinical Response Rate, drop in Ki67 index ≤ 2.7% and Breast conserving rate will be compared between two arms.

Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI Score), The PEPI score is derived from four factors assigned a numerical score following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, ( including Ki67 expression in the surgical specimen, pathologic tumor size, lymph node status, and estrogen receptor (ER) level).

The PEPI score is the sum of each component score and shows the risk points for relapse-free survival. PEPI=0 means low risk. PEPI= 1 to 3 means intermediate risk .

PEPI more than 4 means high risk., 4 months|EndoPredict™ EPclin Score, EndoPredict is a multigene test used to predict the risk of distant recurrence of early stage, ER positive ,HER-2 Negative invasive breast cancer. EndoPredict Clinical Score (EP clin ) categorizes patinets into low and high risk groups.Combination of the 12-Gene Molecular Score, tumor stage and lymph node status, generating an EPclin Risk Score.The EPclin Risk Score is calculated, according to the model, as:

EPclin Risk Score = (0.35 \* tumor size) + (0.64 \* lymph node status) + (0.28 \* 12-Gene Molecular Score) EPclin Risk Scores from 1.0 through 3.3 shows low risk of recurrencein 10 years.EPclin Risk Scores from 3.4 through 6.0 shows high risk of recurrence in 10 years., 4 months
