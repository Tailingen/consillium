Tissue Bank of Biological Specimens From Patients With Gynecologic Disease
The purpose of this study is to create a tissue bank of gynecologic cancers and normal tissue for the study of cancer in order to better understand the changes occurring on a molecular level (DNA, RNA, protein) that lead to the development of cancer.

Cancer arises due to genetic alterations that disrupt numerous cellular functions including proliferation, programmed cell death and senescence, that ultimately control the number of cells in a population. The genetic damage that underlies the development of cancers has a diverse etiology and loss of DNA repair mechanisms also may play a role in allowing mutations to accumulate. Cancers are also characterized by the ability to invade surrounding tissues and to metastasize. Many of the molecular alterations involved in this process have yet to be elucidated.

Gynecologic cancers afflict women of all ages. Cervical cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide, accounting for over 400,000 cases annually. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy with approximately 33,000 new cases being diagnosed annually in American women. Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer related mortality in American women, with approximately 14,000 deaths occurring from it in 2000.

The creation of a tissue repository containing tissue specimens, blood/serum, and molecular extracts (DNA, RNA, protein) will provide a rich source of tissue for future gynecological disease research studies.
