A Study of the Safety and Pharmacology Of PI3-Kinase Inhibitor GDC-0941 In Combination With Either Paclitaxel And Carboplatin (With or Without Bevacizumab) or Pemetrexed, Cisplatin, And Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral (PO) GDC-0941 administered with one of three planned regimens: Arm A: paclitaxel and carboplatin in bevacizumab-ineligible NSCLC patients, Arm B: paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in bevacizumab-eligible NSCLC patients and Arm C: pemetrexed, cisplatin, and bevacizumab in bevacizumab-eligible, non-squamous NSCLC patients.
