Circulating Tumor Cells as a Biomarker for Preoperative Prognostic Staging in Patients With Esophageal Cancer
Despite the availability of several preoperative diagnostic techniques, accurate pretreatment staging of esophageal cancer (EC) remains challenging. Therefore, The investigators evaluated the prognostic significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with EC.
