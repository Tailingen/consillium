The Conversion Therapy of Chemotherapy Plus Camrelizumab in Metastatic Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract. Gastric cancer patients diagnosed for the first time in China have a higher proportion of advanced stages and a higher postoperative metastasis rate.Studies have shown that patients with good pathological response after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (such as tumor regression grade, TRG0 or 1) have a better prognosis.The purpose of this study is to treat patients with advanced gastric cancer who are difficult to perform R0 surgery with chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. At the same time as the primary cancerous lesions are reduced, the distant metastatic lesions are effectively controlled in order to perform R0 surgery and to improve the survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer.
