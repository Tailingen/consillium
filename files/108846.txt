An Individualised Treatment vs. a Minimal Program in Women With Late-term Shoulder Impairments After Breast Cancer.
In breast cancer patients late-term upper limb sequelae, such as shoulder pain and impaired shoulder function remain common after primary breast cancer surgery. The aim of this trial is to evaluate whether an expert assessment of shoulder impairments, followed by an individualised treatment plan, is superior to a minimal physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program in reducing shoulder symptoms, assessed 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, among women with late-term shoulder impairments after primary breast cancer surgery.

Change in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) from baseline to 12 weeks after initiating the treatment., SPADI is a 13-item patient-reported outcome measure to assess shoulder pain (5 items) and shoulder function (8 items) within the last week. The items are scored on a numeric rating scale that ranges from 0 (no pain/no difficulty) to 10 (worst pain/so difficult that required help). Each domain score is equally weighted and added to a total percentage score that ranges from 0 (best) to 100 (worst). The higher the score, patients reported shoulder impairments. The region specific questionnaire can be used in patients with different or unspecified shoulder diagnoses. SPADI is valid, reliable and responsible measure among patients with shoulder impairments., 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks

The 5-item pain subscale are scored on a numeric rating scale that ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). The higher the score, patients report greater shoulder pain and reduction in the SPADI pain score will suggest improvement., 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks|Change in SPADI function from baseline to 12 weeks after initiating the treatment., Change in SPADI function will be reported as a separate subscale.

Worldwide, breast cancer is the second most common cancer. Internationally, an age-standardised incidence rate between 83.1 and 111.9 per 100.000 women is seen, with Denmark taking an unfortunate second place. Standard surgical treatment in Denmark is breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy in combination with sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In part due to early diagnosis and optimised treatment methods, 5-year survival has improved to a current 87%. Despite fewer mastectomies and more BCS, less invasive surgical procedures of the axilla (e.g. fewer ALND vs. SLND), and more refined radiotherapy procedures, late-term upper limb impairment still remains common. The most frequent are lymphoedema, sensory disturbances, pain and impaired shoulder function, with up to 70% of patients reporting at least one of these symptoms three years after surgery. These impairments lead to difficulties in activities of daily living, increased risk of depression and anxiety and decreased quality of life (QoL).

Previous research has primarily focused on prevention and treatment of lymphedema, and less on other upper limb impairments. Pre- and early postoperative physiotherapeutic interventions are known to be effective in reducing shoulder pain and improving shoulder function after breast cancer treatment. Nonetheless, late-term upper limb impairments need further focus with prevalenceÂ´s of up to 50% is reported for impaired shoulder function and pain up to 6 years after surgery, and a substantial knowledge gap exists as to how to help these women. Currently, no standardised evaluation of their impairments or treatment is offered, and it is therefore up to the individual woman to seek care, resulting in large variations in rehabilitation. Thus a substantial knowledge gap exists in how to meet the rehabilitation needs of these women and evaluation of the actual burden of late-term shoulder impairments after primary treatment for breast cancer and the effect of different treatment strategies is warranted.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether the effect of a patient-centred specialised intervention, consisting of an expert assessment followed by an individualised treatment plan (i.e. Intervention group), is superior to a minimal physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program delivered in a pamphlet (i.e. Control comparator group) among women with late-term shoulder impairments 3-7 years after their primary breast cancer surgery. The hypothesis is that women randomised to the Intervention Group will improve significantly more in shoulder function and pain 12 weeks after initiating the treatment than those randomised to the Control comparator group.

This trial is a stratified (by type of surgery and radiotherapy), block randomised (1:1 allocation), controlled, parallel group and assessor blinded superiority trial conducted in Denmark. 130 participants with late-term shoulder impairments 3-7 years after primary surgery for breast cancer will be recruited.
