Appendicular lean soft tissue will be adjusted for body weight., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in metabolic syndrome by Z score calculation at weeks 16 and 24., Metabolic syndrome severity Z score will be calculated using waist circumference, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose data in sex- and ethnicity-specific equations., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in cardiovascular risk based on the Framingham risk score at weeks 16 and 24., 10-year cardiovascular risk will be estimated using sex-specific Framingham risk score based on traditional risk factors. Risk is low if the score is less than 10% and high if it is 20% or higher., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in handgrip muscle strength at weeks 16 and 24., Handgrip strength will be evaluated using a hydraulic handgrip dynamometer., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in cardiorespiratory fitness by a cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at weeks 16 and 24., Peak oxygen uptake will be measured by gold standard cardiopulmonary exercise testing., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in health-related life improvement by the QLQ-C30 at weeks 16 and 24., Participants will complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30). Score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores on symptoms and single-items indicate a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in health-related life improvement by the QLQ-EN24 at weeks 16 and 24., Participants will complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire -Endometrial Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-EN24). Score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores on symptoms and single-items indicate a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in carotid intima-media thickness by ultrasound at weeks 16 and 24., Carotid intima-media thickness will be assessed by a B-mode ultrasound following a standardized protocol., Baseline, week 16, and week 24|Change from baseline in abdominal adiposity by MRI at week 24., Abdominal adipose tissue will be measure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Baseline and week 24|Change from baseline in abdominal skeletal muscle by MRI at week 24., Abdominal skeletal muscle will be measure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Baseline and week 24|Change from baseline in adipose tissue in liver by MRI at week 24., Adipose tissue in liver will be measure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Baseline and week 24|Change from baseline in adipose tissue in the thigh region by MRI at week 24., Adipose tissue in the thigh region will be measure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Baseline and week 24|Change from baseline in skeletal muscle in the thigh region by MRI at week 24., Skeletal muscle in the thigh region will be measure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Baseline and week 24|Change from baseline in cardiac function by MRI at week 24., Cardiac function will be measure using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Baseline and week 24
Background: Individuals diagnosed with endometrial cancer are at an increased risk of cardiac complications post-treatment, particularly if having overweight or a pronounced waist size. Adopting healthy habits-like nutritious eating, regular physical activity, and effective stress management-can mitigate these risks and bolster overall health. However, many cancer survivors find it challenging to consistently adhere to these health and wellness recommendations.

Objective: This study aims to determine the efficacy of a digital wellness platform, enriched with professional guidance, in facilitating healthier lifestyles for endometrial cancer survivors. This would encompass enhancements in nutrition, physical activity levels, and mindfulness practices.

Study Design:

Group 1 (Intervention Group): Participants will engage with the digital wellness platform daily for the initial 16 weeks with expert guidance. Subsequently, participants will navigate the platform independently for the next 8 weeks.

Group 2 (Control Group): Participants will initially be provided with standard publicly accessible health information. After the primary 24-week period, participants will gain access to the digital wellness platform.

Common Elements: Both groups will have access to general health information and will benefit from supportive calls. To monitor their physical activity, all participants will be equipped with an activity tracker.
