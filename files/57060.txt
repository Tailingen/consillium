Safety Study of Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b to Treat Polycythemia Vera
The purpose of this study is the identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the investigational medicinal product. Moreover the safety and tolerability will be assessed and an exploratory analysis of efficacy and biomarker modulation will be performed.
Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: PEG-P-INF alpha-2b (P1101)
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The definition of MTD is based on a 3+3 dose escalation design. MTD is defined as the next lower dose of that dose which was considered to be untolerated (observed DLT frequency at least 2 out of 3 in one cohort or at least 2 out of six patients in 2 cohorts)., The incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), which define the MTD are assessed continously until achievement of MTD.
