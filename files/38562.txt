Study of CryoSpray Ablation of Low Grade or High Grade Dysplasia Within Barrett's Esophagus
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CryoSpray Ablation System to treat esophageal low grade dysplasia (LGD) or high grade dysplasia (HGD) within Barrett's Esophagus (BE).
Barrett's Esophagus|High Grade Dysplasia|Low Grade Dysplasia
DEVICE: CryoSpray Ablation System (510(k) NO: K070893)
The eradication of LGD and HGD within BE at 24 months after the final treatment. The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of all adverse events., 2 years post treatment
1.Eradication of all BE by 24 months after the final treatment. 2.The proportion of lesions that decreased in length by the 24-month follow-up. 3.The proportion of lesions where severity was downgraded by the 24-month follow-up., 2 years post treatment
The study will consist of an estimated 200 subjects with HGD or LGD within BE who are deemed inoperable or refuse standard surgical treatment. A maximum of 20 investigational sites will participate with a maximum of ten subjects per site.
