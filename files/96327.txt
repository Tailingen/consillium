ERK 1/2 Signaling in Ibrutinib Resistant B-cell Malignancies
This research is studying the safety of combining ibrutinib with the study drug LY3214996 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Marginal Zone Lymphoma
DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: LY3214996
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Toxicities occurring following administration of protocol therapy, measured using CTCAE 5.0 criteria., 42 days
Best Response, Best response to study treatment measured using disease-specific criteria., From date of study drug initiation up to a maximum of 2 years|Time to Progression, Assess the amount of time to disease progression, From date of study drug initiation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, up to a maximum of 2 years
This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any disease.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ibrutinib as a treatment option for this disease.

LY3214996 is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor that is being developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. ERK inhibitors stop the signal that a cancer cell receives telling it to grow. In this research study, the investigators are testing to see if LY3214996 is safe when combined with ibrutinib in patients with specific gene mutations. Making treatment decisions based on genetic testing is investigational, and the FDA has not approved this genetic testing. Several doses of LY3214996 will be explored in this study.
