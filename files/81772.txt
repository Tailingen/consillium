Study to Assess the Treatment Patterns in Metastatic Castration-Resistance Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
The purpose of this study is to assess the treatment patterns in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Additionally, participant's demographic and clinical characteristics, skeletal-related events, criteria used to define CRPC, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and pain related to disease and overall survival will be observed.

Percentage of Participants Treated With Chemotherapy in First Line Therapy, Participants treated with chemotherapy in first line therapy will be reported., Day 1|Percentage of Participants Treated With Other Therapies in First Line Therapy, Participants treated with other therapies including secondary hormone therapy, steroids, radiation therapy, radionuclide therapy, bisphosphonates and best supportive care in first line therapy will be reported., Day 1|Percentage of Participants Treated With Chemotherapy in Second Line Therapy, Participants who were treated with chemotherapy in second line therapy will be reported., Day 1|Percentage of Participants Treated With Other Therapies in Second Line Therapy, Participants treated with other therapies including secondary hormone therapy, steroids, radiation therapy, radionuclide therapy, bisphosphonates and best supportive care in second line therapy will be reported., Day 1
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, ECOG performance status is a scale that measures how cancer affects the daily life of a participant on an ordinal scale from grade 0 (best) to grade 5 (worst)., Day 1|Number of Participants with Comorbidities, Participants with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac diseases, congestive cardiac failure, thyroid diseases and stroke will be reported., Day 1|Blood Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, Blood PSA levels will be reported., Day 1|Number of participants With Bone or Visceral Metastasis, Participants with bone or visceral metastasis will be reported., Day 1|Assessment of Pain Related With Disease, Pain will be assessed by reviewing the charts having information regarding pain (bone or other sites)., Day 1|Number of Participants With Gleason score, Gleason scoring is used to grade tumors. A primary grade is assigned to the most common tumor pattern (how the cancer cells look under a microscope), and a second grade to the next most common pattern. The two grades are added together to get a GS. Gleason grade range= 1-5; 5=worst prognosis. GS range=2-10; 10=worst prognosis. Improvement is defined as a decrease in GS from a Baseline score of 6 (GS\<=6; includes no cancer); worsening is defined as an increase in GS from a baseline score of 6 (GS \>6)., Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Skeletal Related Events (SREs), SREs include vertebral collapse, bone fractures, spinal cord compression, bone surgery and radiotherapy for bone complications., Day 1|Number of Participants who were used to define mCRPC Criteria, Participants with criteria used to define mCRPC as described by European Association of Urology (EAU) International Guidelines will be reported., Day 1|Percentage of Participants Who Received Therapies After Second Line, Participants who received therapies after second line will be reported., Day 1|Overall Survival, Day 1
This is an observational (study in which participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes), longitudinal (correlational research study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time) and retrospective (study looking back over past experience) study to describe the treatment patterns in mCRPC. Treatment patterns will be assessed by collecting medical charts from participants diagnosed with mCRPC in or prior 2009. Primarily, percentage of participants who received therapy as first line treatment will be assessed. All adverse events associated with the use of Sponsor drugs will be reported.
