Pilot Study of a Pharmacy Intervention for Older Adults With Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to address the challenge of medication management for older patients undergoing treatment for cancer. The sponsor of this protocol is the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center who is providing funding for this research study.

Rates of study enrollment, To determine rates of study enrollment, we will assess the proportion of eligible patients who enroll in the study., 2 years
Rates of Study Completion, To determine study completion rates, we will evaluate the proportion of patients enrolled who complete the study., 2 years|Rates of study satisfaction, To determine rates of study satisfaction, we will examine the proportion of participants who report satisfaction with the structure, timing and content of the study, using Likert-type scale responses., 2 years|Rates of Medication List Accuracy, Compare rates of medication list accuracy (defined as concordance between the medical record and the medication list the patient reports taking) between study arms at 4 weeks following enrollment., Baseline to 4 weeks|Change In The Number Of Medications, Compare change in the number of medications (defined as the number of medications a patient is prescribed) between study arms from baseline to 4 weeks following enrollment., Baseline to 4 weeks|Number Of Medications, Compare the number of medications (defined as the number of medications a patient is prescribed) between study arms at 4 weeks following enrollment., Baseline to 4 weeks|Rates of Polypharmacy, Compare rates of polypharmacy (defined as five or more medications) 4 weeks following enrollment between study arms., Baseline to 4 weeks|Change In The Number Of Potentially Inappropriate Medications, Compare change in the number of potentially inappropriate medications between study arms from baseline to 4 weeks following enrollment., Baseline to 4 weeks|Number Of Potentially Inappropriate Medications, Compare the number of potentially inappropriate medications between study arms at 4 weeks following enrollment., Baseline to 4 weeks|Rates Of Appropriate Pneumococcal Vaccinations, Compare rates of appropriate pneumococcal vaccinations (as defined by the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network \[NCCN\] guidelines) between study arms at 4 weeks., Baseline to 4 weeks|Rates Of Appropriate Pneumococcal Vaccinations, Compare rates of appropriate pneumococcal vaccinations (as defined by the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network \[NCCN\] guidelines) between study arms at 8 weeks., Baseline to 8 weeks|Rates Of Appropriate Influenza Vaccinations, Compare rates of appropriate influenza vaccinations (as defined by the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network \[NCCN\] guidelines) between study arms at 4 weeks., Baseline to 4 weeks|Rates Of Appropriate Influenza Vaccinations, Compare rates of appropriate influenza vaccinations (as defined by the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network \[NCCN\] guidelines) between study arms at 8 weeks., Baseline to 8 weeks
The goals of the proposed study are: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PRIME (Pharmacist Reconciliation to Improve Medication Management in the Elderly) to older patients with breast, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers; and (2) to estimate the effect size (i.e. the magnitude of the difference between groups) of PRIME for improving medication management (e.g. accurate medication list, less polypharmacy, fewer potentially inappropriate medications) and achieving up-to-date vaccinations.
