68Ga-PSMA PET in the Renal Cell Carcinoma
The primary research purpose is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA PET in metastatic lesions of locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma, and to compare with that of enhanced CT. The second purpose is to evaluate whether 68Ga-PSMA PET can change the treatment decision of patients with locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma

Additional diagnostic value of 68Ga PSMA PET / CT compared with CT in patients with locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma, The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared with enhanced CT in diagnosing locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma metastases in clinical practice. If the diagnostic performance of 68Ga PSMA PET / CT is better than enhanced CT, it may have additional diagnostic value in in locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma., 2 years
The changes of treatment decision-making in patients with locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma by 68Ga PSMA PET / CT., The impact of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on clinical decisions in patients with locally advanced (Stage III) and advanced renal cell carcinoma (Stage IV) were evaluated by a multidisciplinary prostate cancer therapy team. The clinical decisions were made according to the EAU and NCCN guidelines. The patients with locally advanced (Stage III) has no metastases and advanced renal cell carcinoma (Stage IV) may have oligometastatic disease or metastatic disease. For the patients with locally advanced renal cell carcinoma (Stage III), radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy is appropriate. For the patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (Stage IV), the patients with potentially surgically resectable RCC can receive surgery and the patients with unresectable RCC need to receive systemic therapy and rediotherapy. The different staging performance of enhanced CT and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may have impact on patients with locally advanced and advanced renal cell carcinoma., 2 years
