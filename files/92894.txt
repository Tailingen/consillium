Comparison of Whole Breast Screening Ultrasound and Contrast Enhanced Mammography for Supplemental Breast Cancer Screening
Breast tumors are often detected on mammography but may be harder to see in women with dense breasts. This is why screening breast ultrasound is sometimes used as another test in women with dense breasts. Ultrasound has been shown to detect additional cancers that are not seen on regular mammography.

Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is a FDA approved form of mammography. It is essentially a routine digital mammogram performed after iodine dye (the same that is used with CT scans) is injected into a vein in the arm. Like screening ultrasound, CEDM has been shown to detect breast cancers that are not seen on a regular mammogram. The purpose of this study is to compare whether CEDM or screening breast ultrasound is better at detecting cancer. Both will be done in this study and compared to one another.
Breast Cancer Screening
DEVICE: contrast enhanced digital mammography (CEDM)|DEVICE: whole breast screening ultrasound (WBUS)
The number of cancers and false positive findings identified on a CEDM and WBUS as a measure of sensitivity and specificity., With respect to imaging, a positive test is defined by a recommendation for biopsy (BIRADS 4 or 5). Negative imaging tests are those with BIRADS 1-3. The number of recommendations for short term follow up (BI-RADS 3) will also be recorded., 1 year
