Pioglitazone vs. Insulin Glargine in the Treatment of Secondary Drug Failure in Type 2 Diabetes
Pioglitazone and insulin glargine are equally effective in achieving glycemic control in secondary drug failure of type 2 diabetes but the mechanisms of actions are different.
Type 2 Diabetes|Secondary Drug Failure
DRUG: pioglitazone|DRUG: insulin glargine
Effect of pioglitazone vs. insulin glargine on beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity, 26 weeks
Effect of pioglitazone vs. insulin glargine on BNP, 26 weeks
The present study was undertaken to assess differences in how insulin glargine vs. pioglitazone affect:

* Beta-cell function as measured by proinsulin/insulin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin secretion (HOMA Î²-cell) and glucagon stimulated C-peptide test
* Insulin sensitivity as measured by adiponectin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin tolerance test and
* Surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease as measured by BNP, NT-pro BNP and plasma lipid profile as add-on therapy in patients with T2D and secondary drug failure. The patients' satisfaction with each treatment was also surveyed.
