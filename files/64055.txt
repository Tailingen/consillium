Standard Follow-Up Program (SFP) for Patients With Esophageal Cancer
Motive:

In order to improve the treatment technique, a comprehensive follow-up program is needed to obtain all relevant patient, treatment and toxicity data from esophageal cancer patients.

Goal:

To set-up and maintain a database containing treatment results in terms of tumor control, side effects, complications and patient-reported quality of life.

A standard database of patients receiving photon treatment will be created. These data are then linked to dose-volume data of radiotherapy, with the aim to build prediction models for both tumor control and toxicity after radio (chemo) therapy that can later be used for selecting patients for proton treatment.
Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Acute toxicity, Highest during and within 2 weeks after last day of radiation therapy|Late toxicity, Highest within one year after last day of radiation therapy
Overall survival, At 1,2,3,4 and 5 years after first day of radiation therapy|Loco-regional tumor control, At 1,2,3,4 and 5 years after first day of radiation therapy
Patient-rated symptoms and Quality-of-Life, Before first day of radiation therapy and at 3,6,12,24,36,48,60 months after first day of radiation therapy
