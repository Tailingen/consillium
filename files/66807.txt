Magnetic Resonance Whole Body Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Finding Bone or Lymph Node Metastasis in Participants With High-Risk Prostate Cancer
This trial studies how well magnetic resonance whole body diffusion-weighted imaging works in finding cancer that has spread to the bone or lymph nodes (metastasis) in participants with high-risk prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance whole body diffusion-weighted imaging (a method to show how water moves in a certain area) may help find bone or lymph nodes metastasis.

Accuracy of whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Accuracy will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals for whole body MRI (for bone and lymph node metastasis), bone scan (for bone metastasis), and computed tomography (CT) scan (for lymph node metastasis). Comparisons between modalities will be performed using McNemar's test. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 6 months
Sensitivity of MRI, bone scan, and CT scan, Sensitivity will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals for whole body MRI (for bone and lymph node metastasis), bone scan (for bone metastasis), and CT scan (for lymph node metastasis). Comparisons between modalities will be performed using McNemar's test. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 9 years|Specificity of MRI, bone scan, and CT scan, Specificity will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals for whole body MRI (for bone and lymph node metastasis), bone scan (for bone metastasis), and CT scan (for lymph node metastasis). Comparisons between modalities will be performed using McNemar's test. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 9 years|Positive predictive value (PPV) of MRI, bone scan, and CT scan, PPV will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals for whole body MRI (for bone and lymph node metastasis), bone scan (for bone metastasis), and CT scan (for lymph node metastasis). Comparisons between modalities will be performed using McNemar's test. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 9 years|Negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI, bone scan, and CT scan, NPV will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals for whole body MRI (for bone and lymph node metastasis), bone scan (for bone metastasis), and CT scan (for lymph node metastasis). Comparisons between modalities will be performed using McNemar's test. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 9 years|Detection of other types of metastases, Comparisons between modalities will be performed using McNemar's test. Other statistical analyses will be carried out as appropriate., Up to 9 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare accuracies of whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus bone scan plus computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting bone or lymph node metastasis in high risk prostate cancer patients.

OUTLINE:

Participants undergo standard of care bone scan, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and pelvic MRI. Participants also undergo magnetic resonance whole body (WB)-diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) over 20-30 minutes.
