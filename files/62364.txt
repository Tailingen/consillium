Expanded Access Program for OOS Obe-cel
The purpose of this program is to provide access to obe-cel treatment for adult patients with ALL who have undergone leukapheresis and had obe-cel manufactured from their blood cells but the product is deemed OOS (does not meet the specifications to be used commercially). The target patients for this study have limited options for treatment and repeat blood sampling is not feasible. The main aims of this study are (1) to provide adult patients with ALL with access to obe-cel and (2) to describe the safety profile of obe-cel (including CRS, ICANS, serious infections, secondary cancers, and any side effects) within the first 45 days after infusion of OOS obe-cel.

This study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter expanded access program (EAP). The patient population included in this EAP will be adult patients diagnosed with recurring or refractory ALL who were prescribed obe-cel as part of their standard of care and are eligible for use under the approved local prescribing information.

To be in the study, patients must provide informed consent, be at least 18 years of age, have a confirmed diagnosis of ALL, be medically fit and stable to receive obe-cel, have had commercial obe-cel prescribed by their treating physician as per standard of care, and for whom remanufacturing is not clinically appropriate.

Patients cannot be in the study if they have a history of severe immediate allergic reaction to any drugs or metabolites of similar chemical classes as obe-cel, are a pregnant woman, or are receiving treatment in another study.

All data will be collected from information routinely recorded in the medical record. There is no formal hypothesis testing. Data will be analyzed descriptively (numbers, percentages and ranges, etc.).
