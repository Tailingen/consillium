Trial of Pembrolizumab for Advanced Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is relatively rare but exhibits higher incidences in less developed countries. PSCC is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by early spread. Pembrolizumab has recently been FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma but will serve as the investigational agent for this penile cancer study.
Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Tumor Response Rate, The response rate will be evaluated every 3 weeks using the criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in addition to immune related criteria based on patterns of response., Baseline up to two years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), The duration of time from the start of treatment to the first documentation of tumor progression., Baseline up to two years|Overall Survival, Length of subject survival after starting study treatment, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Number of Patients With Adverse Events, Adverse events reporting will be graded following the National Cancer Institute of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0., Baseline up to two years
This is a multicenter trial to evaluate Pembrolizumab for patients with advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma following prior chemotherapy. Participating institutions are the University of Alabama at Birmingham (coordinating center), M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, and Emory University. Patients will receive intravenous Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and undergo a clinical exam. Radiographic scans will be done at baseline and every 9 weeks. Therapy will continue until disease progression or there are intolerable toxicities.
