Microbiome in Lung Cancer and Other Malignancies
To characterize the fecal, skin, nasal and oral microbiome and metabolome in patients with lung cancer and other malignancies, and correlate to treatment response and toxicities of various therapies including immunotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy, etc.
Lung Cancer|Cancer|Malignancy
PROCEDURE: Nasal Swab|PROCEDURE: Oral Swab|OTHER: Stool Collection|GENETIC: Microbiome analysis|GENETIC: DNA Banking|PROCEDURE: Skin Swab
Identify and compare bacteria within given samples through standard protocol and 16S rRNA amplicon, Bacterial DNA will be isolated from stool/swab samples using standard protocol. Fecal micobiota will be examined based on an 16S rRNA amplicon., Time of study enrollment up to one year
Correlate data from samples with patient clinical information, Correlate data from samples with patient clinical information regarding overall response rates., Time of study enrollment up to one year|Number of treatment related adverse events (AE) as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, Record from each clinical visit the AEs from immunotherapy or its combination with chemotherapy., Time of study enrollment up to one year
Patients will be asked to provide nasal, oral and skin swabs, as well as stool samples during their regular clinic visits, at the baseline before desired therapy is given, and at the time when treatment is changed due to either disease progression or unbearable toxicities leading to treatment stop/change. If treatment stop/held is due to toxicities, a 3rd set of samples will be collected when toxicities reduce to less than grade 1. The samples will be subjected to DNA extraction followed by 16S rRNA and/or shotgun sequencing metagenomic analysis. The data will be correlated to clinical response from treatments, toxicities, clinical data (use of antibiotics, PPIs, lab parameters, etc.) and tissue genetic/immunological characteristics (mutations, PDL1 expression, etc.) for review of response. This is not data to be used for treatment of these subjects.
