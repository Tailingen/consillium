Gemcitabine With or Without CI-994 in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine plus CI-994 is more effective than gemcitabine alone for non-small cell lung cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without CI-994 in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: tacedinaline
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine with or without CI-994 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status and are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive CI-994 orally on days 1-21 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Arm II: Patients receive placebo capsules orally on days 1-21 and gemcitabine as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days as long as medically appropriate (absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 176 patients will be accrued for this study.
