Enumeration and Function Analysis of Treg Cells in Peripheral Blood of HCC Patients Before and After Ablation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the enumeration and function changes of regulatory t cells in peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma patients before and 1 week, 4 weeks after ablation therapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation
variation of absolute counting of T cell subsets in peripheral blood of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy, changes of absolute counting of T cell subsets in peripheral blood of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy,such as CD3+,CD4+,CD8+,CD4+CD25+FOXP3+(Treg) cells., 4 weeks post therapy|variation of serum IL-10,TGF-β1,IFN-γ concentration of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy, variation of serum IL-10,TGF-β1,IFN-γ concentration of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy, 4 weeks post therapy
variation of proliferation suppression ability of CD4+CD25+ T cells of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy, CD4+CD25+ T cells, derived from peripheral blood of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy,were co-cultured with CD4+CD25- or CD8+ T cells,which were stimulated by CD3/CD28 MACSiBead Particles.CD4+CD25- and CD8+ T cells proliferation changes were analysed to test CD4+CD25+ T cell suppression ability., 4 weeks post therapy|variation of suppression ability of CD4+CD25+ T cells of HCC patients on cytokine secretion before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy, CD4+CD25+ T cells, derived from peripheral blood of HCC patients before and 1,4 weeks after radiofrequency ablation therapy,were co-cultured with CD4+CD25- or CD8+ T cells,which were stimulated by CD3/CD28 MACSiBead Particles.supernatant IFN-γ were analysed to test CD4+CD25+ T cell suppression ability., 4 weeks post therapy
Regulatory T cells，which are also called Treg cells，play an important role in suppressing anti-tumor immunity.Accumulated evidences indicate that Treg cells are elevated in peripheral blood,however,there are also reports that decreased Treg cells are found in hepatocellular patients.This study focuses on the changes of Treg cells ratio in peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma patients before and 1 week, 4 weeks after ablation ,also its functional cytokines,such as TGF-β,IL-10,IFN-γ,and inhibition function when co-cultured with CD4+CD25-、CD8+ cells. The investigators speculate that a decreased Treg ratio will be found in patients who receive ablation therapy,and its function cytokines,moreover,CD4+CD25-、CD8+ cells' proliferation and function could be inhibited when co-cultured with Treg cells.
