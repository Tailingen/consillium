A Study of DS-1471a In Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This first-in-human (FIH) study will assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of DS-1471a in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: DS-1471a
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation), Cycle 1: Baseline up to Day 28 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Baseline up to 60 months
Best Overall Response (BOR) As Assessed by the Investigator in Participants Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Best overall response (BOR) is recorded from the start of study drug until documented progressive disease (PD) or start of any anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first. Confirmation of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) is required. As per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions)., Baseline up to 60 months|Time to Response (TTR) As Assessed by the Investigator in Participants Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the start of study drug to the date of the first documentation of response (CR or PR) as assessed by the investigator. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline up to 60 months|Duration of Response (DoR) As Assessed by the Investigator in Participants Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR to the date of the first documentation of PD as assessed by the investigator or to the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline up to 60 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) of Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the start date of study drug to the date of the first documentation of objective PD as assessed by the investigator or to the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. As per RECIST v1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS) of Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Escalation and Expansion), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of the start of study drug to the date of death due to any cause., Baseline up to 60 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Expansion), Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed BOR of CR or PR as assessed by the investigator. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline up to 60 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) of Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Following Treatment With DS-1471a (Dose Expansion), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants who have a BOR of CR, PR, or SD as assessed by the investigator. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions)., Baseline up to 60 months|Pharmacokinetic Analysis Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of DS-1471a, Cycle 1 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycles 4, 6, and 8 (Day 1), each cycle is 28 days|Pharmacokinetic Analysis Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of DS-1471a, Cycle 1 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycles 4, 6, and 8 (Day 1), each cycle is 28 days|Pharmacokinetic Analysis Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve of DS-1471a, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable time (AUClast), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the time of dosing to 28 day (AUC28d), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve during dosing interval (AUCtau) will be assessed., Cycle 1 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycles 4, 6, and 8 (Day 1), each cycle is 28 days|Pharmacokinetic Analysis Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of DS-1471a, Cycle 1 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycle 2 (Day 1), Cycle 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22), Cycles 4, 6, and 8 (Day 1), each cycle is 28 days|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies Against DS-1471a, Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) incidence is defined as the proportion of participants having treatment-emergent ADAs., Cycle 1 (Days 1 and 8), Cycle 2 and 3 (Day 1), and Cycle 4 and every 2 cycles thereafter (Day 1), each cycle is 28 days
The objectives of this multinational, multicenter, open-label, 2-part, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, FIH study of participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors are to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose for expansion phase, preliminary efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of DS-1471a.
