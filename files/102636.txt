Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide With or Without Rituximab in Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic B-Cell Lymphocytic Leukemia
This randomized phase III trial is studying fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab to see how well they work compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in treating patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease progression, relapse or death by any cause, whichever came first., Median observation time at time of analysis was approximately 21 months|Final Analysis: Time to Progression-free Survival Event, Progression-free survival was defined as the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease progression, relapse or death by any cause, whichever came first., Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months
Event-free Survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time between randomization and the date of disease progression, relapse, start of new CLL treatment or death by any cause., Median observation time at time of analysis was approximately 21 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between randomization and the date of death due to any cause. Median OS was not reached., Median observation time at time of analysis was approximately 21 months|Disease-free Survival (DFS) of Patients With Confirmed Complete Response (CR)., CR is defined by at least 8 weeks of: 1)Absence of lymphadenopathy 2)No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly 3)Absence of B-symptoms 4)Normal blood count 5)Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 8 weeks after the clinical and laboratory results demonstrated that a CR was achieved. A marrow sample had to be normocellular for age with less than 30% lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules had to be absent. If marrow was hypocellular,a repeat biopsy was taken 4 weeks later and samples were re-reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology. DFS was calculated from time of CR to relapse or death. Median DFS was not reached., Median observation time at time of analysis was approximately 21 months|Final Analysis: Time to Overall Survival Event, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between randomization and the date of death due to any cause., Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months|Final Analysis: Time to Event-free Survival Event, Event-free survival was defined as the time between randomization and the date of disease progression, relapse, start of new Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia treatment or death by any cause., Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months|Final Analysis: Time to Disease-free Survival (DFS) Event in Participants With Complete Response (CR), CR is defined by at least 8 weeks of: 1)Absence of lymphadenopathy 2)No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly 3)Absence of B-symptoms 4)Normal blood count 5)Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 8 weeks after the clinical and laboratory results demonstrated that a CR was achieved. A marrow sample had to be normocellular for age with less than 30% lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules had to be absent. If marrow was hypocellular,a repeat biopsy was taken 4 weeks later and samples were re-reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology. DFS was calculated from time of CR to relapse or death, Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months|Final Analysis: Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented Complete Response, Partial Response to disease progression or death by any cause., Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months|Final Analysis: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response, CR is defined by at least 8 weeks of: 1)Absence of lymphadenopathy 2)No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly 3)Absence of B-symptoms 4)Normal blood count 5)Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 8 weeks after the clinical and laboratory results demonstrated that a CR was achieved. A marrow sample had to be normocellular for age with less than 30% lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules had to be absent. If marrow was hypocellular,a repeat biopsy was taken 4 weeks later and samples were re-reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology. Partial response is defined as a decrease in the size of a tumor, or in the extent of cancer in the body, in response to treatment., Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months|Final Analysis: Time to New Treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL), The time from randomization to the start of a new treatment., Median observation time was approximately 66.4 months
