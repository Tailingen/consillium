Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous-cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
This proof-of-concept study aims to assess the clinical and biological effects of Atezolizumab combined with Bevacizumab in advanced previously treated squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC).
Head and Neck Neoplasms
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Overall response rate, Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), on two consecutive occasions at least 4 weeks apart, determined by investigator per RECIST v1., At 18 weeks
Disease control rate, Disease control rate (DCR) defined as the proportion of patients with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) at 18 weeks determined by investigator per RECIST v1.1, At 18 weeks|Best Overall Response Rate, Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) is determined by the best response designation recorded between the date of the first study treatment and the date of objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first., Every 6 weeks for 2 years then every 9 weeks for 3 years|Duration of response, Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time interval from the date of first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR, whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that disease progression or death is documented, whichever occurs first., Every 6 weeks for 2 years then every 9 weeks for 3 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 6 weeks for 2 years then every 9 weeks for 3 years|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is the time from the first day of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 1 year|HPV+ vs HPV -, Exploratory analyses on tumor biopsy samples include molecular characterization and comparison of HPV+ versus HPV- tumors and tumor microenvironment., At Baseline, at cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days) and in case of relapse for 2 years|PD1-/PD-L1 expression, Exploratory analyses on tumor biopsy samples include PD1-/PD-L1 expression at baseline and after treatment by IHC/IF on tumor cells and immune infiltrate and correlation to soluble forms determined by ELISA in blood samples., At Baseline, at cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days) and in case of relapse for 2 years|Immune cells infiltrate characterization, Exploratory analyses on tumor biopsy samples include Immune cells infiltrate characterization., At Baseline, at cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days) and in case of relapse for 2 years|Immuno-phenotyping, Exploratory analyses on blood samples include immuno-phenotyping., At Baseline, at Cycle 1 day 7 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 3 and in case of relapse for 2 years|Cytokines Production, Exploratory analyses on blood samples include cytokines production by blood T cells (using DMSO cryopreserved PBMCs) according to ICP receptor expression. Intracytoplasmic cytokines will be measured after PMA/ionomycin restimulation by multi-parametric flow cytometry. The response will be determined according PD-1 versus other ICP expression., At Baseline, at Cycle 1 day 7 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 3 and in case of relapse for 2 years|Microbiome analysis, Microbiome analysis on stool samples will be assessed through whole metagenomics sequencing in order to evaluate roles of microbiome communities in immunotherapy., At Baseline, at Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) and at the end of treatment for 2 years
Patients will receive the combination of Atezolizumab 1200 mg and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg by IV infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or voluntary withdrawal. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving study treatment will be permitted to continue the study treatment if they meet all of the following criteria:

* Evidence of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator following a review of all available data
* Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease
* Absence of decline in ECOG Performance Status that can be attributed to disease progression
* Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions.
