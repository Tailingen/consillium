Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer
Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue, for example tumor tissue. Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (imILT) is a specific form of thermotherapy, which, in addition to destroying tumor tissue, has been optimized to cause a tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with imILT other, untreated, tumors also decrease in size.

The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficiency when it comes to local tumor destruction of the imILT treatment method in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The purpose is also to investigate the functionality and safety as well as understanding of the subsequent immunological effects.

This trial is prospective, open and non-randomized. Five patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer will be treated in this trial, which is estimated to be carried out during a time period of 36 months.
