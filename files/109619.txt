Methylnatrexone In Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (MINK). A "Window of Opportunity" Pilot Study.
To learn if OCSCC patients can be safely given methylnaltrexone for 2 weeks before surgery.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Methylnaltrexone
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
2.1 Primary Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of treating OCSCC participants with methylnaltrexone. We define success as when a participants can receive assigned medication for two weeks preoperatively without interruption due to AEs (NCI CTCAE v4.03). By the end of the trial, feasibility is claimed if 90% or above the participants can successfully receive assigned medication.

2.2 Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the endpoints include tolerability, efficacy and tumor biological response of methylnaltrexone in surgical candidates for OCSCC.

2.3 Exploratory Objectives

The exploratory objectives are to perform tumor RNASeq profiling and assess blood and tumor immunological landscape, and to correlate efficacy endpoints with tumor biomarkers.
