A Phase 2 Study Evaluating Olutasidenib in Patients With IDH1-mutated Clonal Cytopenia of Undetermined Significance and Lower-risk Myelodysplastic/Syndromes/Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia.
To learn if olutasidenib can help to control CCUS, MDS, and/or CMML. The safety of the drug will also be studied.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Clonal Cytopenia of Undetermined Significance
DRUG: Olutasidenib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives - To determine the response rate of olutasidenib monotherapy in patients with IDH1-mutated CCUS or lower-risk MDS/CMML

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate the rates of transfusion independence, defined as the absence of transfusions over a period of at least 8 weeks
* To ascertain the safety and tolerability of olutasidenib monotherapy in these participants populations
* To determine survival and rates of leukemia transformation
* To analyze reduction in IDH1 clone size

Exploratory Objectives

- To investigate global gene expression profiles, DNA methylation profiles, and other potential prognostic markers to explore predictors of antitumor activity and/or resistance to treatment.
