Liver Resection for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Impaired Liver Function
Hepatic dysfunction limits the therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is closely associated with patient prognosis. Established practice guidelines for patients with HCC and impaired liver function are lacking. The treatment allocation in these populations is heterogeneous and remains controversial. This study compared the survival benefits of liver resection (LR) and transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with HCC and impaired liver function.
