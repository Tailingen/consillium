A Diagnostic Study of the Advanced Endoscopy to Detect Early Esophageal Cancer
This descriptive cross sectional study aims to directly compare the diagnostic capability of the probed-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and the magnifying narrow band imaging (M-NBI) in the Lugol's voiding lesions.
