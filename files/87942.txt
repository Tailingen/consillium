Five Fractions of Radiotherapy Followed by Full Dose FOLFOX Chemotherapy as Preoperative Treatment for Rectal Cancer
To determine if short course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy can maintain morbidity at or below levels reported with concurrent 5FU, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy, while maintaining response rates comparable to what would be expected with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.
Rectal Neoplasms
RADIATION: External beam radiation|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Capecitabine
Rate of T Stage Downstaging, T stage downstaging is defined as clinical pretreatment American Joint Committee on Cancer T stage (cT) being greater than pathologic T stage at surgery (ypT)., Mean number of weeks before surgery 17.3 (SD +/- 2.9 weeks)|Preoperative Gastrointestinal Morbidity, As measured by participants who experience grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal morbidity, Mean number of weeks before surgery 17.3 (SD +/- 2.9 weeks)
Incidence of Any Late Grade 3 or Higher Morbidity, Preoperative (mean time from start of radiation to surgery 17.3 weeks (SD +/- 2.9 weeks)|Incidence of Post Chemoradiotherapy Grade 3 or Higher Morbidity, 1 year (completion of all treatment)|Local Control, * Kaplan-Meier projections
* Local control = control of primary tumor, 30 months|Rate of Overall Control, 1 year|Rate of Locoregional Control, 1 year|Freedom From Disease Relapse, Kaplan-Meier projections., 30 months|Determine Quality of Anorectal Function, Anorectal function was measured by the participant's response to the FACT-C questionnaire question "I have control of my bowels". The answers ranged from 0=not at all to 4=very much., Up to 1 year
Our principal objectives in this trial will be to determine if short course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy can maintain morbidity at or below levels reported with concurrent 5FU (oral capecitabine if 5FU is unavailable), oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy, while maintaining response rates comparable to what would be expected with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. If we can establish a T stage downstaging rate that is significantly better than 50% and if acute tolerance is acceptable, then we would consider this study as having provided sufficient pilot data to support including this approach as an arm in a multi-institution phase III trial. The long-term goal is improved overall control of disease by delivering better chemotherapy earlier.
