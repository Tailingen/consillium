Treatment of Advanced and Metastatic Solid Tumors With MIL97
This is a Phase 1, global, multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of MIL97 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumor. The study consists of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. An accelerated titration design (cohorts 1-2 only) followed by 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used in dose escalation phase.

The starting dose for dose escalation phase is 0.01 mg/kg Q3W, followed by 5 dose cohorts (0.03mg/kg Q3W, 0.1mg/kg Q3W, 0.2mg/kg Q3W, 0.3mg/kg Q3W and 0.45mg/kg Q3W). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 21 days. Based on data of 3-week treatment regimen, one or two dose levels may be chosen for Q2w regimen. Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 28 days.

One or two dose cohorts will be chosen (either 2-week regimen or 3-week regimen cohorts) to expand to total of 10 subjects in each cohort for further exploration of PK as well as safety and efficacy.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody MIL97 for Injection
The incidence of MIL97 treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor, incidence of AEs and SAEs assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0., up to 2.5 year after enrollment
Pharmacokinetics: AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration, up to 1.5 year after enrollment|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax;, Maximum concentration (Cmax) of the drug after administration, up to 1.5 year after enrollment|Objective response rate (ORR);, To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of MIL97 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumor. ORR includes complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria., up to 2.5 year after enrollment|Duration of response (DoR);, DOR is defined as the time from the initial response (CR or PR) to the time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., up to 2.5 year after enrollment|Progression free survival (PFS);, Defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., up to 2.5 year after enrollment|The overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor;, Defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., up to 2.5 year after enrollment|The Disease control rate for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor;, Defined defined as the proportion of patients with objective evidence of CR, PR, or SD., up to 2.5 year after enrollment|Immunogenicity;, Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) will be tested and percentage of ADA positive patients will be calculated to evaluate immunogenicity of MIL97., up to 2.5 year after enrollment|Biomarkers;, measurement of CD80, CD86 and cytokines in human plasma, up to 2.5 year after enrollment
