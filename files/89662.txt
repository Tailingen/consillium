Human ADME Study of [14C]-Ceralasertib (AZD6738) and Absolute Bioavailability of Ceralasertib
This is an open-label, two-part study in participants with NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or endometrial cancer and will be conducted at multiple study sites.

Participants will be assessed for study eligibility prior to admission to the study site.

Part A will assess the absolute bioavailability, determine the excretory routes of \[14C\]-Ceralasertib, and evaluate the PK parameters of a Ceralasertib oral dose and a radiolabelled IV microdose of \[14C\]-Ceralasertib.

Participants will be admitted to the study site pre-dose Part A and will remain at the study site for excreta (urine and faeces) collections, PK sampling and safety assessments. A washout period days will be observed between dosing in Part A and Part B. Part B will assess the ADME of \[14C\]-Ceralasertib.

Participants will be readmitted to the study site for Part B and will remain at the study site for excreta (urine, faeces, and any vomitus) collections, PK sampling, and safety assessments.

Participants will return to the study site for a Follow-up Visit after the last dose of Ceralasertib which will include routine safety assessments.

After the completion of Parts A and B, and following the Follow-up Visit, participants may be allowed further access to Ceralasertib if in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor they may derive clinical benefit.
