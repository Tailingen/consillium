Focused Stereotactic Radiation Treatment of Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
Focused stereotactic radiation treatment of localized prostatic adenocarcinoma. in order to quantify the delay between the focused treatment and the salvage procedure.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Cyberknife
Delay between the initial diagnosis and date of salvage treatment, Delay between the initial diagnosis and date of salvage treatment, through study completion, up to 36 months

Focused stereotactic radiation treatment of localized prostatic adenocarcinoma. in order to quantify the delay between the focused treatment and the salvage procedure.

Second objectives : objectives: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, MRI response, toxicity (CTCAEv4), quality of life (International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF5) scores).

Method At first: Multiparametric Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - 12 biopsies within the whole gland.

Placement under endorectal ultrasound control of 4 fiducials at least 2 cm spaced.

Treatment : CyberKnife radiation treatment delivering 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, in 10 days. Tracking using the 4 fiducials. Critical organs: Rectal and bladder wall: V35\<2cc. Bladder neck and urethra: V35\<1cc.

Salvage treatments: in such a context, salvage surgery or salvage intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments can in theory remain valid and safe options.
