Plerixafor Plus Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor (G-CSF) For Mobilization And Collection Of Peripheral Hematopoietic Stem Cells In Japanese Participants With Multiple Myeloma
Primary Objective:

To determine if Multi Myeloma (MM) patients mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus plerixafor 240 μg/kg are more likely to achieve a target number of greater than or equal to 6 x 10\^6 cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ cells/kg in 2 or fewer days of apheresis than MM patients mobilized with G-CSF alone.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety of G-CSF plus plerixafor arm compared to G-CSF arm in MM patients.
* To compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to the number of participants who achieved a minimum of 2 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis.
* To compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to the number of days of apheresis required to reach the target of greater than or equal to 6 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg.

Proportion of participants who achieve a collection of a minimum target of 2 x10^6 cells/kg CD34+ cells in less than or equal to 4 days of apheresis, Day 5 to Day 8 of the apheresis/treatment period|Number of days of apheresis to collect 6 x10^6 cells/kg CD34+ cells, Day 5 to Day 8 of the apheresis/treatment period|Number of days of apheresis to collect 2 x10^6 cells/kg CD34+ cells, Day 5 to Day 8 of the apheresis/treatment period|Total number of CD34+ cells/kg collected over up to 4 apheresis, Day 5 to Day 8 of the apheresis/treatment period|The relative increase (ratio) of peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (cells/μL), From Day 4 morning to Day 5 morning for both arms, from Day 4 morning to Day 4 evening for GP arm only, and from Day 4 evening to Day 5 morning for GP arm only|Number of participants with adverse events, Up to 68 days|Change from baseline in clinical laboratory measurements, Up to 68 days
Total study duration for a participant can be approximately up to 68 days.
