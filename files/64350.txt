PK-directed Dose Adjustment of IV Busulfan Conditioning Regimen for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Lymphoma Patients
This is a study for the outcome and safety of individualized busulfan dosing with cyclophosphamide and etoposide for patients preparing for a stem cell transplant to treat Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Lymphoma
DRUG: IV Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide (BuCyE Regimen)
Number of Progression Events in 2 Years., The time of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from transplantation to the occurrence of the event that was death or first recurrence of progressive disease., 2 years
Number of Death Events in 2 Years., The time of overall survival was defined as the time from transplantation to death of all causes., 2 years|Number of Transplant-related Death Events Until Day 100., Transplant-related mortality was defined as death due to any cause other than disease relapse/progression up until Day 100., Day 100|Overall Response Rate, The overall response status is complete response and not complete response (partial remission, primary refractory/primary induction failure, stable disease, progressive disease, and relapse) at Baseline and each of the scheduled follow-up time points., Baseline, Day 100, Month 6, 12, 24, Early termination and End of Trial (within 30 days of the trial termination)
Evaluation of progression-free survival, transplant related mortality, overall survival, and overall response rate, in subjects with NHL and HL receiving an IV busulfan-based conditioning regimen with PK-guided IV busulfan dosing, followed by autologous HSCT as well as comparison to those receiving carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) conditioning regimen (and its variants) obtained from registry data in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Assessment of the safety profile of a BuCyE conditioning regimen with PK-directed dosing of IV busulfan will also be completed.
