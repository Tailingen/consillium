A Study of SHR-A2009 Versus Platinum-based Chemotherapy in EGFR-mutated, Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
This study was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter phase III clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of SHR-A2009 with platinum-based dual-agent chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who failed EGFR TKI treatment.
