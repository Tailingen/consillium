A Phase I Trial Using Cyclophosphamide, Rituximab and Revlimid (CR2) for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and toxicity when cyclophosphamide, rituximab and lenalidomide (Revlimid) are combined for the treatment of relapsed/refractory of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Lymphoma, Small Lymphocytic
DRUG: Lenalidomide, Rituximab, and Cyclophosphamide
The primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with cyclophosphamide and rituximab for the treatment of CLL or SLL., Day 28 of the first cycle of chemotherapy
Assess response criteria, including complete response rate, survival at 1 year, time to progression, duration of response, and eradication of minimal residual disease., Response will be measured after 4 cycles, at the end of treatment and then every 3 months post treatment.
