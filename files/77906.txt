Acupuncture for Enhanced Recovery After Surgery in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Cancer Resection
Background:

Patients who undergo laparoscopic surgical resection of colorectal cancer may experience various post-operative symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea and vomiting, and anxiety) and limitation of daily activities (e.g., walking capacity). There is also a risk of post-operative complications and a prolonged hospital stay due to complications. Patients who underwent surgical resection may have experienced chronic pain, anxiety/depression, or diminished quality of life. The physical, psychological, and functional aspects of patients' disorders imply the necessity of multidisciplinary care, including complementary or traditional medicines such as acupuncture. This study aims to assess whether acupuncture treatment, combined with an enhanced recovery program after surgery in an inpatient care setting is effective than only an enhanced recovery program after surgery.

Objective:

To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture combined with an enhanced recovery program after surgery to reduce postoperative symptoms and improve functional recovery and the patients' quality of life.
