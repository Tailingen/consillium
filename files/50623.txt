Two Fraction Prostate SBRT With DIL SIB
Phase I/Ib, single arm trial of Two-Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) with an MRI directed, dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL), simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) based on genomic classification in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of two fraction SBRT in patients with localized prostate cancer.
