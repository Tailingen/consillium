Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation With Adoptive Immunotherapy in Epstein-Barr Virus Positive Recurrent/Refractory Hodgkins Lymphoma
The investigators intend to utilize reduced intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem cell transplant from EBV positive HLA matched sibling or unrelated adult donor combined with post AlloSCT allogeneic donor derived LMP specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) infusions in EBV positive patients with poor risk Hodgkin Lymphoma. One of three reduced intensity conditioning regimens predetermined at each institutional center of the Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult Lymphoma Cell Therapy Consortium (LCTC) will be utilized for related or matched unrelated adult donor allogeneic transplant followed by donor LMP specific CTL infusion for three doses post AlloSCT. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of donor derived LMP specific CTLs will be safe and feasible.
Hodgkins Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: allogeneic donor derived LMP specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
Safety, The number of serious adverse events associated with administering allogeneic HLA matched donor derived LMP specific-CTLs in CAYA with EBV-associated refractory/relapsed HL following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and allogeneic HSCT will be monitored to determine the safety of this treatment., 1 year|Toxicity, The number of adverse events associated with administering allogeneic HLA matched donor derived LMP specific-CTLs in CAYA with EBV-associated refractory/relapsed HL following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and allogeneic HSCT will be monitored to determine the toxicity of this treatment., 1 year
Feasibility, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production and shipping of HLA matched donor derived LMP specific-CTLs to multiple sites in various geographic regions of the US following RIC and allogeneic HSCT will be monitored to assess the feasibility., 1 year
