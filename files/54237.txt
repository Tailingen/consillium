Chemotherapy-induced Cognitive and Brain Changes in Older Adults With Breast Cancer
This research study evaluates the effect of chemotherapy on cognition (thinking) and the brain in people with breast cancer.
Impaired Cognition|Chemo-brain|Breast Cancer
OTHER: Cognitive, functional and subjective assessments|DEVICE: MRI|RADIATION: PET Scan
Change in cognitive performance scores, Baseline, immediately after completion of chemo, and 6 months after completion of chemotherapy
Correlation between baseline amyloid accumulation in the brain and change in cognitive performance, Baseline, 6 months after completion of chemotherapy|Correlation between baseline tau accumulation in the brain and change in cognitive performance, Baseline, 6 months after completion of chemotherapy|Correlation between change in tau accumulation in the brain (from baseline to 6 months after completion of chemotherapy) and change in cognitive performance (from baseline to 6 months after completion of chemotherapy), Baseline, 6 months after completion of chemotherapy
* This study is being done to study effects of chemotherapy (cancer treatment) on the brain and cognition (thinking). "Chemo-brain" is a term sometimes used to refer to effects of chemotherapy on the brain and cognition (thinking).
* This study is being done to test for "chemo-brain" in older adults with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy, and to identify people who are most likely to be affected. The investigators will look at thinking abilities and brain images before and after chemotherapy to see if it can help identify people at risk for cognitive side effects of the treatment, and to better understand effects of treatment on brain structure and function.
* The investigators are looking for participants who have either been recently recently diagnosed breast cancer participant or a healthy volunteer.
* What is involved in the study:

  * Memory and Thinking Tests
  * Imaging: Either MRI/or MRI and PET Scans
