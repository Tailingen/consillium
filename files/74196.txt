Hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiotherapy For Prostate Cancer: The HEIGHT Trial
1. Delivery of directed hypofractionated targeted (HT) radiotherapy (RT) tumor boost to the dominant tumor lesion in the prostate as identified by multiparametric MRI will increase tumor eradication from the prostate.
2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the multiparametric MRI defined regions at high risk of harboring tumors that determine outcome.
3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have Circulating DNA or tumor cells (CTC) that are related to an adverse treatment outcome.
4. Quality of life will not differ significantly between the treatment arms.
5. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the HTIMRT arm, because the patients will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher radiation dose.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: SIMRT|RADIATION: HTIMRT
Number of Participants With Biopsy Failure, Number of participants showing positive prostate biopsy finding post treatment., Up to 2.25 years
Toxicity Rate, Toxicity rate will be reported as the number of participants experiencing any treatment-related adverse events. Acute and Late Toxicity will be evaluated by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0. Acute toxicity will be defined as any treatment-related adverse event during and within 3 months of completing treatment. Late Toxicity will be defined as any treatment-related adverse events occurring more than 3 months after treatment completion., Up to 6 years|Mortality, Mortality will be reported as overall survival and failure free survival. Overall survival is defined as the elapsed time from start of radiotherapy to death from any cause. Failure free survival is defined as the elapsed time from start of radiotherapy to first documented evidence of biochemical or clinical failure or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. In the absence of any event defining failure, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last documented failure-free status., Up to 6 years|Failure Rate, Failure rate will be reported as the incidence of biochemical or clinical failure. Biochemical failure is defined is an increase of 2 or greater from nadir of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels. Clinical Failure is defined as newly identified extension outside the prostate after initial regression, or urinary obstructive symptoms with carcinoma or regional/distant failure due to radiographic evidence metastasis., Up to 6 years|EPIC SF-12 Scores, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Medical Outcomes Study SF-12 (EPIC SF-12) to evaluate patient function and satisfaction after prostate cancer treatment. Response options for each item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better HRQOL., At baseline, at last week of treatment (Up to 8 weeks), at 6 weeks after treatment (Up to 14 weeks), at 3 months after treatment (Up to 20 weeks), at 9 months after treatment (Up to 44 weeks).|MAX-PC Scores, Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured using the scores on the Modified 18-item Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC). The scale consists of 18 items (e.g. "I thought about prostate cancer even though I didn't mean to.") scored on a scale from 0 ("not at all") to 3 ("often"). Total scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety., At baseline, at last week of treatment (Up to 8 weeks), at 6 weeks after treatment (Up to 14 weeks), at 3 months after treatment (Up to 20 weeks), at 9 months after treatment (Up to 44 weeks)|Biomarker Expression in Prostate Tumor Regions, The amount of biomarker expression will be evaluated via immunohistochemistry (IHC) from ultrasound guided prostate biopsy tissue samples for both functional MRI suspicious regions and those that are not suspicious., Up to 3 years|Incidence of Circulating Free DNA, Incidence of circulating free DNA, as assessed from blood samples., Up to 3 years
