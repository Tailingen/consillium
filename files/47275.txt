Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Stage I-III Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out the effects (good and bad) of highly focused radiation on you and your prostate cancer. The purpose of this evaluation is to see if this treatment causes fewer side effects that other standard treatment approaches, and to evaluate the effect of this treatment on your prostate tumor and your quality of life over time.

RADIATION: CyberKnife Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Quality of life outcomes (low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer groups), In the low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer groups, to determine whether study treatment improves patient-reported quality of life outcomes compared to the approach used in a previous multi-center cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery trial., 8 years|Rates of acute and late grade 3-5 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities (high-risk group), In the high-risk group, to estimate rates of acute and late grade 3-5 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities following cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery., 8 years
Rates of toxicities related to treatment, After five years following cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery, estimate rates of toxicities related to treatment., 5 years|Disease free survival, Measure disease free survival after five years following cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery., 5 years|Overall survival, Measure overall survival after five years following cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery., 5 years
Quality of life, Measure quality of life after five years following cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery., 5 years
