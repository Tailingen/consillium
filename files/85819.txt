Capecitabine With or Without Sunitinib Malate as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer of the Esophagus or Gastroesophageal Junction
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether capecitabine is more effective when given alone or together with sunitinib malate in treating patients with metastatic esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well capecitabine works compared with capecitabine given together with sunitinib malate as first-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.
Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction|Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: sunitinib malate
Comparison of Progression-free Survival, The primary analysis will be a comparison of Arm A to Arm B using a one-sided log-rank test between the 2 Kaplan-Meier curves. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria, who started treatment will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. If a patient is still alive 3 years after registration, no further follow-up is required. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, Up to 3 years
Response Rate (Complete Response or Partial Response), A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a CR or PR noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations ≥4 weeks apart. Confirmed tumor response will be evaluated using the first 6 cycles of treatment. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be evaluable for response. The confirmed response rates between the 2 arms will be compared using a Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact test. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The distribution of overall survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier., Up to 3 years|Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date documentation of disease progression occurs. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred prior to death. The distribution of time-to-progression will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier., Up to 3 years|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure is defined to be the time from the date of randomization to the date at which the patient is removed from treatment due to progression, adverse events, or refusal., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved an objective response as the date at which the patient's earliest best objective status is first noted to be either a CR or PR to the earliest date progression is documented., Up to 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare the progression-free survival of elderly (age ≥ 65 years) and/or poor performance status patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with capecitabine with verus without sunitinib malate.
* Report other indicators of efficacy with these regimens, including the confirmed response rate, overall survival, time to tumor progression, duration of response, and time to treatment failure.
* Compare the adverse event profiles of these regimens in these patients.

Secondary

* Explore whether certain key proteins associated with anti-VEGF therapy are able to predict tumor response.
* Bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or slides, and blood products for future studies.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to gender (male vs female), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), and age (≥ 65 years vs \< 65 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to arm II at the physician's discretion.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine as in arm 1 and oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-21.

In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline for evaluation of protein markers as possible predictors of tumor response to this regimen. Samples are analyzed by IHC for expression levels of markers

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
