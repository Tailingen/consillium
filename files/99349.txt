The Chinese Pulmonary Lymphoepithelioma-like Carcinoma Collaboration Study
This retrospective case-control study aims to investigate the genetic mechanisms of primary Pulmonary Lymphoepithelioma-like Carcinoma, identify genetic susceptibility loci associated with its onset, and explore potential pathogenic genes, providing new insights for its etiological research.

Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (pLELC) is a rare non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that histologically resembles nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and predominantly affects the Asian population. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a recognized pathogenic factor, and the regional prevalence of pLELC suggests that genetic susceptibility also plays an important role. However, no genetic studies on pLELC have been conducted, leaving its genetic etiology poorly understood. In this study, genotyping for all the subjects was performed by using Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array. Genome-wide association followed by meta-analysis was performed for pLELC cases and healthy controls. The primary objective of this study is to discover susceptibility genes that explain the genetic mechanisms of pLELC.
