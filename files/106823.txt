Safety & Efficacy of Three Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy Regimens Plus Bevacizumab With or Without Trastuzumab for Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Breast Cancer
This is a phase IIb, randomized, parallel-group, noncomparative, multicenter, pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab with or without (+/-) trastuzumab administered with three different docetaxel-based combination regimens for the adjuvant treatment of participants with node positive or high-risk node negative breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) + bevacizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel (T) + bevacizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (TAC) + bevacizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab (TCH) + bevacizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab and trastuzumab maintenance therapy|DRUG: Bevacizumab maintenance therapy
Cardiac Safety - Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Clinical Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Participants were evaluated for clinical CHF every 3 weeks during chemotherapy, every 3 months while on maintenance therapy, and every 3 months during the 2-year follow-up period. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of CHF was assessed by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) performed midway through completion of chemotherapy according to a treatment-specific schedule, every 12 weeks during maintenance therapy, and at 6 and 24 months after completion of maintenance therapy.

Grade 3-4 CHF were identified through a clinical review of all study collected investigator verbatim and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The preferred terms (PT) cardiac failure congestive, cardiomyopathy, and ejection fraction decreased were associated with CHF., from the first dose of study medication up to the end of follow-up (up to 3 yrs)
Safety - Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant of the clinical investigation, regardless of the relationship to study treatment.

A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that at any dose (including overdose) resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or was medically important.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened in severity during the on-treatment period., from the administration of the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication; events ongoing at the time of discontinuation were monitored in the follow-up period until resolution.|Disease-free Survival (DFS) Rate, DFS was defined as the time from the administration of the first-dose of study medication until recurrence of tumor or death from any cause in the absence of previous documentation of tumor recurrence. DFS rate was the probability of being disease free and alive at a particular time. DFS rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier Method, and 95% confidence intervals were computed using the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice.

For participants who did have objective recurrence of tumor and who were still on study at the time of an analysis, or who were given antitumor treatment other than the study treatment, or who were removed from study follow-up prior to documentation of the tumor recurrence, DFS was censored at the last date the participant was known to be disease-free., from the administration of the first-dose of study medication up to 12 months, 18 months and 24 months
In this study, participants were stratified according to HER2 status at the time of enrollment. HER2-negative participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either stratum 1 (AC-\>T sequential + bevacizumab) or stratum 2 (TAC + bevacizumab). All HER2-positive participants were assigned to stratum 3 (TCH + bevacizumab).

The study included a treatment period of 1 year, followed by a 2 year posttreatment survival follow-up period.
