A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of RO7759065 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Atezolizumab in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human Phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RO7759065 as a single agent (Phase Ia) or in combination with atezolizumab (Phase Ib) in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable solid tumor malignancies. Several key aspects of the study design and study population are summarized below.
