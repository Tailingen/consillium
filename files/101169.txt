Eribulin in Brain Metastases From HER2-negative Breast Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy of eribulin for treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM)
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin
Efficacy of eribulin for treatment of HER2-negative BCBM, By estimating central nervous system (CNS) objective response rate per RANO-BM criteria. CNS objective response rate will be defined as the rate of patients with a partial response or a complete response as defined by RANO-BM criteria (Lin et al. 2015), from inclusion until 30 days after completion of treatment
Safety of Eribulin in this population, Toxicity will be evaluated before every chemotherapy infusion according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria. All treatment-related adverse events will be collected. The rate of grade 3 to 5 adverse events will be analyzed, from Eribulin initiation until 30 days after completion of treatment|Time to WBRT (cohort A and B), Time to WBRT will be defined as the time from Eribulin initiation to WBRT start, from Eribulin initiation to the time of the first dose of whole brain radiation therapy - up to 28 months|CNS progression-free survival, CNS progression-free survival will be defined as the time from Eribulin initiation to CNS disease progression according to RANO-BM criteria or death from any cause, from Eribulin initiation until the date of first documented CNS disease progression or date of death from any cause - up to 28 months|Overall survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time from Eribulin initiation to death from any cause, from Eribulin initiation to death|Change in cognitive function, Cognitive function will be evaluated by self-report Fact-Cog v3.0 questionnaires (French validated version;(Joly et al. 2012)) that will have to be filled every two cycles (before every day 1 infusion), From Eribulin initiation up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation|Quality of life measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain Metastasis, Quality of life will be measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain Metastasis (FACT-Br v4.0, (Thavarajah et al. 2014)) questionnaire. This questionnaire will be filled every two cycles, From Eribulin initiation up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation
Progression-free survival for non-CNS disease, Extracranial progression-free survival will be defined as the time from Eribulin initiation to disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (Schwartz et al. 2016) or death from any cause. Thoracic and abdominal CT-scans will be performed as recommended in each participating center (usually every 6 weeks) to assess non CNS disease (extracranial PFS, non-CNS response rate, and clinical benefit). Non-CNS disease will be evaluated according to investigator assessment., from Eribulin initiation until the date of first documented extra-cranial disease progression or date of death from any cause - up to 28 months|Bi-compartmental progression-free survival (PFS), Bi-compartmental PFS will be defined as the time from Eribulin initiation to CNS disease progression according to RANO-BM criteria or non-CNS disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or death from any cause, from Eribulin initiation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause - up to 28 months|Overall response rate for extra-CNS disease, The overall response rate for non-CNS disease will be defined as the rate of patients with a partial response or a complete response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, from Eribulin initiation until 30 days after completion of treatment|Clinical benefit for both CNS and extra-CNS disease, The clinical benefit rate will be defined as the rate of patients with a partial response or a complete response or disease stabilization \> 6 months. Clinical benefit will be assessed for both CNS (using RANO-BM criteria) and non-CNS disease (using RECIST 1.1 criteria), separately, partial response or complete response or disease stabilization > 6 months|Eribulin efficacy according to hormone receptors expression, CNS objective response rates will be assessed according to hormone receptors expression (positive vs negative). A case will be defined as hormone receptors negative if both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression are expressed by less than 10% of tumor cells, from Eribulin initiation until 30 days after completion of treatment|Efficacy comparison between patients with and without non-CNS disease, CNS objective response rates will be assessed according the presence of non-CNS disease ('CNS only' vs 'not CNS only')., from Eribulin initiation until 30 days after completion of treatment
This study will explore eribulin in three specific cohorts of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer harboring BCBM, pretreated with anthracyclines and taxanes:

* Cohort A = Newly diagnosed, untreated BCBM, not candidate to initial surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and with pauci-symptomatic disease not requiring immediate whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
* Cohort B = BCBM pretreated with SRS and/or surgery alone, without WBRT, and not requiring immediate WBRT
* Cohort C = BCBM pretreated with WBRT
