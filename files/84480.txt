Part A of the study was a Phase 1/2a study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of different treatment regimens of Betalutin with expansion at the candidate recommended Phase 2 doses. Part B was a dedicated Phase 2b randomized substudy to further assess the efficacy and safety of the candidate recommended Phase II doses. Part C was a Phase 2a fixed dose expansion cohort planned to obtain supplementary pharmacokinetic data.
