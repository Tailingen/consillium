Intraoperative Flow Cytometry In Colorectal Cancer
This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of flow cytometry to accurately identify between normal and cancer cells in colon epithelium in humans diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: flow cytometry
Accuracy of intraoperative Flow Cytometry for cancer cell identification in colorectal cancer., Samples from cancer and normal colon epithelium are prospectively collected intraoperatively and assessed with intraoperative Flow Cytometry. Following comparative DNA content and phenotypic analysis, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is used to evaluate the performance of intraoperative Flow Cytometry to distinguish between normal and cancer tissue. The optimal cut-off value is determined to delineate the status of tumor tissue, resulting in the highest sensitivity and specificity and hence the optimal accuracy., 2017-2021
Tissue samples from normal and cancerous colon epithelium are collected intraoperatively following standard colectomy and analyzed blindly by flow cytometry, which reports, in less than 10 min, on the origin of the sample based in the estimation of DNA and tumor index.
