Study of Ibrutinib vs Placebo, in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine, in the First Line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (RESOLVE)
This is a phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed by investigator, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS, is defined as the time from date of randomization until date of death from any cause., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Ibrutinib and Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Versus Placebo in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine., This is a measure of percentage of subjects with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Grade 3 or above collected Up to 30 days after the last participating subject discontinues study drug., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months|Overall Response Rate, ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response, based on investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months|Clinical Benefit Response, Subject achieved a ≥50% reduction in pain intensity (Memorial Pain Assessment Card \[MPAC\]) or analgesic consumption, or a 20-point or greater improvement in KPS for a period of at least 4 consecutive weeks, without showing any sustained worsening in other parameters.

OR Subject was stable on all of the aforementioned parameters, and showed a marked, sustained weight gain (≥7% increase maintained for ≥4 weeks) not due to fluid accumulation (Burris 1997)., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months|Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Response, The CA19-9 response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with a decline of 20%, 90%, and other thresholds considered clinically meaningful, from baseline. This is a percentage of patients with \> or = 60% reduction from baseline., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months|Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30)., Unit is the month: TUDD1 - the time between random \& 1st occurrence of a decrease in QLQ-C30 score ≥10 pts w/o improvement in QoL score of ≥10 points or any further QoL data due to deterioration. The proportion of subjects who met the "responder" criteria prior to subsequent anticancer therapy initiation. Response defined as achievement of a ≥50% reduction in MPAC visual analog scale which measures pain intensity or analgesic consumption, or a ≥20-point improvement from baseline in KPS sustained for a period of ≥ 4 consecutive weeks without showing any sustained worsening from baseline in any of the other parameters OR Subject stable on all parameters (pain and KPS), \& showed a marked, sustained weight gain (≥7% increase from baseline maintained for ≥4 weeks) not due to fluid accumulation., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months|Rate of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE), The VTE rate is defined as percentage of subjects with Venous thromboembolic events (SMQ) per investigator assessment., Results at an overall median follow-up of 24.87 months
