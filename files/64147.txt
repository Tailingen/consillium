Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy as a Boost to the Prostate
In this study, participants will have standard Androgen Deprivation Therapy and undergo standard external beam radiation therapy to the prostate and at-risk lymph nodes by Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. The subsequent \*boost\* radiation therapy to the prostate alone will be given using the CyberKnife, rather than using the standard Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. This study will also see how CyberKnife affects the quality of the participant's life.

In this study, participants will have standard androgen deprivation therapy and undergo standard radiation therapy to the prostate and at-risk lymph nodes by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The subsequent \*boost\* radiation therapy to the prostate alone will be given using the CyberKnife, rather than using the standard Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. This study will also see how CyberKnife affects the quality of the participant's life.
