This is a single-center, open, single-arm clinical exploratory study to observe the safety and efficacy of cord blood derived CD19 CAR-NK cells sequential treatment with 7x19 CAR-T in relapse / refractory B cell lymphoma. This study consisted of two phases: phase I: CARNK cells preparation and infusion (Day0, dose of 2 x 10\^6 / kg). Phase II: 7x19 CAR-T cells preparation and infusion (Day7, dose 2Ã—10\^6/kg).
