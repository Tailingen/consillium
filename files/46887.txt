Phase II Trial of Carbon-ion Radiotherapy Combined With GM-CSF for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this research project is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy with concurrent granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: carbon-ion radiotherapy
Progression-free survival of all patients, Time in months measured from treatment initiation until the date of progression or the date of last follow-up., 2 year
Overall Survival, Time in months measured from treatment initiation until the date of death or the date of last follow-up., 2 year|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Time interval from the start of carbon-ion radiotherapy to 3 months after the completion of carbon-ion radiotherapy]|Objective responses rate, 3 months
Golden E.B. et al.in 2015 reported that localized radiotherapy granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced objective abscopal responses in solid tumor with metastasises. We hypothesize that hypofractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy combining granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) might improve the clinical response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint of the current phase II trial is progression-free survival rate at 2 years, secondary endpoints are overall survival, safety and toxicity.
