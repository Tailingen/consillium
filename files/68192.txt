A Phase 2 Study of Leronlimab in Combination With TAS-102 + Bevacizumab in Previously Treated Participants With mCRC
This is an open label, randomized, two arm, multi-center study to explore the effect of leronlimab on the overall response rate/ overall survival and safety and tolerability when used in combination with trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with CCR5+, MSS, mCRC who have progressed on prior treatment before participating in the study. The main questions this study aims to answer are:

1. Can leronlimab, in combination with standard of care therapies trifluridine and tipiracil+ bevacizumab, increase the objective response rate in persons with CCR5+, MSS, mCRC who have progressed on prior treatment before participating in the study.
2. Is leronlimab safe and well tolerated in these subjects when used in combination with standard of care therapies trifluridine and tipiracil+ bevacizumab.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
DRUG: 350 mg leronlimab|DRUG: 700 mg leronlimab
To evaluate the efficacy of leronlimab in combination with trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab in participants with CCR5+, refractory, MSS, mCRC., Efficacy will be measured as the effect on objective response rate (ORR) of leronlimab when used in combination with trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with CCR5+, refractory, MSS, mCRC.

ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with the best overall response (BOR) or confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST version 1.1., From enrolment through end of treatment at 12 months
To assess the safety and tolerability of leronlimab when used in combination with trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with CCR5+, refractory, MSS, mCRC., Treatment Emergent AE's (TEAE) are defined as events with an onset on or after the first treatment. TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, System Organ Class, and preferred term. The following TEAE summaries will be provided:

* All TEAEs
* TEAEs related to study drug.
* All TEAEs by severity
* Serious TEAEs
* Serious TEAEs related to study drug.
* TEAE reported in 5% or more participants in any treatment group.
* TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment.
* TEAEs leading to interruption of study treatment.
* TEAEs leading to death., From enrolment through end of treatment at 12 months.|To assess the duration of response of leronlimab in combination with trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab in participants with CCR5+, MSS, mCRC, The time from the first documentation of response, either partial or complete, to the documentation of the objective tumor progression or until death due to any cause., From enrolment through end of treatment at 12 months.
This is an open label, randomized, two arm, multi-center study to explore the effect of leronlimab on the overall response rate/ overall survival and the safety and tolerability when used in combination with trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with CCR5+, MSS, relapsed refractory, mCRC who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if RAS wild-type and medically appropriate, an anti-EGFR therapy.

This study will enroll approximately 60 participants, 30 participants in each of two arms evaluating either 350 mg or 700 mg of leronlimab, who are 18 years of age or older, with histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer that is microsatellite stable (MSS) and CCR5+ (confirmed by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to each arm, where approximately 30 participants will receive 350 mg of leronlimab + trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab and approximately 30 will receive 700 mg of leronlimab + trifluridine and tipiracil + bevacizumab.
