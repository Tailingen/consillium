Objective response rate (ORR) measured by number of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized participants for each treatment group, 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS) measured by the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the Blinded Independent Central Review, or death, due to any cause, whichever occurs first, 34 months
Overall survival (OS) measured by the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause, Approximately 5 years|Number of treatment-related adverse events (AE), Approximately 5 years|Number of treatment-related serious adverse events, Approximately 5 years
