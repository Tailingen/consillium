Clinical Evaluation, Motor Performance and Quality of Life in Patients Affected by Soft Tissue Sarcomas, Undergoing Surgical Treatment: Observational Study
The main aim of the study is evaluate quality of life and motor performance of patients with soft tissue sarcomas undergoing surgical treatment and post-operative rehabilitation treatment.

Primary objectives:

* Identification of clinical characteristics and motor damage after surgery for soft tissue sarcomas;
* Impact of perioperative treatments and surgery on the quality of life of patients with soft tissue sarcomas;
* Impact of post-operative rehabilitation treatment on quality of life and recovery of motor activity The primary endpoint will be the improvement in the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) between T1 (post-surgery) and T3 (at the end of rehabilitation treatment).

Secondary endpoints will be:

1. the evolution over the various timepoints of the selected rating scales (Toronto Extremity Salvage Score, Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Rating Scale, Numerical Rating Scale, Brief Pain Questionnaire, Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Scale, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, Short Form Health Survey 36);

• The change in walking performance before and after the rehabilitation treatment.
