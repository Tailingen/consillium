If they can perform the task, they will then be asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible. The time to complete the task will be recorded., Baseline, 3 months, 12 months and 24 months|Standing Balance Test, Participants will be asked to maintain balance for up to 30 seconds in three positions characterized by a progressive narrowing of the base support., Baseline, 3 months, 12 months and 24 months|Gait Speed Test, Participants will be instructed to start at a marked walking course with toes touching the start line and when cued to start, will begin walking at their ususal speed. The time to walk from the starting line to the end of the 4-meter walk will be recorded., Baseline, 3 months, 12 months and 24 months|Grip Strength, Grip strength is assessed with an isometric handgrip dynamometer while the participant is sitting with the head facing straight ahead.

840 women aged ≥18 years old scheduled to receive chemotherapy for Stage I-III breast cancer and a comparison population of 160 women without cancer (1,000 total). Equal numbers of women will be recruited aged \< 52 vs. \> 52. At baseline, innovative MRI measures of CV function (LV and aorta); measurements of submaximal (6-minute walk) and, on 45% of the cohort, maximal (peak VO2) exercise capacity; questionnaire data to assess fatigue and behavioral and psychosocial risk factors; and biomarkers will be collected.

Measurements will be repeated at 3±1, 12±2 and 24±2 months. This study will assess the relevance of pre-existing factors such as age, black/white race, hypertension, smoking (yes/no), diabetes, coronary artery disease, menopause status, CV medications, and physical activity on the study outcomes. Also, this study will assess dynamic change in modifiable CV risk factors (including BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, serum glucose, physical activity, psychosocial factors, lifestyle behaviors), and the cancer treatment including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery.
