A Study of Mycobacterium w Plus Docetaxel for Hormone Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This study proposed the comparison the overall survival, hematological toxicity, pain reduction score,PSA levels, tumor response, quality of life in two arms of HRPC patients from different parts of India.
Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Mycobacterium w.|DRUG: Docetaxel
Median Survival time, 12 months|Time to Tumor Progression, 12 Months
hematological toxicity, PSA levels, Quality of Life, 12 months
Prostate Cancer is a common health issue facing men worldwide in most of the patients cancer will shrink with hormonal therapy. In some cases cancer returns or continues to grow despite very low levels of circulating male hormones, which is called Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer (AIPC) or Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC). Mycobacterium w is known to share multiple antigen including PSA. It administration is associated with antigen specific generation of cell mediated immunity. Docetaxel is found to useful in management of metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer, which is associated with improved survival, tumor progression free survival with reduction in pain, serum PSA and improvement in quality of life. Cyclophosphamide 300mg/sq.m will be used to eliminate T-regulatory cell responsible immuno suppression. The vaccine Mycobacterium w will be administered on a day following cyclophosphamide. For better initiation of immune responses Docetaxel will be given seven days following first dose of Mycobacterium w.
