Biomarkers of Androgen Response and Resistance In Evolution During a Rising PSA
This is an open-label phase 2 multi-center study of abiraterone and enzalutamide in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Sixteen patients will be enrolled over 18 months.
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone + prednisone|DRUG: Enzalutamide
Change in expression of androgen receptor abnormalities (e.g. ARV7, AR mutations) following abiraterone/enzalutamide treatment, The change in protein expression of androgen receptor (AR7) splice variant and AR / AR pathway mutations as a mechanism of resistance to abiraterone/enzalutamide is evaluated by measuring the difference in a quantitative immunohistochemical biomarker between assays performed before and after treatment., 18 months
Rate of PSA increase, 18 months|Time to PSA progression, PSA progression is defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 µg/L (2 ng/mL) above the nadir., 18 months
Number of participants with adverse events from the administration of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and prednisone to men with early stage prostate cancer., The number of participants experiencing adverse events will be evaluated to determine the safety of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and prednisone treatment in men with early stage prostate cancer, ., 18 months
