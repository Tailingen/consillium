Nivolumab Plus Epacadostat in Combination With Chemotherapy Versus the EXTREME Regimen in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (CheckMate 9NA/ECHO-310)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab plus epacadostat in combination with chemotherapy in first-line recurrent or metastatic patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) when compared to the standard of care (EXTREME regimen).
