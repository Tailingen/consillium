Plastic Stent Within a Lumen-Apposing Stent for Malignant Biliary Obstruction
There are doubts concerning the possible benefits derived from the insertion of double-pigtail plastic stents (DPS) within the lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) in the EUS-guided transmural biliary drainage (BD). The aims was to evaluate the safety of LAMS with and without a coaxial DPS in EUS-BD for the palliative management in malignant biliary obstruction.

DEVICE: Endoscopic biliary transmural drainage
Potential benefits, to respond if a coaxial DPS within a biliary LAMS really has a potential benefit in the EUS-BD (less number of adverse events: cholangitis, bleeding, sump syndrome, cholestasis secondary to stent biliary obstruction), 4 weeks
Technical success, Technical success was defined as a successful stent placement between the extrahepatic bile duct and duodenal lumen in a single step approach and determined by endoscopy and fluoroscopy, 24 hours|Clinical success, Clinical success was defined as a reduction in bilirubin by 50% at 2-weeks after stent placement, meaning that the biliary stent was functional., 4 weeks|Procedure time, Procedure time was defined from the insertion of the endoscope to its removal., 2 hours|Biliary reintervention, Biliary reintervention: the need to perform additional interventions to achieve biliary drainage., 6 months
