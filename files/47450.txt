Association Between Telomere Length and Cardiac Dysfunction
Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of relative telomere length (RTL) are associated with cardiac dysfunction caused by chemotherapy in children with acute leukemia (AL).The aim of this study was to explore association between RTL content in peripheral blood cells could be used as a risk predictor for severity of cardiac damage.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Relative telomere length
Relative telomere length, The ratio of RTL to hemoglobin contents was calculated for each sample from standard curves. After that, the ratio for each sample was normalized to a calibrator DNA in order to standardize between different runs, and then defined as the measurement of relative mtDNA contents.Relative expression of mtDNA were measured in young adults suffered from AL., From date of admission until the date of discharging from hospital, assessed up to 5 days
