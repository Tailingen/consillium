Bone Microstructure by Using HR-pQCT After Esophagectomy
Esophagectomy is most curative treatment to esophageal cancer. However, osteoporosis , which is characterized by both the loss of bone mass and the deterioration of bone architecture, is a serious complication in the long course after surgery. The aim of the present study was to evaluate osteoporosis by using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in the long course after esophagectomy. At least 3 years should have elapsed since operation without recurrence of esophageal cancer.

PROCEDURE: esophagectomy
Comparing bone microstructure in control and Esophagectomy groups, volumetric bone mineral density, 1day
Comparing bone microstructure with serum biomarkers of osteoporosis, Correlation between bone mineral density in esophagectomy and biomarkers (25-hydroxyvitaminD, calcium, iPTH, P1NP, ICTP, TRACP5b), 1day|Comparing bone microstructure with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Correlation of bone mineral density between esophagectomy and DXA, 1day
The patients after esophagectomy loss appetite and decrease the weight. Esophagectomy especially cause severe sarcopenia and metabolic change. Osteoporosis, which is characterized by both the loss of bone mass and the deterioration of bone architecture, is a serious complication in the long course after esophagectomy. The primary tools for assessing volumetric density and bone structure are quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and more recently, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). However the validation of osteoporosis with HR-pQCT in the long course after esophagectomy remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to evaluate osteoporosis by using HR-pQCT in the long course after esophagectomy. At least 3 years should have elapsed since esophagectomy without any recurrence.
