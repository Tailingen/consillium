A Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in Combination With Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
A Randomized, Phase II Study of ivonescimab or cadonilimab or penpulimab in Combination With Cisplatin and Nab-paclitaxel in Patients With locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) eligible for resection.

This proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration of ivonescimab or cadonilimab or penpulimab combined with chemotherapy in HNSCC who are eligible for resection.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Ivonescimab combined with TP|DRUG: Cadonilimab combined with TP|DRUG: Penpulimab combined with TP
pCR, Pathological complete response rate, After surgery (approximately 9-10 weeks after start of study treatment)
MPR, major pathological remission, After surgery (approximately 9-10 weeks after start of study treatment)
ORR, objective response rate, 9-10 weeks|EFS, event free survival, 1 years|OS, overall survival, 2 years
In this study, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either the ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy treatment group (Cohort 1), or the cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy treatment group (Cohort 2), or the penpulimab combined with chemotherapy treatment group (Cohort 3). Pathological response rate will be the primary outcome measures. Adverse events will also be recorded.
