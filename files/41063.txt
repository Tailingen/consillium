Venetoclax, Daratumumab, and Dexamethasone for Systemic Light-Chain Amyloidosis With Translocation (11;14) (ALTITUDE)
This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of venetoclax, daratumumab, and dexamethasone for the treatment of systemic light-chain amyloidosis in patients with a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) abnormality called a translocation involving chromosomes 11 and 14, or "t(11;14)". Venetoclax works by attaching to a protein called Bcl-2, in order to kill cancer cells. Daratumumab works by binding to a target on the surface of cancer cells called Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38). When daratumumab binds to CD38, it enables the immune system to find the cancer cell and kill it. Dexamethasone is a type of drug called a corticosteroid. A corticosteroid is a drug made of artificial steroid hormones, that are used to treat symptoms such as inflammation (swelling and irritation to a part of the body). The combination of these medications may more effectively treat patients with systemic light-chain amyloidosis and t(11;14).

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study. If dose level 3 (VEN/DARA SC and DEX) is not the recommended phase 2 doses/maximum tolerated dose in phase 1, the study will not open to phase 2.

PHASE I: All participants receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Depending on dose-level assignment, participants may also receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle with or without daratumumab SC on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2, days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, then on day 1 of cycles thereafter. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PHASE II: Participants receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle, dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, and daratumumab SC on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycles 1-2, days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, then on day 1 of cycles thereafter. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months until the last participant on the study completes 2 years of treatment.
