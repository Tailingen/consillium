Evaluation of Preoperative Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in Patients With Brain Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of using an imaging technique called breath-holding functional magnetic resonance imaging (BH fMRI) in addition to the standard imaging test described above. This study will allow the researchers to find out whether using BH fMRI in combination with the standard approach is the same as, better, or worse than the standard approach used alone.
Brain Tumor
DEVICE: fMRI Paradigms
Number of patients that have false negative results, The primary objective is to examine if the false negative results of BOLD fMRI adjacent to brain tumors can be compensated for by measurements of BH-MRI and subsequent calibration of the BOLD response. We will have two sets of data: 1) the data obtained using routine techniques to analyze the BOLD fMRI data; and 2) the data obtained where the BOLD fMRI data was analyzed incorporating BH data. Every data point obtained in 1) will have a corresponding data point using 2), the BH MRI data, to adjust the BOLD fMRI analysis., 2 years
