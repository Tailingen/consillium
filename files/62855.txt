Evaluation of Cyberknife Precision Radiation Delivery System for Unresectable Malignant Lung Cancer
This study has two primary objectives. The first objective is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) that can be delivered with stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with inoperable malignant lung tumors. Once the MTD is established, the second objective is to determine the efficacy of radiosurgical ablation of lung tumors in terms of symptoms and radiographic responses.
