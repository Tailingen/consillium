Studying Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Previously Enrolled on Clinical Trial POG-9421
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia previously enrolled on clinical trial POG-9421.
Leukemia
GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: microarray analysis|GENETIC: proteomic profiling|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Profiling of basal and potentiated phospho-protein networks (PPPNs) using tissue samples|Classification of AML-based signal transduction mechanisms|Correlation of basal and PPPN profiles with specific molecular lesions (e.g., FLT3-ITD, NPM, WT1, c-kit, CEPBα, PASGΔ75, and karyotype) and gene expression profiles.
OBJECTIVES:

* To profile basal and potentiated phospho-protein networks (PPPNs) using tissue samples from pediatric patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) previously enrolled on clinical trial POG-9421.
* To classify AML-based signal transduction mechanisms.
* To correlate profiles of basal and PPPNs with specific molecular lesions (e.g., FLT3-ITD, NPM, WT1, c-kit, CEPBα, PASGΔ75, and karyotype) and profiles of gene expression in tumor tissue samples.

OUTLINE: Banked tissue samples are collected for laboratory studies, including phospho-protein signaling and gene expression profiling studies.
