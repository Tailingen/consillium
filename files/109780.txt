Preoperative mFOLFIRINOX (or Gem-Nab-P) +/- Isotoxic High-dose SBRT for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer with the aim of curative R0 resection and related improvement of survival. As a standard, surgery is usually followed by adjuvant therapy that improves survival but neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is a rapidly emerging concept that needs to be explored and validated in terms of therapeutic options in borderline resectable pancreatic tumors. In this setting, preoperative FFX seems to be feasible and can be prolonged by radiation therapy. However, the exact and best therapeutic sequence is not yet known and the additional role of adding isotoxic high-dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (iHD-SBRT) to chemotherapy requires validation in randomised trials. We propose to evaluate the impact and efficacy of adding iHD-SBRT to preoperative neoadjuvant mFFX or Gem-NabP in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic Neoplasm|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: mFOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel|RADIATION: Isotoxic High-Dose (iHD)-SBRT|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Disease free survival, Defined as time from randomisation to the first documentation of event where events considered are 1) disease progression, per RECIST, prior to surgery, 2) discovery of hepatic or peritoneal carcinomatosis during surgical exploration, 3) recurrent disease following R0-R1 surgery, or 4) death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks|R0 Resection rate, Defined as the proportion of eligible randomised patients in whom a R0 resection was achieved during surgery after neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX +/- iHD-SBRT. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection (\>1 mm) from the inked margins (pancreatic transection, vascular and posterior circumferential resection margins)., up to 12 months
Resection rate, defined as the percentage of eligible randomised patients that underwent a curative-intent resection, up to 12 months|Pathologic complete/major response (pCR), Defined as the proportion of patients in whom a pCR or a major (\<10% of residual tumour cells) was confirmed by histopathologic review of the surgical specimen., up to 12 months|Complete feasibility of the therapeutic sequence, Defined as the proportion of patient who performed completely the neoadjuvant therapeutic sequence with mFFX (or Gem-Nab-P) +/- iHD-SBRT until surgery (abdominal exploration with or without pancreatectomy). The therapeutic sequence will not be considered as feasible if less than 60% of patients do not complete it until surgery., up to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time interval between randomisation and death. 95% confidence interval will be estimated based on standard method., Defined as the time interval between randomisation and death, assessed up to 60 months|Locoregional failure free interval (LFFI), defined as the time interval between the randomisation and the date of locoregional failure. A locoregional failure is any progressive or recurrent pancreatic cancer in the original tumour location or the N1-2 lymph node areas, defined as the time interval between the randomisation and the 1st documented date of locoregional failure, assessed up to 60 months|Distant metastases free interval (DMFI), defined as the period of time without distant metastasis after randomisation., defined as the period of time without distant metastasis after randomisation, assessed up to 60 months|Toxicity, Incidence of adverse events, assessed per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 and the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the CTCAE, up to 24 months|Postoperative complications, defined according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and definitions of post-pancreatic surgery complications (pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying and bleeding) by the International study group on Pancreatic Surgery., up to 12 months|Quality of life (QoL) assessment - General, assessed per EORTC General Quality of life of Cancer patient questionnaire QLQ-C30 version 3.0 (minimum value: 30 - maximum value: 126; higher score associated with worse QoL outcome)., up to 24 months|Quality of life (QoL) assessment - Pancreatic cancer, assessed per EORTC Quality of life of Pancreatic Cancer patient questionnaire QLQ-PAN26 (minimum value: 26 - maximum value: 104; higher score associated with worse QoL outcome)., up to 24 months|Quality of life (QoL) assessment - Depression, assessed per the depression test : Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; minimum value: 0 - maximum value: 27; higher score associated with worse QoL outcome), up to 24 months|Technical and quality success rate of EUS-delivered fiducials., The technical success is defined as at least one marker presumed to be inside the tumour at the end of the EUS procedure. The quality success is defined as a score equal or higher than 6/12 points based on the 5 items quality score defined in \[Figueiredo M, Bouchart C et al 2021\]., up to 12 months
STEREOPAC is an multicenter, academic, prospective, randomised comparative, interventional study.

Patients receive 4 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX (or Gem-Nab-P)\*. A full restaging (clinical, morphologic imaging, vascular involvement, biologics, CA 19.9) is performed. Non-progressive patients will be randomised (1:1) to

ARM A for receiving 4 additional cycles of chemo followed by surgery.

or to

ARM B for receiving 5th and 6th cycles of chemo then iHD-SBRT followed by a 7th (and optional 8th cycle) followed by surgery.

\*: in case of CI or intolerance to mFFX, Gem-Nab-P regimen can be chosen or shifted to for 6 doses, then restaging, and then 3 doses followed by SBRT or 6 doses and immediate surgery)

Adjuvant chemotherapy administration is indicated unless the patient's condition precludes it.
