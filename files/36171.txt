Fibroscan Evaluating Immunotherapy Response in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The goal of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate the role of transient elastography (Fibroscan) in predicting the response of immunotherapy in advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

Researchers will predict the response to 6 months of HCC immunotherapy regarding improvement of the degree of liver fibrosis, development of liver decompensation, complications, survival, and mortality.

Participants will undergo history-taking, clinical examination, laboratory investigations, Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, BCLC staging, abdominal ultrasonography, Triphasic CT abdomen with contrast or MRI (for evaluation of tumor site, size and number), and Fibroscan examination at baseline and follow-up after 6 months.
