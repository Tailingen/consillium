AUD Biomarkers Study (Proteomic and Genomic Analysis of Biospecimens)
Study purpose: to explore the entire spectrum of proteomic and genomic changes (amongst others) involved in diseases and in healthy/control populations. The Study is designed to discover biomarkers, develop and validate diagnostic assays, instruments and therapeutics as well as other medical research. Specifically, researchers may analyze proteins, RNA, DNA copy number changes, including large and small (1,000-100,000 kb) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both diseased tissue and case-matched germline DNA from Subjects.

OTHER: Observational Study Only. NO Intervention.
Enrollment and collection totals for a diverse population of subjects/conditions involved in diseases and in healthy/control populations., We will total the number of subjects and characterize the totals by disease state, gender, ethnicity and specimens contributed, Through study completion, an average of once per year
The primary objective of this Study is to collect high-quality tissue, whole teeth, and biofluid Specimens, and associated Clinical Data from consented Subjects.

The secondary objective of this Study is to test Specimens and associated Clinical Data to confirm pathology diagnosis and correlation of microscopic evaluation with the provided information, to assess RNA and DNA integrity or degradation, and provide overall quality control evaluations.
