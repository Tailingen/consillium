A Study Comparing Treatment Preference Between Oral Decitabine/Cedazuridine and Azacitidine in Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Low-Blast Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
It is hypothesized that significantly more patients would prefer oral decitabine/cedazuridine to subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine (AZA) due to several factors, including improved treatment convenience, the reduced risk of nosocomial infections, and reduced treatment discomfort. However, this hypothesis has not been formally studied in a controlled setting. This study aims to address this evidence gap and evaluate patient, primary caregiver (carer), and clinician treatment preference between oral decitabine/cedazuridine and SC AZA in the treatment of adult patients with International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) intermediate, IPSS intermediate-2, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or low-blast (LB) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and thereby lend further credibility to the clinical, economic, and patient value of oral decitabine/cedazuridine.
