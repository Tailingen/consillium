BEHAVIORAL: Culturally Aware Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy (AET) Non-Initiation Intervention
Program Feasibility, Feasibility will be demonstrated by enrollment (\>50% of eligible and approached patients will enroll), retention (\>70% of enrolled participants will complete the two intervention sessions) and attendance (â‰¥70% of participants completing at least one session)., Up to 3 months/12 weeks|Program Acceptability, Acceptability will be demonstrated by \>75% of participants reporting average satisfaction scores greater than the mid-point of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. The total score range is 3-12, with higher scores indicating a better outcome., Up to 3 months/12 weeks
Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) Initiation, Following the intervention, participants will be more likely to have started their AET. AET initiation will be measured by self-reported questionnaire., Baseline (within 1-week of consent), 1-month, and 3-months post-baseline
This is a single-arm pilot trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a patient-centered, evidence-based, culturally competent, nurse-led intervention to encourage breast cancer survivors who have not begun taking adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) to initiate the medication.

The research study procedures include:

* screening for eligibility
* two individual study intervention sessions
* study assessment follow-up questionnaires

This research study involves two individual sessions with a nurse practitioner which will take place via videoconferencing sessions either in-person or via telephone. Participants will also complete three brief questionnaire packets over the 12-week course of the study.

It is expected that up to 35 people will take part in this research study. The investigators plan to enrich the study sample for patients of a racial and/or ethnic minority in order to ensure the generalizability of the study findings.
