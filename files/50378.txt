Neuroprotective Effects of Lithium in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy to the Brain
This phase I/II trial studies the effects and safety of giving lithium carbonate (lithium) to patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing radiation therapy to the brain (PCI; prophylactic cranial irradiation). PCI is used to prevent cancer metastases from returning in the brain. This treatment can cause short-term memory problems by damaging the hippocampus. Lithium may help prevent or lessen memory problems caused by PCI by protecting the hippocampus.
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Lithium Carbonate|RADIATION: Prophylactic cranial irradiation
Safety of Lithium Carbonate as Measured by Number of Patients in the Safety lead-in Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), -Graded and described using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4. Safety will be defined as \< 2 patients experiencing DLTs of the first 6 treated., 3 weeks|Immediate Recall Memory Deterioration as Measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Immediate Recall (HVLT-IR) Total Score, * The HVLT is a word learning test measuring episodic visual memory
* The immediate recall memory deterioration test portion consists of 36 words split into 3 sections (animals, gemstones, places of shelter, types of birds, tools, items of clothing, kitchen utensils,weapons, and alcoholic beverages)
* The words were read aloud and the participants was asked to freely recall them immediately. The list was read a second time followed by a second free recall trial. This was followed by a third reading and third free recall.
* The words recalled for each trial were recorded and a total recall score tallied (range: 0-36).
* The higher the score the better the recall, 3 months
