Study to Assess Safety and Tolerability of Oral CC-115 for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, and Hematologic Malignancies.
The main purpose of this first human study with CC-115 is to assess the safety and action of a new class of experimental drug (dual DNA-PK and TOR kinase inhibitors) in patients with advanced tumors unresponsive to standard therapies and to determine the appropriate dose and tumor types for later-stage clinical trials. The bioavailability of tablet and capsule formulations under fasting and fed conditions will also be evaluated in some patients.

Pharmacodynamics, Phosphorylation inhibition determined by changes in the levels of multiple biomarkers including S6 and, 4EBP (for mTORC1), AKT (for mTORC2) and other appropriate biomarkers in circulating granulocytes and tumor tissue (when available)., Screening (within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug) and Days 1, 2, 8, 15, 22, 28, 155, and end of treatment|Anti-Tumor Efficacy, Tumor response rates using appropriate objective criteria for various malignancies, Every 2-3 months until proof of tumor progression
Latest amendment clarifies that Chronic Lymophocytic Leukemia (CLL) includes T-cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia (T-PLL). Prior treatment with some drugs targeting mTOR, P13K and related pathways is now permitted.
