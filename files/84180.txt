Surgical Resection With or Without Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Treating Women With Node-Negative Breast Cancer and Sentinel Lymph Node Micrometastases
RATIONALE: Surgery to remove lymph nodes in the armpit in patients with sentinel lymph node micrometastases may remove cancer cells that have spread from tumors in the breast. It is not yet known whether surgery to remove the primary tumor is more effective with or without axillary lymph node dissection.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery and axillary lymph node dissection to see how well they work compared to surgery alone in treating women with node-negative breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Axillary lymph node dissection|PROCEDURE: No axillary lymph node dissection
5-year Disease-Free Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where disease-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to first evidence of invasive relapse at any site, second primary tumor (contralateral or non-breast) or death., 5-year estimate reported after a median follow-up of 60 months
5-year Overall Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause., 5-year estimate reported after a median follow-up of 60 months|Site of Recurrence, Site of recurrence of breast cancer, Reported after a median follow-up of 60 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare disease-free survival of women with clinically node-negative breast cancer with sentinel lymph node micrometastases treated with surgical resection with or without axillary dissection.
* Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Assess sites of recurrence, particularly reappearance of disease in the undissected axilla.
* Assess long-term surgical complications in patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, menopausal status (pre- vs postmenopausal), and preoperative sentinel node biopsy (yes vs no). Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.
