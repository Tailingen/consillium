Safety and Efficacy Study of Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) Therapy in Patients With Advanced or Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to verify the safety and clinical benefit of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment of advanced or unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Safety and feasibility of PEF treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
* Locoregional control of ablated lesions and quality of life assessment.
* Local and peripheral immunoregulation effect.
