Study to Evaluate Imetelstat in Patients With High-Risk MDS or AML Failing HMA-based Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of hematologic improvement, and safety of imetelstat in participants with high-risk (HR) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is relapsed/refractory to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) treatment. Responding patients are eligible to continue treatment until loss of response/disease progression.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Imetelstat sodium
Overall Hematological Response Rate of Participants after Treatment with Imetelstat, The combined response assessment criteria for MDS and AML based on IWG 2018 criteria (MDS) and the criteria of the European LeukemiaNet (AML) will be used to define responders.

The response rate is calculated as number of responders divided by the number of all participants of the analysis set., After 4 Months of Treatment
