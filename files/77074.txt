[18F]FPIA PET-CT in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults and has an extremely poor prognosis. Glioblastoma is the most common subtype and its most aggressive form, with an annual incidence of 3.19 cases per 100,000.

The aim of this study is to quantify the degree of fatty acid oxidation in 20 participants diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that have undergone surgical resection throughout the course of their chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment.

The investigators hypothesise that the parameters derived from longitudinal 18F-fluoropivalate (18F-FPIA) positron emission tomography (PET) will change predictably over the course of therapy in relation to response.

Twenty evaluable participants with histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following surgical resection that are due to undergo treatment with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) will be enrolled into the study. The patients invited to participate in the study will provide written informed consent, but will only undergo 18F-FPIA positron emission tomography-computerised tomography (PET-CT) imaging once they have satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once these criteria have been satisfied, eligible participants will proceed with a 18F-FPIA PET-CT post-surgical resection/prior to CRT, mid-therapy (\~4-6 weeks from the start of CRT, and at the end of CRT treatment (\~10-14 weeks from the end of treatment).

All the participants that are enrolled in the study will have undergone surgical resection as part of their routine clinical care from which a tissue diagnosis will be confirmed.

On the scan date, the participants will undergo a blood test to measure plasma concentrations of carnitine. During the scan, a single dose of 18F-FPIA (maximum, 370MBq) intravenous (IV) will be administered to the participant followed by a whole brain static PET-CT scan 40 minutes post-injection.
