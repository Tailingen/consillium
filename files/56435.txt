The research data will be collected using the "Individual Information Form" and the "Beck Hopelessness Scale" prepared by the researchers in line with the literature., Individual Information Form: The form prepared by the researchers consists of 14 questions.

Beck Hopelessness Scale: The Beck Hopelessness Scale was developed by Beck and colleagues in 1974 to determine the degree of pessimism an individual has about the future. The scale consists of 20 items in a five-point Likert format. The questions are answered as true or false and reflect negative expectations. Each answer that matches the given key scores 1 point, while answers that do not match score 0 points. The total score obtained is considered the "hopelessness" score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of hopelessness. The scale's score range is 0-20. The questions on the scale cover emotional, motivational, and cognitive dimensions. The scale consists of three factors: "Feelings about the Future," "Loss of Motivation," and "Future Expectations" (Durak \& Palabıyıkoğlu, 1994). In this study, the Cronbach's Alpha value for hopelessness was calculated as 0.952., The research data were collected through face-to-face and telephone interviews after obtaining ethical committee approval. The time required for individuals to complete the forms is approximately 10 minutes.
Reiki is considered a complementary and alternative therapy method that can be effective in coping with such emotional challenges and enhancing psychological well-being. It is thought that Reiki practices, by regulating the flow of energy and providing deep relaxation, can reduce individuals' levels of hopelessness and improve overall quality of life. This study will investigate the effect of Reiki practices on the levels of hopelessness in oncology patients.
