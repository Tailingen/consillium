Quantitative Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test in Symptomatic Patients
The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of three (3) quantitative immunochemical faecal occult blood test in symptomatic patients.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DEVICE: fecal occult blood test
Number of patients with high fecal blood output in relation to colorectal cancer, Accuracy of diagnosis in colorectal cancer, Up to 36 months
Number of patients with low fecal blood output in relation to colorectal polyps, Accuracy of diagnosis of colorectal polyps, Up to 36 months
Consecutive patients referred from primary care for colonoscopy due to symptoms are eligible. Patients will receive written information of the study together with the time for colonoscopy. A specific research nurse will call them and for those accepting participation, history and current medication will be collected. Kits will be sent to patients and they will provide three faecal samples before examination. These will be analysed at one certified laboratory.

Hemoglobin concentration will be notified in the range of 50 - \< 1000 ng/mL, or as a negative outcome.

Macroscopic findings at the colonoscopy will be collected, as well as the outcome of the pathological report.
