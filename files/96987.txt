Treatment Optimization in Patients With Untreated Multiple Myeloma
This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, 2-arm phase IIb trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide maintenance after Bortezomib/Melphalan/Prednison (VMP) induction to VMP without maintenance (Placebo). In addition the trial will assess the treatment of Revlimid/low dose Dexamethasone (Rd) as Salvage after VMP without sufficient response (less than PR) in an observational arm. Key eligibility criteria include patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and who are 65 years of age or older or are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients with poor performance status or serious coexistent medical conditions will be excluded from this study. After registration all patients receive 6 cycles VMP (modified according to Mateos et al.). Patients who receive at least a PR and completed VMP can be randomized to either Lenalidomide 10 mg/d continuously maintenance or to placebo. Randomization will be stratified according to the quality of response after VMP induction (PR vs. VGPR + stringent complete remission \[sCR\] + CR). Patients that are not able to complete VMP due to toxicity but reached at least a PR after a minimum of four cycles of therapy should immediately proceed to randomization. Blinded phase continues until progression or end of study. After unblinding, patients who received placebo should be treated with Rd.

Patients that do not reach PR after induction with VMP or are progressive during treatment with VMP should not be randomized, but switched to the observation arm and treated with Rd immediately. The study treatment ends with the confirmed progression on maintenance treatment (Lenalidomide or placebo) for patients that reached PR with induction treatment, or with the confirmed progression on second-line therapy with RevlimidÂ® and Dexamethasone for patients that did not reach PR on induction treatment. All patients will be followed up every 3 months after end of study treatment, until end of study. The study ends two years after Last Patient In (i.e. randomization for maintenance) if sufficient events for the primary endpoint were received, but not later than 8 years after trial initiation (whatever comes first).

Primary objective

- Estimate the gain in progression-free survival (PFS) by maintenance with Lenalidomide after induction with VMP in elderly patients or patients unfit for highdose chemotherapy in comparison with placebo after VMP

Secondary study objectives

* To compare response rates of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo
* To compare overall survival probabilities between patients treated with Lenalidomide maintenance and patients without maintenance treatment
* To compare the safety of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo
* To compare the QoL of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo
* To assess the safety and efficacy of Rd for poor responders on VMP
