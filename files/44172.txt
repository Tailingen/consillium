Study Of Eribulin (E7389) In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors And Normal Or Reduced Hepatic Function As Per Child-Pugh System
This is an open-label, three-parallel group pharmacokinetic study. Patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to one of three groups to receive I.V. doses of eribulin (E7389). The three groups are: normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) according to the Child-Pugh System for classifying hepatic impairment.

Lesions measured by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Objective response rate: complete response (CR-disappearance of all lesions)+ partial response (PR-30% decrease in lesion diameter), Progressive Disease (PD-20% increase in lesion diameter), stable disease (SD-neither shrinkage nor increase of lesions)., throughout the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug
