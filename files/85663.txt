DLBCL is a highly common malignant tumor in Asia. The aim of the study is to observe and explore the clinical information on DLBCL patients with different genetic subtypes and to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of different molecular subtypes of DLBCL. This study is a non-interventional real world, observational study and all registered data are collected from real clinical practice cases. The medical data includes patient demographic, tumor characteristics, laboratory examination, history of treatments, adverse reactions, efficacy results and possible prognostic factors. The results can guide future precision therapy for DLBCL.
