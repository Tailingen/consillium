A Study of Relatlimab Plus Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab Alone in Participants With Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether relatlimab in combination with nivolumab is more effective than nivolumab by itself in treating unresectable melanoma or melanoma that has spread.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Relatlimab|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented tumor progression, assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR) (per RECIST v1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death., From randomization to date of first documented tumor progression or death (up to approximately 33 months)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. For subjects that are alive, their survival time will be censored at the date of last contact ("last known alive date")., From randomization to the date of death (up to approximately 3 years)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of randomized subjects who achieve a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on BICR assessments (using RECIST v1.1 criteria)., From randomization up to approximately 3 years
The Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), The number of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs).

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 33 months)|The Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The number of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs).

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event., From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 33 months)|The Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation, The number of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation.

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 33 months)|The Number of Participant Deaths in the Study, The number of participant deaths in the study., From first dose up to approximately 33 months|The Number of Participants Experiencing Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Liver Tests, The number of participants with clinical laboratory test abnormalities in specific liver tests based on US conventional units., From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 33 months)|The Number of Participants Experiencing Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Thyroid Tests, The number of participants with clinical laboratory test abnormalities in specific thyroid tests based on US conventional units., From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 33 months)
