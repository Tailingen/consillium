Single Ultra-high Dose Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Early Lung Cancer
The goal of this prospective single-arm phase II study is to study the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early lung cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

How effective is this regimen of SBRT for early lung cancer? How safe is this regimen of SBRT for early lung cancer?

The goal of this prospective single-arm phase II study is to study the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early lung cancer. This study intends to enroll 100 participants in 2 years. The participants enrolled will receive single fraction of ultra-high dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) (30Gy/1F).
