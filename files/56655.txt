Volume 3D_US Kidney
The purpose of this study is to measure the volume of the kidney and tumors using 3D-US acquisition and to correlate these measurements to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.

3D-US volume measurements, Kidney and renal tumor, 1 month
2D-US volume measurements, Kidney and renal tumor, 1 month|Inter and intra variability measurements, Kidney and renal tumor, 1 month|2D and 3D US volume measurements during Contrast-enhanced US (if performed for patient management), Kidney and renal tumor, 1 month
Additional objectives are comparison between true volume measurements and volume estimation using measurements of the three perpendicular diameters, comparison of inter and intra variability of 3D US measurements with inter and intra variability of 3D CT or MRI measurements, calculation of 3D and 2D volume measurements during contrast-enhanced US examination when the injection is performed for clinical routine purposes such as vascular and extension staging, during interventional procedures such as US guided biopsy targeting the non-necrotic tumour parenchyma. Concordance between 2D and 3D US acquisitions will be compared to CT and MRI measurements. Comparison of volume measurements between non-contrast and contrast-enhanced methods (US, CT and MRI) will be performed. The results will be compared to renal function before and after tumour treatment.
