Transdiagnostic Oncology Program in Primary Care
The goal of this observational study is to learn about how cancer survivors experience a relatively new 12-month interdisciplinary aftercare program called the Transdiagnostic Oncologic Program (TOP). TOP is an innovative program offered as part of routine family-doctor care among several practices in the province Drenthe, the Netherlands. It is coordinated by the family doctor and caried out by an interdisciplinary team, consisting of the family doctor, a physiotherapist, nutritionist, and optionally a psychologist. The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Is TOP feasible and acceptable?
* Does TOP lead to improvements in quality of life in cancer survivors? Patients who were eligible for the program (n=54) were asked to participate in research as well. Everyone who participated in TOP (n=19) agreed to participate in this study as well. Those who declined participation (n=35), were asked to serve as controls, of which 16 agreed to do so.
Cancer Survivor
BEHAVIORAL: Transdiagnostic Oncologic Program
Feasibility and satisfaction., Feasibility of the intervention was assessed through attrition and attendance rates and through several questions on an evaluation form at post-intervention (T2), including adverse effects. Serious adverse events were also inquired by the GP. Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed with the same evaluation form at T2., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.|Change in quality of life, Quality of life (QoL) was measured with the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). From this, global health status, an overall indicator of quality of life, as well as five functioning scales (physical, emotional, cognitive, social and role) and three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain) were used., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.
Change in fatigue, Fatigue was comprehensively assessed by the validated Dutch version of the Multidimensional Fatigue inventory (MFI); the MFI-20., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.|Change in mental symptoms, Mental symptoms were assessed with the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), which is a reliable and validated questionnaire., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.|Change in happiness, Happiness, a specific aspect of quality of life, was measured with the happiness index (HI)., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.|Change in work ability, Work ability was assessed by a validated single-item question from the work ability index (WAI)., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.|Change in work accommodations after work resumption, Work accommodations after work resumption was assessed with six contextual items. Participants who resumed work at one of the assessments (T0, T1, T2) were asked to specify any work accommodations., From baseline to the end of the program, after 1 year.
