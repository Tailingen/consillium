A Study of XZP-3287 in Combination With Fulvestrant in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XZP-3287 in combination with Fulvestrant versus placebo combined with Fulvestrant in Patients who have HR positive and Her2 negative recurrent/metastatic breast cancer and have received prior endocrine therapy are eligible for study.
