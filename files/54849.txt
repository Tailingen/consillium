This study examines melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer in people diagnosed with vitiligo compared to matched controls.

The skin cancer outcome comprises of the composite of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers: squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma., 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the Female Sex Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in female vitiligo cases and matched controls., 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the Male Sex Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in male vitiligo cases and matched controls., 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the <45 Age Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those aged \<45, 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the 45-64 Age Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those aged 45-64, 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the >=65 Age Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those aged \>=65, 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the White Ethnicity Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those of white ethnicity, 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the Non-white Ethnicity Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those of non-white ethnicity, 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the Most Deprived Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those in the most deprived subgroup category, 10 years from the index date|Number of New Onset Skin Cancers in the Least Deprived Subgroup, Number of new onset skin cancers assessed prospectively in vitiligo cases and matched controls by those in the least deprived subgroup category, 10 years from the index date
Prevalence of Skin Cancer in Adult People Diagnosed With Vitiligo, Skin cancer is defined as the composite of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers: squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma., At index date|Prevalence of Melanoma Skin Cancer in Adult People Diagnosed With Vitiligo, Prevalence of melanoma skin cancer in adult people diagnosed with vitiligo at or before recruitment, At index date.|Prevalence of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Skin Cancer in Adult People Diagnosed With Vitiligo, Prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer in adult people diagnosed with vitiligo at or before recruitment, At index date.|Prevalence of Basal Cell Carcinoma Skin Cancer in Adult People Diagnosed With Vitiligo, Prevalence of basal cell carcinoma skin cancer in adult people diagnosed with vitiligo at or before recruitment, At index date.|Number of New Onset Actinic Keratoses in Adult People Diagnosed With Vitiligo, Number of new onset actinic keratoses in adult people assessed in vitiligo cases and matched controls., 10 years from the index date|Prevalence of Actinic Keratoses in Adult People Diagnosed With Vitiligo, Prevalence of actinic keratoses in adult people diagnosed with vitiligo at or before recruitment, At index date.
For the primary analysis, this study examines the risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers: squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in people diagnosed with vitiligo. It also examines actinic keratoses. In secondary analysis, this study examines the prevalence of skin cancer in people diagnosed with vitiligo compared to matched controls.

This study also examines whether the susceptibility to melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer may vary between different patient subgroups, e.g. ethnicity, those who undergo phototherapy or treatment with the new targeted biologic immunosuppressive therapies.
