A Study to Assess Prevalence of a Specific Protein Overexpression in Adult Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80%-85% of lung cancers cases of which 60% are non-squamous (NSQ). This study will evaluate the prevalence of mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) overexpression (OE) in adult participants with advanced or metastatic NSQ NSCLC.

Archived tissue biopsies will be tested for MET OE and data from approximately 500 participants will be collected. No participants will be enrolled in this study.

Participants' charts will be reviewed. No drug will be administered as a part of this study. The duration of the study will be approximately 15 months.

There is no additional burden for participants in this trial.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Presence of Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition (MET) protein overexpression (OE), OE is defined as: positive: \>= 25% of tumor cells with 3+ staining intensity, or negative: \< 25% of tumor cells with 3+ staining intensity. High overexpression (OE high) is defined as: positive: \>= 50% of tumor cells with 3+ staining intensity negative: \< 50% of tumor cells with 3+ staining intensity. These are determined by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed by the local laboratory., Up to 15 Months
