Valid Biomarkers in Blood to Predict the Response to Therapy in Prostate Cancer Patients
Participants to the study will be assigned to 5 cohorts according to the stage of disease and planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

In all patients, 12 ml of blood sample will be collected in EDTA tube for analysis of biological biomarkers in different time points.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: biological samples collection and analysis
Biomarkers value in the response to therapy, To assess the value of MDSCs, NLR, cytokines as biomarkers of clinical outcome at different stages of disease and their correlation with PSA, the marker usually used for PC, 3 years
Biomarkers inter and intra variability, to assess the inter- and intra-variability of the value of MDSCs, NLR and cytochines., 3 years|Metabolomic and metagenomic analysis, to set-up the microbiota analysis and blood analysis quantification and determine the intra- and inter-patient variability (Group 0);, 3 years|Metabolomic and metagenomic analysis, to assess the diversity and the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its blood metabolites in PC patients in castration-sensitive (Group 2) and castration-resistant (Group 3) phase, 3 years
Participants to the study will be assigned to 5 cohorts according to the stage of disease and planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

Group 0 (set-up): blood sampling and rectal swab will be collected at a single time-point during the PC treatment. No follow-up is required.

Group 1a (control): the first blood sampling will be performed within 4 weeks since the negative biopsy; subsequent samplings will be done according to a schedule comparable to that of Group 1 up to 1 year or evidence of tumor, whichever occurs first.

Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3: the first blood sampling will be performed before radical treatment or HT start or CT start, on the basis of the planned antitumor therapy; subsequent sampling will be done after radical intervention at 4 weeks (only for Group 1) and then every 3 months (or more frequently if clinically indicated), up to 3 years or evidence of tumor recurrence/progression (radiological or biochemical), whichever occurs first.

At the time of recurrence/progression, patients of Group 1 could become part and could be followed as per Group 2, and patients of Group 2 could become part and could be followed as per Group 3.
