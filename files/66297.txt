Study of Tremelimumab Alone or Combined With Olaparib for Patients With Persistent EOC (Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma)
This study will be looking at what dose of tremelimumab and olaparib is safe and effective in patients with persistent EOC (Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma).
Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Olaparib
Adverse events as a measure of the safety and tolerability profile of tremelimumab in combination with olaparib, Number of participants experiencing study drug-related dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Dose escalation (phase I) portion of the trial only., 4 years|Fold change from baseline in the ratio of peripheral CD4+ICOShi T cells and Regulatory T cells, Dose escalation (phase I) portion of the trial only., 4 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of tremelimumab combined with olaparib, Dose escalation (phase I) portion of the trial only., 4 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 6 months by RECIST, PFS rate is defined as the percentage of patients with disease progression (PD or relapse from CR as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause at 6 months. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Complete Response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 6 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 6 months by irRECIST, PFS rate is defined as the percentage of patients with disease progression (irPD or relapse from irCR as assessed using irRECIST criteria) or death due to any cause at 6 months. Per irRECIST criteria, irCR = disappearance of all lesions, irPR is =\>30% decrease in tumor burden, irPD is \>20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir, irSD is \<30% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline cannot be established nor \<20% increase compared with nadir. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 6 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions and PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions., 4 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by irRECIST, Objective Response Rate (irORR) is defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (irCR) or partial response (irPR) based on irRECIST criteria. Per irRECIST criteria, irCR = disappearance of all lesions and irPR is =\>30% decrease in tumor burden., 4 years|Duration of Response by RECIST, Number of months from the start date of PR or CR (whichever response is recorded first) and subsequently confirmed to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is documented. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, and PD is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 4 years|Duration of Response by irRECIST, Number of months from the start date of irPR or irCR (whichever response is recorded first) and subsequently confirmed to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is documented. Per irRECIST criteria, irCR = disappearance of all lesions, irPR is =\>30% decrease in tumor burden, and irPD is is \>20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir., 4 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, PD is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, SD is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of patients with disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of followup (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years
This clinical trial was initially intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial, but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2 prior to termination.
