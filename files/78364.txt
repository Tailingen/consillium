A Trial of the Combination of SHR-A1811 and Fluzoparib in HER2-Expressing Cancers
The study is being conducted to evaluate safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SHR-A1811 for Injection in combination with Fluzoparib Capsule for HER2-expressing advanced solid tumors of patients. To explore the reasonable dosage of dosage regimen of combination therapy for HER2-expressing advanced malignant tumors of patients.
