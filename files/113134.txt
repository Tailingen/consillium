Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Osteoblast-Like Cells In- Vitro Study
The idea of treating different deformities or diseases in the maxillofacial region with Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT) has recently become popular. It has been widely used in medical practice for the management of urolithiasis, cholelithiasis and in haead and neck region for sialolithiasis. The present study 'Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Osteoblast-Like Cells In-vitro study' will be done to explore and evaluate the effect of shockwaves. Further, Osteoblast-like cells will be assessed for Cell - Cell interaction and Cell Viability. It will be assessed using a scratch assay, Mtt assay and ATP analysis.

Introduction:

Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT) has recently become popular. Shockwave has been widely used in medical practice for the management of urolithiasis, cholelithiasis and in haead and neck region for sialolithiasis.

Aim:

This study 'Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Osteoblast-Like Cells In-vitro study' will be done to explore and evaluate the effect of shockwaves. Further, Osteoblast-like cells will be assessed for Cell - Cell interaction and Cell Viability.

Methodology:

In this in-vitro study, 20 Osteoblast - like cells will be included. 10 samples to be considered for Control group and the remaining 10 samples considered as Test group. Extracorporeal shockwave will be applied to the Test samples. They will be further analysed using wound scratch assay which is used to assess Cell proliferative rate and scratch closure through live imaging. MTT assay and ATP assay used to determine Cell viability after exposure to shockwaves. The cell migration and cell viability after exposure to shockwaves will determine its effects on osteoblast-like cells.
