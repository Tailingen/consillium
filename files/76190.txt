Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake With a Patient Navigator
Patients who receive tailored navigation (consisting of a letter and patient navigation services) and get screened will be significantly greater than the control group who receives treatment as usual.

A majority of patients will opt for Fecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT)as one of their preferred tests, after undergoing the "Patient Navigator" intervention and that proportion will be significantly greater than the group who opt for FOBT in the control group.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Health counselling by nurse navigator|BEHAVIORAL: Usual primary care counselling
Completion of verified CRC screening event (FOBT;colonoscopy) event in experimental vs. control groups within 48 weeks, Completion of verified CRC screening events in experimental vs. control patients, 48 weeks after baseline assessment
Screening preferences; predictors of CRC screening and screening preference., 48 weeks
Primary Outcome Measure:

Number of patients who receive a letter and patient navigation services and get screened compared to the control group.

Secondary Outcome Measures:

Proportion (%) of patients preferring FOBT vs.colonoscopy; Predictors of CRC screening and screening preference.

Subjects: Ambulatory patients (men-women aged 50 years and above) recruited from primary care practices at the Group Health Centre, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. All patients will be screened for eligibility and those who are eligible and agree to participate in the study will be randomized to either of the two study arms: intervention group or control group.
