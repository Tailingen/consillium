Open-Label Surufatinib in European Patients With NET
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multi-centre study of surufatinib in patients with low to intermediate grade (Grade 1 or Grade 2), well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).
Neuroendocrine Tumours|Neuroendocrine Tumour of the Lung|Small Intestinal NET
DRUG: Surufatinib
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate the incidence of complete response, partial response and stable disease., up to 6 months
Maximum plasma concentrations of surufatinib with blood sampling, Blood sampling will be taken to measure levels of the study drug in all cohorts and cytochrome P450 in cohort D only, up to 12 months|QTc change from Baseline, QTc change from baseline in approximately first 40 patients (Cohorts A, B, and C), up to 6 months|Evaluation of safety and tolerability of surufatinib, Evaluate the safety and tolerability of surufatinib in patients with NET, Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), the duration between the enrollment date and the first disease progression (PD) or death (whichever comes first)., up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration between the date the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail) and the date of disease recurrence or progression as objectively recorded, up to 12 months
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multi-centre study of surufatinib in patients with low- to intermediate-grade (Grade 1 or Grade 2), well-differentiated NETs.

The study will enroll 4 cohorts of varying NETs, as follows:

* Cohort A - NET of lung origin
* Cohort B - NET of small bowel origin
* Cohort C - NET of non-small bowel, non-pancreas, and non-lung origin
* Cohort D - NET of any origin (DDI substudy)

All patients will be treated with oral surufatinib 300 mg QD in treatment cycles of 28 days starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.
