Lorlatinib for Newly-Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma With ROS or ALK Fusion
The goal of this study is to determine the response of the study drug loratinib in treating children who are newly diagnosed high-grade glioma with a fusion in ALK or ROS1. It will also evaluate the safety of lorlatinib when given with chemotherapy or after radiation therapy.

Disease Control Rate, To assess the disease control rate (Complete Response \[CR\], Continued Complete Response \[CCR\], Partial Response \[PR\] and Stable Disease \[SD\]) of lorlatinib in young children with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma with ALK or ROS1 fusion after 2 cycles of lorlatinib monotherapy., Day 1 of treatment until the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of participants with lorlatinib-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Assess and further characterize the safety and toxicity of lorlatinib in pediatric patients newly diagnosed with HGG with a fusion in ALK or ROS. This will be achieved by calculating the number of participants with, as well as frequency and severity of, lorlatinib-related Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From Day 1 of protocol treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR) in HGG, To assess the objective response rate (ORR) (Complete Response \[CR\] and Partial Response \[PR\]) of lorlatinib in children with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma with ALK or ROS1 fusion after 2 cycles of lorlatinib monotherapy., From Day 1 of protocol treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment|Overall Survival (OS) in HGG, To assess overall (OS) of children with high-grade gliomas treated with a lorlatinib-containing regimen at 1, 3 and 5 years and compare it to historical data from BABYPOG and HIT-SKK., Day 1 of treatment until date of death due to any cause or date of last follow-up, assessed up to 60 months|Progression-Free Survival in HGG, To assess progression-free survival (PFS) of children with high-grade gliomas treated with a lorlatinib-containing regimen at 1, 3 and 5 years and compare it to historical data from BABYPOG and HIT-SKK., Day 1 of treatment until date of Progressive Disease or death due to any cause or date of last follow-up, assessed up to 5 years|Associations between genomic tumor alterations with radiographic response, Explore longitudinal associations of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and/or immunologic alterations of tumor at diagnosis, recurrence, or autopsy with radiographic response and advanced neuro-imaging measures., From diagnosis through the end of follow-up period.
This is a multi-institutional clinical trial of lorlatinib in children newly diagnosed with High Grade Glioma (HGG) harboring ROS1 (ROS Proto-Oncogene 1, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase) or ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusions. In this pilot study, investigators will assess the disease control rate (Continued Complete Response (CCR), Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD)) of lorlatinib, and feasibility and safety of lorlatinib administration in combination with standard chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed HGG with ROS or ALK fusions who receive 2 cycles of lorlatinib administered orally, once daily, at 115 mg/m2/day (or maximum of 200mg/dose) for pediatric patients, and 150mg/dose for patients \>18 years, continuously. Secondary objectives include overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) lorlatinib as a single agent and in combination with standard chemotherapy used in children ≤ 48 months with HGG, or post focal radiotherapy in children \> 48 months of age. Children with HGG who have a CCR or CR after 2 cycles of therapy will continue to receive single agent lorlatinib for a total of 12xs 28-day cycles. Continuation of treatment beyond 12 cycles, and up to maximum 26 cycles, may be considered for patients on lorlatinib monotherapy if they are receiving clinical benefit from the study, at the discretion of the treating physician after discussion with Study Chairs. Patients with PR or SD after 2 cycles of lorlatinib monotherapy will go on to receive lorlatinib either in combination with standard backbone chemotherapy (BABYPOG or HIT-SKK, investigator's choice) or post standard radiotherapy, based on the patient's age. Patients with PD after 2 cycles will be taken off protocol therapy.

This study will be a part of the TarGeT, molecularly-guided umbrealla trial in children, adolescents, and young adults newly diagnosed with HGG, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)/diffuse midline glioma (DMG). Patients will undergo (1) upfront comprehensive tumor molecular profiling using multi-omic approach with rapid return of results, (2) stratification to biologically-targeted treatment arms to assess treatment efficacy, and (3) longitudinal evaluation of peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or tumor tissue as well as neuro-imaging to identify biomarkers predictive of response, recurrence, and resistance.

Based on recent trials conducted in this patient population, investigators conservatively estimate that 1 child with newly diagnosed DIPG or HGG with either ROS1 or ALK fusion will be enrolled every 2 months on this study. Patients ≤18 years will start at the recommended phase 2 dose of 115 mg/m2/day and patients \>18 years will start at 150mg/dose. All patients will be treated continuously for 28 days, and one dose de-de-escalations will be allowed. A maximum of 15 eligible patients will be enrolled, anticipated over 2.5 years.
