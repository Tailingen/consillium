Study of Blood Samples in Patients With Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of blood from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood samples in patients with breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Histologic complete response (Chevallier and Sataloff) or tumor response (RECIST)
OBJECTIVES:

* Identify constitutional gene variants associated with a change in response.

OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected periodically for analysis of genetic factors.
