Phase I Clinical Trial of 68Ga-NOTA-SNA002
The clinical trial was a single-center, dose-increasing, open trial.In this clinical trial, 68Ga-NOTA-SNA002 was injected intravenously to observe its safety tolerance, radiation absorption dose, distribution characteristics, etc. in patients with solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Positron-Emission Tomography(PET)
DRUG: 68Ga-NOTA-SNA002
Safety of administration(Vital signs), The safety of administration will be evaluated based on the assessments of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and body temperature before and after administration(% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline)., up to 7 days|Laboratory examination, such as blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine routine, coagulation function, etc., to evaluate the changes of laboratory examination of subjects before and after administration, up to 7 days|Incidence of adverse events, The incident and severity of adverse events per CTCAE V5.0 criteria will be recorded following dose of 68Ga-NOTA-SNA002., through study completion, an average of 1 month|Biological distribution characteristics, Description of biodistribution patterns of 68Ga-NOTA-SNA002 on PET, 60 minutes ~120 minutes after administration|Anti-SNA002 anti-antibody, By analyzing anti-SNA002 anti-drug antibody positive rate., up to 1 month
Changes in whole blood and serum radioactive dose, Measurement of 68Ga Radiation exposure in whole blood and serum after administration, 60 minutes after Blood sampling|Standardized uptake values based on whole-body PET imaging, Analyzing whole body PET imagesï¼ŒDefine area of interest (ROI) and/or volume of Interest (VOI), calculate standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, etc.), 1 month|Radiation absorbed dose of major organs, Calculation of the radiation dose for each vital organ by means of radiation uptake values, 1 month
The study consisted of four phases: screening period , baseline period , trial period and safety follow-up period .

Screening period 2 weeks before the start of the trial, all eligible subjects were selected to participate in the clinical trial. The informed consent signed by the subjects is required before performing all the examinations in this clinical trial.

Baseline period The admission criteria were checked again, and the subjects were enrolled on the same day after the check.

Trial period Including drug administration, blood collection, image collection and pathological tissue collection.

Safe follow-up period All adverse events and drug combinations are processed and recorded during this period.
