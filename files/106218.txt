[18]F-FAZA PET Imaging Study in Patients With Cancer of the Head & Neck, Lung, Renal Cell, Brain, Lymphoma and Neuroendocrine Tumours
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a Nuclear Medicine procedure that uses positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to visualize biological activity. The presence of hypoxia (low oxygen) is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of tumour types and treatment strategies targeting hypoxic cells have been developed. The PET tracer \[18\]F-FAZA can identify hypoxic areas, and changes in uptake during treatment may predict tumour response.

DRUG: 18F-FAZA PET Imaging
Phase I: demonstrate the safety of 18F-FAZA manufactured at the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre/Edmonton PET Centre. Phase II: determine the general biodistribution pattern of18F-FAZA., Phase I: Pre-injection and post-imaging vital signs, blood haematology and blood chemistry, adverse event collection.

Phase II: The location and relative uptake of normal and abnormal 18F-FAZA biodistribution patterns will be determined., Phase I: 2 years, Phase II: 5 years
Determine the relative tumour uptake of 18F-FAZA, Measure relative uptake scores (RUS) and tumour to background ratios (T/B) and correlate this uptake to disease progression, disease-free survival, overall survival and response to treatment over 12 months of follow-up., 5 years|Confirm the safety of 18F-FAZA manufactured at the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre/Edmonton PET Centre, Adverse event collection, 5 years
The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase I/II imaging, open label, single site study. In Phase I, one 18F-FAZA PET scan will be conducted in patients with known squamous cell carcinoma of the Head \& Neck, SCLC, NSCLC, lymphoma, GGM, neuroendocrine tumours or renal cell carcinoma. In Phase II, three 18F-FAZA PET scans will be done on patients with the above tumours as follows: one pre-treatment, one mid course and one post-treatment.
