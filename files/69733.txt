Portal Hypertension and Liver Resection in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
According to the BCLC guidelines, surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating cirrhosis is restricted to patients with preserved liver function, single nodule without vascular invasion and with hepatic venous gradient below 10 mmHg.

However, other guideline treatment, especially from eastern countries demonstrated that surgical resection is safe and feasible and provides better survival than the treatment recommended by the BCLC system for patients with similar stage.

The primary goal of this study is to assess the impact of HVPG on short and long-term outcomes in HCC patients who undergo liver resection.
Primary Liver Cancers
PROCEDURE: Liver resection
Mortality, In-hospital or 90-day mortality, 90 day
morbidity, Overall and liver-related complications including liver failure, ascites, biliary fistula, bleeding, pulmonary complications, and renal complications.

Grading system according to Clavien-Dindo classification, 90 day|Survival outcomes, Including Overall survival and disease free survival, 1,3 and 5 years
Acute kidney injury, As defined by the KDIGIO criteria, within 90 days after surgery|Sarcopenia, using computed tomography, Before liver resection|Time from diagnosis to liver resection, from the date of diagnosis until the date of first referral and from the date of first referral to date of hepatectomy, assessed up to 3 months|Impact of PET CT on overall survival following liver resection, quantitative assessment of metabolic uptake (FDG and choline), Before liver resection
Patients with HCC and candidates for hepatectomy are classified into two groups according to the presence of portal hypertension. Short- and long-term outcomes will be compared.
