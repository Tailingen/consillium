Everolimus for Treatment of Disfiguring Cutaneous Lesions in Neurofibromatosis1 CRAD001CUS232T
This trial is evaluating the use of oral Everolimus to determine if there is a reduction in the size of the disfiguring cutaneous lesions in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 over a 6 month period. The evaluation will be done by 3D photography measuring volume with the LIFEVIZ Micro system.

DRUG: Everolimus
3D Photographic Measurement of Surface Volume of Cutaneous Neurofibroma Lesion, Photographs of selected lesions to measure surface volume., 6 months
Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Adverse Events, Determination if orally administered Afinitor is safe in patients a indicated by lack of Grade 3-4 adverse events during the trial period., 6 months
Determine How Orally Administered Everolimus Effects mTOR Signaling in NF-1 Tissues, Quantification via immunohistochemical staining of PTEN, pS6, p4EBP-1, TSC2, mTOR, NF-1, pAKT, VEGF-A and IGF-IR expression in biopsied neurofibroma tissue samples., 6 months
Qualifying subjects will have a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis 1 and have disfiguring cutaneous lesions that can be measured by photography. The subjects will have photographs of the target lesions,biopsies of the lesions,and safety blood laboratory tests at 3 time points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months which is end of treatment). Everolimus will be taken orally for 6 months. Subjects will visit the clinic monthly for an exam and adverse event evaluation. Laboratory testing will be done at these visits if determined necessary by the PI.
