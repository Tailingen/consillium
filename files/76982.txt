A Study of MEDI1191 in Sequential and Concurrent Combination With Durvalumab in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
To evaluate MEDI1191 administered intratumorally in sequential and concurrent combination with intravenous durvalumab in patients with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors|Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: MEDI1191|BIOLOGICAL: Durvalumab
Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs) serious adverse events (SAEs) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)., The occurrence of DLTs will be used to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MEDI1191., From time of informed consent until 90 days after the last dose of investigational product (MEDI1191 or durvalumab).|Objective response rate (ORR) in patients within expansion arms., The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR)., Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 3.5 years.

Disease control is defined as CR, PR or stable disease., Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 3.5 years.|Duration of Response (DoR)., The DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 3.5 years.|Time To Response (TTR)., The TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment with any investigational product until the first documentation of a subsequently confirmed objective response., Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 3.5 years .|Progression Free Survival (PFS)., PFS will be measured from the start of treatment with any investigational product until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 3.5 years.|Overall Survival (OS)., OS will be measured from the start of treatment with investigational product until death due to any cause., Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 3.5 years.|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of MEDI1191 and durvalumab, The endpoints for assessment of PK of MEDI1191 and durvalumab include individual MEDI1191 and durvalumab concentrations in serum at different timepoints after administration., From first dose of MEDI1191 through to 30 days after last dose of investigational product.|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of MEDI1191, The endpoints for assessment of PK of MEDI1191 include MEDI1191 concentrations in serum at different timepoints after administration., From first dose of MEDI1191 through to 30 days after last dose of investigational product.|Clearance of MEDI1191, The endpoints for assessment of PK of MEDI1191 include MEDI1191 concentrations in serum at different timepoints after administration., From first dose of MEDI1191 through to 30 days after last dose of investigational product.|Immunogenicity of MEDI1191, The endpoints for assessment of immunogenicity of MEDI1191 include the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of MEDI1191 through to 3.5 years after last dose of investigational product.
This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate MEDI1191 delivered by intratumoral injection in sequential and concurrent combination with intravenous durvalumab to subjects with solid tumors. The study has a dose escalation design using mTPI-2 to evaluate a range of doses.
