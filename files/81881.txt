A Study of Lorlatinib in Combination With Ramucirumab in People With Lung Cancer
This study will test the safety of the combination of ramucirumab and lorlatinib. The researchers will test one or two different doses of lorlatinib in combination with ramucirumab to find the drug combination dose that causes few or mild side effects in participants. Once the researchers find this dose, they can test it in future participants to see if it is effective in treating their metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The researchers are also looking to see whether there are specific genes or DNA sequences associated with a response to treatment with lorlatinib and ramucirumab.
