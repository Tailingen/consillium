Characteristics of Cardiac Tumor and the Risk Stratification of Subsequent Adverse Events (UNIQUE)
This study aims to retrospectively and prospectively collect clinical and biological specimen data from patients with cardiac tumors who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Various techniques, including general molecular biology analysis and multi-omics analysis, will be used to construct a prognostic model for cardiac tumors.
Cardiac Tumor
Change in the incidence of MACCE, MACCE (major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events) including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization surgery and stroke. The MACCE will be assessed from the medical records., 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after enrollment.
Change in the incidence of all-cause death, All-cause death diagnosed by clinical doctors will be assessed from the medical records, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after enrollment.|Change in the incidence of myocardial infarction, Myocardial infarction diagnosed by clinical doctors will be assessed from the medical records, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after enrollment.|Change in the incidence of coronary revascularization surgery, Coronary revascularization surgery completed by clinical doctors will be assessed from the medica records, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after enrollment.|Change in the incidence of stroke, Stroke diagnosed by clinical doctors will be assessed from the medical records, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after enrollment.
This study aims to construct a retrospective-prospective long-term follow-up cohort and management system for cardiac tumors through a multi-centre collaborative network. The duration of the study will be divided into retrospective and prospective components. The retrospective study will collect cases of cardiac tumors from 2003-2022; the prospective study is expected to collect cases of cardiac tumors from 2022-2030. The study is expected to assess the disease characteristics, progression patterns, clinical features, natural course and long-term prognosis of cardiac tumors.
