Study of INCA 0186 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose escalation, and dose expansion first-in human (FIH) Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of INCA00186 when given alone or in combination with INCB106385 and/or retifanlimab in participants with specific advanced solid tumors; squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and specified gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies have been selected as indications of interest for this study. Participants with CD8 T-cell-positive tumors will be selected as these tumors are more likely to respond to immunotherapy.
