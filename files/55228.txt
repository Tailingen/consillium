Reliability and Versatility of Pedicled Anterolateral Thigh Flap in Reconstruction of Soft Tissue Defects
a prospective case series study for evaluation of the reliability and versatility of pedicled anterolateral thigh flap in the reconstruction of soft tissue defects as regards flap survival and complications, donor site morbidity and aesthetic outcome.
Post Traumatic Soft Tissue Defects That Could be Reached by Pedicled Anterolateral Thigh Flap|Post Tumor Excision Soft Tissue Defects|Post Debridement Soft Tissue Defects
PROCEDURE: surgical reconstruction of a soft tissue defects by a pedicled flap
Flap Survival Rate, The percentage of flaps that survive completely without necrosis or partial loss. Complications will be graded (e.g., total flap loss, partial necrosis, or marginal necrosis).

Unit: Percentage. Measurement Tool: ruler/(Mesure)., "From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks"
Range of Motion in Reconstructed Area, Assessment of the range of motion in the reconstructed area. Unit: Degrees. Measurement Tool: Goniometer., "From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks"|Strength in Reconstructed Area, Evaluation of muscle strength in the reconstructed area. Unit: Newton (N). Measurement Tool: Dynamometer., "From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks"
