Safety and Effectiveness of EBV-specific Cytotoxic T Cells for the Treatment for EBV Lymphomas or Other EBV-associated Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to test whether treatment with EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells (EBV-CTLs) is effective, and to test any good and bad effects of treatment with EBV-CTLs. EBV-CTLs are a special immune cells that may attack abnormal cells. EBV-CTLs are made by taking cells from a healthy person, growing them in a laboratory for several weeks to educate them to recognize and destroy EBV infected cells, and then storing them in a freezer until they are required for treatment.
