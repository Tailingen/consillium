Remote Resistance Exercise Powering Survivors - Gastrointestinal Oncology
The purpose of the study is to evaluate a tele-resistance training exercise program for individuals undergoing chemotherapy for advanced upper gastrointestinal cancer.
Gastrointestinal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Tele-Resistance Training
Percentage of Participants that Enroll and Consent - Enrollment Feasibility, Enrollment will be considered feasible if ≥ 70% of eligible and approached patients actually consent and enroll, Up to 36 Months|Percentage of Participants that Complete Study Assessments - Retention Feasibility, Retention will be considered feasible if ≥ 70% of participants who complete baseline measures also complete followup measures, Up to 3 Months|Exercise Adherence - Feasibility, Exercise adherence will be assessed based on performance of prescribed exercise volume, with tele-RT volumes considered feasible if participants perform ≥ 70% of the volume prescribed., Up to 6 Months|Participant Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptability - Acceptability, Participants evaluation of feasibility and acceptability will be assessed with a questionnaire, adapted to fit the intervention. The questionnaire includes both Likert Scale and open-ended questions. An item-by-item basis and as average item score, with scores ≥4 ("agree" to "strongly agree") indicating acceptability. Open-ended responses will be analyzed qualitatively to inform intervention improvement., Up to 6 Months|Participant Self-Reported Musculoskeletal Injuries - Safety, Participants will be asked to report the following information: type (joint or soft tissue or other), location (specific body part), and cause (description of activity during which injury was incurred). Participants will then rate the injury on a scale of 1-4 (1=not related, 2=unlikely related, 3=likely related, 4=definitely related). The severity of the injury will be rated on a scale of 1-4 (1=mild/no change in daily activity, 2=some limitation of daily activity, 3=major limitation of daily activity, 4=life threatening). The duration for which daily activities were impacted will be rated on a scale from 1-5 (1=no change, 2=1-3 days, 3=4-7 days, 4=1-2 weeks, 5=more than 2 weeks). The numerator of the variable used to determine program safety will be the number of musculoskeletal injuries that were rated at least a 3 for relatedness to RT (likely related or definitely related) and caused at least some limitation of daily activity lasting more than 3 days., Up to 6 Months|Participant Muscular Strength - Baseline, Muscular strength will be measured using four separate 1-repetition maximum (1RM) lifts: chest press, seated row, leg press, and leg extension performed on resistance training machines. If a particular 1RM lift is contraindicated for a given participant (e.g., limited range of motion for a given joint or osteoporosis), the lift will be skipped, or 5-repetition maximum (5RM) will be measured instead of 1RM, and 1RM will be estimated from 5RM., At Baseline|Participant Muscular Strength - Follow-up, Muscular strength will be measured using four separate 1-repetition maximum (1RM) lifts: chest press, seated row, leg press, and leg extension performed on resistance training machines. If a particular 1RM lift is contraindicated for a given participant (e.g., limited range of motion for a given joint or osteoporosis), the lift will be skipped, or 5-repetition maximum (5RM) will be measured instead of 1RM, and 1RM will be estimated from 5RM., Up to 6 Months|Participant Muscular Endurance - Baseline, Muscular endurance will be measured by the maximum number of repetitions a participant can perform at 70% of the baseline 1-repetition maximum (1RM) for the same four lifts, At Baseline|Participant Muscular Endurance - Follow-up, Muscular endurance will be measured by the maximum number of repetitions a participant can perform at 70% of the baseline 1-repetition maximum (1RM) for the same four lifts, Up to 6 Months|Participant Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) - Baseline, Participants SMI will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans from baseline to follow up., At Baseline|Participant Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) - Follow-up, Participants SMI will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans from baseline to follow up., Up to 6 Months|Participant Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD) - Baseline, Participants SMD will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans from baseline to follow up., At Baseline|Participant Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD) - Follow-up, Participants SMD will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans from baseline to follow up., Up to 6 Months|Participants Health-Related Quality of Life, Health-related quality of life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), Up to 6 Months|Participant Fatigue, Participant fatigue will be measured using the FACT-Fatigue questionnaire (FACT-F), Up to 6 Months|Participant Physical Functioning, Participants physical functioning will be measured using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Functioning Short Form, Up to 6 Months|Participant Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), Participant CIPN will be measured using the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN twenty-item scale (QLQ-CIPN20), Up to 6 Months|Participant Self Reported Exercise - Baseline, Participant self-reported exercise will be measured using a modified Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess both aerobic and resistance exercise, At Baseline|Participant Self Reported Exercise - Follow-up, Participant self-reported exercise will be measured using a modified Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess both aerobic and resistance exercise, Up to 6 Months|Participant Clinicodemographic Characteristics - Baseline, Participant clinicodemographic characteristics including tumor type and cancer stage, chemotherapy type, sex, age, body mass index, race/ethnicity, and marital status will be collected from participants' electronic medical records., At Baseline|Participant Clinicodemographic Characteristics - Follow-up, Participant clinicodemographic characteristics including tumor type and cancer stage, chemotherapy type, sex, age, body mass index, race/ethnicity, and marital status will be collected from participants' electronic medical records., Up to 6 Months|Participant Treatment Outcome, Participant relevant treatment outcomes including chemotherapy dose reductions and changes in chemotherapy will be collected from participants' electronic medical records., Up to 6 Months
