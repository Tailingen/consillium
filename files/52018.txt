Breast Cancer Metastatic|Treatment Outcome
PFS, PFS was defined as the time interval from the date of DS-8201 initiation until date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any causes, whichever occurred first., Six months after the last patient was enrolled|ORR, ORR is the percentage of participants with the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1. CR = Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Up to approximately 12 weeks
