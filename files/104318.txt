Study of Panobinostat Monotherapy in Women With v-ERB-B2 Avian Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2) Positive Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to assess the benefit of panobinostat monotherapy given either orally or i.v. to women with HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Panobinostat - LBH589|DRUG: Panobinostat - LBH589
Overall Response (OR) Rate (as Determined by the Investigator): the Number of Patients Assigned to a Treatment Arm With a Confirmed Best Response of Complete Response(CR) or Partial Response (PR)., The assessment of OR is based on the response of target lesion, of non-target lesion and on presence of new lesions (RECIST Criteria (V1.0)-assessed by CT scan spiral and bone scan)

* CR:Disappearance of all target lesions
* PR:\>=30% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD),taking as reference the nadir SLD
* Progressive Disease (PD):\>=20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the nadir SLD, or the appearance of one or more new lesions
* Stable Disease(SD):Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the nadir SLD, At screening, every 2 cycles (i.e. 6 weeks) during the first 6 cycles, every 3 cycles (i.e. 9 weeks) during the subsequent cycles and at the End of Treatment (EOT) visit. After the EOT, the tumor assessments should be performed every 9 weeks.
Corrected QT Interval Fridericia's Formula (QTcF), Prolonged QTcF: QTcF \>450 msec and increase of baseline on greater than or equal to 60 msec., Panobinostat intra-venous (i.v.): All cycles pre-dose measurements. For cycles 1 and 2, post-dose measurements as well. / Panobinostat oral: Pre-dose and post-dose measurements for all cycles. Note: each cycle = 3 weeks
The purpose of the study is to assess the benefit of panobinostat monotherapy given either orally or i.v. to women with HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer
