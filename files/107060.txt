PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer
Conduct a prospective study to assess the accuracy of a pancreatic cancer risk prediction model.
Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the high predicted risk group, Enrolled subjects will be followed for 18 months to determine the incidence rate of PDAC, 18-Month
The goal of this study is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven risk model for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated health care setting. Patients at increased risk for pancreatic cancer as identified by the risk model will be invited to participate in a prospective study to assess the accuracy of this approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer.
