Real-world Effectiveness of Asciminib and Treatment Patterns in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia With T315I Mutation - a Chart Review Study of Patients Treated in the Asciminib Managed Access Program (MAP)
This non-interventional study (NIS) was a retrospective chart review analyzing existing data from patients participating in the asciminib MAP.
