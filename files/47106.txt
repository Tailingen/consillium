Advancing Brigatinib Properties in ALK+ NSCLC Patients by Deep Phenotyping
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter phase II study investigating the advancing Brigatinib properties in anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive non-small cell lung cancer (ALK+ NSCLC) patients by deep phenotyping

The aim of this study is to compare efficacy of brigatinib and other 2nd-generation ALK tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) in 1st and 2nd line treatment and to explore resistance patterns according to treatment and molecular properties of the tumors
