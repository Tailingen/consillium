Mixed Chimera Allogeneic Transplantation From Matched Unrelated Donors For The Treatment Of Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of the study is to determine the toxicity and feasibility of non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants for multiple myeloma from unrelated donors.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: Autologous followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation
Feasibility and laboratory-measured efficacy of mixed chimera unrelated donor allogeneic transplants.
The primary objective of the protocol is to evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of this mixed chimerism matched unrelated donor allogeneic transplant approach for patients with multiple myeloma. Response, toxicity, survival and graft-versus-host disease will be evaluated.
