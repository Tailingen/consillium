Microbiome, Exercise Tracking Study: Among Individuals at High Risk for Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study has 2 aims:

Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining adults at high risk of colorectal cancer to a physical activity intervention trial. Investigators hypothesize that it will be possible to recruit and retain this patient population to a physical activity intervention trial.

Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of collecting, processing, storing stool samples and analyzing the gut microbiome data. Investigators hypothesize that all of these steps are feasible.

Percentage of participants with collected, processed, and analyzed stool samples, To demonstrate the feasibility of collecting, processing, storing stool samples and analyzing gut microbiome data, 8 weeks
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and is the third most common cancer in men and women. CRC risk factors include genetic predisposition, host factors and modifiable lifestyle behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, obesity). There are very limited data on the differences in the gut microbiota among populations at different levels of CRC risk, as well as the effects of behavioral interventions to alter the gut microbiome.
