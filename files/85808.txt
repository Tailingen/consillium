DERM Health Economics Study
This study aims to provide an initial assessment of the potential impact DERM could have on the number of onward referrals for a face to face dermatologist review and/or biopsy from a teledermatology-based service, and to improve the understanding of the patient pathways that exist.

DERM, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis support tool, has been shown to be able to accurately identify melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and other conditions from historical images of suspicious skin lesions (moles).

This study aims to establish whether the use of DERM in the patient pathway could reduce the number of unnecessary referrals to dermatologist review and/or biopsy.

Suspicious skin lesions that are due to be photographed for a dermatologist to review, will have two additional photographs taken using a commonly available smart phone camera with and without a specific lens attachment. The images will be analysed by DERM, and the results compared to the clinician's diagnosis (all lesions) and histologically-confirmed diagnosis (any lesion that is biopsied).
