Estimation of (suPAR) in Chronic Periodontitis With Post-radiotherapy on HNCs Patients
This study aims to improve a soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor suPAR is a reliable biomarker of chronic periodontitis and may be replaced in patients with head and neck cancer post-radiotherapy (HNC post-RT).

Measure of serum suPAR level, Measure of serum suPAR level in patients head and neck cancer who received radiotherapy, 6 months|Clinical Periodontal parameters measured, Periodontal parameters included (CAL, PI, GBI, PPD) measured by using a millimeter periodontal probe in patients with head and neck cancer who received radiotherapy., 6 months
Oral pH-saliva was measured, Oral pH-saliva collected from outcomes and measured pH-saliva by using pH-meter in patients who underwent radiotherapy., 6 month
The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) plays an essential function in leukocytes and endothelial homeostasis and, therefore, in the development of chronic periodontitis. The study enrolled 150 participants, 50 chronic periodontitis with head and neck cancer post radiotherapy (CP+HNC post-RT) patients, 50 chronic periodontitis (CP) without HNC patients, and 50 healthy controls. Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL), Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Plaque Index (PI), and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) were recorded. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was constructed to quantify serum (suPAR) levels.
