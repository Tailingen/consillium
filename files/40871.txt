A Study of SR-8541A (ENPPI Inhibitor) in Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multi-center phase 1 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SR-8541A administered orally as a monotherapy or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in subjects with solid tumors.

SR-8541A, an ENPP1 inhibitor, will be administered orally as a monotherapy to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

Subjects eligible for treatment include those whose disease is refractory to standard therapeutic options, or for which there are no standard therapeutic options available.

All enrolled patients will orally administer SR-8541A daily. Treatment may continue until the subject's disease worsens or another treatment discontinuation criterion is met.

The combination part will only commence once the SRC has deemed it safe to proceed and a SR-8541A dose from the dose escalation part is selected as the RP2D. The ICI will be either nivolumab or pembrolizumab and dosing will be per SOC. Both investigational products will start on C1D1. Treatment with ICI may be continued if SR-8541A is discontinued and treatment with SR-8541A may be continued after ICI is discontinued.

Approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled.
