Open-label PET Study With [11C]Osimertinib in Patients With EGFRm NSCLC and Brain Metastases
This is an open-label, single centre, Phase I study to determine the brain exposure of \[11C\]osimertinib in patients with EGFRm NSCLC with brain metastases.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: [11C]osimertinib
Maximum Concentration of Percent of Injected Dose in the Whole Brain (Cmax, %ID Brain) of [11C]Osimertinib, During the PET examination time, a series of arterial blood samples were taken to measure Cmax, %ID brain of \[11C\]osimertinib., Day 1, Day 2 (or up to Day 8) and Day 25|Maximum Concentration of Brain Standardized Uptake Value (Cmax, SUV Brain) of [11C]Osimertinib, During the PET examination time, a series of arterial blood samples were taken to measure Cmax, SUV brain of \[11C\]osimertinib., Day 1, Day 2 (or up to Day 8) and Day 25|Time of Maximum Radioactivity Concentration in the Brain (Tmax, Brain) of [11C]Osimertinib, The Tmax, brain was determined directly from the observed concentration versus time data., Day 1, Day 2 (or up to Day 8) and Day 25|Brain to Plasma Partition Coefficient (Kp) of [11C]Osimertinib, The Kp was defined as ratio of radiolabeled drug in brain to that in plasma calculated as area under the brain radioactivity concentration-time curve between 0 and 90 minutes/area under the plasma radioactivity concentration-time curve between 0 and 90 minutes., Day 1, Day 2 (or up to Day 8) and Day 25
Maximum Concentration at Steady State (Css,Max) of Osimertinib and Metabolite AZ5104, Venous blood samples were collected to determine Css,max of osimertinib and metabolite AZ5104., Pre-dose and 2, 4 and 7.5 hours postdose on Day 25|Time of Maximum Drug Concentration at Steady State (Tss,Max) of Osimertinib and Metabolite AZ5104, Venous blood samples were collected to determine tss,max of osimertinib and metabolite AZ5104., Pre-dose and 2, 4 and 7.5 hours postdose on Day 25|Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State (AUCss) of Osimertinib and Metabolite AZ5104, Venous blood samples were collected to determine AUCss of osimertinib and metabolite AZ5104., Pre-dose and 2, 4 and 7.5 hours postdose on Day 25|Metabolite to Parent Ratio of AUCss, Venous blood samples were collected to determine AUCss of osimertinib and metabolite AZ5104., Pre-dose and 2, 4 and 7.5 hours postdose on Day 25|Metabolite to Parent Ratio of Css,Max, Venous blood samples were collected to determine Css,max of osimertinib and metabolite AZ5104., Pre-dose and 2, 4 and 7.5 hours postdose on Day 25
A Single-centre, Open-label, PET imaging and Pharmacokinetic Study of IV Administered \[11C\]osimertinib in EGFRm Non-small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases. The study will consist of 2 phases, an imaging phase and a continuous access phase.
