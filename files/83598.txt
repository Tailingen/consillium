Safety and Preliminary Effectiveness of BGB-A445 in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BGB-A445 alone and in combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors; and to determine the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD) or maximum administered dose(s) (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) of BGB-A445 alone and in combination with tislelizumab.
