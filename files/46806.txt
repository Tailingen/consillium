Circadian Disturbances After Breast Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this study is to investigate circadian disturbances after breast cancer surgery by means of monitoring sleep and heart-rate variability, by measuring a metabolite of melatonin in urine and by questionnaires and a sleep-diary.

Sleepiness measured by Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. A sleep-diary recording sleep quantity of day and night sleep., 1 day preoperatively till 14 days postoperatively|Preoperative melatonin levels and amplitude, Excretion of aMT6s in urine. Urine will be collected from 23-07, quantified and 2 samples will be taken to measure aMT6s., 1 day preoperatively|Postoperative melatonin levels and amplitude (early phase), Excretion of aMT6s in urine. Urine will be collected from 23-07, quantified and 2 samples will be taken to measure aMT6s., The first postoperative night|Postoperative melatonin levels and amplitude, Excretion of aMT6s in urine. Urine will be collected from 23-07, quantified and 2 samples will be taken to measure aMT6s., The 14th postoperative night|Sleep architecture, Actigraphy (total minutes asleep, sleep effectiveness, sleep latency, awakenings). A wrist actigraph wil be worn from 1 day preoperatively and taken off on the 14th postoperative day., 1 day preoperatively till 14 days postoperatively
Preoperative heart-rate variability of breast cancer patients, Heart-rate variability measured by Holter monitor and a following analysis of frequency domain parameters., 1 day preoperatively|Postoperative heart-rate variability of breast cancer patients (early phase), Heart-rate variability measured by Holter monitor and a following analysis of frequency domain parameters., The first postoperative night|Postoperative heart-rate variability of breast cancer patients (late phase), Heart-rate variability measured by Holter monitor and a following analysis of frequency domain parameters., The 14th postoperative night
An increasing number of studies have shown that circadian variation in the excretion of hormones, the sleep-wake cycle, the core body temperature, the tone of the autonomic nervous system and the activity rhythm are important both in health and disease processes. More attention is being paid towards the circadian variation in endogenous rhythms in relation to surgery and whether this can affect postoperative recovery, morbidity and mortality.

Studies have been done on circadian disturbances after major and minor surgery but never in relation to breast cancer surgery.

This study will investigate circadian disturbances in this specific group of patients by using Actigraphy, Polysomnography (PSG), Holter-monitoring (HRV), the primary metabolite of melatonin in urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), questionnaires and a sleep-diary.
