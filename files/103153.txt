Nimotuzumab (h-R3), a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, which blocks the binding of EGF and transforming growth factor-Î± to EGFR. High expression of EGFR protein in glioma has been associated with tumor progression and enhanced tumorigenicity. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab, such as head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer15. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination of radio-chemotherapy for the treatment of brainstem tumors in children.
