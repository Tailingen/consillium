Masitinib in Patients With Localized, Primary GIST After Complete Surgery and With High Risk of Recurrence
The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day to placebo in the treatment of patients with localized, primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after complete surgery and with high risk of recurrence.
Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumour
DRUG: Masitinib|DRUG: Placebo
Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), e.g. from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, Until tumor recurrence (e.g. up to 24 months)
Overall Survival (OS), e.g. from the date of randomization to the date of documented death, until death of the patient (e.g. up to 24 months)
Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against wild-type c-Kit, the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit, and PDGFR. Masitinib is also thought to promote survival via modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day with respect to placebo in the treatment of patients with localized, primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after complete surgery and with high risk of recurrence.
