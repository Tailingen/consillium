Use of Compression Bandages in the Prevention of Post-mastectomy Lymphoceles
Lymphocele secondary to a mastectomy whether or not associated with a lymph node procedure (sentinel lymph node or axillary dissection) is an almost systematic consequence observed in the postoperative situation in this type of surgery.

This can be the source of pain, skin complications, and infection with a significant impact on the length of hospitalization for patients treated for breast cancer.

There is no consensus regarding the management of lymphocele. The placement of a compression bandage after mastectomy and / or axillary dissection would allow a more efficient and rapid reduction of the lymphocele and a reduction in recurrences.

This would make it possible to reduce the duration of the wearing of the drain, which determines the length of hospitalization and reduce the recurrence of lymphoceles, the punctures of which can be one of the risk factors for secondary lymphedema.
