A Clinical Study of TK216 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ewing's Sarcoma
This study is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial evaluating TK216 in combination with vincristine in the treatment of relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma (ES) including Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs).

Ewing sarcoma is characterized by genomic rearrangements resulting in over-expression of ets family transcription factors driving tumor progression. TK216 is designed to inhibit this effect by inhibiting downstream effects of the EWS-FLI1 transcription factor. Based on USA RP2D result, designed as a single arm, multicenter open-label studyï¼Œthis study is the first study of TK216 in Chinese subjects with Ewing sarcoma. The study is designed to establish safety and efficacy data in combination with vincristine to assess the potential of TK216 for further development.
