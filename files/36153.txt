Study of KTE-X19 in Adult Japanese Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma or Relapsed/Refractory B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The goal of this clinical study is to learn more about KTE-X19, and how safe and effective it is in adult Japanese participants with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) or r/r B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of KTE-X19, as measured by:

* Objective response rate (ORR) per investigator assessment, in adult Japanese participants with r/r MCL
* Overall complete remission (OCR) defined as complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) per investigator assessment, in adult Japanese participants with r/r ALL
Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Relapsed/Refractory B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: KTE-X19|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
MCL Cohort: Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Investigator Assessment, ORR is defined as the incidence of a complete remission (CR) or a partial remission (PR) per the Lugano Classification., Up to 24 months|ALL Cohort: Overall Complete Remission (OCR) Rate, OCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) per investigator assessment., Up to 24 months
MCL Cohort: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from first objective response to disease progression per indication specific response criteria or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|MCL Cohort: Best Objective Response (BOR), BOR is defined as the incidence of CR, PR, Stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) or unevaluable as best response to treatment., Up to 24 months|MCL Cohort: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from enrollment or KTE-X19 infusion to disease progression per indication specific response criteria or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|MCL Cohort: Levels of Cytokines in Serum, Up to Day 28|ALL Cohort: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate, The incidence of a minimal residual disease response (MRD-). MRD- is defined as MRD \< 10\^-6 per the standard assessment., Up to 24 months|ALL Cohort: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (alloSCT) rate, The percentage of participants receiving alloSCT as the 1st next therapy after KTE-X19 infusion., Up to 24 months|ALL Cohort: Relapse-Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from enrollment or KTE-X19 infusion date to the date of disease relapse or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|ALL Cohorts: DOR, DOR is defined as the time between their first complete remission (CR or CRi) to relapse or any death in the absence of documented relapse., Up to 24 months|MCL and ALL Cohort: Levels of Anti-Cluster of Differentiation 19 (Anti-CD19) CAR T Cells in Blood, Up to 24 months|MCL and ALL Cohorts: Percentages of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Event (SAEs) and Deaths, First infusion date up to 24 months|MCL and ALL Cohorts: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment or KTE-X19 infusion to death from any cause., Up to 24 months|MCL and ALL Cohorts: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinically Significant Changes in Safety Laboratory Values, First infusion date up to 24 months
After completing at least 24 months in the study, all participants who received an infusion of KTE-X19 will be transitioned to a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study (KT-US-982-5968) to complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments.
