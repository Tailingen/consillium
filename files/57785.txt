The Efficacy and Safety of Nab-paclitaxel Plus S-1 in First-line Treatment of Advanced Biliary Tract Adenocarcinoma
Advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options. Nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 chemotherapy will be given to untreated patients with advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma for the first-line treatment.
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel,S-1
objective response rate（ORR）, Assessed by RESIST, 6 month
Progression free survival (PFS), Assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve，From date of randomization until date of first documented PD, date of death, 6 month|overall survival time (OS), Assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve，From date of randomization until date of death, 1 year|safety profile: assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Patients with treatment-related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v4.0 to determine the tolerability of patients with Advanced Biliary Tract Adenocarcinoma, 1 year
Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel has become a standard therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer. Given the morphologic and histologic similarities between pancreatic cancer and biliary tract adenocarcinoma, nab-Paclitaxel may be a promising regimen, and S-1 has been approved for biliary tract cancer in Japan. Untreated patients with advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma will receive Nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m2 (D1, D8, q3w) and S-1 (40mg BID for body surface area\<1.25 m2; 50mg BID for body surface area of 1.25-1.5 m2; and 60mg BID for body surface area\>1.5 m2; D1-14, q3w) as the first-line treatment. The investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment, and expect to provide a more effective treatment plan for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer in China.The primary endpoint is objective response rate(ORR), and the secondary endpoints are progression-free survival(PFS), overall survival(OS) and the safety.
