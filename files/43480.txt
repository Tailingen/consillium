The Study Aims to Measure the Metabolome in Melanoma Patients Using NMR Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography and to Analyse Differences Depending on the Course of the Disease.
Prospective, single-centre study with the central question of how the metabolome from blood samples, different body fluids and tissues between patients patients with malignant melanoma in different tumour tumour stages and healthy patients and whether this is suitable for early detection of initial diagnosis, recurrence or stage shift at an early stage.

The biosamples are collected in the BioBank Dresden and used for the NMR and LC-MS analyses described here. It is planned to use the biosamples for further analyses.
Melanoma of Skin
Differences in metabolite concentrations, Metabolite concentrations are measured by NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography and compared between different subgroups., through study completion, an average of 3 years
