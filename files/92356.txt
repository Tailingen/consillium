CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. All pathological (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis \<10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From screening up to 6 years 2 months|Main Study: Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the participant's death from any cause., From screening up to 6 years 2 months|Main Study: Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Percentage of participants with TEAEs were reported. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are those events that occurred from first dose date through 30 days after last dose date, or day before subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first., From Day 1 up to 6 years 2 months|Main Study: Plasma Concentration of Erdafitinib at 2 Hours (C2h), C2h is the plasma concentration of erdafitinib at 2 hours., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21: Pre-dose up to 2 hours post-dose (each cycle length=28 days)|Main Study: Plasma Concentration of Erdafitinib at 4 Hours (C4h), C4h is the plasma concentration of erdafitinib at 4 hours., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21: Pre-dose up to 4 hours post-dose (each cycle length=28 days)
This is a multicenter, open-label study (participants will know the identity of study drugs administered) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib in participants with urothelial cancer. The study comprises a 30-days Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase comprised of 28-day treatment cycles that will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs in a long-term extension (LTE) phase, and a post-treatment Follow-up Phase that will extend from the End-of-Treatment Visit until the participant has died, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. The end of study is defined as the date when all participants have completed the study treatment (Regimens 1 to 3) and all participants enrolled under the drug-drug interaction (DDI) substudy are no longer receiving treatment with erdafitinib. The purpose of DDI sub-study is to evaluate the interaction of repeated doses of erdafitinib with a sensitive cytochrome 450 (CYP) 3A substrate (midazolam) and with an organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) probe substrate (metformin). Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
