An Internet Delivered Intervention for Re-Adjustment to Sexual Intimacy With an Ostomy After Cancer
This study investigates the feasibility and efficacy of an Internet-delivered intervention for the sexual and intimate re-adjustment of couples in which one partner is living with a temporary or permanent ostomy (e.g., colostomy, ileostomy, urostomy) following treatment for colorectal and/or bladder cancer. The two session intervention will be delivered via online videoconferencing and will focus on facilitating couples' communication around their sexual and intimate relationship. Exercises from sex therapy will be used to scaffold conversations about motivations for having sex, intimacy and sensual pleasure, and relational strengths for coping. The intervention aims to enhance couples' ability to cope with the changes in their sexual and intimate relationship. A group of couples receiving written educational material only will be used as a comparison group to measure change in sexual and intimate adjustment over time.
