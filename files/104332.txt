Trial of THEO-260 in Ovarian Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to establish if THEO-260 is safe to administer to adult females with ovarian cancer. It will also aim to establish if THEO-260 is able to treat ovarian cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What medical problems do participants have when taking THEO-260?
* At what dose is THEO-260 both safe but also shows signs of being able to treat ovarian cancer?
* At the selected dose, test THEO-260 is a wider group of participants to confirm the safety and ability to treat ovarian cancer.

Part A will be the dose escalation/ finding part of the trial where we will aim to establish a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

Part B will be where the recommended RP2D is given to a larger group of participants.

Participants will:

* Be administered 6 doses of THEO-260 over the course of 2 weeks.
* They will then visit the clinic at regular intervals for check-ups and tests to monitor safety and THEO-260 ability to treat ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: THEO-260
Safety and tolerability of THEO-260, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by:

Evaluation of DLTs and AEs during treatment and follow-up using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v5.0 or American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO; for pneumonitis only) or American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; for cytokine release syndrome \[CRS\] only)., Until end of trial for a participant, estimated at 1 year|Establish recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for THEO-260, The totality of safety and efficacy data collected will be used to assess RP2D., Until end of Part A of trial, estimated at 18 months after start of enrolment|Evaluate preliminary efficacy of THEO-260, The response to RP2D dose of THEO-260 will be assessed by Overall Response Rate (ORR) determined by tumour imaging according to RECIST v1.1., Until end of trial, estimated at 3 years after start of enrolment
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of THEO-260, Assess PK profile (maximum concentration - Cmax) of THEO-260 in blood by qPCR., Until Day 29 after first dose|Shedding of THEO-260 in saliva, urine and faeces, Assess shedding of THEO-260 in buccal, urine and faecal samples by qPCR., Until Day 29 after first dose|Risk of systemic cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after THEO-260, Assess systemic CRS following administration of THEO-260 by measurement of key markers in blood., Until Day 29 after first dose|Evaluate preliminary efficacy of THEO-260 - RECIST, Determine response to THEO-260 as assessed by tumour imaging according to RECIST v1.1., Until end of trial, estimated at 3 years after start of enrolment|Evaluate preliminary efficacy of THEO-260 - CA125, Efficacy will also be measured by changes in cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)., Until end of trial, estimated at 3 years after start of enrolment
