Non-interventional Study to Assess the Frequency of Cachexia in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to assess the frequency of cachexia and the management of cachexia and associated symptoms in a patient population with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Cachexia
Frequency of Cachexia According to Modified Fearon Criteria, Percentage of NSCLC patients with a cachexia according to Fearon criteria modified for the stages of pre-cachexia and refractory cachexia in order to classify all the featured cases without ambiguity.

A patient was considered to have cachexia if he/she had:

* Weight loss \>5% in the last 6 months prior to inclusion or
* BMI \<20 kg/m² and weight loss between 2 and 5% in the 6 months prior to inclusion or
* Weight loss \>2% and sarcopenia (as evaluated by the muscle mass index at L3) if available. If data were not available regarding possible sarcopenia, the presence of cachexia was assigned based on the 2 above conditions.

In the 3 cases defined above, patient should not have entered the refractory cachexia stage, which was defined as: ECOG performance score of 3 or 4 and a low survival expectancy as defined by Martin et al. (J Clin Oncol 2015) (BMI \<20 kg/m² and weight loss ≥ 6%) or (20 ≤ BMI ≤ 21.9 kg/m² and weight loss ≥ 11%) or (22 kg/m² ≤ BMI and weight loss ≥ 15%)., Day1
Frequency of the Different Stages of Cachexia in the General NSCLC Population, Percentage of the different stages of cachexia at inclusion.

The different stages of cachexia used the following classification:

* No Cachexia: 1) no weight loss (WL\<2%) or 2) weight gain AND no anorexia AND no sarcopenia
* The pre-cachexia stage : 1) 2% ≤ weight loss ≤ 5% AND BMI ≥ 20 and/or 2) anorexia (according to question 13 of the quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30) and/or 3) weight loss \< 2% AND sarcopenia
* Cachexia: 1) Weight loss \> 5% OR 2) weight loss between 2 and 5% AND BMI \< 20 kg/m² OR 3) weight loss \> 2% AND sarcopenia. In all cases, patient should not have entered the refractory cachexia stage
* Refractory cachexia: ECOG 3 or 4 AND low survival expectancy \[BMI \< 20kg/m² and weight loss ≥ 6%\] OR \[20 ≤ BMI ≤ 21,9 kg/m² and weight loss ≥ 11%\] OR \[22 kg/m² ≤ BMI and weight loss ≥ 15%\], Day 1|Frequency of the Different Stages of Cachexia in the General NSCLC Population According to Stage Associated With NSCLC., Percentage of the different stages of cachexia at inclusion according to the NSCLC stage, Day 1|Frequency of the Different Stages of Cachexia in the General NSCLC Population According to Histology Associated With NSCLC., Percentage of the different stages of cachexia according to the NSCLC histology, Day 1|Frequency of Sarcopenia in the General NSCLC Patients With Cachexia, Percentage of patients with sarcopenia in the general NSCLC patients with cachexia, Day 1|Frequency of Sarcopenia With no Clinical Significant Weight Loss in the General NSCLC Patients With Pre-cachexia, Percentage of patient with sarcopenia and no clinical significant weight loss (sarcopenia and WL\< 2%) in the general NSCLC patients with pre-cachexia:, Day 1|Frequency of the Different Stages of Cachexia in the General NSCLC Population According to Molecular Abnormalities Associated With NSCLC., Percentage of the different stages of cachexia according to the molecular abnormalities associated with NSCLC:

". Depending on the location of the patient mark on the scale, a score of between 0 ("nothing at all") and 10 ("as usual") will be allocated., Day 1|Description of the Clinical Signs/Symptoms Associated With the Different Stages of Cachexia: Loss of Appetite - AC/S FAACT, Score of the 12-question AC/S module (Anorexia-Cachexia module) of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT) questionnaire assessing anorexia and cachexia: the AC/S module of the FAACT questionnaire consists of 12 questions to assess over the last 7 days quality of life, related to anorexia or cachexia. The score ranges between 0 and 48, the higher the score, the higher the quality of life., Day 1|Description of the Clinical Signs/Symptoms Associated With the Different Stages of Cachexia: Inflammation Markers - Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, Day 1|Description of the Clinical Signs/Symptoms Associated With the Different Stages of Cachexia: Inflammation Markers - CRP, CRP level, Day 1|Description of the Clinical Signs/Symptoms Associated With the Different Stages of Cachexia: Inflammation Markers - Fibrinogen, fibrinogen level, Day 1|Description of the Quality of Life Associated With the Different Stages of Cachexia., Quality of life has been analysed using scores from the functional scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire- Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire): score ranging from 0 (malfunction) to 100 (healthy level of functioning) for the following parameters : physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social scales, Day 1|Description of the Level of Physical Activity Associated With the Different Stages of Cachexia., Three levels of physical activity are defined:

This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional, European (France and Belgium), multicentric prevalence study, conducted on a representative population of 500 patients with NSCLC, to assess the frequency and the management of cachexia and associated symptoms.

The study will be conducted in accordance with the professional code of ethics and the good epidemiological practices guidelines developed by the ADELF (the Association of French-Speaking Epidemiologists) and in accordance with the STROBE recommendations for the drafting of reports and publications related to the study.

The information will be collected during a single visit to the oncologist/lung specialist as part of the usual patient management of his/her lung cancer. The physician will explain the purpose of the study to the patient with an information form specific to the study and will inform him/her of the option to refuse or withdraw from participation. The patient information form in France or a specific consent form in Belgium will be signed by the patient and a copy will be given to him/her (the original will be kept by the physician).

This study does not require any additional specific data. Data will come from the medical file and from the routine disease management. Furthermore, the following self-completion questionnaires will be proposed to patients: Visual analogue scale for dietary intake (dietary intake VAS), assessment of the concerns associated with the anorexia/cachexia (Anorexia-Cachexia module of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy \[FAACT\] questionnaire), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), and assessment of physical activity (IPAQ, International Physical Activity Questionnaire). Abdominal CT-scan, if available, will be collected for assessment of skeletal muscle mass index at L3.
