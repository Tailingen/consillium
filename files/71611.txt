Solid Tumor Cancer Surgery With or Without Intraoperative Imaging: A Registry
The study objective is to collect prospective data on cancer patients who undergo surgery and intraoperative imaging. The registry will include (but not limited to) cancer type, stage, intraoperative challenges to the surgeon, usage and results of intraoperative imaging, and recurrence surveillance.

Our objective is to collect prospective data on cancer subjects who undergo surgery and intraoperative imaging. The registry will include (but not limited to) cancer type, stage, intraoperative challenges to the surgeon, usage and results of intraoperative imaging, and recurrence surveillance.

In this protocol, subjects that receive intraoperative imaging will provide us the opportunity to record what tissues fluoresce in the operating room, and then to identify if these lesions are cancer when the histopathology is performed. Also, we will monitor any side effects or potential toxicities that may occur. This data can then be used to predict if a subject is more likely to develop a local recurrence due to missed cancer cells, metastatic lymph nodes or synchronous lesions.
