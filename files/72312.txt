The CARE Program is a randomized trial of a cancer rehabilitation program designed to help older cancer patients who have shown to have a loss of function.

This is a prospective, two-arm, single-center randomized controlled pilot trial of a cancer rehabilitation program for older adults, titled the 'CARE program,' which is designed to maintain and/or improve functional status and quality of life in older adults diagnosed with cancer. Adults aged 65 years and older with cancer will be screened with a Geriatric Assessment (GA) for eligibility. Although breast cancer patients will be eligible, this study will focus primarily on other types of cancers. Adults with at least one functional deficit --defined as impairment in ability to perform activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive decline or balance -- will be randomized to either the intervention (CARE program) or to the control arm (Supportive care services information only). Both arms will receive a brochure about the supportive care program to provide patients who we've identified as having deficits with information about auxiliary services available and because the intent is to limit the difference between the groups. We hypothesize that patients who participate in the CARE program will maintain or improve functional status and quality of life when compared to supportive care services information only.
