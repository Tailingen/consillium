Debunking the Frailty-sarcopenIa-ADT Axis in mEtastatic Prostate canceR With multiComponent Exercise: The FIERCE Trial
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 16-week supervised, clinic-based circuit training intervention utilizing resistance and functional exercises and self-directed aerobic exercise will improve frailty and sarcopenic status and disease progression outcomes among pre-frail/frail metastatic prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

The names of the study intervention involved in this study is:

• Supervised circuit training (aerobic and resistance exercise regimen)
PROSTATE CANCER|Metastatic Prostate Cancer|Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Supervised Circuit Training
Change in Circulating Inflammation for Exercise Group, Assessed by change in systemic inflammatory biomarkers through blood analysis (ul/ml)., Baseline (week 0) and Post-intervention (week 17)|Frailty, This will be assessed by the Fried Frailty Phenotype, which measures participant ratings on a five-characteristic scale and will be totaled for an overall frailty score of 1-2, identified as prefail, or ≥3, identified as frail. Participants will receive a score of 1 (experience characteristic) or 0 (do not experience) for each characteristic., Baseline (week 0) and Post-intervention (week 17)
Sarcopenia, A sarcopenia score of ≤10.75 kg/m2, as assessed by computed tomography (CT), will be the cut point used for identifying muscle loss = 1 point., Baseline (week 0) and Post-intervention (week 17)|Skeletal Muscle Biomarkers - myokines, Assessed from muscle biopsy specimens of the vastus lateralis (ul/ml)., Baseline (week 0) and Post-intervention (week 17)
This research study is a pilot, randomized control study, which is the first-time investigators are examining this intervention in this setting.

Participants will be randomized into one of two study groups: Exercise Group versus Attention Control Group. Randomization means a participant is placed into a group by chance.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, including extensive evaluations of fitness, physical health and strength, blood tests, muscle biopsy, surveys, and follow-up visits.

Participation in this research study is expected to last about 16 weeks.

It is expected that about 80 people will take part in this research study.

The Prostate Cancer Foundation is providing funding for this research study.
