Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
Current therapies for Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.
* To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination, radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
