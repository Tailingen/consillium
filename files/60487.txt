Using Probiotics to Reactivate Tumor Suppressor Genes in Colon Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine if probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on the colon cancer-associated microbiota and epigenetic alterations in colon cancer. Dietary supplementation consists of two ProBion Clinica tablets, yielding a daily dose of 1.4 x 10 ˄ 10 Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 (ATCC SD5219), 7x10 ˄ 9 Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (ATCC 700396), and 0.63 g inulin.

Changes in microbiota composition after probiotics use, The microbiota composition is analysed at baseline and after probiotics use in tissue and faeces samples, 8-78 days depending on time elapsed from inclusion to surgical removal of tumor
Epigenetic changes after probiotics use, DNA methylation levels are analysed at baseline and after probiotics use in tissue samples, 8-78 days depending on time elapsed from inclusion to surgical removal of tumor
