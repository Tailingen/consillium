Utidelone Versus Docetaxel in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare Utidelone with Docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously failed platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. This phase III, open-label, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of Utidelone and Docetaxel in the aforementioned lung cancers.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Utidelone Injection|DRUG: Docetaxel Injection
Overall Survival, Comparing the OS of Utidelone and Docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who previously failed Platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens, 36 months
Progression Free Survival, Imaging-provable disease progression, 36 months|Objective Response Rate, The number of patients with an observed best efficacy rating of CR or PR as a percentage of the total number of evaluable patients according to RECIST 1.1., 36 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, The number of patients with best efficacy ratings of CR, PR and SD as a percentage of the total number of evaluable patients according to RECIST 1.1., 36 months
In this study, 612 patients will be screened, enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the Utidelone (40 mg/m2/d intravenously once daily on days 1-5) treatment or the docetaxel (75 mg/m2/d, intravenously once on day 1) control group, stratified by prior immunotherapy status (PD-1/PD-L1 vs. no PD-1/PD-L1). Both groups will be treated in a 21-day cycle until disease progression or an occurrence of intolerable toxicities. Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks (Â±7 days) after randomization and continued until disease progression as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria, with or without discontinuation of study treatment; the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be used to assess patients' quality of life based on a signed informed consent.
