Photobiomodulation Therapy in the Management of Hand-foot Syndrome and Hand-foot Skin Reaction
Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a side effect of chemotherapy. HFS is characterized by redness, swelling, and pain on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, which can progress to blistering. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) refers to symptoms affecting the hands and/or feet associated with multikinase inhibitors (TKIs). HFS and HFSR are painful complications that can lead to compromised daily activities, sleep-wake disturbance and impaired mobility, eventually decreasing Quality of Life (QoL).

Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive therapy based on the application of visible and/or near-infrared light produced by a laser diode or a light-emitting diode. The scientifically proven biologic effects of PBM are improved wound healing, and a reduction in pain, inflammation, and oedema. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBMT in the management of HFS and HFSR.
