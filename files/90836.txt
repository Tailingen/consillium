68 Ga PSMA PET/MRI for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a pilot study to investigate the evaluate to use of a drug/radiopharmaceutical called Gallium-68 PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) for use in PET/MRI evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI
Evaluation of PSMA PET-MR for identification of intra and extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma in patients, Sensitivity of PSMA PET-MRI for detection of LI-RADS 5 (definitely HCC) lesions on a per-lesion basis with histopathology as the gold standard. We will perform a Radiologic-pathologic correlation comparing HCC PSMA SUVmax with tumor PSMA immunostaining positivity., 18 months
This is a prospective pilot proof-of-concept single-center study. Primary Objective Using surgical histopathology as the reference standard, the investigators intend to achieve the following objectives in adult subjects with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) undergoing surgical resection or transplant:

1. To demonstrate the feasibility of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI for imaging patients with HCC
2. To estimate the sensitivity of SUVmax on PSMA PET for identification of LI-RADSÂ® 5 (definitely HCC) observations or biopsy proven HCC(s).
3. To perform a Radiology-Pathology correlation of PSMA uptake at PET with HCC tumor PSMA immunostaining, tumor pathology features, and signal and enhancement characteristics at MRI
