Assessment of Safety, Tolerability and PK Profile of MSP008-22 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is the 'first-in-human' clinical trial of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), Tablet formulation for Oral dosing of MSP008-22, a molecule (new chemical entity) with anticancer properties.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: MSP008-22
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), to assess Tolerability of MSP008-22 in Human, 10 days post dose|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), to assess Safety of MSP008-22 in Human, 10 days post-dose|Incidence of Treatment Emergent adverse events (TEAE); % of patients who experience at least 1 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE); % of patients who discontinue due to TEAE(s)., to assess Safety of MSP008-22 in Human, 30 days post-dose
Plasma Cmax, (maximum measured concentration of MSP008-22 in plasma), 72 hours post dose|Plasma AUClast, (area under the plasma concentration time curve of MSP008-22 from hour 0 to last sample with measurable plasma concentrations), 72 hours post dose|Plasma AUCinfinity, (area under the concentration-time curve of MSP008-22 in plasma over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity), 72 hours post dose|plasma tmax, (time from dosing to maximum measured concentration of MSP008-22 in plasma), 72 hours post dose|Plasma t1/2, (terminal half-life of MSP008-22 in plasma), 72 hours post dose|CL/F, (total clearance of MSP008-22 in plasma after administration estimated using formula), 72 hours post dose|Vz/F, (apparent volume of distribution of MSP008-22 during the terminal phase following administration, estimated using formula), 72 hours post dose|Ae, (the total amount of MSP008-22 excreted in urine), 72 hours post dose|Ae %dose, (the percent of MSP008-22 recovered in urine), 72 hours post dose|CLr, (and the apparent renal clearance of MSP008-22), 72 hours post dose
This Single Ascending Dose (SAD) clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral ascending doses of the IMP in patients with Stage IV of advanced solid tumours including but not limited to Breast cancer including Triple-negative breast cancer, Ovarian cancer, Prostate cancer, Head and Neck squamous cell cancer).

The trial will also assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MSP008-22 in humans.

The safety, tolerability and PK data from this trial will determine the safety of MSP008-22 for dosing in humans in further clinical trials.

As MSP008-22 has shown efficacy in in vitro studies against various cancer cell lines and in prostate and breast cancer cell lines in xenograft studies, the first in human trial of MSP008-22 is planned in patients of 'Stage-IV of Advanced Solid Tumours (Breast cancer including Triple-negative breast cancer, Ovarian cancer, Prostate cancer, Head and Neck squamous cell cancer and other advanced solid tumors).
