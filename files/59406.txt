Study of DS-1062a in Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Actionable Genomic Alterations (TROPION-Lung05)
This is a study of the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of DS-1062a in participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with known actionable genomic alterations.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: DS-1062a
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., From baseline until disease progression, death, or other protocol defined reason, up to approximately 24 months.
Duration of Response (DOR), From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Concentration (Cmax), From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax), From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Percentage of Participants Who Reported Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), From baseline up to approximately 24 months
This study will evaluate DS-1062a 6.0 mg/kg in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with actionable genomic alterations and who have been previously been treated with 1 platinum-containing therapy and 1 or more lines of targeted therapy. The study will be divided into 3 periods: Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period. The primary analysis of Objective Response Rate (ORR) by blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be conducted after all participants either have been followed for at least 9 months after the start of study treatment or have discontinued from the study, whichever occurs first.
