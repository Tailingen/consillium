Effects of Oral Cancer Treatments on Upper Esophageal Opening During Swallowing
The purpose of this study is to investigate post-operative and post-radiation upper esophageal sphincter opening measures in oral cancer patients, compare measures to age- and gender-matched healthy adults, and determine relationships with patient swallowing outcomes and quality of life.
Cancer of Head and Neck
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Videofluoroscopic imaging (VFSS) with high-resolution manometry (HRM)
Change in Upper Esophageal Maximum Admittance as measured by HRM among time points of oral cancer treatment., This measure provides understanding of how well throat muscles pull the upper esophagus open to allow flow of liquid or food from the throat to the esophagus., Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)|Change in Upper Esophageal Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP) as measured by HRM, This measure indicates how well the muscles of the upper esophageal sphincter relax to allow liquid and food to pass through., Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)|Change in Hypopharyngeal Pressure at Nadir Impedence (PNI) as measured by HRM, This measure indicates how well the upper esophagus stretches open to accept the liquid or food., Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)
Change in the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) Scores among time points of oral cancer treatment, Measurement of swallowing-related quality of life. This patient-rated tool has a maximum score of 100 points total across 20 questions, where the highest score indicates better overall swallow-related quality of life., Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)|Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) Grading Scale Score, Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) grade of 0 to 4, where lower grade reflects better swallow function, Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)|Statistical Correlation between MDADI and Maximum Admittance, Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)|Statistical Correlation between DIGEST and Maximun Admittance, Approximately 4 weeks (post-surgery), and up to 6 months (3 months post-radiation)
