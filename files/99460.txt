Open-label, Dose-finding Study to Determine Antibody Response to G17DT Treatment in Patients With Gastric Cancer.
An open label, dose-finding, schedule-changing, sequential, multiple dose, multi-center study in patients with Stage I-III gastric cancer. The first group of patients received a starting dose of 250 µg at weeks 0, 1, and 3. Thereafter, allocation to treatment with 100 µg or 500 µg was based on antibody response and dose tolerability.
Gastric Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: G17DT
Antibody Levels, Gastrin-17 antibodies are produced as a result of treatment with G17DT and the proportion of patients producing gastrin-17 antibodies was considered to be an appropriate measure of the immunogenicity of the dosing schedule under study., Up to Week 24|Injection Site Reaction, An examination was performed to assess injection site tolerability at every posttreatment visit from Week 1 to Week 12 (end of core phase)., Up to Week 12|World Health Organization (WHO) Performance Status, WHO performance status was monitored up to Week 12 to compare final status with baseline status., Up to Week 12|Diptheria Toxoid Antibody Levels, Diptheria toxoid antibody levels were measured at screening and at Week 12 to assess toxicity from Diptheria toxoid., Up to Week 12
Adverse Events, Any adverse events that were reported during the study, Up to Week 24
