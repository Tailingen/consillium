Predictive OCTA Biomarkers After Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery
This study evaluates the structural parameters, by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), retinal vessel density, using OCT angiography, and visual acuity in patients that received endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.
Pituitary Adenoma
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery
Comparison between retinal structures before and 48 hours and 1 year after Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery, 8 patients with pituitary adenoma compressing optic chiasm. Changes in thickness of ganglion cell complex (microns) and in thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (microns) before and 48 hours and 1 year after Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery, 48 hours and 1 year follow up|Comparison between retinal microvasculature before and 48 hours and 1 year after Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery, 8 patients with pituitary adenoma compressing optic chiasm. Changes in retinal vessel density (percent) in macular and papillary regions before and 48 hours and 1 year after Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery, 48 hours and 1 year follow up
Correlation between retinal structures and visual acuity after Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery, 8 patients with pituitary adenoma compressing optic chiasm underwent Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery.

Correlation between ganglion cell complex, retinal nerve fiber layer thicknesses (microns) at baseline and visual acuity recovery (logMAR) 1 year after surgery., 1 year follow up|Correlation between retinal microvasculature and visual acuity after Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery, 8 patients with pituitary adenoma compressing optic chiasm underwent Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery.

Correlation between retinal vessel density (percent) at baseline and visual acuity recovery (logMAR) 1 year after surgery., 1 year follow up
The primary outcome was to detect the changes in visual acuity, retinal structural and vascular features at 48 hours and 1 year after Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.

The secondary outcome was to identify potential biomarker that could predict the functional recovery at 1 year follow up.
