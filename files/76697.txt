Methotrexate and interferon are widely used drugs in treatment in patients with cutaneous T-cell Lymphomas. Efficacy and safety of both drugs have never been compared directly in one study.

Patients will be randomly assigned to receive Methotrexate or Interferon Alfa 2b. Treatment will continue until disease progression or the development of intolerable toxicities. Study is conducted to analyse and compare efficacy, safety and quality of life provided by Methotrexate or Interferon Alfa 2b.
