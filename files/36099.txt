Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Gebasaxturev (V937) Administered Intravenously or Intratumorally With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Pembrolizumab Alone in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic Melanoma (V937-011)
This is a Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of gebasaxturev administered both intratumorally (ITu) and intravenously (IV) as combination therapy with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus pembrolizumab alone in anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1)-treatment-naive participants with advanced/metastatic melanoma. The primary hypothesis of the study is that gebasaxturev administered either ITu or IV in combination with pembrolizumab results in a superior objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on blinded independent central review (BICR), compared to pembrolizumab alone. This study will be terminated once all participants finish treatment with V937. Participants eligible to continue to receive pembrolizumab will be transferred to MK-3475-587 study.
Advanced/Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Gebasaxturev IV|BIOLOGICAL: Gebasaxturev ITu|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, without evidence of progression based on non-target or new lesions) as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 which was modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR based on modified RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to ~ 35 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Up to ~ 35 months|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrated a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all lesions) or confirmed Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, without evidence of progression based on non-target or new lesions.) per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. RECIST 1.1 was adjusted for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ and was assessed by BICR for this outcome measure., Up to ~ 35 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1, as Assessed by the Investigator, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR based on modified RECIST 1.1 was presented., Up to ~ 35 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) RECIST 1.1, as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm.
