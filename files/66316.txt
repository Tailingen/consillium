This therapy involves the use of melphalan, etoposide, and carboplatin (consolidation chemotherapy); autologous stem cell rescue, post-transplant radiation therapy and a maintenance phase with Isotretinoin (Accutane, 13-cis-retinoic acid) therapy. If available, patients should also consider post-transplant therapy with cytokines and monoclonal antibody (ch14.18) on a COG or New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) trial.
