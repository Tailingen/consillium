Personalized Exercise Oncology
The Goal of the study is to identify trait-homogenous groups of cancer patients in regards to their physical activity associated health literacy. Based on these Groups, individualized exercise protocols and educative strategies can be developed which may increase the efficacy of the exercise therapy and increases the likelihood that patient get involved in physical activity.

OTHER: Survey
Patient Clusters, Identification of different, trait-homogenous patient clusters, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Questionnaire: Physical Activity Associated Health Literacy, To assess physical activity-associated health competence the recently developed and validated questionnaire from Sudeck and Pfeifer (2016) will be used, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Questionnaire: Health Literacy, To assess health-literacy the recently developed and validated questionnaire from Sudeck and Pfeifer (2016) will be used, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Questionnaire: Health Related Quality of Life, Quality of Life will be assessed with the validated 30-item self-assessment questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Questionnaire: Fatigue, To asses fatigue patients will be asked to complete the 12-item EORTC QLQ-FA12 (FA = fatigue), which is a newly developed questionnaire which has been intensively validated, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Questionnaire: Physical Activity, Patient's level of physical activity will be assessed with the SQUASH Physical Activity Questionnaire. It includes multiple activities referring to a 'normal' week. Activity dimensions asked include actively commuting physical activity (walking, cycling), physical activity at work or school, household activities, leisure time activities (sports, walking, gardening, cycling)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Questionnaire: Emotion Thermometers, Emotion thermometers are four-domain visual-analogue scale including distress, anxiety, depression, and anger. Each domain is rated on an 11-point (0 to 10) Likert scale, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Questionnaire: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Bone pain will be assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). This is a valid and reliable tool for pain measurement in cancer patients with bone metastases. It measures both pain severity and pain interference on function, through study completion, an average of 1 year
