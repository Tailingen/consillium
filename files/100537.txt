Liposomal Bupivacaine vs Ropivacaine for TAPBs
Few studies have compared the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided TAP blocks with Liposomal bupivacaine(LB) versus ropivacaine in reducing postoperative opioid usage in patients undergoing laparoscopic lower abdominal tumor Resection. Therefore, we are conducting this prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare the postoperative analgesic effects of LB and ropivacaine for TAP blocks among patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal procedures.
Abdominal Tumor|Postoperative Analgesia|Liposomal Bupivacaine|Ropivacaine
DRUG: Liposomal Bupivacaine|DRUG: Ropivacaine
Postoperative opioid use, The amount of drug used in the postoperative analgesia pump, 3 days postoperatively
Postoperative pain score, Postoperative VAS score, 3 days postoperatively|Postoperative adverse reactions, Postoperative adverse reactions were followed up, 3 days postoperatively
This study aimed to investigate the impact of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) on postoperative opioid usage for ultrasound(US)-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks in laparoscopic colorectal resections. We divided 76 patients into two groups. An injection of bilateral TAP blocks was administered to LB group using 133mg liposomal bupivacaine in each block (266mg total), and to R group using 20 ml 0.25% ropivacaine in each block (40 ml total). Opioid consumption and pain scores at 6h, 24h, 48h and 72h were recorded postoperatively, as well as the total intraoperative remifentanil dose, the hospital stay lengths after surgery, and adverse events including dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.
