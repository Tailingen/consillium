A Study of BBI503 in Advanced Solid Tumors, or BBI503/ Sorafenib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 dose escalation study of BBI503 monotherapy, or BBI503 in combination with Sorafenib. This study population is adult patients with advanced solid tumors in monotherapy, or adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in combination therapy.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: BBI503|DRUG: Sorafenib
Determine of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BBI503 monotherapy and in combination with Sorafenib by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 36 days|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Approximately 7 months|Pharmacokinetic profile of BBI503, 37 days
Assessment of the preliminary anti-tumor activity by performing tumor assessments approximately every 8 weeks, The radiologic assessments will be evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, 6 months|Progression Free Survival, The time the participant stays on study until progression will be measured and recorded., Approximately 7 month|Overall Survival, Participants follow-up for overall survival will occur. Maximum follow-up time is 1 year after the initial administration of the last subject., Approximately1 year
