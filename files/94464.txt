Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of AK104 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of AK104 as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1a) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK104 as a single agent, and a dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) which will characterize treatment of AK104 as a single agent at the MTD or RP2D.
Advanced Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AK-104
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after the last dose of AK104, up to 2 years and 3 months|Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be assessed during the first 4 weeks of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle (4 weeks) of treatment., During the first 4 weeks
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for â‰¥8 weeks) based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 3 years|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until death due to any cause., Up to 3 years|Area under the curve (AUC) of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104; Up to 2 years and 3 months.|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of AK104 through to 90 days after last dose of AK104; Up to 2 years and 3 months.|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK104 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of AK104 through to 90 days after last dose of AK104; Up to 2 years and 3 months.|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK104 through to 90 days after last dose of AK104; Up to 2 years and 3 months.
