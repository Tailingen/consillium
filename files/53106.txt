Study of CS-7017 in Combination With FOLFIRI in Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Who Failed First-Line Therapy
This phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, parallel group, multicenter study will be conducted at up to 18 study centers in the US, Central America, and South America. Adult subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who failed first-line chemotherapy will participate in the study, which will be conducted on an outpatient basis. It is anticipated that 100 subjects will be enrolled to obtain approximately 90 evaluable subjects.
Colorectal Cancer|Neoplasms, Colorectal
DRUG: CS7017|DRUG: irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFIRI)
Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 16 Weeks After Administration of CS-7017 Combined With Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) After Failure of First-line Therapy in Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization until the first objective evidence of disease progression or death from any cause., Baseline to 16 weeks postdose
Median Overall Progression-Free Survival Following Administration of CS-7017 in Combination With Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFIRI) After Failure of First-line Therapy in Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization until the first objective evidence of disease progression or death from any cause., Baseline to approximately 3 years postdose|Median Overall Progression-Free Survival: Sensitivity Analysis Including Clinical Progression After Administration of CS-7017 and Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil After Failure of First-line Therapy of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first objective documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death resulting from any cause, whichever came first. The sensitivity analysis included clinical progression as an event., Baseline to approximately 3 years postdose|Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate Following Administration of CS-7017 in Combination With Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) After Failure of First-line Therapy in Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, As per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors v1.0, best overall response was characterized as confirmed complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed partial response (PR) defined as ≥30% decrease from baseline, stable disease (SD) defined as neither progressive disease (PD) nor PR, and PD defined as ≥20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as CR + PR. If there is no tumor assessment after the first dose of study drug, the best overall response is classified as Inevaluable., Baseline to approximately 3 years postdose|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in ≥10% of Participants Following Administration of CS-7017 Combined With Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) After Failure of First-line Therapy in Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, An adverse event (AE) \>30 days after last dose of study drug was not included as a treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) unless considered related to treatment., Baseline to 30 days post last dose, up to approximately 3 years
