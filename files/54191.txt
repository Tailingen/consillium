PSMA-PET/MRI Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer
The goal of this study is to determine the safety of using PSMA-PET/mpMRI to define radiotherapy targets, while meeting all current planning criteria. This study also intends to determine the feasibility of performing stereotactic body radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost on the dominant intra-prostatic lesions while meeting all current planning criteria.

This study aims to determine if multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging can help optimize the placement of the high dose inhomogeneity characterizing stereotactic body radiation therapy. All radiation plans have "hot spots" of radiation, and in current practice these regions are randomly located. This study will focus those hot spots on regions determined by mpMRI + PSMA-PET to have visible tumor.
