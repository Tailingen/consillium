Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of registration to the earliest date of documented evidence of recurrent or progressive disease or the date of death due to any cause., Six months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be assessed by the percentage of patients achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), as evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Six months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of registration to the date of death due to any cause, or the date of last contact (censored observations)., Twelve months
GCN is predicted to be the front-line therapy for biliary and pancreatic cancer in the future given excellent results of current early clinical trials (ORR â‰¥ 67% in pancreatic cancer). This will change standard of care for front-line therapy in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. In this cohort of patients' tolerability after 6 cycles of therapy will be a challenge. Investigators hypothesize that developing a maintenance strategy with TTF+G will be cutting edge approach and can potentially transform front-line standard of care therapy in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. If this pilot study proves fruitful then a larger study to confirm findings can be conducted.
