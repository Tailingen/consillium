Pathways to Advance Targeted and Helpful Serious Illness Conversations (PATH-SIC)
The purpose of this study is to increase serious illness conversations (SICs) about patients goals and preferences regarding their healthcare between patients with cancer and their oncology clinicians and improved care provided near the end of life.

Proportion of patients with an SIC at 60 days for arm 1 (patient +clinician nudge) vs arm 2 (no nudge)., The numerator includes patients with any SIC documentation extracted from the Advanced Care Planning module between the date of the poor prognosis node and 60 days. The denominator is all patients randomized to the applicable study arm., up to 60 days after reaching the poor prognosis node
Proportion of patients with an SIC at 60 days, comparison of all 4 study arms, Same as the primary outcome, up to 60 days after reaching the poor prognosis node|Time from SIC to death among decedents, Time from SIC to death among decedents, randomization up to 1 year|Receipt of chemotherapy in last 14 days of life, Whether or not the patient received chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life, among decedents, randomization up to 1 year|ED visits in the last 30 days of life, Number of ED visits in the last 30 days of life, among decedents, randomization up to 1 year|Hospitalization in last 30 days of life, Hospitalization in the last 30 days of life, among decedents, randomization up to 1 year|Median length of hospitalization, Median length of last hospitalization, in days among decedents, randomization up to 1 year|ICU utilization in last 30 days of life, ICU hospitalization in the last 30 days of life, among decedents, randomization up to 1 year|Death in an acute care facility, Presence or absence of death in an acute care facility like a hospital or emergency room, randomization up to 1 year|Death in the ICU, Whether or not death occurred in an ICU, randomization up to 1 year|Hospice enrollment at death, Whether or not the patient was enrolled in hospice on the day of death, randomization up to 1 year|Enrolled < 4 days in hospice at death, Whether or not the patient was enrolled in hospice for less than 4 days on the day of death, randomization up to 1 year|Patient preferences, Patient responses on SHARE questionnaire, Up to 60 days after randomization
The objective of this study is to implement an intervention in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that uses cancer treatment pathways data to identify patients appropriate for serious illness conversations (SICs) and applies "nudges" to patients and their oncology clinicians to increase SICs and improve end of life (EOL) outcomes.

Identified participants and clinicians will be randomized into 1 or 4 groups.

* Nudge to patient and clinician
* Nudge to patient only
* Nudge to clinician only
* No nudge.

The expected enrollment is approximately 800 participants.
