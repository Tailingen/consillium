A Study to Evaluate 5 μg/kg Tbo-filgrastim in Infants, Children and Adolescents With Solid Tumors Without Bone Marrow Involvement
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of daily subcutaneous administration of 5 μg/kg tbo-filgrastim in infants, children and adolescents with solid tumors without bone marrow involvement.
Neutropenia
DRUG: tbo-filgrastim
Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE occurring during the timeframe. A non-TEAE is any AE not considered a TEAE.

Severity was rated by the investigator using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) scale where 3=severe but not life-threatening, 4=life-threatening and 5=death. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator (related=reasonable possibility). Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes., Non-TEAE: signing of informed consent to Day -1 (last day of CTX in week 1).

The ECGs were interpreted by both the investigator and a qualified physician at the central diagnostic center as normal, abnormal not clinically significant, or abnormal clinically significant. The following parameters were measured/derived for each ECG assessment: heart rate, PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, corrected QT interval according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF), corrected QT interval according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), QRS duration, and QRS axis.

The count of participants with potentially clinically significant ECG findings is reported., Day 1 (start of tbo-filgrastim administration) pre-dose, 4 hours post dose and 6 hours post dose; Day 21 (end of study visit)|Participants With Negative Shifts From Baseline to End of Study in Physical Exam Findings, Physical examination was performed at screening and at the end-of-study visit. The following body systems were marked as normal or abnormal and if abnormal, whether clinically significant: Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat (HEENT), chest and lungs, heart, abdomen, skin, lymph nodes and neurological.

Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline value were considered as an adverse event.
