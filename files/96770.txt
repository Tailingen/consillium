Fulvestrant in Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Estrogen may cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fulvestrant works in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: fulvestrant
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) objective response rate (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]), Monthly
Toxicity, Every Month
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine if the prostate-specific antigen objective response (complete and partial response) rate is \> 0.2 in patients with androgen-independent advanced prostate cancer treated with fulvestrant.

Secondary

* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 0, 14, and 28. Courses repeat once a month in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
