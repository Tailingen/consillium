However, use of this item set is not limited to practices that explicitly function as medical homes. Any primary care practice that is interested in a more comprehensive assessment of their patients' experiences may add the PCMH items to the survey (6 questions; response options: 3-item, 4-item or 6-item Likert scale)., 12 months|Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Scale v1.2 (answer responses using a Likert Scale), As part of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) created in 2004, The PROMIS Global-10 is a publically available global health assessment tool that allows measurements of symptoms, functioning, and healthcare-related quality of life (HRQoL) for a wide variety of chronic diseases and conditions (10 questions; response options: 5-item Likert scale)., 12 months|Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions Symptoms Scale (Self-efficacy for managing symptoms short form 8a (8 questions; 5-item Likert scale), The PROMIS adult Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions Symptoms Scale assesses self-reported current level of confidence in managing symptoms from chronic health conditions (8 questions; response options: 5-item Likert scale)., 12 months|The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (version 3), Questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients (30 questions; response options: 4-item or 7-item Likert scale), 12 months|Receipt of Treatment Summary from Health Information and National Trends Survey (HINTS 4, Cycle 2), The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) regularly collects nationally representative data about the American public's knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information (1 question; response option: yes/no)., 12 months|Primary Care Delivery of Survivorship Care Scale, Self-reported measure of perceived survivorship care (6 questions; response options: 5-item Likert scale), 12 months|Patient-Reported Bother from Side Effects of Cancer Therapy (Validated Single-Item Measure), The single item "I am bothered by side effects of treatment" (GP5), rated on a 5-point Likert scale, is part of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) version (1 question; response option: 5-item Likert scale), 12 months|The Satisfaction with Decision Scale, (6 questions; response options: 4-item Likert Scale), 12 months|Confidence in Managing Survivorship Care, Questionnaire assessing self-reported receipt of survivorship care planning, expectations of their providers, and confidence in managing their survivorship care (5 questions; response options: 4-item Likert scales)., 12 months|Cancer recurrence, Single item, question: Did a doctor or other health professional ever tell you that your cancer had come back? (response option: yes/no). 1a. If yes, what was the most recent year a doctor or other health professional told you that your cancer had come back? _______________, 12 months

A quasi-experimental non-randomized pre/post with control group trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage colorectal and breast cancer survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. The trial will test the efficacy of an embedded primary care provider (PCP) model (experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk survivors who will be transitioned at 6-36 months post-treatment for comprehensive survivorship care. We hypothesize that a) patients in the PCP model will have superior receipt of recommended care compared to usual care; b) patients in the PCP model will perceive significantly better care coordination, self-efficacy, and confidence in their PCP compared to usual care; and c) use of unplanned and non-recommended care will be less in the PCP model compared to usual care.
