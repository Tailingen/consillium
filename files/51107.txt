Treatment of Refractory/Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma With CD19-TriCART Cell Therapy
This is a single arm, open-label, phase Ⅰ study, to determine the safety and efficacy of CD19-TriCAR-T, an autologous tri-functional anti- CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-positive T cell therapy, in Refractory/ Relapsed CD19 Positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

The tri-functional anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor contains an anti-CD19 scFv, a PD-L1 blocker, and a cytokine complex, enabling the CD19-TriCAR-T to simultaneously targeting the CD19 positive NHL cells，blocking the inhibitory PD-L1 signal and stimulating T/NK cell activation and expansion.
