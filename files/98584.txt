Single Centre Prospective Evaluation of 68Gallium-FAPI PET/MRI in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Single centre prospective evaluation of 68Gallium(Ga68)-FAPI-46 PET/MRI in patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). 68Gallium-FAPI-46 PET/MRI and standard contrasted multiphasic MRI imaging will be acquired in patients with radiological or histological diagnosis of HCC. The PET scan results will be compared to standard imaging to evaluate its role in lesion detection, characterisation and staging in patients with HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Radiolabelled tracer, 68Gallium-FAPI-46 PET/MRI
Sensitivity of FAPI-PET/MRI to detect intrahepatic HCC using contrasted multiphasic MRI liver as standard comparison, Calculated as: Number of MRI detected HCC lesions with FAPI-46 uptake / number of MRI detected intrahepatic HCC lesions, 1 year
Determine the proportion of cases whereby use of FAPI-46 PET/MRI leds to AJCC TNM/BCLC stage being, i) unchanged, ii) up-staged and iii) down-staged, Calculated as: number of HCC lesions identified on standard of care imaging with FAPI-46 uptake / total number of HCC lesions on standard of care imaging, 1 year|Sensitivity estimation of 68Gallium-FAPI-46 PET/MRI in per-lesion analysis for all lesions with available surgical resection samples for histopathology assessment, Calculated as: Number of pathologically confirmed HCC lesions identified on FAPI PET/MRI / total number of pathological confirmed HCC lesions, 1 year
