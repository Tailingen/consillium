A Trial of LONSURF in Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a single-arm, non-randomised study including patients with EBER positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma with recurrent or metastatic disease not amenable to curative treatment, who have received at least 1 regimen of platinum containing chemotherapy.
Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: TAS-102
Disease control rate, As defined by complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks of assessment using RECIST 1.1., 45 months
Progression free survival rate of patients, as defined as the time from initiation of treatment to radiological progression, clinical deterioration or death., 45 months|Best objective response rate, as assessed by RECIST 1.1, 45 months
HYPOTHESIS

Given the favourable activity of fluoropyrimidines (5Fluorouracil) which inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the investigators hypothesized that TAS-102 may demonstrate efficacy in NPC through targeting TS as well as an additional mechanism of incorporating trifluridine triphosphate into DNA.

OBJECTIVES OF TRIAL

1. To determine the clinical efficacy of TAS-102 in recurrent and metastatic NPC
2. To assess the safety and tolerability of TAS-102 in the study population of R/M NPC
3. To study the pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 in the study population of R/M NPC
4. To study potential predictive biomarkers for clinical benefit from TAS-102
