Blood Screening for Adult Colorectal Cancer
Multicenter, inter-regional, case-control study with the primary objective of evaluating the discriminative power of the blood biomarker TFPI-1 to separate patients with histologically proven CRC from an asymptomatic control population between 50 and 75 years of age with normal colonoscopy.
