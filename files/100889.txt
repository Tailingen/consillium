JAB-21822 in Combination With Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced CRC and Other Solid Tumors With KRAS G12C Mutation
This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of JAB-21822 in combination with cetuximab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer，advanced small intestine cancer and advanced appendiceal cancer with KRAS p.G12C mutation.
Advanced Colorectal Cancer|Small Intestinal Cancer|Appendiceal Cancer
DRUG: JAB-21822|DRUG: Cetuximab
Dose Escalation phase: Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as the clinically significant treatment related adverse event (TRAE) or abnormal laboratory values assessment during the first 21 days of (Cycle 1) and excludes events that are deemed clearly related to underlying disease, progression, or intercurrent illness., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Dose Expansion phase: Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v 1.1., Up to 4 years - from baseline to RECIST confirmed Progressive Disease
Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion phase: Number of participants with adverse events, Patients will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) according to NCI-CTCAE criteria., Up to 4 years|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion phase: Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of JAB-21822 will be measured by using plasma PK samples., Up to 4 years|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion phase: Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC of JAB-21822 will be measured by using plasma PK samples., Up to 4 years|Dose Expansion phase: Duration of response ( DOR ), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression per CTCAE v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 4 years|Dose Escalation phase: Overall response rate (ORR), The percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on RECIST v 1.1., Up to 4 years|Dose Expansion phase: Disease Control Rate ( DCR ), DCR is defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease(SD) per CTCAE v1.1., Up to 4 years|Dose Expansion phase: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of first treatment to the earliest date of disease progression per CTCAE v1.1 or death which occurs first., Up to 4 years
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JAB-21822 in combination with cetuximab to determine the MTD and RP2D during Dose Escalation phase; then to evaluate preliminary antitumor activity when JAB-21822 is administered in combination with cetuximab during Dose Expansion phase in patients with advanced colorectal cancer，advanced small intestine cancer and advanced appendiceal cancer with KRAS p.G12C mutation.
