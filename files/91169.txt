Impact of Bevacizumab on Symptom Burden and Neurological Deficits in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
This retrospective non - interventional patient chart review will be utilizing real world clinical data from patients treated for rGBM at the University Regensburg Medical center either with or without bevacizumab. Only patients will be analyzed who were potentially eligible for bevacizumab treatment. The study is designed to investigate the potential effects of bevacizumab treatment on the functional status, symptom burden, neurological deficits, time to tumor progression and overall survival between cohorts potentially eligible for bevacizumab.
