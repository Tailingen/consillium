A Phase I, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study of CAT-8015 in Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
A dose-escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of CAT-8015 that can be safely administered to a patient.
Lymphoma
DRUG: CAT-8015
Assess safety, estimate MTD, characterize toxicity profile, study pharmacology and observe anti-tumor activity at the MTD., Day 28
Assess immunogenicity of CAT 8015 and potential biomarkers for therapeutic or toxicity responses., Day 0-7; 0-14
To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose that can be safely administered to a patient, and to establish a safe dose, based on MTD, for subsequent clinical testing.
