These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale, up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions health state classifier to 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems), up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|ICU and non-ICU hospitalization days, up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|ICU and non-ICU hospitalization reasons, up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|Anti-therapeutic JWCAR029 antibody, up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|Changes of T cell counts, subgroups and serum cytokines, up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|CD19 expression in tumor biopsy samples, up to 2 year after JWCAR029 infusion|Changes of inflammation biomarkers-CRP, up to 1 year after JWCAR029 infusion|Changes of inflammation biomarkers-serum ferritin, up to 1 year after JWCAR029 infusion
This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study conducted in adult subjects with R/R Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma in China to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics(PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) of JWCAR029 and collect the patient reported quality of life changes and immune response after JWCAR029 treatment.

There will be two cohorts of cohort A and cohort B. Large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients will be enrolled in cohort A and follicular lymphoma patients will be enrolled in cohort B. Two dose levels of 1.0 x 10\^8 CAR+ T cells and 1.5 x 10\^8 CAR+ T cells are adopted in this study in both cohorts, subjects will be randomly assigned into the two dose levels with a 1:1 ratio. All sujects will be followed for 2 years following JWCAR029 infusion.
