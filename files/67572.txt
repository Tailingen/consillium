Atrasentan in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Malignant Glioma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of atrasentan in treating patients who have progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: atrasentan hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of atrasentan in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma.
* Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.
* Assess preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

Patients receive oral atrasentan once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 2-10 patients receive escalating doses of atrasentan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1 patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 2 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
