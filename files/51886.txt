Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Evixapodlin (Formerly GS-4224) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of evixapodlin (formerly GS-4224) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of evixapodlin in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Evixapodlin
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During the Dose Escalation Phase, A DLT was any toxicity defined as follows excluding toxicities clearly related to disease progression or disease-related processes occurring during the DLT assessment window (Day 1 through Day 21):

* Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia
* Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia with fever
* Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia
* Grade ≥ 2 bleeding
* Grade ≥ 3 anemia
* Grade ≥ 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (excluding Grade 3 nausea or emesis or Grade 3 diarrhea)
* Grade ≥ 2 non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse event that in the opinion of the investigator is of potential clinical significance
* Treatment interruption of ≥ 7 days due to unresolved toxicity
* Any toxicity event that precludes further administration of evixapodlin
* Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) associated with a Grade 2 elevation in bilirubin lasting ≥ 7 days
* An immune-related adverse event (irAE) for which immunotherapy should be permanently discontinued, Day 1 through Day 21
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: AUCtau of Evixapodlin During the Dose Escalation Phase, AUCtau was defined as area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval., Intensive PK: Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6, 24 hours (h) postdose (400-1500 once daily [QD] mg cohorts) on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1 & D15|PK Parameter: Cmax of Evixapodlin During the Dose Escalation Phase, Cmax was defined as the maximum observed drug concentration., Intensive PK: Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6, 24 h postdose (400-1500 QD mg cohorts) on C1D1 & D15|PK Parameter: Ctrough of Evixapodlin During the Dose Escalation Phase, Ctrough is defined as the observed concentration at the end of the dosing interval., Intensive PK: Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6, 24 h postdose (400-1500 QD mg cohorts) on C1D1 & D15|PK Parameter: Tmax of Evixapodlin During the Dose Escalation Phase, Tmax is defined as the time to maximum observed concentration., Intensive PK: Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6, 24 h postdose (400-1500 QD mg cohorts) on C1D1 & D15|Percentage of Participants Experiencing ≥ Grade 3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events During the Dose Expansion Phase, First dose date through end of treatment plus 30 days, approximately 5 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing ≥ Grade 3 Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities During the Dose Expansion Phase, First dose date through end of treatment plus 30 days, approximately 5 years
This was a planned Phase 1/2 study. However, Phase 2 was not conducted because the study was closed due to sponsor decision prior to opening the dose expansion cohort and hence, RP2D analysis was not performed.
