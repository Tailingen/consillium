A Pharmacokinetic Study of Single Doses of Sativex in Treatment-induced Mucositis
To investigate what the body does to single doses of Sativex (i.e. the pharmacokinetics \[PKs\] of four sprays containing 10.8 mg Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol \[THC\] and 10 mg cannabidiol \[CBD\]) when mild, moderate or severe oral mucositis is induced. This will be done by looking at the effects of the body on the drug before and after oral mucositis is induced. The study participants will have Non-surgical Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), and oral mucositis will be induced with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sativex
The time to peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 6-hydroxy-CBD after a single dose of Sativex, Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at pre-defined time-points by either direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. Blood was drawn from each subject into a five-mL lithium-heparinised tube. The allowable window for sample collection was ±5 minutes at all PK time points with the exception of 8 hours (window of ±1 hour) and 24 hours (±2 hours)., Pre-dose then 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose|Area under the concentration-time curve from administration until the last sampling point (t) equal or above the Lower Limit of Quantification (AUC(0-t)) of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 6-hydroxy-CBD after a single dose of Sativex, Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at pre-defined time-points by either direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. Blood was drawn from each subject into a five-mL lithium-heparinised tube. The allowable window for sample collection was ±5 minutes at all PK time points with the exception of 8 hours (window of ±1 hour) and 24 hours (±2 hours)., Pre-dose then 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose|Area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 6-hydroxy-CBD after a single dose of Sativex, Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at pre-defined time-points by either direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. Blood was drawn from each subject into a five-mL lithium-heparinised tube. The allowable window for sample collection was ±5 minutes at all PK time points with the exception of 8 hours (window of ±1 hour) and 24 hours (±2 hours)., Pre-dose then 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose
Median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 6-hydroxy-CBD after a single dose of Sativex, Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at pre-defined time-points by either direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. Blood was drawn from each subject into a five-mL lithium-heparinised tube. The allowable window for sample collection was ±5 minutes at all PK time points with the exception of 8 hours (window of ±1 hour) and 24 hours (±2 hours)., Pre-dose then 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose|Terminal half-life (t1/2) of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 6-hydroxy-CBD after a single dose of Sativex, Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at pre-defined time-points by either direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. Blood was drawn from each subject into a five-mL lithium-heparinised tube. The allowable window for sample collection was ±5 minutes at all PK time points with the exception of 8 hours (window of ±1 hour) and 24 hours (±2 hours)., Pre-dose then 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose|Apparent total body clearance of drug from plasma (CL/F) of THC, 11-hydroxy-THC, CBD, 7-hydroxy-CBD and 6-hydroxy-CBD after a single dose of Sativex, Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at pre-defined time-points by either direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. Blood was drawn from each subject into a five-mL lithium-heparinised tube. The allowable window for sample collection was ±5 minutes at all PK time points with the exception of 8 hours (window of ±1 hour) and 24 hours (±2 hours)., Pre-dose then 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post-dose|The incidence of adverse events as a measure of subject safety, The numbers of subjects who experienced an adverse event during the study is presented., Day 1 - Day 30
