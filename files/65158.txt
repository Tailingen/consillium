Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (JCAR017) as Second-Line Therapy (TRANSCEND-PILOT-017006)
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to determine the efficacy and safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel (JCAR017) in adult subjects who have relapsed from, or are refractory to, a single line of immunochemotherapy for aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (based on age, performance status, and/or comorbidities). Subjects will receive treatment with lisocabtagene maraleucel and will be followed for 2 years for safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers, disease status, quality of life, and survival.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate is the percent of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of either complete response (CR) or partial reasons (PR) based on the Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment recorded from the time of JCAR017 treatment until disease progression, end of study, the start of another anticancer therapy or JCAR017 retreatment.

This scale addresses symptoms and functional limitations that are important to lymphoma patients. The LYM items are scored on a 0 ("Not at all") to 4 ("Very much") response scale. Items are aggregated to a single score on a 0-60 scale., Baseline and Day 29|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessed by the EuroQol Instrument EQ-5D-5L, The European Quality of Life 5D-5L Scale (EQ-5D-5L) assesses general health-related quality of life. Health is defined in 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded so that a '1' indicates no problem, and '5' indicates the most serious problem. The responses for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit number. These health states are converted to a single index value using the crosswalk method to the EQ-5D-3L value set from the United Kingdom (UK). The EQ-5D-5L health states ranged from -.594 for the worst (55555) to 1 for the best (11111) for UK value set with an optimal health state is assigned a score of 1.00, death is assigned a score of 0.00 and negative values representing values as worse than dead.
