Determination of Dose of Antiangiogenic Multitargeted DOVITINIB (TKI258) Plus Paclitaxel in Patients With Solid Tumors
The investigators plan to study the determination of the dose and the combination of antiangiogenic effect of dovitinib and cytotoxic activity of weekly paclitaxel in different types of malignant tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Dovitinib|DRUG: Dovitinib + Paclitaxel
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended dose for Phase 2 and the safety and tolerability in combination with paclitaxel dovitinib weekly, After priming phase (7 days)
Pharmacokinetic interactions between paclitaxel and dovitinib, To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions between paclitaxel and dovitinib. Establish the sampling circuit and molecular diagnostic procedures for future expansion cohort at the recommended dose for Phase 2, focusing on patients with amplifications or mutations of drug targets.

Other criteria for safety assessment will be the number of cycles and dose intensity of each component of the treatment regimen, changes in vital signs and results of laboratory tests during and after administration of paclitaxel and dovitinib, Baseline and end oftreatment phase, an espected average of 16 weeks
This is an open label,multicenter, Phase I dose escalation study with a phase dovitinib alone for the pharmacokinetic profile and a treatment phase to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral(po)dovitinib with paclitaxel administered intravenously (iv) (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 and 21 every 4 weeks) in patients with malignant tumors of any histologically confirmed, not susceptible of cure, which have been treated available reference.
