Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Rezvilutamide+ADT+Docetaxel Versus Rezvilutamide +ADT in the mHSPC
Evaluate whether the combination of Rezvilutamide and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with docetaxel improves overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) compared to the combination of Rezvilutamide and ADT.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer|Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer|Chemotherapy Effect
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Rezvilutamide
rPFS, radiographic Progression-Free Survival, 36 months
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, percentage of patients with a decreasing PSA following the regimens discussed above, 36 months|time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), time to PSA progression, 36 months
time to next bone-related event, Including bone structure, pain, etc., 36 months
To investigate the value of chemotherapy in the treatment of high-burden of mHSPC on the background of next-genertion of AR inhibitors.
