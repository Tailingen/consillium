AI Prediction of Gastric Cancer Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This study seeks to develop a deep-learning-based intelligent predictive model for the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients. By utilizing the patients' CT imaging data, biopsy pathology images, and clinical information, the intelligent model will predict the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy and prognosis, offering assistance in personalized treatment decisions for gastric cancer patients.

Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for TRG prediction by the AI model, The AUC will be used to evaluate the performance of the AI model in predicting TRG grading of gastric cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. An AUC of 1 indicates perfect prediction, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates prediction no better than chance., two months|Accuracy of TRG prediction by the AI model, Accuracy measures the proportion of true positive and true negative predictions made by the AI model among all predictions. It indicates the capability of the model to correctly classify patients into their respective TRG gradings., two months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 3 years, The duration from the date of patient confirmation to the date of tumor progression or death of the patient, whichever occurs first., Three years|Overall Survival (OS) at 5 years, The duration from the date of patient confirmation to the date of death of the patient., Five years
This study seeks to develop a deep learning model to predict the outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer. Leveraging participants' CT scans, biopsy pathology images, and clinical profiles, this model aims to forecast the effectiveness of post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the subsequent prognosis, thereby aiding in individualized treatment choices for these participants.

Data Collection: The investigators will gather data from 1,800 retrospective cases and 200 prospective cases from multiple hospitals. The retrospective data will be divided into training and testing sets to train and validate the model, respectively. The model's performance will subsequently be evaluated using the prospective dataset.

Clinical Information: This encompasses the participant's gender, age, tumor markers, staging, type, specific treatment plans, pre and post-treatment lab results, etc.

Imaging Data: CT imaging data taken within one month prior to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with at least the venous phase CT imaging included.

Pathology Data: Pathology images from a gastric tumor biopsy stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) taken within one month prior to treatment.

TRG Grading: Based on the pathology report of the surgical samples using the Ryan TRG grading system.

Prognostic Endpoints: The recorded endpoints are a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and a 5-year overall survival (OS). All deaths due to non-disease factors are excluded from the prognosis analysis.
