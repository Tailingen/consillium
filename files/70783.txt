Compare Outcomes Between Two Acellular Dermal Matrices
This study will evaluate the performance of Alloderm RTU medium (LifeCell) vs. Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis (RTI Surgical®, Inc.). These are the thinnest versions of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) offered by both vendors and can be used for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. Alloderm RTU medium has a thickness of 1.6±0.4 mm, while Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis has a thickness of 1.0±0.2 mm. In the context of breast reconstruction, these ADMs are used in the same manner. They may be inserted with a tissue expander immediately after skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy. The investigators will examine breast-reconstruction associated complication rates, pre- and post-operative patient reported outcomes using the Breast Q, and physician reimbursement as well as direct hospital costs. The endpoint will be either exchange of the tissue expander for a permanent breast implant or autologous flap, explantation due to patient preference, development of a complication, or less common reasons. The investigators propose that Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis and Alloderm RTU will have equivalent complication and patient reported outcome rates as well as physician reimbursement, but that direct hospital cost will be less with Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Alloderm RTU|OTHER: Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis|PROCEDURE: Skin or nipple-sparing mastectomy|OTHER: Breast Q|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Incidence of premature tissue expander (TE) removal, * All participants meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have a skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction will be included in the analyses of the primary study endpoint.
* A breast with the TE removed before planned exchange to a permanent breast implant is considered to have had a premature TE removal, Up to 15 months
Patient satisfaction as measured by Breast Q, * Each domain contains separate modules that investigate physical, psychosocial, and sexual well-being as well as their satisfaction with their care, breasts, and overall outcome.
* It also investigates patient expectations in the preoperative questionnaire, and degree to which expectations were met in the post-operative version.
* Each module generates a Q-score on a 0-100 scale that can be used for quantitative analysis to enable statistical comparison of the pre- to the post-operative state., Up to 15 months|Health related quality of life as measured by Breast Q, * Each domain contains separate modules that investigate physical, psychosocial, and sexual well-being as well as their satisfaction with their care, breasts, and overall outcome.
* It also investigates patient expectations in the preoperative questionnaire, and degree to which expectations were met in the post-operative version.
* Each module generates a Q-score on a 0-100 scale that can be used for quantitative analysis to enable statistical comparison of the pre- to the post-operative state., Up to 15 months|Duration of drain use, -The number of days a drain is used after surgery, Up to 15 months|Incidence of analgesic use for pain, -Outpatient analgesia beyond preoperative analgesic requirements will be recorded, and will include no pain medicine, celecoxib, gabapentin, acetaminophen, hydrocodone, oxycodone, OxyContin, ibuprofen, hydromorphone, cyclobenzaprine, and methadone., Up to 15 months|Incidence of infection as measured by presence or absence of cellulitis, -The number of participants who experience cellulitis, Up to 15 months|Incidence of non-infectious complications, -These will include seroma (and method(s) of seroma diagnosis), incisional dehiscence, necrosis of the mastectomy skin flap, dehiscence of the ADM from the chest wall or pectoralis muscle, hematoma, or a pathologic (grade III or IV) capsular contracture., Up to 15 months|Nature of second surgery as measured by type of surgery enrolled patients undergo to address their tissue expander after its initial insertion, -Document type of second surgery each participants has after their initial tissue expander, Up to 15 months|Degree of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) incorporation, -A qualitative scale, from 1-4 will be used to quantity ADM incorporation. This will be recorded upon inspection of the ADM at the time that the tissue expander is readdressed., Up to 15 months|Comparison of direct hospital costs, -These are available through Barnes hospital and will be normalized to Medicare rates by conversion from relative value units (RVU) due to heterogeneity in payer mix. Line item costs as well as patient-level data will not be available due to the proprietary nature of these products. However, normalized, aggregate patient data for the cycle of care in each study arm (Alloderm RTU vs Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis) is available and will be calculated. "Direct costs" are those that can be traced directly to a department, product or service, excluding overhead costs, and thus reflect the hospital's assessment of the cost it incurred providing the specific services and supplies used by the patients. All breast reconstruction related costs performed by Barnes, or Barnes West County hospital from the first surgery up until immediately before the second surgery will be included., Up to 15 months|Comparison of physician reimbursements, -These are available through the Department of Surgery and will be normalized to Medicare rates by conversion from relative value units (RVU) due to heterogeneity in payer mix. Line item costs as well as patient-level data will not be available due to the proprietary nature of these products. However, normalized, aggregate patient data for the cycle of care in each study arm (Alloderm vs Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis) is available and will be calculated. All breast reconstruction related costs billed by Washington University Physicians from the first surgery up until immediately before the second surgery will be included., Up to 15 months|Amount of tissue expander fill, -This is breast-level data since the left and right side may differ in bilateral reconstruction cases. The investigators already track tissue expander fills as part of the electronic medical record. The amount of tissue expander fill during surgery and device type are recorded in the operative record., At the time of surgery|Immediate implant type as measured by volume (cc), At the time of surgery|Immediate implant type as measured by manufacturer, At the time of surgery|Immediate implant type as measured by shape, At the time of surgery|Immediate implant type as measured by fill, At the time of surgery|Immediate implant type as measured by surface characteristics, At the time of surgery
