A Study on Treatment for Patients With BRAFV600E Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
Previous studies have shown that BRAFV600E mutant mCRC patients have a shorter survival time than BRAF wild type mCRC patients. For Chinese patients, however, it remains unclear about the BRAF gene mutation rate, diagnosis, prognosis and survival data in people with BRAFV600E mutant mCRC .

This real-world, multicenter non-interventional study (NIS) will describe the mutation rate, treatment patterns, effectiveness and safety of current treatment regimens in BRAFV600E mutant mCRC patients in China.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|BRAF V600 Mutation
OTHER: Non interventional study
Progression-free Survival (PFS), the length of time between initiation of any line treatment for mCRC and the first documented disease progression, 6 months
Overall Survival (OS), length of time between any treatment initiation (for mCRC) and death (due to any cause), 24 months|Overall Response rate (ORR), number of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 6 months
