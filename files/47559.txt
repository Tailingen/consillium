Subzero and Scorpion Trial
This is a prospective single-institution pilot study examining the feasibility of performing ultrasound-guided cryoablation to completely ablate breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study is designed such that patients meeting selection criteria will undergo cryoablation followed by surgical resection. The pathology of the surgical specimen will be used to determine the rate of complete tumor ablation. Standard adjuvant therapies otherwise remained unchanged.
Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
PROCEDURE: cryoablation
complete tumor ablation, rate of complete tumor ablation defined as no remaining invasive or in situ carcinoma present upon pathological examination of excised tissue, 2 years
