A Study of GDC-0810 Single Agent or in Combination With Palbociclib and/or a Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) Agonist in Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
This study is a multi-institution, Phase Ia/Ib/IIa open-label, dose-finding, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and proof-of-concept study of GDC-0810 as a single agent and in combination with palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist. The study is divided into 3 phases: Phase Ia, Phase Ib, and Phase IIa. During Phase Ia (dose escalation phase), GDC-0810 single agent will be administered orally on a continuous daily dosing regimen with a Day -7 lead-in period for single dose PK evaluation prior to the start of daily treatment. The incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated from Day -7 through the first cycle (28 days) of treatment (35 days total). Depending on safety and tolerability, participants will be assigned sequentially to escalating doses of GDC-0810 using standard 3 + 3 design. During Phase Ib (dose escalation and expansion phase), participants will receive GDC-0810 with palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and assess the safety and tolerability of concomitant administration. During Phase IIa (dose expansion phase), participants previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) will be treated at the RP2D to further characterize the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of GDC-0810.

DRUG: GDC-0810|DRUG: LHRH Agonist|DRUG: Palbociclib
Phase Ia: Maximum Tolerated Dose of GDC-0810 When Used as a Single Agent, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined based on the number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) experienced by the participants. DLTs were defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) that are deemed by the investigator or the Sponsor to be related to study drug (toxicities will be attributed to single agent GDC-0810 unless they are clearly related to disease progression or can clearly be attributed to a cause other than GDC-0810 administration):

* Any grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia)
* Any grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity of \> 7 days' duration
* Any grade toxicity that leads to study drug interruption of \> 7 days' duration, Day -7 through the first cycle (28 days) of treatment (35 days total)|Phase Ia: RP2D of GDC-0810 When Used as a Single Agent, The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) was based on the overall safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of GDC-0810., Day -7 through the first cycle (28 days) of treatment (35 days total)|Phase IIa: Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Tumor Response of GDC-0810 According to RECIST v1.1, Objective response (OR) is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1. OR was based on criteria related to changes in size of target lesions. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Screening and every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 until Cycle 12, thereafter every 3 months until disease progression (up to 3 years)|Phase IIa: Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit Response of GDC-0810 According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving confirmed RECIST v1.1 defined CR, PR, and/or stable disease. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable disease was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease., Screening and every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 until Cycle 12, thereafter every 3 months until disease progression (up to 3 years)|Phase Ib: RP2D of GDC-0810 When Used in Combination With Palbociclib and/or LHRH, The RP2D of GDC-0810 When Used in Combination With Palbociclib and/or LHRH RP2D was not determined since the development of the GDC-0810 was discontinued before enrolling Cohort C2. The RP2D would have been based on the overall safety and PK/PD profile of GDC-0810 and palbociclib, and not necessarily the MTD., first cycle (Days 1 to 28 of a 28-day schedule)
