Neoadjuvant Sintilimab Combined With Reduction of Cycles of Chemotherapy in Resectable Oral Cavity or Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OOC-002)
The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with reduction of cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel) in patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who are about to undergo surgery. Data obtained in this trial will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
