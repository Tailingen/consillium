Study of IMC-1121B in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial is testing the investigational drug IMC-1121B administered to Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. The rationale for performing this trial is to establish the safety profile and the pharmacokinetics of IMC-1121B.

Screen for the Development of Circulating Antibodies Against IMC-1121B (Immunogenicity), Data presented are the number of participants with treatment emergent antibody positive., Baseline to study completion up to 48 weeks
This single center, open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 study will enroll approximately 15 to 18 participants. The actual size will vary depending on the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed and the resultant sizes of the cohorts. Participants will receive IMC-1121B, administered intravenously, once every 2 or 3 weeks for 6 weeks (one cycle). After one cycle of treatment, participants who have an objective response or stable disease may continue to receive IMC-1121B at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or other withdrawal criteria are met. A minimum of three participants will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose escalation in successive cohorts will occur once all participants complete one cycle of therapy.

Participants will be enrolled sequentially into each cohort.

A completed participant will be either a participant who completes the initial 6 week treatment period (Cycle 1) or a participant who discontinues therapy for an IMC-1121B related toxicity during Cycle 1. Participants who do not complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for reasons other than an IMC-1121B -related toxicity will be replaced. Toxicity data for each cohort will be reviewed prior to dose escalation. Upon completion of all required safety evaluations during the initial 6 weeks, the next cohort of new participants will be treated at the next higher dose level using a dose escalation scheme.
