Treatment for Subjects With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel study was designed to evaluate whether a single fixed-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of pegfilgrastim or daily administration of Filgrastim for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) support would assist in allowing the planned dose-on-time (PDOT) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (CHOP) chemotherapy with Rituximab every 14 days in subjects with aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma by reducing the duration of neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Filgrastim
The primary objective was to provide preliminary information on the ability of pegfilgrastim or Filgrastim to support planned dose on time (PDOT) application of CHOP chemotherapy with Rituximab given every 14 days, to subjects with NHL.
