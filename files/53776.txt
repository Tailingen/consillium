Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Comprehensive Treatment of 4-10 Oligometastatic Tumors
In patients with a limited oligometastatic burden (cancer has spread but is not yet considered metastatic), emerging evidence suggests that treatment of all sites of disease with ablative therapies can improve patient outcomes, including overall- and progression-free survival. The application of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for patients with 4-10 metastatic deposits appears promising, yet it is unclear if all patients with greater than 3 oligometastatic lesions benefit from ablative therapies in terms of improved Overall Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), or quality of life. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of SABR, compared to standard of care treatment, on overall survival, oncologic outcomes, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumor and 4-10 metastatic lesions.
