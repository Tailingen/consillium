GD2-SADA:177Lu-DOTA Complex in Patients With Solid Tumors Known to Express GD2
Patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer, High Risk Neuroblastoma, Sarcoma and Malignant Melanoma will be treated with GD2-SADA:177Lu-DOTA complex(The IMP is a two-step radioimmunotherapy, delivered as two separate products GD2-SADA and 177Lu-DOTA) to assess safety and tolerability

To determine the optimal, safe GD2-SADA protein dose and dosing interval between GD2-SADA and 177Lu-DOTA administrations, Occurrence of DLTs (Part A), 6 weeks|To determine maximum tolerable activity of 177Lu-DOTA, Occurrence of DLTs (Part B), 6 weeks|To assess cumulative toxicity signals and safety profile (Number and severity of adverse events) following repeated dosing and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Number and severity of adverse events (Part C), 52 weeks
A phase 1 dose-escalation single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center trial of the safety and tolerability of GD2-SADA:177Lu-DOTA complex in GD2 expressing solid tumors.

The trial is planned as a Phase 1 trial with three parts, A, B and C. Escalation in this trial will be based on a classical 3+3 trial design.

Part A is a GD2-SADA dose escalation phase, in which patients will receive one treatment cycle.

Part B is a 177Lu-DOTA dose escalation phase, in which patients will receive up to 2 treatment cycles .

Part C is a repeated dosing phase where the doses determined in Part A and B will be administered. Patients will receive repeated treatment cycles with a maximum of 5 cycles.
