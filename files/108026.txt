A Study of RC48-ADC in Local Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer With the HER2-Overexpression
This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to compare RC48-ADC to physician choice standard treatment in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpression locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.

DRUG: RC48-ADC|DRUG: Paclitaxel injection|DRUG: Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection|DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate Tablets
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the date of death of the subject., within approximately 3 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by the investigator, Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard., within approximately 3 years|Objective remission rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by the independent efficacy evaluation committee according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation (the evaluation by the investigator will also be performed)., within approximately 3 years|Duration of relief (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, within approximately 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as cases where objective remission (assessed as complete remission or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study., within approximately 3 years|Tumor progression time (TTP), Time to disease progression (TTP) refers to the time from the random date to the first disease progression (calculated by the event that occurred first). Disease progression will be evaluated by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1 standard (investigator and Independent Review Committee(IRC) evaluation)., within approximately 3 years
This study is a phase III multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel control study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate for the treatment of HER2-overexpression locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. The HER2-overexpression is defined as: the HER2 IHC 3+ or 2+, regardless of FISH status.
