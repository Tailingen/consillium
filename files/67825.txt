Nanocurcumin for Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy (RT)
There is a growing body of evidence exploring the role of curcumin as a radioprotector against radiation-induced injury in normal tissues as well as a radiosensitizer in tumor cells. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral nanocurcumin in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.
