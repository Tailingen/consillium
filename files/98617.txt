Study of Breath-holding as a Means to Reduce Tumor Motion From Breathing
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate typical tumor motion caused by breathing using MRI and can help determine whether simple passive breathing and/or breath-holding could be used for the future treatment of similar lung and liver tumors using radiation therapy radiosurgery techniques.
Neoplasm, Metastatic
PROCEDURE: MRI with breath-holding
Tumor Motion Related to Breathing as Determined From MRI Images, 1. Determine the typical and maximal tumor 3D displacements over the respiratory cycle and how these values vary depending on the tumor location
2. Determine the reproducibility of target position over multiple breath-holds
3. Determine the variability across patients in respiratory-derived lesion motion and target position reproducibility over multiple breath-holds, 20 - 30 seconds
