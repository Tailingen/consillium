Phase 1 Dose Finding Study of Belinostat for Treatment of Patients With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)
The primary objective of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for belinostat when combined with CHOP regimen and establish the recommended belinostat dose for the Phase 3 study.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Belinostat|DRUG: CHOP
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To determine the MTD for belinostat when combined with CHOP regimen and establish the Phase 3 recommended belinostat dose., up to 5 days
Safety and tolerance, To assess safety and tolerance of belinostat when given in combination with CHOP regimen. Safety and tolerance will be mainly characterized by the number and severity of treatment emergent adverse events, and treatment related AEs that occur or worsen after the first dose of study treatment., up to 5 days|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) after 6 cycles of BelCHOP regimen, 126 days|Effectiveness of study drug, Pharmacokinetics of belinostat when co-administered with CHOP regimen. The concentration of Belinostat to assess the effectiveness., 126 days
This is a Phase 1 dose finding study using the traditional escalation rule of 3+3 design to evaluate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of belinostat when administered in combination with CHOP.
