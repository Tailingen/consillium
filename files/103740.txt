Patients with limited number of brain metastases from solid tumors are at high risk of local recurrence after surgical removal of the tumor mass. The standard Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) demonstrated to reduce the risk of recurrence without improving survival. At the same time WBRT have substantial acute and late toxicity. Preliminary experiences with Stereotactic radiosurgery or hypofractionated radiotherapy of the resection cavity indicate promising local control and good tolerance. This attitude was only partially explored in prospective trials. In this research patients with limited number of brain metastases and controlled systemic disease will be treated, with such a stereotactic irradiation, at the same time with evaluation of the local control (Primary endpoint) by repeated MRI and of quality of life, neurologic functionning (with a battery of thsts, e.g. MMSE, QLQ-C30, EORTC BN-20) as well as overall survival as secondary endpoints.
