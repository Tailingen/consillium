KLHL14 Expression as Predicting Factor of Invasiveness in pitNET
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between KLHL14 expression and its cytoplasm-nuclear localisation and pituitary adenomas biological behaviour with particular focus on its role in epithelial mesenchymal transition and invasion of para and suprasellar regions.

This is a multicenter and multidisciplinary study, with the involvement of the Departments of Neurosurgery of the University of Naples Federico II and the Department of Biosciences of the University of Teramo.
Invasiveness, Neoplasm
OTHER: Immunohistochemical expression in pitNET cells of KLHL14
Invasiveness degree, The expression of KLHL14 in invasive pituitary adenomas, Invasiveness degree will be determined at the time of surgery
The investigators would like to analyse the possible correlations between the expression, the cytoplasm-nuclear localisation and the activity of the protein KLHL14 and pituitary adenomas biological behaviour with particular focus on its role in epithelial mesenchymal transition and invasion of para and suprasellar regions. This study will be conducted on biological sample collected during surgery and primary cellular line derived from those samples.

Patients refer to neurosurgery for the detection of pituitary adenomas with various presenting symptoms that can be correlated to hormone production or to mass effect produced by the lesion on the optic apparatus or on the oculomotor nerves after invasion of the cavernous sinus. All patients undergo an ophthalmological clinical examination to define the presence of visual alteration and endocrinological assessment to determine eventual hormone hypersecretion. Finally, radiological exams, as magnetic resonance of the sellar region, are performed on patients to evaluate the extension of the pathology, its relationship to the surrounding neurovascular structures and therefore guide neurosurgical resection which is typically performed via an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Except for prolactin secreting pituitary adenomas, for which medical therapy with dopaminergic agonists is a viable approach, surgery with adenoma resection represent the gold standard for treatment.
