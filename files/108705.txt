DRUG: Continuous 3,4-DAP|DRUG: Taper 3,4-DAP to Placebo
Number of Participants With 30% or More Deterioration in Triple Timed Up & Go (3TUG) Test, Compared to Time-matched Baseline, The 3TUG time obtained 2 hours after the last dose of the withdrawal period (i.e., at time of theoretical "peak drug effect") was compared to the average time-matched 3TUG tests performed during 2 days of baseline observation prior to randomization.

The study endpoint was a change of more than 30% in the final post-dose 3TUG during the withdrawal period and was based on blinded readings of video recordings of 3TUG tests., Baseline period (days 0, 1, 2); Randomized treatment period (starting with last dose of day 2, and days 3, 4, 5, and ending with first dose on day 6 when pre-randomization regimen was resumed, or rescue, if indicated sooner)
Self-assessment of LEMS-related Weakness, W-SAS, The last post-dose self-assessment of LEMS-related weakness from the withdrawal period with categories of much much weaker (-3), much weaker (-2), somewhat weaker (-1), about the same (0), somewhat stronger (1), much stronger (2), and much much stronger (3)., Participants were followed for up to 7 days
The objectives of the study were to confirm the safety and to test the efficacy of 3,4-DAP in the treatment of LEMS-related weakness.

This was a phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal study in subjects with known clinically active LEMS who had been on a chronic stable dose of compassionate distribution Jacobus 3,4-DAP provided through FDA-approved individual investigator-held INDs.
