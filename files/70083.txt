A Study of CA-170 (Oral PD-L1, PD-L2 and VISTA Checkpoint Antagonist) in Patients With Advanced Tumors and Lymphomas
CA-170 is a rationally designed and orally available, small molecule that directly targets the Programmed death-ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1/PD-L2), and V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) immune checkpoints and results in activation of T cell proliferation and cytokine production. This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 trial of orally administered CA-170 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas who have progressed or are non-responsive to available therapies and for which no standard therapy exists.
