Effectiveness of Accelerated Intervention With Compression Sleeve in Mild and Moderate Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema
The purpose of this study is to determine whether accelerated treatment with custom-made compression sleeve is more effective than standard procedure in the treatment of mild and moderate arm lymphedema secondary to primary cancer treatment.
Breast Cancer|Lymphedema
DEVICE: Custom-made compression sleeve and -gauntlet|OTHER: Educational information, recommendation and instruction
Change of excess limb volume (ELV), ELV in the affected arm compared to the non-affected arm. ELV described as both absolute volume in ml and relative volume in percent, 8 weeks follow-up
Changes in arm disability, Measured with Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), 8 weeks follow-up|Changes in subjective symptoms (pain, tension, and heaviness), 8 weeks follow-up
Use of a custom-made compression sleeve is an initial treatment of mild and moderate arm lymphedema secondary to primary breast cancer treatment. The compression sleeve improves the flow of lymph fluid out of the arm, reduces the swelling, and prevents progression of the lymphedema in the future.

Early intervention is recommended though early is not well-defined in literature. The purpose of this study is to evaluate reduction of excess limb volume and changes in arm disability and clinical symptoms in accelerated treatment with compression sleeve compared to standard treatment.
