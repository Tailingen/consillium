Stereotactic Radiosurgery After Surgery in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases
RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stereotactic radiosurgery works in treating patients with brain metastases.
Metastatic Cancer|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
BEHAVIORAL: MMSE|BEHAVIORAL: QOL via FACT-Br|PROCEDURE: MRI|RADIATION: Post-operative SRS
Recurrence Rate at the Surgical Site as Measured by MRI, The number of months for local recurrence via MRI, 12 months
Rate of Salvage Whole-brain Radiotherapy, Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), or Surgery, 12 months|Rate of New Brain Metastases Outside of the Adjuvant SRS Site, 12 months|Quality of Life as Measured by the FACT-Br Subscales, Every 3 months for 12 months|Preservation of Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Mini-Mental State Exam, Every 3 months for 12 months.|Clinical Significance (if Any) of Locally Recurrent Brain Metastasis at the Time of Their Occurrence (Mass Effect, Cognitive Functioning, and Other Symptoms), 12 months|Rate of Death Due to Neurologic Causes, 12 months|Overall Survival, 12 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To estimate the rate of recurrence at the surgical site in patients with brain metastases treated with adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with historical data documenting recurrence at the surgical site after surgery and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

Secondary

* To estimate the rate of salvage WBRT, SRS, or surgery in patients treated with adjuvant SRS alone.
* To estimate the rate of new brain metastases outside of the adjuvant SRS site.
* To estimate patient quality of life after adjuvant SRS alone.
* To assess the effect of surgical intervention and SRS on the preservation of neurocognitive functioning in these patients.
* To determine the clinical significance (if any) of locally recurrent brain metastases at the time of their occurrence (mass effect, cognitive functioning, and other symptoms) in these patients.
* To estimate the rate of death due to neurologic causes, defined as death attributable to the progression of neurological disease.
* To estimate the overall survival of these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery over 30-90 minutes.

Quality of life and neurocognitive function are assessed periodically.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.
