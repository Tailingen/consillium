TCR-Redirected T Cell Treatment in Patients With Recurrent HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Post Liver Transplantation
This is a single-arm and open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability and primary efficacy of the HBV specific T cell receptor (HBV/TCR) redirected T cell in patients with recurrent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma post liver transplantation.
Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: TCR-T cells
Safety evaluation of the TCR-T treatment, Incidence of adverse events/serious adverse events, Start of Treatment until 28 days post last dose
Overall Response Rate, Tumour assessment will be according to RECIST v1.1. This is based on percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 from baseline., Start of treatment until disease progression, and subsequent follow up up to 24 months post treatment.|Progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year PFS is measured by the number of patients with stable disease after 1 year, using RECIST v1.1., Start of treatment until disease progression, and at 6-month and 1-year.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomisation until death by any cause. Participants will be followed up for survival follow up for two years., Start of treatment until disease progression, and at 6-month and 1-year.
