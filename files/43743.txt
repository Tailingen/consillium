Comparison of Adenoma Detection Rate Among Water, Carbon Dioxide and Air Methods of Minimal Sedation Colonoscopy
The purpose of this study is to determine which of the methods of colonoscopy viz. water insufflation or air insufflation or carbon dioxide insufflation is better in detecting the adenomas in colon and also which of these methods is best tolerated by patients.

Hypothesis: the investigators hypothesize that in patients undergoing first time screening colonoscopy a higher Adenoma Detection Rate will be found in the proximal colon in the group randomized to the water method compared to those randomized to the air or CO2 insufflation methods
Screening Colonoscopy
PROCEDURE: colonoscopy
Adenoma Detection Rate, proximal colon and total, The number of adenomas detected in proximal colon and total number of adenomas detected during the procedure will be compared between the three methods, Day 1, At time of colonoscopy
Pain scores, Visual Analog Scales will be used to calculate the pain scores based on the discomfort/pain experienced by the patient, during and immediately after colonoscopy on day 1|Sedation requirements, The amount of sedation required to complete the patient's colonoscopy., Collected at Day 1, during the procedure
Patient overall satisfaction score, patient satisfaction will be scored on a Visual Analog Scale, immediately after colonoscopy on day 1
Significance:

ADR is an independent predictor of risk of post screening colonoscopy colon cancer. A simple method solely controlled by the colonoscopist that enhances proximal ADR holds the promise of rectifying some of the unresolved shortcomings of screening colonoscopy in failing to reduce the occurrence of post screening incident cancers in the proximal colon and the associated cancer mortality.

Hypotheses \& Specific Aims:

Primary Hypothesis:

In patients undergoing first time screening a higher ADR will be found in the proximal colon in those randomized to the water method compared to those randomized to the air method or CO2 method.

Secondary Hypotheses:

The examination method but not co-variables, procedure-related or patient-centered outcomes, is an independent predictor of proximal colon ADR.

Specific Aims:

This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded controlled study to compare the study (water) and control 1 (air) method and control 2 (CO2 method) to aid insertion of the colonoscope. The proximal colon ADR, total ADR, co-variables, procedure-related and patient-centered outcomes and adverse event during and within 30 days of colonoscopy will be recorded and compared between the study and control methods.
