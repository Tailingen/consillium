Trials Comparing of HD Versus 4K Laparoscopy for Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of 4K Laparoscopic Surgery for Gastric Cancer.
Stomach Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: 4K Laparoscopic Surgery|PROCEDURE: HD Laparoscopic Surgery

Postoperative morbidities are divided into short-term and long-term complications after surgery.

Short-term is defined as within 30 days of surgery or the first discharge if the hospital stay is \> 30 days.

Long-term is defined as the period from 30 days or more after the operation or the period between first discharge (the hospital days after surgery \>30 days) and 3 years after the operation.

Postoperative mortality: patients whose death was identified according to documented intraoperative observation items, including patients who die within 30 days after surgery (including the 30th day) regardless of the causality between death and surgery, and patients who die more than 30 days after surgery., 30 days|Hospitalization expenses, dolloars, 1 months|3-year disease free survival rate, month, 36 months|3-year overall survival rate, month, 36 months
A prospective randomized comparison of HD and 4K laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical experience for the extensive application of the 4K laparoscopic technique. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
