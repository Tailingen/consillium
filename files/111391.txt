Bendamustine/Lenalidomide/Rituximab: Combination as a Second-Line Therapy for 1st Relapsed-Refractory MCL
This is a prospective, multicenter phase II trial designed to evaluate the safety and activity of the combination of Bendamustine, Lenalidomide and Rituximab (R2-B) in patients with first relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and the efficacy and safety of a maintenance treatment with Lenalidomide for 18 months from the end of R2-B (from month 7 to 24) for those responding to the induction.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Bendamustine, Lenalidomide, Rituximab
Complete Response (CR) rate, Proportion of CR according to the Cheson2007 response criteria, At the end of the consolidation phase (6 months)|Maintenance Progression Free Survival (maPFS), maPFS will be defined in the maintenance cohort as the time between the date of CR/PR and the date of disease progression or death from any cause., 36 months
Toxicity, Incidence of grade 3 or higher Toxicity measured by CTCAE v.4 during induction and maintenance therapy, 24 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR at the end of the consolidation treatment is defined as Complete Response(CR) or Partial Response according to the Cheson 2007 response criteria, at the end of the consolidation phase (6 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) in all patients, PFS will be measured from the day of enrolment and of disease progression or death from any cause, 42 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the date of enrolment and the date of recurrence/disease progression or death from any cause, 36 months|Molecular response rate, rate of conversion to molecular remission measured by PCR, 24 months|Molecular relapse rate during study period, rate of conversion to molecular relapse measured by PCR, 42 months|Disease kinetics of minimal residual disease (MRD) during study period, measured by real time PCR in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, up to 42 months|Cumulative incidence of second primary malignancies, incidence of any second primary malignancies (haematological and not haematological) diagnosed after the conclusion of induction phase, up to 42 months|To evaluate the possible relationship between Cereblon expression and response to therapy, Possible relationship between Cereblon expression and response to therapy, 6 months
This is a phase II study, non randomized, multicenter. Patients with MCL refractory to front line therapy or in first relapse will be enrolled.

The study includes an induction phase, a consolidation phase, a maintenance phase and a follow up phase.
