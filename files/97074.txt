Sitravatinib (MGCD516) and Nivolumab in Oral Cavity Cancer Window Opportunity Study
This is a window of opportunity study for patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who are considered suitable for curative-intent surgical resection, with pre-operative drugs, Sitravatinib and Nivolumab.

This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, pre-operative window of opportunity study for patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who are considered suitable for curative-intent surgical resection, with pre-operative Sitravatinib and Nivolumab. A total of 12 patients who are evaluable for correlative studies, are planned for enrollment.

This study will involve treatment with Sitravatinib and Nivolumab, tests and procedures done for safety and the collection of blood samples for biomarker research. Tissue samples (fresh biopsy or archival tissue) will also be collected for biomarker research and evaluation.
