CP-751,871 Treatment For Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This study represents the first-in-human study for CP-751,871. The study aimed to define the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of CP-751,871 in patients with multiple myeloma through a dose escalation design.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CP-751,871
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose level at which not more than 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed during Cycle 1 in 6 participants, Baseline up to Cycle 1 (Week 4 or Week 8)
Single Dose End-of-infusion Concentration (Cinf) for CP-751,871, 1 hour postdose in Cycle 1|Single Dose Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) for CP-751,871, Cycle 1: predose; 1; 24; 48; 72; 168; 336; 504, 672 and 1008 (for participants with an up to 8-week Cycle 1 only) hours postdose|Single Dose Volume of Distribution (Vz) for CP-751,871, Cycle 1: predose; 1; 24; 48; 72; 168; 336; 504 and 672 and 1008 (for participants with an up to 8-week Cycle 1 only) hours postdose|Single Dose Plasma Decay Half-life (t1/2) for CP-751,871, Cycle 1: predose; 1; 24; 48; 72; 168; 336; 504 and 672 and 1008 (for participants with an up to 8-week Cycle 1 only) hours postdose|Single Dose Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - âˆž)] for CP-751,871, Cycle 1: predose; 1; 24; 48; 72; 168; 336; 504 and 672 and 1008 (for participants with an up to 8-week Cycle 1 only) hours postdose|Single Dose Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) for CP-751,871, Cycle 1: predose; 1; 24; 48; 72; 168; 336; 504 and 672 and 1008 (for participants with an up to 8-week Cycle 1 only) hours postdose|Single Dose Systemic Clearance (CL) for CP-751,871, Cycle 1: predose; 1; 24; 48; 72; 168; 336; 504 and 672 and 1008 (for participants with an up to 8-week Cycle 1 only) hours postdose|Multiple Dose Cinf for CP-751,871, 1 hour postdose in Cycles 2 up to 16|Multiple Dose Minimum Observed Plasma Trough Concentration (Cmin) for CP-751,871, 0 hour (predose) in Cycles 2 up to 16|Pharmacodynamic-based Dose, The dose associated with PK exposure that was associated with 80% of the maximal effect based on down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression, Cycle 1 (Week 4 or Week 8)|Human Anti-human Antibody (HAHA) Response to CP-751,871, 30 minutes predose in Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles, end of study visit (Days 30 and 60) for dose levels below 0.8 mg/kg; 30 minutes predose in Cycle 1 and last scheduled follow-up visit for dose levels greater than or equal to 0.8 mg/kg|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), Percentage of participants with OR based on assessment of confirmed complete remission (CR) or confirmed partial remission (PR) according to Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. CR were those with absence of bone marrow or blood findings of multiple myeloma. PR were those with a 50-74% reduction in the quantitative immunoglobulin, and if present, a 50-89% reduction in the urine M-component (Bence-Jones protein)., Baseline, Day 1 at predose/cycle, end of study (30-60 days post last dose)|Time to Disease Progression, Time in weeks from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer, whichever came first. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data met the criteria for progressive disease \[PD\]), Baseline up to end of treatment
