Immunoscore As Decision Guidance for Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Colon Cancer
The overall aim of this study is to prospectively validate the superiority of the Immunoscore as a decision guidance for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer patients, in comparison to the conventional TNM-based high- or low-risk classification.
