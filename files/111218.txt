A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Divarasib and Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab and Pemetrexed and Carboplatin or Cisplatin in Participants With Previously Untreated, KRAS G12C-Mutated, Advanced or Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of divarasib and pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab and pemetrexed and carboplatin or cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of adult participants with KRAS G12C-mutated, advanced or metastatic non squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
