HPV Vaccination in HIV Infected and HIV Uninfected Adolescents in Eswatini
This is a multi-site, open-label non-inferiority study of the 9vHPV vaccine among a population of children, adolescents and young women living with HIV in Eswatini. This protocol seeks to assess immunogenicity of a two-dose 9vHPV vaccine regimen among girls and boys (9-14 years) and young women (15-26 years) living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy versus a three-dose 9vHPV vaccine regimen among HIV uninfected young women (15-26 years) in Eswatini. The secondary objectives include examining the safety profiles of the two-dose 9vHPV regimen in those living with HIV and the three-dose 9vHPV regimen in HIV-uninfected young women, as well as measuring the completion of the vaccination series among those living with HIV and those who are not infected with HIV.

Anti-HPV geometric mean antibody titers, Serum antibodies against HPV antigens (IgG, IFNg, TNF, IL2, CXCL10, granzyme, perforin, PTX3). Geometric mean titers will be summarized by treatment group, and the ratios of mean GMTs between treatment and control and their 95% confidence intervals calculated around point estimates., Month 7 (4 weeks post Month 6 vaccine dose)|Number of seroconversions, Number of participants who seroconvert, defined as having no HPV antibodies pre-vaccination, but detectable HPV antibodies at 4 weeks post month 6 vaccine dose, Month 7 (4 weeks post Month 6 vaccine dose)
Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAE), Number of participants who reported experiences of SAE. SAE is defined as those that experienced death, life-threatening conditions or hospitalizations., Up to 6 months|Number of participants completing vaccination series, Number of eligible participants completing the 2-dose or 3-dose regimens will be tallied., Up to 6 months
Cervical cancer remains a significant threat to public health worldwide and remains the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in women in Sub Saharan Africa. Cervical cancer-associated morbidity and mortality is preventable through HPV vaccination, and screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. To date, there is no nationwide HPV vaccination program in Eswatini and the country is not eligible for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) procurement of HPV vaccines, and yet the triad of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI) and cervical cancer generates a severe disease burden warranting immediate introduction of this intervention. Given the global limitations in vaccine supply and the high cost for procurement, country programs, including in Eswatini, must optimize vaccine resources in order to maximize HPV vaccine coverage.
