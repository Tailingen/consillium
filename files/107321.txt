The Department of Urology has been engaged for years in the field of medical and surgical research relating to benign and oncological pathologies of the prostate, kidney, excretory tract, testicle, as well as urinary continence and dysfunctions of the sexual and reproductive sphere. The accurate acquisition of clinical and psychometric data before and after any treatment, the follow-up analysis, the attention to the patient's global quality of life (QoL) in relation to the particular organic functions affected by the disease, are at the basis of all the medical advances that can be achieved to guarantee ever better care of the individual's health. In the context of urological clinical practice, outpatient activity plays a fundamental role. This activity, which ranges from general urology to sexual medicine, reproductive medicine, functional urology, neuro-urology and uro-oncology, allows us to come into contact with a large number of patients suffering from the most common uropathologies -andrological .

Numerous studies have demonstrated how the treatment and outpatient management of such patients significantly impacts not only the underlying pathology but also their quality of life.

The outpatient management of the urological patient ranges from the recognition of the basic pathology to the diagnosis through the request for clinical-laboratory-instrumental investigations, to the possible indication for a medical or surgical treatment and to the follow-up of the patient.

The main objectives of this data archive are:

1. Collect clinical, instrumental, laboratory, psychometric and sociodemographic data in patients suffering from a uro-andrological pathology who require a consultation in one of the clinics mentioned above.
2. Collect data on the natural history of the pathologies in question and on the patients' quality of life in order to analyze the predictive factors of persistence and recurrence of symptoms, improvement or worsening of the clinical picture, and possible progression of the disease (both in benign and malignant form) and improve the care and treatment of the patients under examination.
3. Having a follow-up and related studies with a number and above all an extension over time that, to date, is not present in the literature or in any scientific production.
