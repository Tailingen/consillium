Segmentectomy Versus Lobectomy for Lung Adenocarcinoma ≤ 2cm
This study aims to evaluate the non-inferiority in recurrence-free survival and overall survival of segmentectomy compared with lobectomy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma ≤ 2 cm with micropapillary and solid subtype negative by intraoperative frozen sections.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Segmentectomy with systemic lymph node dissection|PROCEDURE: Lobectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection
recurrence-free survival rate, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time from surgery until recurrence or death from any cause, 5 year
overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery until death from any cause, 5 year|Post-operative respiratory function, The post-operative respiratory function will be evaluated by FEV1% and FVC., 6 months|Operation time, The surgery time in both groups., 24 hours|Blood loss, Intraoperative blood loss in total., 24 hours|Incidence of operative complications, Any intraoperative complications related to the surgery., 1 month
At present, the technology of intraoperative frozen section has gradually matured, which can diagnose the benign and malignant tumors and guide the resection strategy for peripheral small-sized lung adenocarcinoma. Travis et al. reported high specificity of intraoperative frozen section in the identification of micropapillary components, confirming that intraoperative frozen section may guide the selection of surgical procedures. However, there is still little evidence weather segmentectomy is appropriate for invasive adenocarcinoma without micropapillary patterns. This prospective and multi-center study was aimed to evaluate the non-inferiority in recurrence free survival and overall survival of segmentectomy compared with lobectomy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (≤ 2 cm) not including micropapillary components.
