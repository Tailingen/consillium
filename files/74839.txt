Phase 1 Trial of RP-3467 Alone and in Combination With Olaparib in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 trial to investigate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of the PolÎ¸ inhibitor RP-3467 alone or in combination with the poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib in adults with molecularly selected advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: RP-3467 at assigned dose and schedule|DRUG: Olaparib 200-300 mg BID, daily
To assess the safety and tolerability of RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as assessed per NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria, 20 months|To define a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RP-3467 in combination with olaparib, 24 months
To assess PK parameters of RP-3467 alone or in combination with olaparib with calculation of maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), 19 months
This is a first-in-human Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to:

* Evaluate the safety profile of RP-3467 when administered orally alone and in combination with olaparib and to define the MTD or MAD for RP-3467 monotherapy and the RP2D for the combination
* Characterize the PK profile of RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib
