CoSeal in Liver and Biliary Surgery in Prevention of Denovo Hepatic Adhesion
Study of phase II: Clinical study national, exploratory, multicentric, prospective, randomized, as a double blind man evaluating the effectiveness and the tolerance of the treatment by a surgical gel of sealing containing polyethylene glycol in the prevention of operational adherences post.3 Study of phase III: Clinical study national, multicentric, prospective, randomized, controlled, as a double blind man comparing a group controls with a group of patients treated by a surgical gel of sealing containing polyethylene glycol in the prevention of hepatic adherences of novo post operational.
Patient With Hepatic Metastasis
PROCEDURE: hepatic surgery of resection|PROCEDURE: hepatic surgery of resection
HEPATIC ADHERENCE SEVERITY, Measure of hepatic adherence :

SCORE 0: NO HEPATIC ADHERENCE SCORE 1: SHADOW ON HEPATIC ADHERENCE SCORE 2: VASCULAR OR DENSE HEPATIC ADHERENCE SCORE 3:COHESIVE HEPATIC ADHERENCE SCORE 4: DISSECTION IN ANOTHER PLAN

THIS 5 SCORE WILL BE ANALYSED ON THE 8 SEGMENT AND ON PEDICLE OF LIVER, 3 years
LIVER RELEASE VALUE, DISSECTION PHASE BETWEEN INCISION AND PARTIAL OR TOTAL EXPOSITION OF LIVER, 3 years|LOSS OF BLOOD, 3 years|CoSeal tolerance, 3 years|per operative complication, 3 years|post operative complication, 3 years|hospitalisation time, 3 years|operative difficulty, score 0 if there are no difficulty for the release of liver or score 10 if dissection of liver is impossible, 3 years|de novo hepatic adherence extension, 0 : no extension of hepatic adherence

1. : 1/3 of area affected
2. : between 1/3 and 2/3 of area affected
3. : more than 2/3 of area affected, 3 years|hepatic adherence reformation, 3 years|adherence composite score, this is a mathematic score in relation with area and severity of liver adherence, 3 years|composite score and surgery difficulty, this is a correlation between the composite score, the morbidity criteria and dissection difficulty, 3 years|liver adherence score validation, 3 years
