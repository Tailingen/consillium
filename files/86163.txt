Long Term Follow-up After Embolization of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations
The time-frame and the follow-up elements after embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations are not standardized. Therefore, few reliable follow-up data are available for these patients. This study aims at collecting standardized long term data for these patients.
