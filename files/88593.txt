Evaluate the Response to 2 Induction Courses (12 Intravesical Instillations) of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for High Risk Superficial Bladder Cancer
This is a phase II study. This means that BCG therapy has already been found to be safe in humans. The investigators just want to see if using more treatments works better.
Bladder Cancer|High Risk Superficial
BIOLOGICAL: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
Response Rate, (by cystoscopy and cytology) Participants who have a response are those who have no evidence of disease in their bladder by both urine cytology and cystoscopy. Participants whose disease remains at the same stage or is downstaged without complete resolution are considered nonresponders and will be documented as having recurred. Participants with worsening tumor, defined as the upstaging from non-muscle invasive to muscle invasive disease, or metastatic disease will be documented as disease progression., 6 months
Percentage of Participants With Recurrence-free Survival After Complete Response, Progression is defined as the upstaging, from non-muscle invasive to muscle invasive disease, or metastatic disease will be documented as disease progression., 2 years
