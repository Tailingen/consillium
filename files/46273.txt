Part 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD study with a food effect assessment.

Part 2 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, MAD study over 14 days. In order to explore the potential CYP3A4 inducer effect, midazolam will also be administered in one cohort.

Part 3 is a 3-period, open label, randomised, sequential study. Each subject will receive solid dose formulation and powder for oral suspension in a randomised manner.
