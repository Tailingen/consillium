TPIV200/huFR-1 (A Multi-Epitope Anti-Folate Receptor Vaccine) Plus Anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) in Patients With Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer
This is a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests two investigational drugs: TPIV200/huFR-1 (also called TPIV200), which is a vaccine consisting of proteins from the folate receptor alpha mixed with GM-CSF, and durvalumab (MEDI4736) , which is an antibody drug that help un-block parts of the immune system. The aim of this study is to find out whether these drugs, when given together are safe, and whether they are effective in treating cancer.
