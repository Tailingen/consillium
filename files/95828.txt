Treatment of Rectal Cancer With Long-term Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Combined With Camrelizumab
This is a single-arm, phase II clinical study aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with camrelizumab as a neoadjuvant therapy in the treatment of locally advanced/low rectal cancer requiring anus preservation.
