This is a prospective, phase II, adaptive, multicentre, randomised clinical trial in patients undergoing reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The trial will compare the novel graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis regimens of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) + Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) (PTCy-CNI) or PTCy + Sirolimus to a current standard-of-care involving the use of T-cell depletion with Thymoglobulin. Patients will be minimised at randomisation by their randomising centre, disease risk score (low/intermediate or high/very high) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match (10/10 or 9/10). Patients eligible for entry into the trial will be randomised on a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either one of the experimental treatment arms or the control arm.

The primary objective is to compare GvHD-free, relapse-free Survival (GRFS) in patients treated with the GvHD prophylaxis regimens PTCy-CNI, PTCy-Sirolimus or T-cell depletion with Thymoglobulin.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the cumulative incidence of acute GvHD (aGvHD), the cumulative incidence of moderate and severe chronic GvHD (cGvHD), the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), immune suppression-free survival, the cumulative incidence of engraftment, the incidence of full donor chimerism, the cumulative incidence of infection requiring inpatient admission, the number of inpatient days, the timing and dose of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), the cumulative incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) related-post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), the number of doses rituximab administered for EBV reactivation, quality of life (QoL), the cumulative incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis, the cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia and CMV end-organ disease and safety and tolerability.

The scientific research will address the questions about how plasma biomarkers for GvHD predict GvHD and non-relapse mortality following T-cell depleted methods of transplantation and how the different methods of T-cell depletion impact on immune function and re-constitution.

Exploratory Outcome Measures:

The scientific research will address the following questions:

1. Do plasma biomarkers for GvHD predict GvHD and non-relapse mortality following T-cell depleted methods of transplantation?
2. Do PTCy methods increase T cell receptor repertoire diversity (as measured by TCR DNA sequencing) compared to ATG-based T cell depletion?
3. How do the different methods of T-cell depletion impact upon donor Treg reconstitution?
4. How do the different methods of T-cell depletion impact upon thymic function as evaluated by measurement of recent thymic emigrants?
5. Are PTCy methods of TCD associated with better preservation of virus-specific immunity (as measured by tetramer or ex vivo functional immune responses)?
