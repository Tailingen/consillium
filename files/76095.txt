Improved Breast MRI With SWIFT
Today's medical imaging methods have insufficient specificity for reliable differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions in patients. Pathologic evaluation is currently the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This research will use a novel method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Sweep Imaging with Fourier Transform (SWIFT), at a very high magnetic field (4 Tesla) to distinguish malignant from benign breast lesions. This research will reveal whether the SWIFT sequence bears new capabilities in medical imaging for breast cancer diagnosis.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Magnetic resonance imaging
Lesions, Number of lesions detected, at time of read by two radiologiests, compared to biopsy within 7 days.
Patients will be asked to come to the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota. Researchers will interview the patient and describe procedures and risks. An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in an upper extremity for infusing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast dye. Baseline MRI scans will be done. These MRI measurements will be compared with clinical, radiological and pathological findings (the gold standard).

Follow-up contact will occur within one year after the MRI to determine whether a pathology report is available.
