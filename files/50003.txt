Effect of Panitumumab on the Pharmacokinetics of Irinotecan
The primary objective of this study is to determine if panitumumab affects the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of irinotecan.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: Irinotecan
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Irinotecan, To analyze the effect, if any, that panitumumab had on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, the Cmax of irinotecan administered alone (Cycle 1) and with concomitant panitumumab (Cycle 2) was measured. Plasma samples were assayed by a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluorescence method for the measurement of irinotecan. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 2 ng/mL., Predose and at 10 minutes, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the end of the irinotecan infusion at cycle 1 (irinotecan alone, week 1 day 1) and cycle 2 (irinotecan with panitumumab, week 3, day 1).|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From the Time of Dosing to Infinity (AUCinf) for Irinotecan, To analyze the effect, if any, that panitumumab had on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, the AUCinf of irinotecan administered alone (Cycle 1) and with concomitant panitumumab (Cycle 2) was measured., Predose and at 10 minutes, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the end of the irinotecan infusion at cycle 1 (irinotecan alone, week 1 day 1) and cycle 2 (irinotecan with panitumumab, week 3, day 1).|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) for Irinotecan, To analyze the effect, if any, that panitumumab had on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, the AUClast of irinotecan administered alone (Cycle 1) and with concomitant panitumumab (Cycle 2) was measured., Predose and at 10 minutes, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the end of the irinotecan infusion at cycle 1 (irinotecan alone, week 1 day 1) and cycle 2 (irinotecan with panitumumab, week 3, day 1).|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events of special interest include infusion reactions, integument toxicities, diarrhea, stomatitis, hypomagnesemia, and pulmonary, vascular, and cardiac toxicities. Infusion reactions were defined as 1. Prespecified signs and symptoms indicating a possible infusion reaction (derived from Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) definitions of allergic reaction/hypersensitivity and cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction) with onset day coincident with any study drug infusion and which resolved the day of, or the day after, onset; 2. incidence of AE with terms consistent with the panitumumab US package insert (USPI) (any event within 24 hours of an infusion during the clinical study described as allergic reaction or anaphylactoid reaction, or any event occurring on the first day of dosing described as allergic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, fever, chills, or dyspnea).

Data are summarized overall and by treatment phase., The reporting time frame for Adverse Events is from first dose date to 30 days since the last dose date, until the data cut-off date of 16 July 2009. The median time frame is 5.7 months.
The primary objective of this study is to determine if panitumumab affects the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of irinotecan.
