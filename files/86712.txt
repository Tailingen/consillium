Correlation Analysis of T-lymphocyte Subsets and Prognosis in Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) for Lymphoma
This is a retrospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study. This study aims to explore the effect of T-lymphocyte subsets changes in immunologic reconstitution and prognosis in lymphoma patients who were treated by autologous stem cell transplantation.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: autologous stem cell transplantation
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival serves as an effective index to analysis the correlation of T-lymphocyte subsets and prognosis. And it would be measured within 2 years., 2 years|Overall survival, The investigators would measure the overall survival of participants within 2 years. Overall survival serves as an effective index to analysis the correlation of T-lymphocyte subsets and prognosis., 2 years
High dose chemotherapy combined with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is the consolidation treatment for advanced lymphoma patients and approved for treating recurrent and refractory lymphoma by prolonging progression-free survival significantly while also improving quality of life. Evidences to date, have validated that changes of T-lymphocyte subsets after autologous stem cell transplantation associated closely with immunologic reconstitution, and have produced amazing effects in prognosis. Whether T-lymphocyte subsets changes could serve as an effective index for prognosis has been a serious question for lymphoma patients treated by autologous stem cell transplantation. In this study, the investigators explore the changes of T-lymphocyte subsets in lymphoma patients before and after autologous stem cell transplantation, and evaluate the significant effect of T-lymphocyte subsets changes in immunologic reconstitution and prognosis in these patients.
