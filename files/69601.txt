Diagnostic Biomarkers Exploration of Breast Cancer From Serum and Urine
The goal of this observational study is to find the diagnostic biomarkers in serum and urine from early breast cancer patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* compare the different biomarkers in serum and urine from breast cancer patients, benign lesions and healthy population.
* construct the best diagnostic model by machine learning to distinguish breast cancer and non-breast cancer patients.

Participants, including breast and non-breast cancer patients will be asked to provides blood and urine during their diagnosis and treatment process without changing the original treatment. When necessary, specimens will be collected during the surgery，without affecting pathological diagnosis.
Breast Neoplasm Female
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Collect blood and urine，pathological specimens if necessary
The different biomarkers in malignant and benign breast diseases, By analyzing the differences (eg:PCA, FC and et al.)in the composition of proteins in blood and urine, biomarkers with significant differences between the two groups will be obtained., It is expected to be one to two years.|Diagnostic models used different biomarkers by machine learning, Using biomarkers that detect discrepancies, combined with machine learning to build early breast cancer diagnostic models., Within half a year after the completion of the test.
