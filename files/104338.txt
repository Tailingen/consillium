A Prehabilitation Program to Boost Postoperative Functional Capacity in Surgical Lung Cancer Patients
This research study is evaluating a prehabiliation intervention designed to improve postoperative functional capacity (measured by 6-minure walking distance) in individuals undergoing lung resection for cancer.
