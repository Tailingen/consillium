A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of MGD013 in Patients With Melanoma
This is an open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MGD013 in ① Cohort 1: patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic melanoma who have failed prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; ② Cohort 2: patients with untreated, unresectable recurrent or metastatic, mucosal or acral lentiginous melanoma.
Unresectable, Recurrent or Metastatic Melanoma|Untreated Mucosal or Acral Lentiginous Melanoma
DRUG: MGD013
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR in enrolled patients, which is assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 12 months after dosed
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by Investigator per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 12 months after dosed|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by Investigator and IRC per irRECIST., Approximately 12 months after dosed|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from patient enrollment to death due to any cause, Approximately 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from patient enrollment to tumor progression or death due to any cause. Progression is assessed per RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, respectively, Approximately 12 months after dosed|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the time from patient enrollment to tumor progression or death due to any cause. The tumor progression is assessed per RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, respectively, Approximately 12 months after dosed|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from radiographic response to disease progression or death in patients with a best response of CR or PR, assessed per RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, respectively, Approximately 12 months after dosed|Survival Rate, Survival Rate is defined as the proportion of surviving patients at the corresponding time point. Survival rates at 6 and 12 months will be analyzed in this study, Approximately 12 months after dosed|Incidence of Abnormal Laboratory value, Incidence of abnormal laboratory is defined as the proportion of patients who have abnormal laboratory value not prior to the initiation of MGD013 administration, Approximately 24 months|Incidence of Adverse Events, The incidence of adverse events is defined as the proportion of the patients who have adverse event(s) enrolled in this study., Approximately 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of MGD013 treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to MGD013 administration., Approximately 24 months.|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax), The maximum serum concentration (Cmax, ng/ml) is defined as the maximum (or peak) serum concentration that MGD013 achieves in patients after the MGD013 administration at a corresponding timepoint., Approximately 3 months.|Trough Serum Concentration (Ctrough), The through serum concentration (Cmin, ng/ml) is defined as the minimum (or through) serum concentration reached by MGD013 prior to administration of a second dose., Approximately 3 months|Immunogenicity of MGD013, Immunogenicity is defined as the positivity measured as the anti-MGD013 antibody induced in serum after MGD013 is administrated into human body at corresponding timepoints., Approximately 6 months after dosed
The study is conducted in two parts for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Part I: Safety evaluation and efficacy exploration for MGD013. Part II: Efficacy expansion based on results from Part I to further evaluate the efficacy effect of MGD013.
