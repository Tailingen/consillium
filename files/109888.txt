A Study Evaluating Bemarituzumab in Combination With Other Anti-cancer Therapies in Subjects With Previously Untreated Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer.
The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bemarituzumab in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, and to evaluate the efficacy of bemarituzumab in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) and nivolumab as assessed by objective response.
