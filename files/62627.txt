S095035 in Adult Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors With Deletion of the Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP) Gene
This is a first-in-human Phase 1, multicenter, open-label dose escalation study of S095035 in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with homozygous deletion of MTAP who have failed to respond to or have progressed after at least 1 prior treatment regimen, and for whom additional effective standard treatment is not available. S095035 is an oral methionine adenosyltransferase 2A \[MAT2A\] inhibitor.

This is a first-in-human Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study of S095035 as single-agent, or in combination with TNG462 in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with homozygous deletion of MTAP who have failed to respond to or have progressed after at least 1 prior treatment regimen, and for whom additional effective standard treatment is not available. S095035 is an oral methionine adenosyltransferase 2A \[MAT2A\] inhibitor. TNG462 is a protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5 \[PRMT5\] inhibitor.
