Study of TL-895 in Subjects With Myelofibrosis or Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis
This study evaluates TL-895, a potent, orally-available and highly selective irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of Myelofibrosis (Cohorts 1-3) or Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (Cohort 5). Participants must be diagnosed with Myelofibrosis and be relapsed/refractory (e.g., having failed prior therapy), intolerant, or ineligible to receive JAKi treatment, or be diagnosed with Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis.
Myelofibrosis|Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis
DRUG: TL-895|DRUG: Placebo
Cohorts 1-3: Determine the RP2D of TL-895, The RP2D for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 will be reported, 9 months|Cohort 5: Determine the RP2D of TL-895, The RP2D for Cohort 5 will be reported, Week 24
Cohorts 1-3: Spleen volume reduction (SVR) rate, The proportion of subjects achieving â‰¥35% SVR at Week 24 by MRI or CT scan (central review)., Week 24|Cohort 5: Changes in patient reported symptoms, Mean change in patient reported symptom assessment, Week 12
