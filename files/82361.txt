Clinical Impact of Second-look Endoscopy After Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection of Gastric Neoplasm
Gastroenterologists often follow up second look endoscopy after endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD) of gastric neoplasms because they want to prevent bleeding of procedure sites. But Goto suggested in his retrospective analysis that a second-look endoscopy after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric epithelial neoplasm may be unnecessary. So, the investigators try to identify the hypothesis prospectively in this study.
Gastric Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: second look endoscopy
Post-ESD bleeding rate according to second look endoscopy, Up to 60days
bleeding complication rate according to location of lesion in stomach., Fundus, cardia, upper body, mid body, lower body, antrum anterior wall, posterior wall, great curvature, lesser curvature, Up to 60days|Bleeding rate according to size of resected specimen, longest diameter of specimen: millimeter, Up to 60days|Post ESD bleeding rate according to total procedure time of endoscopic submucosal dissection, Up to 60days|Post ESD bleeding rate according to bleeding degree during endoscopic submucosal dissection, Mild: bleeding control time: \<1/3 of total ESD procedure time. Moderate: bleeding control time: 1/3\~1/2 of total ESD procedure time Severe: bleeding control time: \>1/2 of total ESD procedure time, Up to 60days
