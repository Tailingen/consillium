Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Toripalimab in Combination With Axitinib Versus Sunitinib Monotherapy in Advanced Renal Cell Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter, phase III trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab in combination with axitinib to sunitinib monotherapy as a first-line therapy for advanced RCC. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive the combination therapy of Toripalimab and axitinib or sunitinib monotherapy.
