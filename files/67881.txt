Peritoneal metastasis is one of the most frequent non-curable factors in advanced gastric cancer with poor prognosis, the median survival time of patients is less than 1 year and even worse in China. Recently, several new modalities have been developed and reported to improve survival, including the new chemotherapeutic agents, molecular targeting agents and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy（HIPEC）.Still, the long-term outcomes based on multicenter randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are awaited.

The surgical approach to metastatic lesions has been proved to play a very crucial role in prolonging the survival of metastatic colorectal patients, which might be able to cure patients with the operation aiming at R0 resection. For patients with metastatic gastric cancer, surgical intervention of primary tumor and measurable metastatic lesion is technically feasible, while the survival benefit is controversial. Even though the REGATTA trial demonstrated that the removal of the primary tumor is not necessarily beneficial, the role of operation aiming at R0 resection combined with new regimens like HIPEC and new chemotherapeutic agents is still confusing and new categories of classification for metastatic gastric cancer based on the treatment response is needed.

In order to evaluate the survival benefit and safety of cytoreductive surgery(CRS) and HIPEC before beginning chemotherapy in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis, patients who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited in this study and receive CRS, HIPEC and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy regimen based on cisplatin and fluorouracil(CF) are recommended. Patients are followed up for 2 years and the safety and survival outcome will be analyzed.
