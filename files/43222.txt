HDR Brachytherapy 68-Ga-RM2 PET, 68-Ga-PSMA-11 PET &Multi Parametric MRI in Prostate Cancer
This study is being conducted to determine whether the combination of imaging agents 68-Ga RM2 and 68-Ga PMSA11 is better at assessing response to high dose rate (HDR) local therapy than standard imaging or biopsy in patients with known prostate cancer (PC)
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 68-Ga RM2.|DRUG: 68-Ga PSMA11|DEVICE: PET/MRI
Number of Participants With Successful Assessment of PET Based PC Lesions, Assessment of whether 68-Ga-RM2 and 68-Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI can detect additional cancers over mpMRI. Detection of PC lesions will be assessed by 68Ga PSMA11 and 68Ga RM2 PET scans., Day 1 (first scan) and 2 weeks (second scan) relative to baseline. First scan was approximately 2 months prior to HDR treatment|Number of Participants for Which an Assessment of PET Based Therapeutic Response to HDR is Successfully Obtained, Assessment of whether 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI can assess changes in response to treatment. Therapeutic response to HDR will be assessed by 68Ga PSMA 11 and 68Ga RM2 PET scans. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Day 1 (first scan) and 2 weeks (second scan) relative to baseline. First scan was approximately 2 months prior to HDR treatment|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed as survival without progression at 24 months. The outcome is reported as the number (without dispersion) of the participants alive without progression., 24 months
Primary Objective:

1. To demonstrate that 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI can detect additional cancers over mpMRI.
2. To demonstrate that 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI can assess changes in response to treatment and predict progression free survival (PFS) at 24 months.
