Famitinib in Combination With Adebrelimab for the Treatment of Advanced Thyroid Cancer
This is a multi-cohort, open-label, single-centre, Phase 2 study aiming to investigate the efficacy and safety of a regimen using the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor Famitinib in combination with the PD-L1 antibody Adebrelimab for the patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic refractory to standard treatment differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as well as Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with the best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., From date of treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., From date of treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documentation of PD or date of death, whichever occurs first, as measured by RECIST V1.1., From date of treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from treatment to death, regardless of disease recurrence., From date of treatment start until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Safety Assessment, The safety assessment includes the rate of treatment-related adverse effects, severe adverse effects, and abnormal laboratory examination results, which have clinical significance according to CTCAE v 5.0., From treating to the date AEs, SAEs, or abnormal results occurs. assessed up to 60 months
The participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to different cohorts to be treated. Participants will receive Adebrelimab 1200 mg intravenously once every three weeks (Q3W), together with Famitinib 20 mg orally daily before or after the diet. Participants will be given the regimen of Famitinib in combination with Adebrelimab during the Treatment phase until disease progression or undulated toxicity appears.
