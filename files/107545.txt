A Comparison Between BMS-690514 and Erlotinib in Patients Who Were Previously Treated for NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to improve disease control and survival for patients who were treated with chemotherapy using BMS-690514 over erlotinib
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BMS-690514|DRUG: Erlotinib
To compare the progression-free survival of patients on BMS-690514 with those on erlotinib, CT/MRI at baseline and every 6 weeks for 36 weeks
To compare the overall survival between BMS-690514 and erlotinib, 15 months|To estimate the overall response rate of BMS-690514 or erlotinib, 15 months|To estimate the tumor size change and PFS rate at 6 weeks, 6 weeks|To assess safety and tolerability of BMS-690514 and erlotinib, 15 months|To estimate the association between efficacy and EGFR copy as measured by FISH for both BMS-690514 and erlotinib, 15 months|To obtain samples for population pharmacokinetics for BMS-690514 in previously treated NSCLC patients, Days 1,8,15, 29
