In the United States, 14.8 million women live greater than 50 miles away from the closest gynecology oncologist underscoring the need for increased implementation of telemedicine. In consideration of the COVID-19 outbreak, recommendations were made to organize goals of therapy by prioritizing curative intent and utilizing telemedicine to manage current therapies. Research regarding telemedicine, its benefits, and patient perspectives in other specialties has been reported, however there appears to be a dearth of information in the field of gynecologic oncology. Our study aims to seek patients' perspective of telemedicine and whether implementation for extended office visits, teleconsultations and more are feasible and valuable to them.
