Biomarker To Evaluate Protein Profiles of Neutropenic Fever/Infection With Acute or Chronic Leukemias
The purpose of this study is to measure, in pilot/observational study, panels of circulating proteins in real time at the onset of neutropenic fever/infection in patients with acute or chronic leukemias undergoing chemotherapy or other biologic treatment. And to generate preliminary trend results in panels of circulating proteins longitudinally during the period of neutropenia and to correlate those values to clinical/laboratory data and patient outcomes.
Leukemia, Lymphocytic|Leukemia, Myeloid
To identify potential biomarkers for the prediction of NF, we performed serial measurements of nine biomarkers \[C-reactive protein (CRP), protein C, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1\] using a multiplex ELISA array platform every 6-8 hours in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.
