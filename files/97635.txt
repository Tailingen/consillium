Microdose Study of Melphalan, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone
The purpose of the study is to identify specific genes that are up- or downregulated in multiple myeloma patients who receive a microdose of either Melphalan (Alkeran®), Bortezomib (Velcade®) or Dexamethasone (Dexaven®). The study treatment constitutes 1% of the planned standard myeloma treatment and will be given two hours prior to standard treatment. Blood samples are taken at baseline, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes for microarray analysis.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Change from baseline in gene expression at 15, 30, 60, 120 minutes upon microdose drug exposure., The primary outcome measure is determination of differential and significantly expressed genes across time successive samples from each individual patient. The analysis will be based on global gene expression profiling and differentially expressed genes will be identified using pairwise comparisons of samples means by two sample t-tests and corrections for multiple testing., Prior to microdose and 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes post-microdose
