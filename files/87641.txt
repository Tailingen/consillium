Barrett's Esophagus - 315 - 3 Way Cross Over
This study evaluates PGE2 production, COX-2 enzyme activity and PCNA expression in Barrett's metaplastic tissue. All patients will have a baseline endoscopy with multiple biopsies. The patients will then be receive four dosing regimens (esomeprazole, esomeprazole and aspirin, esomeprazole and rofecoxib, or rofecoxib alone) consecutively each for a 10 day dosing period, whilst undergoing further follow up endoscopies and multiple biopsies.
Barrett's Esophagus
DRUG: Esomeprazole|DRUG: Aspirin|DRUG: Rofecoxib
Measure PGE production in Barrett's metastatic tissue & determine the reduction from baseline of PGE production would be equivalent on Day 10 in esomeprazole 40mg bid + aspirin treatment compared to esomeprazole 40 mg bid + rofecoxib 25 mg qd treatment, Baseline esophageal biopsies will be taken and thereafter at Day 10 in each treatment period.
To determine in which of the four treatment groups the reduction in the baseline in PGE2 production, COX-2 enzyme activity and PCNA expression in Barrett's metaplastic tissue is the greatest., Baseline esophageal biopsies will be taken and thereafter at Day 10 in each treatment period
