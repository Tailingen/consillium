Phase I Study of IPI-504 and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a Phase I clinical trial of IPI-504 in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere).The purposes of the study are to determine:

* the safety profile,
* the highest dose of IPI-504 that can be given with docetaxel without causing severe side effects, and
* to recommend a Phase II dose of the combination in patients with solid tumors.

IPI-504 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an emerging and recently identified target for cancer therapy. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that plays a central role in maintaining the proper folding, function and viability of various "client proteins". Many of the client proteins stabilized by Hsp90 are oncoproteins and cell-signaling proteins important in cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell survival.

This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalating study in which patients will be treated with a fixed dose of docetaxel followed by IPI-504 following one of three dosing schedules.

Once an MTD has been defined, up to 20 additional patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be enrolled.
