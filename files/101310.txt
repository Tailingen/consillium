Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab + Decitabine Followed by Std Neoadj Chemo for Locally Advanced HER2- Breast Ca
This study is a 2-cohort, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study of a short course of immunotherapy consisting of sequential decitabine followed by pembrolizumab administered prior to a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for patients with locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer. The primary efficacy objective is to determine if the immunotherapy increases the presence and percentage of tumor and/or stromal area of infiltrating lymphocytes prior to initiation of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At enrollment, patients will be assigned to one of 2 cohorts based on hormone receptor status.

* Cohort A - patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (defined as both ER and PgR with \< 10% positive staining on IHC) Note: before beginning standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients in Cohort A may be reassigned to Cohort A2 to receive extended pembrolizumab as part of new standard neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant therapy.
* Cohort B - patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (defined as either ER or PgR with ≥ 10% positive staining on IHC)

The Percentage of Increase in Tumor and Stroma With Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) From Baseline Pre-treatment Biopsy to Post-immunotherapy Biopsy Following Administration of Decitabine Followed by Pembrolizumab., To determine and quantify if treatment with neoadjuvant decitabine followed by pembrolizumab increases lymphocyte infiltration into tumor and/or stroma in patients with locally advanced, HER2-negative breast cancer., Baseline pre-treatment biopsy to post-immunotherapy biopsy following administration of decitabine followed by pembrolizumab, 3-7 day window after Day 22 medication administration, about one month
Number of Adverse Events (AEs) Reported During and After Immune Treatment (ie, Decitabine and Pembrolizumab), Using criteria in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), all adverse events (AEs) regardless of grade or attribution, will be captured from the beginning of study treatment (initiation of decitabine) until initiation of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

For patients who do not initiate pembrolizumab, all AEs will be captured until 30 days following the last dose of decitabine or until another cancer treatment is initiated, whichever occurs first.For patients who initiate pembrolizumab, immune related adverse events (irAEs) (clinically significant and non-clinically significant) will be captured from the initiation of pembrolizumab through the end of the 30- day post-surgery (or post-treatment, for those who don't have surgery) follow-up period and at a 12-month follow-up time point., Time of study registration until 30 days following the last dose of decitabine, or until another cancer treatment was initiated, or 30 days following surgery, 12- months.|Number of Patients Meeting Criteria for Lymphocyte-predominant Breast Cancer (LPBC) Following Treatment With Decitabine and Pembrolizumab, To determine if the study treatment increases the proportion of tumors with ≥ 60% tumor or stromal area infiltrated with lymphocytes (ie, LPBC). The percentage of patients meeting criteria for LPBC following treatment with decitabine and pembrolizumab compared to the percentage before treatment (LPBC is defined as breast cancer with ≥ 60% intratumoral or stromal area with infiltrating lymphocytes.), Assessed at end of administration of decitabine and pembrolizumab Day- Window of time Days 25-29|Number of Patients With Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) in the Breast and Post-therapy Lymph Nodes., To determine the rate of pCR in the breast and lymph nodes (pCR breast and nodes). The number of patients with pCR in the breast and post-therapy lymph nodes defined as the absence of any invasive cancer in the resected breast specimen and absence of cancer on H\&E evaluation of all resected lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (ypT0/is; ypN0)., 30 days following surgery or last dose of therapy|Number of Patients With no or Minimal Residual Disease in the Resected Breast and Axillary Specimen., To determine the rate of Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) Index value of 0-1 following all neoadjuvant therapy. The number of patients with no (0) or (i) minimal residual disease in the resected breast and axillary specimen defined as RCB Index value 0 or i (Arabic numeral)., End of therapy surgery|The Number of Patients With Clinical Complete Response (cCR), To determine the rate of clinical complete response in the breast and lymph nodes (cCR breast and nodes) following all neoadjuvant therapy. The proportion of patients with cCR defined as the absence of tumor based on physical examination of the breast and nodes following completion of all neoadjuvant therapy., End of therapy surgery|Enumeration of T Cells and Immune Cell Subsets, To characterize the alteration of T lymphocyte and other host cell infiltration and immune response gene signatures in breast cancers resulting from treatment with decitabine and pembrolizumab.

Both cohorts will receive the identical doses and treatment schedules of decitabine and pembrolizumab followed by a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Both cohorts will receive 4 cycles of AC and 12 doses of weekly paclitaxel or Nab-paclitaxel. Paclitaxel or Nab-paclitaxel will be combined with carboplatin for Cohorts A and A2 (TNBC). The sequence of the 2 regimens will be at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist following the safety lead-in phase. For the primary endpoint, Cohorts A and A2 will be evaluated together, separate from Cohort B.
