Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of Odronextamab in Patients With CD20+ B-Cell Malignancies
This study has two parts with distinct study objectives and study design. In part A, odronextamab is studied as an intravenous (IV) administration with a dose escalation and a dose expansion phase for B-NHL and CLL. The dose escalation phase for B-NHL and the CLL study are closed at the time of protocol amendment 17. In part B, odronextamab is studied as a subcutaneous (SC) administration with a dose finding and a dose expansion phase for B-NHL.
