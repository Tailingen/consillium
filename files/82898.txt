Study to Identify the Impact of Denosumab on the Immune System in Patients With HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
The aim of this prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, explorative phase II study is to identify the impact of (neo)adjuvant denosumab on the systemic immunity and local immunologic microenvironment in postmenopausal patients with HER2 negative non-metastatic primary breast cancer.

Change in intratumoral T-cell (CD4, CD8 and Treg) numbers and function between the baseline biopsy and the surgical specimen., The change will be determined by use of IHC and immunofluorescent stainings., The change can be determined after the surgical specimen is obtained, which is around two weeks after enrolment.|Change in myeloid cell (M1/M2 Macrophage, MDSC, DC) numbers and function between the baseline biopsy and the surgical specimen., The change will be determined by use of IHC and immunofluorescent stainings., The change can be determined after the surgical specimen is obtained, which is around two weeks after enrolment.
Shift in activated T effector cell levels., Shifts will be determined by comparing PBMCs (using flow cytometry) before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration., Measurements will be done in PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Shift in regulatory T-cell levels., Shifts will be determined by comparing PBMCs (using flow cytometry) before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration., Measurements will be done in PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Change in functional response of T-cells., Changes will be determined by comparing PBMCs (using stimulation tests) before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration., Measurements will be done in PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Change in mature and immature myeloid cells (M1/M2 macrophage, MDSC, DC)., Shifts will be determined by comparing PBMCs (using flow cytometry) before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration., Measurements will be done in PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Shift in myeloid cell function., Shifts will be determined by comparing PBMCs (using triggering tests) before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration., Measurements will be done in PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Change in stimulation capacity APCs., Changes will be determined by comparing PBMCs (using restimulation tests) before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration., Measurements will be done in PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Change in serum levels of RANKL and OPG., Changes will be determined by comparing serum before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, using ELISA., Measurements will be done in serum from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Change in serum cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, interleukines, IFN gamma)., Changes will be determined by comparing serum before start treatment, at day of surgery before surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, using luminex., Measurements will be done in serum from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment.|Correlation of tumor measurements with serum measurements., Measurements in tumor and serum will be correlated., Measurements will be done in tumor material and serum from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment and tumor material from baseline and surgery.|Correlation of tumor measurements with PBMCs measurements., Measurements in tumor and PBMCs will be correlated., Measurements will be done in tumor material and PBMCs from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment and tumor material from baseline and surgery.|Correlation of serum measurements and PBMCs measurements., Measurements in serum and PBMCs will be correlated., Measurements will be done in PBMCs/serum from before start treatment, day of surgery and 7 days after last chemotherapy administration, which will be around 8 months after enrolment and tumor material from baseline and surgery.|Toxicity according to NCI CTCAE v4.03., Toxicities are graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03., Toxicity will be assessed from start treatment up to 30 days following the last dose of treatment.|Difference in descriptive event free survival (EFS) at 3 years based on immune response., After 3 years of follow up, differences in EFS based on immune response will be determined., EFS will be determined after 3 years.
In this study, postmenopausal patients with stage T1c + grade 3, stage II or III, HER2-negative breast cancer, which are planned to undergo surgery followed by adjuvant AC-T chemotherapy, are randomized between no denosumab, denosumab low dosing and denosumab high dosing. Denosumab administration will start one week before surgery and continue until the last chemotherapy cycle.
