Postoperative IMRT Combined With Capecitabine for Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients
Radiation therapy plus concurrent chemotherapy has been demonstrated a significant improvement in overall and disease-free survival according to Intergroup Trial 0116 in patients with gastric cancer after surgical complete resection. Advantage of application of IMRT has been shown in planning comparison studies for postoperative gastric patients. So the investigators designed the trial to see safety and efficacy of postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy of capecitabine combined with IMRT for stage II/II gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
RADIATION: concurrent chemoradiation
feasibility of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine for the treatment of gastric cancer patients, feasibility of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine is defined as toxicities (CTC-AE 3.0) and rate of patients complete concurrent chemoradiation according to protocol., 3 months after concurrent chemoradiation
efficacy of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine for the treatment of gastric cancer patients, efficacy of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine for the treatment of gastric cancer patients in this trial is defined as 3-year overall survival and 3-year relapse free survival., 3 years after concurrent chemoradiation
In Intergroup 0116, only 64% patients in concurrent chemoradiation group completed treatment as planed, but in recently reported ARTIST trial, capecitabine was admitted to concurrent with radiotherapy,patients who completed treatment as planed in concurrent group reach high as 80%. IMRT is an advanced radiotherapy technology which allows high conformal dose distribution to Planing Tumor Volume (PTV) and low dose to organ at risk. The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine for the treatment of gastric cancer patients after D1/2 surgery.
