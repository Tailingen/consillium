Preliminary efficacy of ON 123300, Objective responses by RECIST, Through study completion, an average of 6 months
After being informed about the study including potential risks, patients giving written informed consent will proceed to a screening period when assessments will be performed to determine whether the patient is eligible to participate in the study. If the patient is eligible, they will start to receive ON 123300 as capsules every day. On day 1 and Day 8 of the study, patients will be required to provide eight blood samples to allow measurement of the amount of drug in their blood. Three ECGs will also be performed during this time. Patients will continue to receive ON 123300 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient or physician decision to stop.

The first group of patients will receive 40mg of ON 123300 daily, the next group 80mg of ON 123300, the 120mg, etc. until the correct dose has been determined for future studies.

Patients will visit the clinic on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9, then weekly for the first month, then every two weeks for two more months, then every month.
