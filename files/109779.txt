Cellular Immunotherapy Study for Brain Cancer
The purpose of this research study to determine if treating recurrent malignant gliomas with another person's (donor) immune system cells known as aCTL cells, will be safe. This study will also try to determine if persons who receive aCTL's are more or less likely to survive their brain tumor than persons who had similar tumors in the past. Approximately 15 patients will be enrolled at UCLA.
