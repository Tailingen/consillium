Study of Aspirin in Patients With Vestibular Schwannoma
This is a phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, longitudinal study evaluating whether the administration of aspirin can delay or slow tumor growth and maintain or improve hearing in VS patients.
Vestibular Schwannoma|Acoustic Neuroma|Neurofibromatosis 2
DRUG: Aspirin|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is the length of time from start of study treatment to tumor growth of more than 20%., Progression, or around 3.5 years
This is a phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, longitudinal study evaluating whether the administration of aspirin can delay or slow tumor growth and maintain or improve hearing in VS patients. In the Randomized Treatment Phase, patients aged 12 years or older with VSs will be identified and recruited into one of two randomized groups who receive either 1) 325 mg aspirin twice daily (81 mg aspirin twice daily for pediatric patients \<50 kg); or 2) a placebo. Patients will stay on aspirin/placebo as long as there is no more than 20% increase in VS volume. At tumor progression, patients will enter the Open Label Follow Up Phase. Patients who progress on placebo will be given the option to receive unblinded aspirin and will be followed until further progression, receiving a definitive treatment (e.g, surgery or radiation), or 42 months post-baseline, whichever occurs first. Patients who progress on aspirin (either blinded or unblinded) will be taken off study drug and followed until they receive a definitive treatment (e.g., surgery or radiation) or reach 42 months post-baseline, whichever comes first.
