Erlotinib Therapy and Subsequent Development of Mechanisms of Secondary Resistance in Patients With NSCLC
Erlotinib is a drug which targets non small cell lung cancer with a genetic change (mutation) in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This drug has been used in other cancer research studies and information from those studies suggests that Erlotinib can control the growth of these cancer cells.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib
Resistance Mechanism, Participants were classified into 4 potential resistant mechanism groups (4 genetic/ 1 histologic) based on evaluation of rebiopsy tissue: EGFR mutations (T790M mutation, exon 20 insertion), KRAS mutations, MET amplification or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transform using established methods., Participants were evaluated for incidence of genetic mechanisms of secondary resistance at time of disease progression at which point participants stopped treatment. Progression follow up was up to 3 years in this study cohort.
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically every 8 weeks on treatment (cycle duration=4 weeks). Participants were treated until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Progression follow-up was up to 3 years in this study cohort.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

-To prospectively assess the frequency of different genetic mechanisms of secondary resistance in patients' tumors during treatment with erlotinib (e.g., T790M mutations, MET amplification).

* Correlate these genetic changes with patient demographic data and clinical outcomes (time to progression, survival, sites of recurrence/progression).
* Search for novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to erlotinib.
* Identify whether these genetic changes are present at low levels in initial pretreatment tumor specimens.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S)

1. To measure the steady-state plasma concentrations of erlotinib during the course of patients' treatment.

   * Determine if the development and/or resolution of skin toxicity is related to plasma erlotinib concentrations.
   * Determine if the development of disease progression while on erlotinib is correlated with declines in plasma erlotinib concentrations.
   * Assess the plasma levels in patients whose smoking status has been biochemically verified to determine if smoking is associated with lower erlotinib plasma concentration.
2. To analyze from both free plasma DNA and DNA from circulating tumor cells of erlotinib-treated patients for the original sensitizing EGFR mutations and genetic changes associated with secondary resistance.
3. To measure clinical outcomes in patients with known sensitizing mutations in their tumor EGFR when treated with first-line erlotinib.

   * Response rate
   * Time to progression
   * Median overall survival
