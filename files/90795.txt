A Study of a PD-1/CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody AK104 in Patients With Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, PK and immunogenicity of AK104 in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have progressed after at least 2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy (of which one of them must be platinum-based chemotherapy).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: AK104
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1, up to 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dosing till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1, up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dosing to death from any cause, up to 2 years|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence or the deterioration of existing medical event in a clinical study subject administered an investigational drug, which does not necessarily have an unequivocal causal relationship with the investigational product, From the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after last dose of AK104|Observed concentrations of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration, From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), From first dose of AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK104
