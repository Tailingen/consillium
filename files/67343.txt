Monitoring HDR Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer by Optic and Thermal Imaging
This research aims to investigate the correlation between tumor temperature difference and biological factors, such as size, metabolism, treatment response, and tumor aggressiveness.

In addition, normal tissue response to radiation therapy in treated organ will be evaluated.
MALIGNANCY
RADIATION: THERMOGRAPHY IMAGING
The change in Infra-Red radiation emitted at wavelengths 0.8-1nm, Measurement of IR, Baseline and 4 weeks
Evaluating of efficacy of the radiation, The thermal and the optic imaging will be taken and analyzed in order to evaluate the changing in the temperature of the cervix comparing to the baseline as the indication of the response to the radiotherapy, 3 months after the treatment
