Pharmacokinetic Study of Palifermin in Subjects Receiving Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy Followed by Blood Stem Cell Support
Open label palifermin will be administered to subjects who are at a risk of developing mucositis after radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by blood stem cell support. The amount of palifermin in the blood following administration will be evaluated. The safety of palifermin administration and its effect on reducing mucositis will also be evaluated.

DRUG: Palifermin 6 x 60 μg/kg/day|DRUG: Palifermin 2 x 180 μg/kg/day|RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
To characterize the PK profile of 3 daily intravenous (IV) doses of rHuKGF before total body irradiation (TBI) / high-dose chemotherapy conditioning treatment and after PBPC transplantation
To assess the safety and tolerability of rHuKGF in subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing TBI and high-dose chemotherapy followed by PBPC transplantation.|To assess oral mucositis in subjects receiving rHuKGF.
Mucositis is a common side effect to chemotherapy and radiotherapy involving the formation of erythema and ulcerative lesions in the mouth. Mucositis can be serious, resulting in pain requiring interventions such as analgesic medications and the use of parenteral feedings. Currently, no standard therapy is available to prevent or treat mucositis.
