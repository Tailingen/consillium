Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Optimal Dose of Candidate GBM Vaccine VBI-1901 in Recurrent GBM Subjects
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of VBI-1901 in subjects with recurrent malignant gliomas (glioblastoma, or GBM).
Glioblastoma Multiforme
BIOLOGICAL: VBI-1901|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Lomustine
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring during Part A of the study, Through 14 days after each study vaccination|Occurrence of AEs during each treatment cycle, Through 28 days after each study vaccination
Serum antibody immune response, Assessment of IgG antibody to HCMV gB antigen by ELISA, Baseline and 2 weeks after each dose of vaccine in Part A and Part B and every 3 months in Part C|Cellular immune responses, Assessment of IFN-γ and IL-5 positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells by ELISPOT, Baseline and 2 weeks after each dose of vaccine in Part A and Part B and every 3 months in Part C|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) from date of first dose to date of progression (per iRANO/RANO criteria) or death, as well as at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months., From the date of first dose to date of progression or death, as well as at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months|Overall survival (OS), 6, 12, 18 and 24 months from date of first dose|Median overall survival in Part A and Part B of the study, Date of first dose to date of death from any cause, assessed up to 18 months|Reduction in steroid use compared to baseline, Baseline to study completion, an average of 12 months|Change in quality of life (QOL questionnaire) compared to baseline, Baseline to study completion, an average of 12 months|Tumor response rates (TRR) in Part C of the study, Complete response rate, partial response rate, progressive disease and stable disease, Baseline to study completion, an average of 12 months|Safety and efficacy of VBI-1901 compared to standard of care (SOC) in Part C of study, An integrated analysis of safety and efficacy (OS, TRR, PFS) in subjects receiving VBI-1901 at 10 µg dose formulated with GM-CSF as compared to subjects receiving SOC, Baseline to study completion, an average of 12 months
This is a three-part, dose-escalation study to define the safety, tolerability, and optimal dose level of candidate GBM vaccine VBI-1901 with subsequent extension of optimal dose level in recurrent GBM subjects and comparison with standard of care (SOC) treatment. Subjects in groups receiving VBI-1901 vaccination will continue to receive vaccine every 4 weeks until tumor progression per immunotherapy Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (iRANO)/Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria.
