A Study Into the Effect of Seprafilm in Open Total Thyroidectomy
The investigators intend to determine the role of Seprafilm, a popular anti-adhesive agent in minimising internal adhesion formation in the neck after thyroid surgery and therefore reduce swallowing discomfort experienced by patients after surgery.
Thyroid Carcinoma
DEVICE: Seprafilm (Sanofi, USA)
Cricoid elevation, Trial candidates are to undergo videofluoroscopy to assess their swallowing and cricoid elevation is measured using ImageJ.

* First measurement is 1 to 14 days before the surgery.
* Second measurement is 14 days postop.
* Third measurement is 3 months postop., 1 to 14 days before the surgery, postop day 14 and 3 months postop
Hyoid elevation, Trial candidates are to undergo videofluoroscopy to assess their swallowing and hyoid elevation is measured using ImageJ.

* First measurement is 1 to 14 days before the surgery.
* Second measurement is 14 days postop.
* Third measurement is 3 months postop., 1 to 14 days before the surgery, postop day 14 and 3 months postop|Crico-hyoid distance, Trial candidates are to undergo videofluoroscopy to assess their swallowing and hyoid elevation is measured using ImageJ.

* 1 to 14 days before the surgery
* Second measurement is 14 days postop.
* Third measurement is 3 months postop., 1 to 14 days before the surgery, postop day 14 and 3 months postop|Videotaping measurement, Trial candidates are to undergo videotaping of their surgical incision site during swallowing. Maximal displacement of the incision site will be measured and recorded using ImageJ.

* First measurement is 1 to 14 days before the surgery.
* Second measurement is 14 days postop.
* Third measurement is 3 months postop., 1 to 14 days before the surgery, postop day 14 and 3 months postop|Swallowing Quality of Life questionaire, Trial candidates will be interviewed regarding their swallowing using the Sydney Swallowing questionnaire. Patients will be interviewed three times.

* First interview is 1 to 14 days before the surgery.
* Second interview is 14 days postop.
* Third interview is 3 months postop., 1 to 14 days before the surgery, postop day 14 and 3 months postop
Duration of surgery, -Knife-to-skin time to closure., During surgery|Drainage, -Surgical drain will be placed for patients at surgeons' discretion. Drain amount will be recorded., Day 1 to Day 3 after the surgery
Thyroid surgery not only constitutes one of the main pillars in the treatment of thyroid cancers, but is also employed in the management of symptomatic goitres. Occasionally, it is mandated in patients with thyrotoxicosis refractory to medical therapy. While thyroid surgery can be performed with low risks such that patients rarely have to stay beyond three days in hospital, the track record of thyroid surgery is somewhat blemished by the unfortunate side effects associated with the neck scarring after thyroid surgery. Not uncommonly, patients experience discomfort in the neck region after thyroid surgery; in the extreme of cases, patients may even complain of a lifelong pulling sensation in the neck area during eating.

The anti-adhesive properties of Seprafilm are well established in animal studies and affirmed by clinical observations in abdominal surgeries that utilize this material. Thus, Seprafilm is routinely used in instances when a surgeon foresees a need to perform abdominal surgery on the same patient in future, or during the fashioning of a temporary stoma. The safety profile of Seprafilm in thyroidectomy has also been shown by a recent study conducted by a group of clinicians in Seoul.

We postulate that the application of Seprafilm to the surgical wound towards the end of a thyroidectomy significantly reduces internal adhesion formation in the neck region. By achieving this objective, we hope to improve patients' satisfaction with thyroid surgery in terms of ease of swallowing after surgery.
