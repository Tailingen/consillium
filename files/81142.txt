Axitinib With or Without Anti-OX40 Antibody PF-04518600 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
This randomized phase II trial studies how well axitinib with or without anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 work in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Biological therapies, such as anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600, use substances made from living organisms that may may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Axitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving axitinib with or without anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 may work better in treating patients with kidney cancer.

BIOLOGICAL: Anti-OX40 Antibody PF-04518600|DRUG: Axitinib|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Placebo
Progression-free survival (PFS), The statistical comparison of PFS in the two treatment arms will be based on the stratified logrank test., Time from randomization until the earliest of documented disease progression (confirmed progression of disease) or death, assessed for up to 180 days
Incidence of unacceptable toxicity, Defined as any toxicity or toxicities that necessitate the patient being removed from protocol therapy within the first 2 courses of therapy, or which cause a more than 6-week interruption of therapy or delay in starting a next course, up to the beginning of the 3rd therapy course., Up to the beginning of the third course (29 days)|ORR defined as either complete response or partial response occurring any time during treatment and assessed by RECIST 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria, The two arms will also be compared using a one-sided 0.05-level Pearson chi-square test., Up to 180 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether a statistically significant improvement in progression free survival exists for patients receiving the combination.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether the combination is safe and whether objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival (OS) improve as a result of treatment with combination of axitinib + anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 (PF-04518600 \[OX40 Ab\]) compared to axitinib + placebo.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether pre and post treatment specimens collected during the trial demonstrate significant changes in tumor microenvironment and enhanced immune response to tumor cells.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 beginning with course 2. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive axitinib as in Arm I and placebo IV on day 1 beginning with course 2. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 90, and 180 days.
