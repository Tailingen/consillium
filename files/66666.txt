Biomarkers and Molecular Mechanism Study of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Radical Resection and Conversion Therapy
Blood samples will be tested to identify circulating tumor DNA and plasma protein levels to potentially improve prediction of long term prognosis and guide treatment options of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent surgical resection.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ctDNA monitoring|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Plasma proteomic analysis
Correlation between ctDNA level and recurrence-free survival (RFS), ctDNA measurements will be made at baseline and 1 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after surgery. RFS will be assessed by standard radiographic imaging., 1 years|Correlation between specific plasma protein expression level and recurrence-free survival (RFS), plasma proteomic measurements will be made at baseline and 1 months, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after surgery. RFS will be assessed by standard radiographic imaging., 1 years
Correlation between tumor mutation numbers and recurrence-free survival (RFS), Patients with available tumor tissues were sequenced to identify their specific tumor variants.The correlation of mutation numbers and RFS will be analysis., 1 years
Blood samples will be tested to identify circulating tumor DNA and plasma protein levels to potentially improve prediction of long term prognosis and guide treatment options of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent surgical resection.
