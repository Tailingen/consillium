Non-interventional Study for Real-world Data of Afatinib Treatment in First-line Setting and of Subsequent Therapies for Patients With Advanced Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation-positive Lung Adenocarcinoma
The primary objective is to confirm Time on Treatment (TOT) related to afatinib treatment as first-line therapy in patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

The observation in the real-world setting of the time from the start of the first-line afatinib until the end of subsequent treatment in this study will provide insights on the sequence of treatment for patients. The Japanese healthcare system will enable this study to evaluate multiple treatment options after afatinib treatment.
Non-squamous, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: afatinib
Time on Treatment (TOT) With Afatinib in First-line TOT (TOT1), Time on Treatment (TOT) with afatinib in first-line TOT (TOT1). This was assessed as the time from the start of afatinib as first-line treatment until the end of afatinib treatment or death date by any cause, whichever occurs first. If patients did not discontinue first-line treatment with afatinib and did not die at the data extraction, they were censored on the date they were last verified to have been on first-line treatment with afatinib. The survival probability rate (95% confidence interval) against time to first-line treatment failure at 18 months and at 36 months is reported., From start of afatinib as first line treatment up to 18 months and up to 36 months.
Time on Treatment From the Start of Afatinib Until End of Subsequent Therapies in the Second-line Setting or Death by Any Cause (TOT), Time on treatment from the start of afatinib until end of subsequent therapies in the second-line setting or death by any cause (TOT). If patients did not discontinue second-line treatment and did not die at the data extraction, they were censored on the date they are last verified to have been on second-line treatment. If patients were on first-line treatment and did not move to second-line treatment at the data extraction, ToT is same as first-line TOT (ToT1) for these patients. The survival probability rate (95% confidence interval) against time to treatment failure at 18 months and at 36 months is reported., From start of afatinib up to 18 months and up to 36 months.|Time on Treatment From Start of the Second-line Treatment Until End of the Second-line Treatment or Death by Any Cause (TOT2), Time on treatment from start of the second-line treatment until end of the second-line treatment or death by any cause (TOT2). If patients did not discontinue second-line treatment and did not die at the data extraction, they were censored on the date they are last verified to have been on second-line treatment. The survival probability rate (95% confidence interval) against time to second-line treatment failure at 18 months and at 36 months is reported., From start of afatinib as second line treatment up to 18 months and up to 36 months.|Overall Survival, If patients did not die at the data extraction, they were censored on the date they are last verified to be alive. The survival probability rate (95% confidence interval) at 18 months and at 36 months is reported., From start of afatinib up to 18 months and up to 36 months.|Time to Initial Dose Reduction of Afatinib, Time to initial dose reduction of afatinib. If patients did not reduce initial dose of afatinib at the data extraction, they were censored on the date they were last verified to have been on the initial dose of afatinib or increased dose of afatinib. The survival probability rate (95% confidence interval) against time to initial dose reduction of afatinib at 18 months and 36 months is reported., From start of afatinib up to 18 months and up to 36 months.|Percentage of Participants With Dose Modifications of Afatinib, Percentage of participants with dose modifications of afatinib., From start of data extraction until end of data extraction, up to 586 days.
The primary objective is to confirm Time on Treatment (TOT) related to afatinib treatment as first-line therapy in patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

The observation in the real-world setting of the time from the start of the first-line afatinib until the end of subsequent treatment in this study will provide insights on the sequence of treatment for patients.
