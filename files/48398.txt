Evaluation of Ultraaccelerated High Dose Rate Intrauterine Interventional Radiotherapy
To evaluate the degree of acute and long-term intestinal, urinary and vaginal toxicity, and the impact on sexual activity of an accelerated fractionation of high dose rate interventional radiotherapy (IRT-HDR) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (IB2 - VA, N+/-).
Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma
RADIATION: Interventional Radiotherapy
Acute and late gastrointestinal toxicity, Acute and late toxicities will evaluated with CTCAE scale to analyze the safety of accelerated interventional radiotherapy, 6 months|Acute and late urinary toxicity, Acute and late urinary toxicities will evaluated with CTCAE scale to analyze the safety of accelerated interventional radiotherapy, 6 months|Sexual activity, Sexual activity will evaluated with CTCAE scale to analyze the safety of accelerated interventional radiotherapy, 6 months
Observational, monocentric and prospective study. All patients with locally advanced cervix cancer will be underwent to radiochemotherapy followed by accelerated interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy). Fist endpoints wer severe acute and late gastrointestinal, and urinary toxicities and sexual activity.
