Fluzoparib and Apatinib Versus Fluzoparib in Relapsed Ovarian Carcinoma Maintenance Treatment
This study is a Phase II randomized, open label, controlled, multicenter study to access the effects and tolerability of fluzoparib combined with apatinib versus fluzoparib monotherapy for maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian carcinoma (including patients previous treated with a PARP inhibitor).
