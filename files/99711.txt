The Gut Microbiome and Sorafenib Maintenance Therapy in FLT3-ITD Positive AML After Allo-HSCT
This prospective trial investigates the effect of sorafenib maintenance therapy in FLT3-ITD positive AML patients after allo-HSCT in terms of gut microbiome.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used as a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematopoietic malignancies. Sorafenib, an inhibitor of multiple kinases including FLT3, has shown promising activity in FLT3-ITD-positive AML. Our previous studies demonstrated that sorafenib maintenance post-transplantation could improve the outcomes of FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients, which is associated with sorafenib enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Some studies show that gut microbiome is associated with graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and GVL. However, the effect of gut microbiome on sorafenib maintenance after allo-HSCT remains unknown.
