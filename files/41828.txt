Myeloablative Consolidation Therapy and Tandem Autologous Stem Cell Rescue in Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma
This is a phase II single center study to administer two courses of myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy each followed by an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have completed induction chemotherapy (independent of this study). Ideally, patients should begin consolidation chemotherapy no later than 8 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle #5; however it is strongly recommended to begin consolidation within 4-6 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle #5.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Thiotepa|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Carboplatin|BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Stem Cell Infusion|BIOLOGICAL: Granulocyte colony stimulating factor
Progression Free Survival, Percentage of patients with progression free survial. Kaplan-Meier curves and 95% confidence intervals will be used to estimate., 3 years from first PBSC infusion
Time to Engraftment, Defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 0.5 x 109/L for three consecutive days by day 42 after first transplant., Day 42|Relapse, Percentage of patients with relapse. Relapse will be defined as any new lesion; increase of any measurable lesion by \>25%; previous negative bone is positive., 3 years from first PBSC infusion|Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier curves and 95% confidence intervals will be used to estimate overall survival., 3 years from first PBSC infusion
