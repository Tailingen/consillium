Laparoscopic Management of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor of Stomach
Gastric GISTs are rare neoplasms that require excision for cure. Although the feasibility of laparoscopic resection of gastric GIST less than 2cms has been established, the feasibility, safety and long-term efficacy of these techniques for larger lesions are unclear. Investigators hypothesized that laparoscopic resection of gastric GISTs even for larger lesions is feasible \& results in low perioperative morbidity and an effective long-term control of the disease.

Open surgical resection was the standard of treatment until two decades ago, but with advent laparoscopy and experienced gained over the years, the safety \& feasibility of laparoscopic resections of gastric GISTs has been proven but for tumors less than 2 cm. However, with gain of experience and skill in laparoscopic surgery, many surgeons have reported a safety \& feasibility excision of tumors greater than 5 cm. Our current study demonstrates the oncologic safety of the laparoscopic approach even with tumour size range up to 12cm, with efficacy and recurrence rates similar or superior to historical open surgical controls, however, it requires considerable expertise for safe manipulation of the tumour. All these resections were accomplished with minimal morbidity, no perioperative mortality, and short post-operative stay and comparable long term oncological outcomes.
