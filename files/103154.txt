Comparison Study of Different Tumor Biopsy Method for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a mainstay surgery method in breast cance, and the identified number of sentinel lymph nodes determines its accuracy for axillary status. Retrospective study indicated that preoperative tumor biopsy results in more detected sentinel lymoh nodes. The clinical trail is designed to compare the effect of three tumor biopsy methods (preoperative vacuum-assisted biopsy, core needle biopsy, and intraoperative excisional biopsy) for sentinel lymph nodes.

Identification rates of sentinel lymph node biopsy, Identification rate of SLNB between three groups, 1 year
Identification numbers of sentinel lymph node biopsy, Identification numbers of SLNB between three groups, 1 year|fase-negative rates of sentinel lymph node biopsy, fase-negative rates of SLNB between three groups, 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

Compare the identification rate of sentinel lymph node in breast cancer patients with different tumor biopsy methods.

Evaluate the false-negative rates of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with different tumor biopsy methods.

OUTLINE:

The patients were randomly divided into three group, vacuum-assisted biopsy, core needle biopsy, and intraoperative excisional biopsy. Preoperative vacuum-assisted biopsy and core needle biopsy were performed in 10 days before the final surgery. All patients received dual tracer (radiolabeled colloid and blue dye) guided SLNB.
