Phase II Study of IRD (Ixazomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone) Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Followed by Maintenance Ixazomib or Lenalidomide for Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a treatment regimen called IRD which will be given to participants after their stem cell transplant in an effort to help prolong the amount of time the participants are disease-free after transplant. IRD is a three-drug regimen consisting of ixazomib, lenalidomide (also called Revlimid), and dexamethasone. After 4 cycles of IRD, the participants will be randomized to receive maintenance therapy either with ixazomib or lenalidomide.

Response includes stringent complete response (sCR) and complete response (CR).
* sCR requires all of the following:

  * CR as defined below
  * Normal free light chain ratio (0.26-1.65)
  * Absence of clonal cells in the bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence
* CR requires all of the following:

  * Disappearance of monoclonal protein by both protein electrophoresis and immunofixation studies from the blood and urine
  * If serum and urine monoclonal protein are unmeasurable, Normal free light chain ratio (0.26-1.65)
  * \<5% plasma cells in the bone marrow
  * Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytoma, Through completion of maintenance treatment (estimated to be day 1095 of maintenance treatment)|Compare Progression-free Survival Between the Two Maintenance Arms, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from ASCT to progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first, and those event-free survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout., Up to 18 months after completion of maintenance therapy (Up to 5 years after starting the study)|Compare Overall Survival Between the Two Maintenance Arms, Overall survival (OS) will be defined as time from ASCT to death due to any causes, and survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout., Up to 18 months after completion of maintenance therapy (Up to 5 years after starting the study)|Rate of MRD-positive to MRD-negative Conversion Between the Two Maintenance Arms, Cycle 13 Day 1 of maintenance treatment (Approximately Day 364 of maintenance treatment)|Association of Progression-free Survival With MRD-negativity, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from ASCT to progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first, and those event-free survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout., Up to 18 months after completion of maintenance therapy (Up to 5 years after starting the study)|Association of Progression-free Survival With MRD-positivity, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from ASCT to progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first, and those event-free survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout., Up to 18 months after completion of maintenance therapy (Up to 5 years after starting the study)|Association of Overall Survival With MRD-negativity, Overall survival (OS) will be defined as time from ASCT to death due to any causes, and survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout., Up to 18 months after completion of maintenance therapy (Up to 5 years after starting the study)|Association of Overall Survival With MRD-positivity, Overall survival (OS) will be defined as time from ASCT to death due to any causes, and survivors will be censored at withdrawal or study closeout., Up to 18 months after completion of maintenance therapy (Up to 5 years after starting the study)
Based on the further need to improve progression-free survival and overall survival post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma and the benefits seen of consolidation/maintenance treatment with immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the natural next step is to evaluate combination regimens of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors as consolidation/maintenance post-ASCT. The regimen consisting of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRD) has been shown to have low toxicity, and the availability of an oral formulation of ixazomib allows for easier administration when compared to bortezomib.

In this study, following consolidation with IRD, patients will be randomized to maintenance therapy with lenalidomide or ixazomib in order to collect pilot data comparing the toxicity and efficacy of maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors.

09/23/2019: Upon review of the interim analysis, there will be no further randomizations into the maintenance portion of the trial. All patients will be enrolled into the lenalidomide arm with the exception of those who discontinue lenalidomide during the consolidation phase due to toxicity. Patients who discontinue lenalidomide may be enrolled into the ixazomib arm following approval from the principal investigator.

09/30/2021: Following analysis 4 in 2021, analysis of the primary endpoint, all patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance will be transitioned off-study. Patients receiving ixazomib may remain on trial until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at the discretion of the treating physician and the site principal investigator.
