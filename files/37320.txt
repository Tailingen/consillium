A Study on the Correlation Between Tarceva (Erlotinib) - Induced Rash and Efficacy in EGFR Mutated Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Therapy
This open-label, single arm study will assess the correlation between Tarceva (erlotinib)-induced rash and efficacy in participants with inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving first-line therapy for advanced disease. Participants will receive Tarceva at a dose of 150 mg daily orally, with dose adjustments according to protocol depending on toxicity. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal due to any reason.
Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: erlotinib [Tarceva]
Progression-free Survival (PFS) According to Grade of Rash, PFS was defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression according to revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 or the date of death for any reason in the absence of progressive disease (PD). Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions., Day 1 of treatment period until disease progression or death (approximately up to 67 months)
Percentage of Participants With Erlotinib Dose Reductions Due to Rash Grade 3-4, Day 1 of treatment period until disease progression or death (approximately up to 67 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Participants With Erlotinib Dose Reductions Due to Rash Grade 3-4, PFS was defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression according to revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 or the date of death for any reason in the absence of progressive disease (PD).
