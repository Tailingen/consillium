Study of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Women Who Have HER2-Positive Breast Cancer With Mild Cardiotoxicity
The purpose of this study is to find out how much oxygen is used during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in women who have mild cardiotoxicity after standard treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, and to see whether the results of this test can be used to predict how well participants' heart and lungs will work if they continue to receive this kind of treatment.
