Prospective Sinonasal Cancer Multi-institution Study
This is a multi-institution prospective study of patients with sinonasal malignancies. The goal of this study is to learn more about the course of sinonasal cancer, treatment outcomes, and patient quality of life. In addition, central mutational and genomic analysis of tumor tissue will be evaluated.
