Two Regimens of SAR240550/Weekly Paclitaxel and Paclitaxel Alone as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
Primary Objective:

- to assess the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate in the breast of patients treated in following combinations: SAR240550 twice-weekly + weekly paclitaxel, SAR240550 weekly+ weekly paclitaxel, and weekly paclitaxel single agent as calibrator.

Secondary objectives are:

* pCR rate in the breast and axilla,
* Radiological/clinical objective response rate (ORR), breast conservation rate, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), in each treatment arm,
* Safety profiles of study combinations and of the single agent reference treatment,
* Molecular characteristics of the tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and any correlation between the biological activity of the study treatment and the disease outcome.

Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.
Breast Cancer Female
DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: Iniparib (SAR2405550 -BSI-201)
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate defined as the complete absence of invasive carcinoma on histological examination of the breast at the time of definitive surgery and confirmed by blinded centralized review, at the time of definitive surgery
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate in the breast and axilla, at the time of definitive surgery|Objective Response Rate(ORR) defined in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as complete response rate + partial response rate, at the time of definitive surgery|Breast conservation rate, at the time of definitive surgery|Disease Free Survival rate (DFS), up to a maximum of 5 years after definitive surgery|Overall Survival (OS), up to a maximum of 5 years after definitive surgery|Safety parameters (number of patients AE, SAE or AEPM), up to a maximum of 5 years after definitive surgery|Molecular-biological testing, 2 or 3 timepoints during treatment period
Active study treatment will be given either as twice weekly administration (Day 1 and Day 4) or as weekly administration (Day 1) for a maximum of 24 infusions for Arm A and for a maximum of 12 infusions for Arm B. In all study arms, treatment will be given until definitive surgery, the first sign of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.

Definitive surgery will be performed within 2 to 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.

Patients who complete all the study treatment or who withdraw consent or experience intolerable toxicity will undergo surgery according to local practices.

The cut-off date for the primary analyses will be 30 days after the last study treatment administration or the date of the definitive surgery, whichever comes last.

The maximum follow up for each individual patient will be until death or 5 years after the definitive surgery date whatever happens first.
