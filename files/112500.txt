PET Response During Chemoradiation of Lung Cancer
A prospective observational study to determine the prognostic value of the timing of 50% reduction in metabolic activity (T50) during CCRT for NSCLC for treatment outcome (PFS).
NSCLC
OTHER: Low dose FDG PET/CT 5 x.
maximum FDG uptake (SUVmax), • A main study parameter is the maximum FDG uptake (SUVmax (maximum Standardized Uptake Value)) at the location of the primary tumour, as determined at multiple days during treatment (with a maximum of five time points per patient), expressed as T50 for response evaluation., 1 Year
SUVmax during the first two weeks of treatment, indicating inflammatory response., • Increase SUVmax during the first two weeks of treatment, indicating inflammatory response., First Two weeks of treatment|SUVmax in the two weeks prior to treatment, indicating progression, • Increase SUVmax between diagnostic imaging and start of treatment, indicating potential progression., Two weeks prior to treatment|Progression free survival, • Secondary study endpoint is progression free survival, to be associated with T50 for prognostic value., 1 Year
This is a single-centre observational study. Patients with proven locally advanced NSCLC will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy according to the standard clinical protocol of the NKI-AVL. During treatment, the biological behaviour of the tumour will be monitored with serial quantitative FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT scans. From these images, the time during treatment where a 50% reduction in FDG uptake relative to day 1 is reached (T50) will be derived. The T50 of progression-free surviving patients will be compared with that of relapsed or deceased patients, in order to find a value that predicts early treatment failure. An additional FDG PET/CT scan at the same day as regular follow up CT scan will be made, two months after treatment, to have a baseline after treatment for follow up.
