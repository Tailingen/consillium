Effect of Chemotherapy on TMB in NSCLC
Tumor mutation burden is identified as an important biomarkers for predicting PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Several previous clinical trials have demonstrated that chemotherapy could enhance the efficacy of PD-1/L1 immunotherapy in NSCLC such as Checkmate-227, Impower-150, Keynote-189, etc. Pre-clincial experiment shows that chemotherapy could increase CD8 TIL infiltration in tumor microenvironment, activate T cell immune reaction. However, it remains unclear whether chemotherapy could affect tumor mutation burden in advanced NSCLC patients. The present study aims to evaluate whether tumor mutation burden will change after receiving chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients.
