Lesion-to-lesion Comparison of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE, 18F-DOPA, and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the Evaluation of Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
This study is a single centre non-randomized non-blinded phase II prospective cohort study including 50 participants. The objective of this study is to directly compare 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE, 18F-DOPA, and 18F-FDG activity in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) on a lesion-by-lesion basis. The investigators will determine the prevalence of concordant versus discordant disease. Secondary objectives include assessing the standardized uptake value (SUV) and determining if there is any correlation between discordance and disease progression.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-DOPA with furosemide
Lesion-to-lesion comparison of activity on 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE, 18F-DOPA, and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans, Participants will be categorized as having concordant disease (all lesions 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE avid) or discordant disease (one or more lesions not 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE avid)., Within 1 year after completion of both 18F-DOPA and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans
SUV of lesions on 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE, 18F-DOPA, and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans, SUVmax of all lesions on all scans will be recorded and compared to SUVmean of the liver and blood pool, Within 1 year after completion of both 18F-DOPA and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans|Assessment of disease progression - 12 months, All available clinical information will be reviewed 12 months after completion of the PET/CT scans with expert determination of treatment response, no treatment response, or disease progression, 12 months after completion of the 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE, 18F-FDG, and investigational 18F-DOPA PET/CT scans|Assessment of disease progression - 18 months, All available clinical information will be reviewed at 18 months after completion of the PET/CT scans with expert determination of treatment response, no treatment response, or disease progression, 18 months after completion of the 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE, 18F-FDG, and investigational 18F-DOPA PET/CT scans
