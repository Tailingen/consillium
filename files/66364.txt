SRS Timing With Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Patients With Untreated Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial is a randomized, 2-arm, phase II study to determine the effect, if any, of the timing of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) relative to immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO) therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread (metastasized) to the brain.
Brain Metastases|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgery|DRUG: Immunotherapy
Intracranial progression free-survival, Defined as defined as time to intracranial progression from randomization measured by by RANO-BM criteria for radiographic progression on contrast-enhanced brain MRI, from randomization through study completion, an average of 3 years
Assess quality of life in each arm by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain questionnaire, as measured on a 5 point Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) through 4 (very much) where the higher score reflects better quality of life, 1 year|Assess neurocognitive outcome in each arm by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised, as measured by recall scores with higher values indicating better outcomes, 1 year|Assess neurocognitive outcome in each arm by the Trail Making Test Parts A and B, scored as average or deficient based on time to complete the activity, 1 year|Assess neurocognitive outcome in each arm by the Controlled Oral Word Association test, scored as the number of words completed in one minute, with higher score indicating better outcome, 1 year
