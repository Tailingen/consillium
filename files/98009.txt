A Study of CCI-001 in Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Solid Tumours
CCI-001 is a novel colchicine derivative that is being developed by PharmaMatrix Holdings Ltd. (PharmaMatrix). The drug binds to tubulin, a component of the microtubule polymers which are required for a wide range of cellular processes, perhaps most importantly, cell division and mitosis. CCI-001 has been shown to bind more strongly to β-III tubulin, a tubulin subtype which is overexpressed in many cancers.

This trial is being undertaken as a first-in-human, Phase I trial in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumours. Primary Objectives are to examine the compound's safety profile, and to determine the recommended dose. Secondary Objectives are to determine the compound's pharmacokinetic parameters and to evaluate the clinical response rate and survival. Expansion cohorts in in tumour types known to be sensitive to other approved agents with similar mechanism of action will be treated at the recommended dose: transitional cell bladder cancer, pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas, gynecologic cancers (ovarian, cervical, endometrial), and lung adenocarcinoma.
Cancer: Recurrent and/or Metastatic Solid Tumours
DRUG: CCI-001
To assess the safety and tolerability of intravenously infused CCI-001 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumours by determining the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the compound., DLT in this study will be determined against a pre-defined set of criteria based on the NCI-CTCAE v. 5.0 grading system., Cycle 1 (28 days)|To determine, during the dose escalation phase, the recommended dose of intravenously infused CCI-001 for the dose expansion phase of the trial., The recommended dose will be the dose level below that for the cohort in which maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached/exceeded. MTD will have been reached when 2 or more patients in a cohort experience DLT., Cycle 1 (28 days)
To evaluate the clinical response rate in patients treated with CCI-001 with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumours, with particular attention to those in expansion cohorts, All patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria will be utilized to determine response based on CT and/or MRI scans., Patients will have a baseline scan prior to dosing, and re-evaluated with imaging every 8 weeks. To continue from baseline scan to first documented date of disease progression, or date of death from any cause, to a maximum of 36 months.|To evaluate survival in patients treated with CCI-001 with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumours, with particular attention to those in expansion cohorts, Descriptive statistics will be utilized to evaluate patient survival., Start of treatment period (Cycle 1, Day1) to 30 days past the last treatment. Each Cycle is 28 days.|To determine the time to maximum plasma level (Tmax) of CCI-001 administered intravenously., Tmax is the time at which the maximum plasma CCI-001 concentration is achieved., Measured on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Each cycle is 28 days)|To determine the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of CCI-001 administered intravenously., Cmax is the maximum plasma CCI-001 concentration that is achieved post administration., Measured on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Each cycle is 28 days)|To determine the area under the curve (AUC) of CCI-001 administered intravenously., AUC is the measure of total CCI-001 exposure after administration., Measured on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Each cycle is 28 days)|To determine the terminal half life (t1/2) of CCI-001 administered intravenously., t1/2 is the measure of the time it takes CCI-001 plasma concentration to decrease by 50%, after administration., Measured on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Each cycle is 28 days)
