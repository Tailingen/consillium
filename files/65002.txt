Construction of Diagnosis and Treatment System for Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma
This study intends to apply for the establishment of research beds, establish a Chinese PVRL research cohort, and carry out a to achieve the following research objectives:

The goal of this prospective observational study is to construct the diagnosis and treatment system for primary vitreoretinal lymphoma（PVRL）. The study is to achieve the following research objectives:

1. To establish a comprehensive diagnostic criteria for PVRL with high diagnostic efficiency and strengthen the PVRL diagnostic system;
2. To establish a standardized treatment pathway for PVRL and evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment;
3. To screen the prognosis evaluation indicators, and to establish the follow-up process and prognosis evaluation system of PVRL；
4. To explore the pathogenesis of PVRL, specific tumor markers and drug therapeutic targets.
