First-in-Human Safety, Tolerability and Antitumour Activity Study of MTL-CEBPA in Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer
MNA-3521-011 study is a multi-centre, open-label, first-in-human, phase 1a/b clinical study dose/dose frequency escalation followed by a cohort expansion part. MTL-CEBPA is administered as monotherapy or in combination with sorafenib to patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis of the liver. All participants will be considered unsuitable for liver tumour resection and/or is refractory to radiotherapy and other loco-regional therapies.

MTL-CEBPA consists of a double stranded RNA formulated into a SMARTICLES® liposomal nanoparticle and is designed to activate the CEBPA gene.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Cancer
DRUG: MTL-CEBPA|DRUG: Sorafenib 200mg
Part 1- Incidence of Grade 3 or 4 drug related adverse events, Frequency of adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, During cycle 1 (28 days) of treatment assessed over 15 months|Part 2 - Change in tumour size from baseline using RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST in patients treated with MTL-CEBPA in combination with sorafenib, Increase or decrease in tumour measurement using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) reports, Eight weekly intervals until death assessed for 100 weeks
Part 2 - Safety and tolerability of co-administering MTL-CEBPA with sorafenib assessed using frequency of adverse events graded according to toxicity criteria (NCI CTCAE v 5.0) and categorised by body system, Frequency of treatment-related adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, At the end of every cycle (28 days) of treatment assessed over 15 months
