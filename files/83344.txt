Patient-derived Xenograft Models of Tumor From Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The investigators want to have a collection of fresh primary or recurrent tumor tissue for establishment of patients-derived xenografts in order to:

generate a biobank of in vivo patient xenografts representing the different subgroups of tumors for head and neck cancer

* perform genetic and transcriptional profiling of the primary, metastatic tumors and xenograft tumors
* evaluate the efficacy of new targeted agents, whether or not in combination with standard treatment options
* evaluate biomarkers of drug sensitivity
* study primary and secondary (acquired) resistance in these models

PROCEDURE: Local biopsy in the tumor
