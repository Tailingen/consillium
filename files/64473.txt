Exploratory Study of EBV DNA Titre Clearance Whilst on Proton Beam Therapy
How does plasma Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA level change during definitive radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the teenage and young adult cohort and does it correlate with outcomes?
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Head and Neck Cancer|Nasopharyngeal Cancer|Epstein-Barr Virus
Plasma EBV during proton beam RT, Taken weekly, prior to each session of chemotherapy. Change in plasma EBV DNA levels (EBV VCA-IgM Ab) from each blood sample time point., 6 weeks
EBV and tumour correlates, Taken weekly, prior to each session of chemotherapy. Change in plasma EBV DNA levels (EBV VCA-IgM Ab) from each blood sample. Assessment whether EBV plasma clearance predicts tumour response., 2 years
Children with NPC achieve superior survival outcomes compared to adults (10) and the prognostic value of plasma Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA has not been studied in children. Integration of MRI into early treatment response assessment will add further prognostic value and permits response-adapted therapy which can improve quality of survivorship children through toxicity reduction. It also allows identification of patients who either have had or are likely to have a suboptimal response to treatment, facilitating the potential consideration of treatment escalation.

The sample size of this study is not intended to change clinical practice, but rather provide a basis for international collaboration to achieve larger patient numbers.
