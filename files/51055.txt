DRUG: Association of berzosertib with gemcitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Assessment of the antitumor activity of berzosertib combined with gemcitabine, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-month progression-free rate and is defined as the rate of complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD), as per RECIST v1.1., 6 months|Assessment of the antitumor activity of gemcitabine, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-month progression-free rate and is defined as the rate of complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD), as per RECIST v1.1., 6 months
6-month objective response rate (ORR) for patients treated by berzosertib in association with gemcitabine, Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per adapted RECIST v1.1., 6 months|6-month objective response rate (ORR) for patients treated by gemcitabine alone, Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per adapted RECIST v1.1., 6 months|Best overall response for patients treated by berzosertib in association with gemcitabine, Best overall response is defined as the best reponse across all time points (RECIST v1.1). The best overall response rate is determined once all the data for the patient is known, throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|Best overall response for patients treated by gemcitabine alone, Best overall response is defined as the best reponse across all time points (RECIST v1.1). The best overall response rate is determined once all the data for the patient is known, throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|1-year progression-free survival for patients treated by berzosertib in association with gemcitabine, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 1 year|1-year progression-free survival for patients treated by gemcitabine alone, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 1 year|2-year progression-free survival for patients treated by berzosertib in association with gemcitabine, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 2 years|2-year progression-free survival for patients treated by gemcitabine alone, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 2 years|1-year overall survival for patients treated by berzosertib in association with gemcitabine, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (from any cause), 1 year|1-year overall survival for patients treated by gemcitabine alone, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (from any cause), 1 year|2-year overall survival for patients treated by berzosertib in association with gemcitabine, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (from any cause), 2 years|2-year overall survival for patients treated by gemcitabine alone, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (from any cause), 2 years|6-month objective response according to CHOI criteria, independently for each arm, Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per CHOI criteria., 6 months|Best overall response according to CHOI criteria, independently for each arm, Best overall response is defined as the best reponse across all time points (CHOI criteria). The best overall response rate is determined once all the data for the patient is known, throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|Safety profile independently for each arm: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 5, Toxicity graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5, throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|Tumor immune cells levels, Levels of immune cells (CD4, CD8, PDL1)in tumor will be measured by immunohistochemistry, before treatment onset and cycle 2 day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood cytokines levels, Levels of cytokines (tryptophane, interleukine) in blood will be measured by ELISA, baseline, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 6 day 1 and progression (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood lymphocytes levels, Levels of fixed PBMC (peripheral blood mononucear cells) in blood will be measured by flow cytometry, baseline, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 6 day 1 and progression (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood kynurenine levels, Levels of kynurenine in blood will be measured by ELISA, baseline, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 6 day 1 and progression (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, 2-arm, non-comparative randomized (2:1) phase II trial. Patients will be randomized between arm A (gemcitabine + berzosertib) and arm B (gemcitabine) with two patients randomized in arm A for one patient randomized in arm B.
