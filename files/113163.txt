Neoadjuvant Camrelizumab, Nab-paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC
This prospective, single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial enrolled 40 patients who underwent surgery after three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy with camrelizumab, nab-paclitaxel, and carboplatin. The MPR is the primary endpoint, and the pCR, the complete resection rate, the objective response rate, the disease-free survival, adverse events, and quality of life are the secondary endpoints. The exploratory endpoints will be used to establish a multiomics artificial intelligence system for neoadjuvant therapy effect prediction and decision-making assistance based on radiomics, metabolism, genetic, and clinic-pathological characteristics and to explore drug resistance mechanisms.

DRUG: Camrelizumab + Nab-paclitaxel + Carboplatin
Major pathologic response (MPR) Rate, MPR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having ≤10% viable tumor cells in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy., After surgery (approximately 10 weeks)
Evaluation of the pathological complete response (pCR), pCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having an absence of residual invasive cancer in resected lung specimens and lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy., After surgery (approximately 10 weeks)|Evaluation of complete resection (R0) rate, Proportion of patients with no residual resection margin under the microscope after tumor resection, After surgery (approximately 10 weeks)|Disease free survival (DFS), From the date of surgery to any of the following events: disease progression, disease recurrence or death from any cause., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), From the date of participated in study to the date of death., 36 months|Objective response rate(ORR), The proportion of patients achieved complete or patial remission(Imageological) according to RECIST 1.1 prior to definitive surgery, approximately 9 weeks|Adverse events (AEs), The number of participants experiencing an AE will be assessed.An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy can be determined, approximately 9 weeks|Serious adverse events (SAEs), The number of participants experiencing an serious AE will be assessed, approximately 9 weeks|Qol Quality of Life, Quality of life asscesed by Quality of Life Questionnare-Core 30(EORTC QLQ-C30）of The European O-rganization for Reasearch and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L), 36 months
