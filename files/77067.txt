Evaluation of the Interest to Combine a CD4 Th1-inducer Cancer Vaccine Derived from Telomerase and Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The TERTIO trial will propose to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine (UCPVax) with anti-PD-L1 therapy (atezolizumab) and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC by evaluation of the objective response rate at 6 months (randomized phase II, 10 centers, 105 patients)
