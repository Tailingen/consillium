This Phase II clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Enhertu in HER-2 positive mCRPC who have progressed on prior androgen deprivation therapy and novel hormonal agents, who are either not candidates for or have refused taxane based chemotherapy.

Primary endpoints focus on objective response rates, while secondary measures include safety, progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality of life.
