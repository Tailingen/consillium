Can HER2 Targeted PET/CT Imaging Identify Unsuspected HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Metastases, Which Are Amenable to HER2 Targeted Therapy?
Some breast cancer cells make a protein called Human Epidermal Growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Patients with HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer receive medicine that attacks HER2, which helps these patients live longer. Some HER2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer patients also benefit from medicines that attack HER2, but we do not know why or which patients will benefit. This study uses a new imaging method, HER2-targeted PET/CT, to identify patients that may benefit from medicines that attack HER2. This is experimental.
Breast Cancer Metastases|HER2 Positive Breast
RADIATION: 89Zr-trastuzumab|DEVICE: PET/CT scan|RADIATION: 89Zr-pertuzumab
Percentage of Patients With HER2- Primary Breast Cancer Who Develop Imagable HER2+ Metastases, Both SUVmax and SUVpeak will be recorded for lesions, and SUVmax and SUVaverage will be recorded for background measurements. Only those foci qualitatively scored conspicuously positive by both readers (scores of 4 or 5) will be considered as "positive"., 3 years
