Effects of Topical Sesame Oil in the Prevention of Peripheral Venous Catheter Phlebitis: Clinical Trial.
Cancer is a disease that, despite having a higher cure rate, is currently on the rise, with an increase in the number of diagnoses.

For the treatment of these patients a venous access is required, which in the first treatments is of peripheral insertion. These peripheral venous catheter in combination with the highly aggressive treatments for the veins are the cause of the appearance of chemical phlebitis.

Phlebitis is an inflammation caused by a combination of factors, whether chemical, perfusion of irritating medication; mechanical, due to the puncture site, type and fixation of the catheter and infectious, caused by the colonization of pathogenic agents whose origin is the skin and that migrate inward.

Phlebitis involves an injury to the wall of the vein, and consequently, the patient will also be at risk of thrombus formation, which in turn leads to thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

The existence of phlebitis involves intense and constant pain, with increased sensitivity and a sensation of heat and swelling.

With the use of topical sesame oil, and thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, the investigators intend to study whether it is effective in preventing the appearance of phlebitis.
