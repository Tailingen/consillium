Use of Mucolytic Solution Before Upper Endoscopy
The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the maximum dose of mucolytic solution used before upper endoscopy on the visibility of the gastric mucosa

Visibility score" evaluated by blinded performing endoscopist, Visibility score" (0-25 points) counted as the sum of visibility score in the esophagus (0-5), fundus (0-5), corpus (0-5) and atrum (0-5) of the stomach and in the duodenum (0-5)., through study completion, an average of 5 months
Visibility score" evaluated by two blinded endoscopists using 10 endoscopic images captured during endoscopy, "Visibility score" (0-25 points) counted as the sum of visibility score in the esophagus (0-5), fundus (0-5), corpus (0-5) and atrum (0-5) of the stomach and in the duodenum (0-5)., through study completion, an average of 5 months
Residual fluid in the stomach evaluated by blinded performing endoscopist, 0-3 point scale, through study completion, an average of 5 months|Duration of endoscopy, time between introduction and withdrawal of the endoscopy, through study completion, an average of 5 months
Residual gastric content containing mucus, bubbles, bile and food particles may limit visibility of gastric mucosa and therefore diagnostic yield of upper endoscopy, especially in cases of early neoplastic lesions. Data on benefit of peroral mucolytic solution administered before upper endoscopy are limited.
