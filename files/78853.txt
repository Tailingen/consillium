This study is intended to observe the therapeutic effect of dydrogesterone on endometrial polyps and provide a reference for clinical treatment.

Regression rate of endometrial polyps, No evidence of polyps or the maximum dimensions of polyps are reduced by 1/3 or more under pelvic ultrasound, three months after the starting of treatment|Relapse rate of endometrial polyps, Evidence of polyps or the maximum dimensions of polyps are larger during the follow-up of the regression group after treatment, six months after the starting of treatment

Endometrial polyps are a common female endometrial lesion.The long-term unrestrained exposure of estrogen to local tissue is one of the causes of polyp formation.Studies suggested that the progesterone can accelerate the regression rate of endometrial polyps due to its antiestrogenic effects.Based on this, investigators intended to observe the therapeutic effect of dydrogesterone on endometrial polyps and provide a reference for clinical treatment.
