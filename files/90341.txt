The Influence of Perioperative Administration of Dexmedetomidine on Inflammation Response and Postoperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) Cytoreductive Surgery; Double Blind Randomized Controlled Trial
Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been reported to be an effective treatment approach for peritoneal cancer, however, the stress response to HIPEC is major neuroendocrine and cytokine response, which has been considered as the homeostatic defense mechanism. Recently, dexmedetomidine has been suggested to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine on inflammation response and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) cytoreductive surgery.

DRUG: dexmedetomidine|DRUG: Normal saline
IL-6 level, To evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the level of IL-6 in patient undergoing HIPEC, IL-6 level was measured up to 12 hours after surgery., Up to 12 hours after surgery
recurrence rate, To evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the recurrence rate up to 1 year after surgery were collected., up to 1 year after surgery
