A Study to Determine How BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) is Taken up in the Tumor (Phase 0) and to Determine the Highest Dose of BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) That Could be Tolerated (Phase 1a) in Combination With Radiation Therapy in People With a Brain Tumor Called Glioblastoma
This study is open to adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor. The study has two parts. Part 1 is open to people who can get their brain tumor removed by surgery. Part 2 is open to people who already had such a brain surgery.

This study tests a medicine called BI 907828 (Brigimadlin). BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) is a socalled MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer.

The purpose of Part 1 of the study is to find out how BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) is taken up in the tumor. Participants take a single dose of BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) as a tablet before the brain surgery. Part 1 of the study takes about 1 month. During this time, participants have their brain tumor removed by surgery and visit the study site about 8 times.

The purpose of Part 2 is to find the highest dose of BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) that the participants can tolerate in combination with standard radiation therapy. During the first 6 weeks, participants get standard radiation therapy. In addition, they take a dose of BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) once every 3 weeks. Participants may continue to take BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. They visit the study site regularly.

During the entire study, doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.
Glioblastoma
