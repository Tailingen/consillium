Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment Following Treatment in Participants With HER2 alterations Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Percentage of Participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 24 months (data cut-off)
Disease control rate (DCR) Following Treatment in Participants With HER2 alterations Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or standard disease (SD) as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 24 months (data cut-off)|Progression-free survival (PFS) Following Treatment in Participants With HER2 alterations Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Defined as time from randomization until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, or death due to any cause., Up to 24 months (data cut-off)|Duration of Response (DoR) Following Treatment in Participants With HER2 alterations Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression as assessed by investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months (data cut-off)|Overall Survival (OS) Following Treatment in Participants With HER2 alterations Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Defined as time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to 24 months (data cut-off)
This study will explore the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with HER2 mutation, amplification, or HER2 mutation (mutation, amplification, protein over-expression) using Disitamab Vedotin（RC48） combined with Tislelizumab or third-generation EGFR-TKI Furmonertinib, in the aim of providing new treatment strategies for lung cancer patients with HER2 pathway activation.
