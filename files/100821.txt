ATRA, Celecoxib, and Itraconazole as Maintenance
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability associated with the combination of ATRA/celecoxib/itraconazole as maintenance therapy given after an autologous stem cell transplant in relapsed multiple myeloma patients.
Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ATRA|DRUG: Celecoxib|DRUG: Itraconazole
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, 6 months
Blood and Bone Marrow Aspirate Samples as a measure of changes to the MMSC (multiple myeloma stem cell) fraction., 6 months
Primary objective:

To evaluate safety and tolerability associated with the combination of ATRA/ celecoxib/itraconazole given after a salvage transplant for relapsed myeloma in 25 patients in a cycle schedule consisting of three weeks of treatment followed by a rest period of two weeks for a total of five cycles. Subjects will be evaluable only if they have received at least one dose of maintenance treatment. The salvage transplant is not part of this study.

Secondary objective:

To explore changes in frequency and molecular signature in the multiple myeloma stem cell (MMSC) fraction based on flow-cytometric assays and gene expression profiling before and after the experimental treatment and to correlate outcome with expression levels of RARÎ±2 at time of relapse.
