Radiotherapy Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor and GM-CSF for Advanced Recurrent Metastatic Head and Neck Tumors
This is an intervention study, aiming to use high and low dose radiotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor combined with GM-CSF to observe the effect of anti-tumor immunity and long-term therapeutic response rate, and to explore a new treatment model for patients with advanced solid tumors.
