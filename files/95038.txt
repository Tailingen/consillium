Study of SD-101 in Combination With Localized Low-dose Radiation in Patients With Untreated Low-grade B-cell Lymphoma
To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SD-101 in combination with localized low-dose radiation therapy in adult subjects with untreated low-grade B-cell lymphoma.
