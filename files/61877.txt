Evaluation of the Correlation Between Molecular Phenotype and Radiological Signature (by PET-scanner and MRI) of Incident WHO II and III Grade Gliomas.
From the medical records of a series of patients operated on for incident grade II and III glioma, the primary objective is to evaluate the correlation between the molecular profile of tumours and preoperative imaging data (by FDG and FDOPA PET-scan and multimodal MRI).
