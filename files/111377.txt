Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Prevention of Colorectal Anastomotic Leakage
This is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter trial to determine the difference in post-operative anastomotic leakages in colorectal surgery, where anastomosis perfusion is evaluated using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging as an addition to standard surgical practice compared to surgical practice alone.
