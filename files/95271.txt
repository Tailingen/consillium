A Study of Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy Compared to Cetuximab Plus Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer.
The primary endpoint in this study is to investigate if there is a difference in overall survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, randomized to either radiotherapy and cetuximab or radiotherapy and cisplatin. A second randomization is performed in patients with T3-T4 tumors; allocated radiotherapy either 68.0 Gy or 73.1 Gy.
