The purpose of this study is to develop and pre-test an eHealth group intervention for young adult cancer survivors.
Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management and Health Education
Acceptability of the adapted intervention, Participants will report their satisfaction with individual sessions through brief weekly surveys., Over the course of the 10-week intervention, beginning with the first weekly session through the tenth weekly session|Acceptability of the adapted intervention, The number of sessions attended, out of a maximum of 10, will be tracked., Over the course of the 10-week intervention, beginning with the first weekly session through the tenth weekly session|Acceptability of the adapted intervention, Immediately after the intervention participants will report their satisfaction with the full program through a brief survey., Immediately after the intervention
Change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete the 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General. Scores range from 0 to 108, with higher scores reflecting better quality of life., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Change in symptom burden from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete a modified version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, which assesses 10 common cancer-related symptoms each on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate greater symptom burden., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Change in cancer-related distress from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Scores range from 0 to 88, with higher scores indicating greater cancer-related distress., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Change in stress management skills self-efficacy from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete subscales from the Measure of Current Status. Subscale scores range from 0 to 8, 0 to 12, or 0 to 20 depending on the subscale. Higher scores indicate more of the construct being assessed., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Change in coping from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced scale, which yields 14 two-item subscales. Subscale scores range from 2 to 8, with higher scores indicating greater usage of the coping strategy being assessed., Baseline and immediately after the intervention
In the first part of this study, the investigators adapted an evidence-based intervention for improving HRQOL to better meet the needs of young adult cancer survivors, and then conducted focus groups with young adult cancer survivors to get feedback on the adapted intervention. In the second part of the study, the investigators will conduct a single-arm pilot trial in which the adapted intervention will be delivered over videoconference via weekly group meetings with a trained facilitator over the course of 10 weeks.
