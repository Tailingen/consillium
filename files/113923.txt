A Placebo-controlled Phase II Study of Bone-targeted Radium-223 in Symptomatic Hormone-refractory Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational radioisotope Radium-223 in treatment of men with prostate cancer and bone metastases that no longer respond to hormonal treatment.
Prostate Cancer|Neoplasm Metastasis
DRUG: Radium-223 dichloride (BAY88-8223)|DRUG: Saline
Time to occurrence of Skeletal-related Events (SRE), SREs are defined as: Increase in pain severity index during the last week; Increase in analgesic consumption; Neurological symptoms secondary to skeletal manifestations of prostate cancer; New pathologic bone fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral); Tumour related orthopaedic surgical intervention; Subsequent external beam radiation to relieve skeletal pain; Use of radioisotopes to relieve new skeletal related symptoms; Use of corticosteroids for skeletal pain, at doses aimed for pain palliation; Use of chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, or hormones, for the treatment of skeletal disease progression, Up to 12 Month|Relative change (%) in bone-ALP levels from baseline to 4 weeks after last injection, Up to 12 Month
Number of SREs per patient, Up to 12 Month|Changes in the levels of biochemical markers of bone formation, Up to 12 Month|Change in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), Up to 12 Month|Change in pain level, Up to 12 Month|Changes in analgesic use during study period, Up to 12 Month|Changes in Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) from baseline, Up to 12 Month|Overall survival, up to 24 months|Adverse events, up to 24 months|Clinical laboratory tests including haematology, renal and liver function parameters, up to 24 months
Primary objective:

To study the biological effectiveness of radium-223 therapy measured as:

* Time to occurrence of skeletal-related events(SREs)
* Change in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone-ALP) levels

Secondary objectives:

To study the efficacy of radium-223 therapy in terms of:

* Frequency of new SREs
* Proportions of patients with an SRE
* Proportions of patients with SRE at different time points
* Changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover
* Treatment response with regard to pain and analgesic use(termed "Palliative effect" in study protocol)
* Quality of life assessment
* Overall survival To study the safety of the repeated radium-223 regimen Total Enrollment:64 Study start: February 2004
