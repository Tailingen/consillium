Chemotherapy Options for the First Line Chemotherapy in Elderly Patient With Advanced Gastric Cancer
The investigators compare the overall survival between combination chemotherapy and monochemotherapy as a first-line chemotherapy in elderly patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer. The investigators also compare the progression free survival, response rate, safety, and, quality of life between two groups, and evaluate that the comprehensive geriatric assessment tested at baseline can predict the toxicity and compliance of treatment, survival of the patients.

comprehensive geriatric assessment, The investigators are going to evaluate that comprehensive geriatric assessment tested at baseline can predict the toxicity and compliance to treatment, survival of patients.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment will not necessarily be tested in all subjects, but instead, screening tool (KG-7 (Korean screening tool for the elderly)) will be tested in all subjects., baseline
