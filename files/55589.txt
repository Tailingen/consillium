Assessing the Value of a Dosage of Anti-cetuximab in the Therapeutic Management of Patients With Colon Cancer or Upper Aero-digestive Tract and Candidates for Treatment With Cetuximab
The main objective of this study is to validate the utility of IgE anti-cetuximab in the treatment strategy to identify patients at risk for a severe allergic reaction to cetuximab (grade 3 or 4 of the classification of NCI) and thus reduce the incidence of severe reactions.

Validate the utility of an IgE anti-cetuximab test in the treatment strategy, We hypothesize that a positive specific IgE assay predicts the occurrence of an allergic reaction during the first dose of cetuximab. Thus, in population areas where the prevalence of specific IgE positive plasma is higher, the use of alternative therapies in patients with a positive test would reduce the incidence of anaphylactic reactions to cetuximab.

If the use of specific IgE anti-cetuximab in the treatment strategy is effective, there will be reduction in the incidence of anaphylaxis to cetuximab in the participating centers., 3 years
