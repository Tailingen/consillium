Study of Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) vs. Chemotherapy in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of Camrelizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. Participants will be randomized to receive either Camrelizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy of investigators' choice.

The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with Camrelizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) in participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma compared to treatment with Chemotherapy.
