Impact of Immuno-Oncologic Agent on Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
It analyzes the Tumor microenvironment(TME) changes in non pathologic complete response(pCR) subjects among subjects who were administered neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and those who were not administered neoadjuvant pembrolizumab for triple negative breast cancer.

(Neoadjuvant Weekly paclitaxel, Carboplatin +- Pembrolizumab followed by Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide +- Pembrolizumab regimen)

Genomic profiling will be assessed by tissue and blood samples(analyze the TME changes), Tissue and blood will be tested for Spatial transcriptomics, WGS(Wilcoxon rank sum test or Chi-square test, cell-cell interaction), 3year
