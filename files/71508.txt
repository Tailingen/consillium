PIPAC and FOLFOX for Gastric Cancer Peritoneal Cancer
Peritoneum is among the most common sites of metastases in gastric cancer. Systemic chemotherapy is the current standard for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), although, the treatment results remain extremely poor. Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a modern treatment modality for PC, that 1) optimize the drug distribution by applying an aerosol rather than a liquid solution; and 2) apply increased intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure to increase drug penetration to the target. Despite some encouraging preliminary results for PIPAC efficacy, it is still an investigational treatment. Furthermore, only very limited data exist for bidirectional treatment, which includes a combination of systemic chemotherapy and PIPAC. Thus, this study will investigate the feasibility of PIPAC and systemic chemotherapy combination for gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastases.

This open-label, single-arm feasibility study will be conducted at two major gastrointestinal cancer treatment centers in Lithuania and will include 37 participants. Gastric cancer patients diagnosed with a synchronous or metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis based on a clinical, radiological, cytological, and histological examination will be considered for enrollment. Thirty-seven patients willing to participate and meeting the enrollment criteria will be scheduled for the experimental treatment. Three cycles of 1st line palliative systemic chemotherapy will be administered every 28 days and PIPAC with cisplatin 10,5 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 2,1 mg/m2 will be utilized 14 days after each of the systemic chemotherapy cycles. After the 3rd PIPAC procedure patients will be re-assessed and discussed at multidisciplinary team meetings. In case of downstaging patients will be considered for radical gastrectomyÂ±cytoreductive surgery; others for further systemic therapy. All patients will be followed up for 24 months.
