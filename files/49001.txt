Study of Nivolumab for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage III) Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Nivolumab and Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy
The phase II, randomised Study is to explore the efficacy and safety of nivolumab as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (stage III) who have not progressed following neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus nivolumab and definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy
Stage III Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
