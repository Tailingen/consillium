Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation therapy is more effective for head and neck cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of radiation therapy in treating patients who have head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer|Non-melanomatous Skin Cancer
PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Time to local recurrence
Length of survival|Morbidity and toxicity|Quality of life as assessed by EORTC Quality of life Questionnaire for Head and Neck Cancer
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare adjuvant continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy vs conventional radiotherapy, in terms of preventing disease recurrence, in patients with head and neck cancer.
* Compare the early and late toxic effects of these treatments in this patient population.
* Compare disease-free and overall survival of patients receiving these treatments.
* Assess quality of life in patients receiving these treatments.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 3 times daily, with an interval of at least 6 hours between any 2 treatments, 5 days a week, for just over 2 weeks, for a total of 13-14 treatment days.
* Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 6-6.5 weeks. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then annually for 5 years.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
