Establishing Technique for PECS2 Catheter Insertion
The investigators are trying to establish an easy technique for insertion of a catheter for continuous infusion while performing pectoral type 2 (serratus) block, as a post operative pain controlling measure for cases undergoing simple mastectomy, using ultrasound guidence

successful catheter insertion, confirming catheter insertion 5 cm beyond the tip of needle in the proper plan using ultrasound, during time of performing the block

As the space between the pectoralis minor and the serratus anterior is a fashial plane with a connective tissue occupying. we are trying to demonstrate a simple technique for inserting a catheter within that fashial plane and making sure of the catheter position, to ensure post operative analgesia for cases performing simple mastectomy.

Now the Pectoralis type 2 block (PECS type 2) is an established technique as regional block technique for chest wall procedures.

We are trying to maximizing the benefit of the block with a catheter insertion to use it for continuous infusion of bupivacaine for controlling post operative pain in cases performing simple mastectomy procedure
