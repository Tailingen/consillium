A Study of HRS2543 in Patients With Advanced Tumors
To assess the safety and tolerability of HRS2543 in patients with advanced tumors and to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of HRS2543
Advanced Tumors
DRUG: HRS2543
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT is considered at AE related to study drug unless there is a clear, well-documented, alternative explanation for the toxicity. Severity of AEs are graded according to the NCI CTCAE 5.0 for the study, the occurrence of the following drug related AEs during the single dose and the first cycle (28 days) will be considered a DLT by the investigator and SMC., Day 1 to 28 (Cycle 1)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0., Day 1 to 28 (Cycle 1)|Recommended PhaseII Dose (RP2D), Toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0., Day 1 to 28 (Cycle 1)
