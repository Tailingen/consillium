Implementing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Pathways In Major Gynecologic Oncology Operations In Greece
The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program includes preoperative counseling, fasting avoidance, non-opioid analgesia, fluid balance, normothermia and early mobilization. ERAS pathways were developed to reduce hospital length of stay, reduce costs and decrease perioperative opioid requirements, and be beneficial for patients. We propose the hypothesis that the ERAS pathway could reduce the length of stay (LOS) in hospital for patients undergoing major gynecologic oncology surgery (MGOS).

Patients were randomly allocated in two groups: An ERAS pathway group including preoperative counseling, early feeding/mobilization, and opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia; and a classic model group of post operative recovery as control.

Length of Hospital Stay (LOS), Measuring how many days the participants will stay in hospital for the post-op recovery. It is defined as the time frame from the day of the surgery to the day of discharge from the hospital (unit: days)., up to 30 postoperative days|Pain Levels, Evaluation of analgesia and correlation of requirements with opioid analgesics; by recording of postoperative pain levels and the evaluation of the effectiveness of analgesic treatment of patients. Using Numbered pain Scale, from 0 that means no pain at all, to 10 that means the worst pain.

As lower the number on pain scale as better the outcome., up to 3 postoperative days|Number of Participants With the Ability to Getting up in a Chair Within 18h, The number of participants who had the ability to have a sit steadily on a chair himself, within the first 18 hours after the surgery., within the first 18 postoperative hours|Number of Participants With the Ability of Full Mobilization Within 18h Postoperatively, The participants should be able to stand on their feet, walk in the room, go to the toilet and make a short walk in the surgical ward within the first 18 hours after the surgery.

Mobilization time, which is defined as the time frame from the end of the operation until they are able to walk without external assistance (unit: hours)., within the first 18 hours after the surgery|Early Feeding, Feeding within the first 6 hours after the surgery. The participants should be able to drink clear fluids (water, tea,chamomile, apple juice, filter coffee, jelo) with or without sweeteners, given that they don't have PONV., up to 6 hours postoperatively
Early Mobilization of the Digestive System, Number of participants who had their digestive system function on time, with hunger, bowel sounds and bowel movements within the first 24 hours postoperatively, within 24 hours post surgery|Early Discontinuation of IV Administration, Number of participants who had early discontinuation of IV fluids and conversion to per os within 24 hours postoperatively, within 24 h post surgery|Number of Participants Who Had Their Urinary Catheter Removal, Number of participants who had their urinary catheter removed within 24 hours postoperatively, within the first 24h after surgery|Number of Participants Who Had Their Drainage Removal Within 24h, Number of Participants who had their drainage removal within 24 hours postoperatively, within 24h post surgery|Blood Transfusion, Number of participants who had blood transfusion during their intraoperative and postoperative time, within 48 hours post surgery|Postoperative Complications, The evaluation of postoperative complications such as bleeding, thrombosis and inflammation., up to 5 postoperative days|Readmission, Readmission rate by 30 days after discharge from the hospital, up to 30 postoperative days
The Gynecological Cancer of the inner genital organs includes ovarian cancer, endometrial and cervical cancer and its therapeutic approach is surgical removal of the organ with cancer.

The last decade has developed various postoperative recovery protocols aimed at safe and rapid recovery of the patient after a surgery and early discharge from the hospital. These protocols are known as ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols or Fast-Track (FT) and combine various evidence-based perioperative care techniques.

The ERAS protocols include specific approaches preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative, by the multidisciplinary team (surgeon, anesthetist and nurse), and aim at reducing the postoperative stress and pain, fasten the feeding and the mobilization of the patient after the surgery and rapid the hospital discharge.

This trial is designed to evaluate the superiority of the ERAS pathway to conventional non-ERAS clinical practice in reducing the LOS. The results may provide new insight into the clinical applications of the ERAS pathway for MGOS.

This doctoral thesis aims to compare the effectiveness of the Protocol ERAS against the classical model of recovery, in the postoperative recovery of patients with Gynecological Cancer undergoing MGOS, in a Public Oncology Hospital in Greece.

The importance of ERAS programs is expected to emerge in the length of hospital stay, in pain control, in perioperative stress, in the early feeding and mobilization of patients who have undergone MGOS.
