Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab and Tucatinib Without Chemotherapy in HER2-positive Breast Cancer: the TRAIN-4 Study
This is a single-center, phase 1b study evaluating the safety and feasibility of a neoadjuvant treatment with tucatinib, trastuzumab and pertuzumab in stage II-IIIA HER2-positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tucatinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab
Incidence and severity of adverse events, Number of patients with adverse events and severity of adverse events (all grades; CTCAE v5.0) until 30 days after last study treatment administration, an average of 8 months
Incidence of serious adverse events, Number of patients with serious adverse events until 30 days after last study treatment administration, an average of 8 months|Incidence of disease progression, Number of patients with progressive disease during neoadjuvant treatment. Progressive disease is defined as 20% increase in âˆ†FTV or \>20% increase measured in the longest diameter on DCE-MRI or unequivocal new lesions on (18)F-FDG PET, an average of 8 months|Incidence of dose reductions and treatment discontinuations, Number of patients with dose reductions and treatment discontinuations, an average of 8 months|Radiologic complete response, Number of patients with a radiologic complete response defined as the absence of pathologic enhancement on contrast enhanced MRI breast, an average of 8 months|Pathological complete response, Number of patients with a pathological complete response (ypT0/is N0) at surgery in patients treated without chemotherapy, and overall, an average of 8 months|Residual Cancer Burden, Residual Cancer burden (RCB, 0-III) at surgery in patients treated without chemotherapy, and overall, an average of 8 months|Event-free survival, Number of patients without progression or disease recurrence, second primary or death at 3, 5 and 10 years after registration, 3, 5, 10 years|Overall survival, Number of patients alive at 3, 5 and 10 years after registration, 3, 5, 10 years
High pathological complete response (pCR)-rates are seen using different neoadjuvant chemotherapy schedules with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2-positive stage II - III breast cancer patients. However, a subset of patients with stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer can be treated with HER2-blockade alone. These patients can potentially be totally spared from chemotherapy-associated toxicity. The proportion of patients whom can successfully be treated without chemotherapy could potentially be increased by selecting great responders using DCE-MRI and by adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and pertuzumab alone. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment with tucatinib, trastuzumab and pertuzumab.
