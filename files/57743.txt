PEA Promote Gastrointestinal Function Recovered After Colorectal Cancer Operation
To investigate whether perioperative electroacupuncture is more effective than postoperative electroacupuncture in improving gastrointestinal function after colorectal cancer operation
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Routine perioperative management and PEA|PROCEDURE: Routine perioperative management and postEA
time to first flatus (TFF), time to first flatus, Day 3
Recovery time of postoperative bowel sounds, The enteric voice continuous auscultation recorder was used to monitor immediately after operation, and the time to the end of operation was calculated, Day 3|Time of first postoperative defecation, Patients self-report their defecation and doctors record the time, Day 3|Dietary recovery, First time of water intake, tolerance to liquid diet time, tolerance to solid diet time, Day 3|Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction, Duration and frequency of postoperative appearance: nausea, emesis,ventosity, Day 3|Quality of life scale 1, EORTC QLQ-C30（Version 3.0 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (standard score, SS, range from 0 to 100, higher scores mean a better outcome);, "Day 0"，"Day 3"，"Day 7"|Quality of life scale 2, SF-36(Chinese version),The Short Form (36) Health Survey,( The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability), "Day 0"，"Day 3"，"Day 7"|Postperation pain, VAS,Visual analogy score (0 to 10,higher scores mean a worse outcome), Day 3|Motor function, Walking independently after surgery, Day 3|LOS(length of stay), From admission to discharge, Day 7|Biochemical indexes, C-reactive protein(CRP)，motilin(MTL).Gastrin(GAS),vasoactive peptide(VIP), "Day 0"，"Day 3"|Biochemical indexes 1, C-reactive protein(CRP, ug/L), "Day 0"，"Day 3"|Biochemical indexes 2, Motilin(MTL, ng/L), "Day 0"，"Day 3"|Biochemical indexes 3, Gastrin(GAS, ng/L), "Day 0"，"Day 3"|Biochemical indexes 4, vasoactive peptide(VIP, pg/L), "Day 0"，"Day 3"|Adverse Event Assessment, Any adverse events in the study, "Day 0"，"Day 3"，"Day 7"
Although there are large intestine cancer postoperative clinical research of acupuncture, but fewer sample size, whether perioperative acupuncture intervention is superior to the postoperative acupuncture intervention, remains to be seen, so investigators proposed to carry out the preliminary experiment, the data can be collected according to the different characteristics of perioperative, perioperative choose different acupoints compatibility, give full play to the needle medicine compound anesthesia in colorectal cancer surgery play a unique function of viscera protection, to explore the curative in colorectal cancer surgery perioperative intervened to promote the role of gastrointestinal function after surgery for early rehabilitation provides evidence-based medical evidence, develop and optimize the acupuncture and drugs combined anesthesia in colorectal cancer surgery perioperative application of specification, It promoted the establishment of the first treatment mode of "accelerated recovery in perioperative period of colorectal cancer operation based on combined acupuncture and drug anesthesia"
