Endobronchial Valves in Persistent Air Leak
Because an endobronchial valve is a one-way inspiratory airway blocker, it is hypothesized that it could be also used for controlling persistent air leaks while maintaining the drainage of secretions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in October 2008 the Spiration valve system designed to control air leaks in the lung that persist after lung surgery. This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Spiration endobronchial valves in a prospective series of consecutive patients with a prolonged persistent air leak after anatomic surgical resection for cancer.

Persistent Air Leak (PAL) is independently associated with prolonged hospital length of stay, decreased patient satisfaction, increased morbidity or postoperative complications, and adds significantly to the cost. The management of air leaks is primarily preventive and therefore starts in the operating room with surgical techniques that can minimize the occurrence of post-operative air leaks, such as the creation of pleural tents or use of suture line glues or sealants. Notwithstanding some patients will after a lung resection have PAL. Any minimal invasive method that helps to increase our ability to treat (reduce and/or stop) the air leak in these latest cases carries an enormous clinical as well as cost-saving potential. Bronchoscopic occlusion of a segmental or subsegmental bronchus using endobronchial valves is such a less invasive method which has shown in case reports to interrupt an air leak.
