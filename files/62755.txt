Circulating Tumor DNA as an Early Marker of Recurrence and Treatment Efficacy in Ovarian Carcinoma
Prospective multicentre assay to assess ctDNA value for ovarian cancer monitoring and disease recurrence after front-line treatment.
Ovarian Carcinoma
OTHER: biological sampling
Prognostic value of ctDNA increase for predicting a subsequent clinical, radiological (RECIST v1.1) or biological (CA-125 according to GCIG criteria) diagnosis of disease relapse., Re-appearance of mutations non detectable after treatment or increase of ctDNA comparing to the nadir, at diagnosis, after each cycle of eventual neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, before surgery, then every six months during the next two years, and every year in the following three years
The main objective is to explore the capacity of ctDNA to be an early marker of ovarian carcinoma recurrence after front-line treatments, i.e. to show significant modifications before clinical diagnosis of disease relapse.

Prospective multicentre open-label study

During visits in the frame of management of the disease, blood samples will be collected at diagnosis, after each cycle of eventual neoadjuvant chemotherapy, every 6 months during the following 2 years, and every year during the remainin time of follow-up. Tumor samples will be collected at surgery or through a biopsy.

Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years.
