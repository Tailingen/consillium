Fisetin to Improve Physical Function in Stage I-III Breast Cancer Survivors
This phase II trial tests whether fisetin works to improve physical function in women who have received chemotherapy for stage I-III breast cancer treatment. Fisetin is a naturally occurring substance that is found in strawberries and other foods. Fisetin eliminates cells that have undergone a process called senescence. Senescence is when a cell ages and permanently stops dividing but does not die. Over time, large numbers of these cells build up in tissues throughout the body and can release harmful substances that causes inflammation and damages nearby healthy cells. Studies have shown that chemotherapy causes a build-up of these senescent cells. Giving fisetin may eliminate senescent cells and improve physical function in postmenopausal women who have received chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Adverse events will be determined at each time point per patient as the presence (yes/no) of toxicities (CTCAE v 5.0) of grade \>= 2.

Treatment adherence (yes/no) for each patient at each time point will be determined. A patient will be considered adherent (coded 1) if she took all the required capsules within the allotted time, and non-adherent (coded 0) otherwise. The number of capsules taken in the allotted time out of the total required will also be recorded. Will then compare between treatments the proportion of adherent patients and the average proportion of capsules taken within the allotted time across patients at each time point using the t-test. Time point-specific analysis will be performed since conditions for pill-taking differ between the clinic (supervised) and patients' home (self-administered)., From baseline up to 30 days
