Study of MK-4464 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors (MK-4464-001)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of MK-4464 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors|Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: MK-4464|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: 89Zr-MK-4464
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is any toxicity assessed by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study intervention administration that results in a change to a given dose or a delay in initiating the next cycle. All toxicities will be graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)., Up to approximately 21 days|Number of Participants Who Experience At Least One adverse event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 24 months
Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of MK-4464, Cmin is the minimum concentration of the drug observed in plasma. Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine Cmin of MK-4464., Once daily on Day 2, 3, 5, 8, 15 of Cycle 1 and 4, Pre-dose and immediately Post-dose Day 1 Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, Pre-dose Day 1 Cycles 5, 6, 7, 8, and every 4 cycles thereafter through Cycle 35, 30 days post last dose (up to ~25 months); Cycle = 21 days|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of MK-4464, Cmax is the maximum concentration of the drug observed in plasma. Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine Cmax of MK-4464., Once daily on Day 2, 3, 5, 8, 15 of Cycle 1 and 4, Pre-dose and immediately Post-dose Day 1 Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, Pre-dose Day 1 Cycles 5, 6, 7, 8, and every 4 cycles thereafter through Cycle 35, 30 days post last dose (up to ~25 months); Cycle = 21 days|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of MK-4464, AUC is a measure of the extrapolated mean concentration in serum. Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine AUC of MK-4464., Once daily on Day 2, 3, 5, 8, 15 of Cycle 1 and 4, Pre-dose and immediately Post-dose Day 1 Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, Pre-dose Day 1 Cycles 5, 6, 7, 8, and every 4 cycles thereafter through Cycle 35, 30 days post last dose (up to ~25 months); Cycle = 21 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by investigator assessment will be presented., Up to 24 months
