A Study Evaluating [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 vs. a Change of Androgen Receptor-directed Therapy in Taxane Treatment Naive Chinese Male Patients With Progressive Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 over a change of androgen receptor-directed therapy (ARDT) treatment in prolonging radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) in Chinese metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, who were previously treated with another ARDT as last treatment and who have not been exposed to a taxane-containing regimen in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) settings and who are considered appropriate for delaying taxane-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of rPFS will be assessed via blinded independent centralized review of radiographic images provided by the treating physician and as outlined in Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) guidelines.

Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time of radiographic progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)-modified RECIST V1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review, or death., From date of randomization until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 42 months
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause. If a participant is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the participant was known to be alive (on or before the cut-off date)., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 59 months (estimated final OS analysis)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first documented progression by investigator assessment (radiographic progression, clinical progression, PSA progression) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 59 months (estimated final OS analysis)|Prostate-specific antigen 50 response rate, PSA 50 response rate is the proportion of PSA responders, defined as a participant who has achieved PSA decrease of \>= 50% from baseline that is confirmed by a second consecutive PSA measurement \>= 4 weeks later.

EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions., From randomization up till 30 day safety follow-up or at LTFU2 (168 days after EOT) and LTFU4 (336 days after EOT) of long term FU for patients prematurely discontinued, assessed up to 59 Months (estimated final OS analysis)|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) Questionnaire, FACT-P assesses symptoms/problems related to prostate carcinoma and its treatment. It is a combination of the FACT- General + the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS). The FACTGeneral (FACT-G) is a 27 item Quality of Life (QoL) measure that provides a total score as well as subscale scores: Physical (0-28), Functional (0-28), Social (0-28), and Emotional Well-being (0-24). The total score range is between 1-108, higher scores indicates better for total score and subscale scores. PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better). The FACT-P total score is the sum of all 5 subscale scores of the FACT-P questionnaire and ranges from 0-156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life., From randomization up till 30 day safety follow-up or at LTFU2 (168 days after EOT) and LTFU4 (336 days after EOT) of long term FU for patients prematurely discontinued, assessed up to 59 Months (estimated final OS analysis)|Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire, The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain and includes severity and interference scores. BPI-SF is an 11-item selfreport questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. Pain severity score is a mean value for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 (questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 \[no pain\] to 10 \[pain as bad as you can imagine\]). Pain severity progression is defined as an increase in score of 30% or greater from baseline without decrease in analgesic use., From randomization up till 30 day safety follow-up or at LTFU2 (168 days after EOT) and LTFU4 (336 days after EOT) of long term FU for patients prematurely discontinued, assessed up to 59 Months (estimated final OS analysis)|Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, The distribution of adverse events will be done via the analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Event (TESAEs), through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., From date of randomization till 30 days safety fup, assessed up to 59 months (estimated final OS analysis)
The study contains a screening period to assess the eligibility of participants, only participants fulfilling the \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan interpretation criteria for eligibility and meeting all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. In the randomization period, approximately 60 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment or a change of approved ARDT treatment. Randomization will be stratified by symptomatology i.e., Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic vs. symptomatic.

Participants randomized to \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment group will receive 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) ± 10% \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 once every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for 6 cycles. For participants randomized to the ARDT treatment arm, the change of ARDT treatment for each participant will be selected by the treating physician prior to randomization and will be administered per the physician's orders. Supportive care will be allowed in both arms at the discretion of the investigator. ARDT must not be administrated concomitantly with \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617.

Efficacy assessment will be performed every 8 weeks after first dose of study treatment for the first 24 weeks (week 9, 17, 25) and then every 12 weeks (week 37, 49, etc) until confirmation of radiographic progression by BICR. Upon confirmation of rPFS by BIRC, participants randomized to ARDT arm will be allowed to crossover to \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment if the crossover criteria are met. Post-treatment follow up period will have a 30-day safety follow up post EOT visit and long term survival follow up.
