Intraperitoneal LSTA1 in CRS-HIPEC
This Study is designed to test an investigational product (IP) called LSTA1 (Study drug). LSTA1 is a drug designed to improve the delivery of anti-cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy. Improved delivery of chemotherapy may result in improved anti-cancer effects when given with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with peritoneal metastases. Participants will be randomized to receive LSTA1 with HIPEC or HIPEC alone (without LSTA1) at the time of surgery.

Adverse events of interest (AE-I), The proportion of subjects experiencing an inpatient adverse event of interest (AE-I; gastrointestinal fistula/leak, neutropenia, intra-abdominal abscess, venous thromboembolism, mortality), postoperatively from the date of CRS-HIPEC to date of discharge (typically 1-2 weeks)|Drug concentration in tumor, Total drug content in tumor, divided by total tumor mass, at time of surgery
Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival, Time (in months) from randomization to time of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (PFS), or to time of death due to any cause (OS)., 5 years|Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of any adverse events (AEs) by grade and system organ class using CTCAE v5.0 up to 30 days from the date of CRS-HIPEC., 30 Days
Given the high recurrence and disease-related mortality in patients with peritoneal metastases from appendiceal, colorectal, and ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC), use of an agent to improve operative tumor delivery of co-administered anticancer drugs during HIPEC would potentially have significant impact on oncologic outcomes.

Safety of LSTA1 has been demonstrated in the context of metastatic pancreatic cancer when administered intravenously with cytotoxic chemotherapy, but the investigators wish to determine its safety and potential efficacy when administered intraperitoneally with HIPEC in patients with peritoneal metastases from appendiceal, colorectal, and ovarian cancer.
