Phase I Study of Cell Therapies for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory AML or High-risk MDS
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary activity of ARC-T cells and SPRX002 in participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
BIOLOGICAL: SPRX002|BIOLOGICAL: ARC-T Cells
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and establish recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), The RP2D will be determined based on the totality of data, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); if applicable, and other endpoints such as observed efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and other safety endpoints (adverse events (AEs), laboratory assessment, vital signs, and physical examinations), 24 months
Anti-Tumor Activity, Serial blood and bone marrow sampling to determine response to treatment by modified International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria in AML and MDS, or other appropriate response criteria for the malignancy under study, such as overall response rate, composite complete remission rate, and rate of negative minimum residual disease (MRD), 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK), Quantification of ARC-T cells and SPRX002 using vector copy number (VCN) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 24 months
This is a Phase I open-label, safety, and dose-escalation study of ARC-T cells and SPRX002 in participants with relapsed or refractory AML or high-risk MDS. The study will have the following sequential phases: screening, enrollment, pretreatment with lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy, treatment with SPRX002 and ARCT cells, treatment extension with SPRX002, follow up, and long-term safety follow-up.

Following a single infusion of SPRX002 and ARC T (Day 0) and followed by regular administration of SPRX002 at the assigned dose level, both safety and efficacy data will be assessed. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed through Day 28 and safety data will be collected throughout the study. Long-term safety data will be collected for up to 15 years per health authority guidelines. Efficacy will be assessed monthly for the first 6 months, then quarterly up to 2 years, or upon subject relapse.

ARC-T cells are a genetically modified autologous T-cell product. The T cell has been transduced using a third-generation lentiviral vector encoding a binding domain (referred to as AF101) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), followed by CD8 spacer and transmembrane region that is fused to the intracellular signaling domains 4-1BB and CD3Î¶. AF101 specifically binds to the "TAG" protein (referred to as Q26) of the soluble protein antigen-receptor x-linker (sparX; specifically, SPRX002).
