A Comparison of Platinum-based Therapy With TSR-042 and Niraparib Versus Standard of Care (SOC) Platinum-based Therapy as First-line Treatment of Stage III or IV Nonmucinous Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by complex molecular and genetic changes. The high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, programmed death receptor ligands 1 (PD-L1) expression, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in ovarian tumors provide several targets for treatment and maintenance of disease response. Given the unmet medical need of participants with advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer, this study design will enable investigators to provide participants with current SOC for ovarian cancer for the duration of the study. This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 study that will primarily compare the progression-free survival (PFS) for participants receiving dostarlimab with SOC chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab followed by niraparib and dostarlimab maintenance +/- bevacizumab versus participants receiving SOC with chemotherapy followed by niraparib maintenance. This comparison will be investigated in participants of newly diagnosed stage III or IV advanced non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer participants and also to compare PFS of all participants with Stage III or IV high-grade non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based combination therapy, dostarlimab (TSR-042), and niraparib to SOC platinum-based combination therapy. The currently recommended SOC therapy for the first line treatment of Stage III or IV ovarian cancer is the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, with or without concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab. Participants will receive SOC during the chemotherapy Run-In period (cycle 1) before randomization to study treatment (cycle 2). Concurrent bevacizumab use must be determined prior to randomization at cycle 2.

Progression Free Survival (PFS), To compare the PFS of all participants with Stage III or IV high-grade nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer given first-line treatment with the combination of dostarlimab with SOC chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab followed by niraparib and dostarlimab maintenance +/- bevacizumab versus SOC chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab followed by niraparib maintenance +/- bevacizumab. PFS is defined as the time from treatment randomization to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression. PFS will be evaluated by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 6 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the date of randomization to the date of death by any cause, Up to 7 years|PFS by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, BICR determined PFS will be assessed as per RECIST criteria., Up to 6 years|Change from Baseline in the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) assessment, EQ-5D-5L is a validated questionnaire to assess the overall health-related quality of life in participants across diseases. EQ-5D-5L consists of a descriptive section of 5 questions/dimensions, one related to each of: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is measured by 5-point Likert scale (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems), Baseline and up to 6 years|Change from Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) assessment, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated questionnaire to assess the overall health-related quality of life in participants with cancer and is composed of 30 questions including multi-item scales and single item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/quality of life scale (GHS/QOL), and six single items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties). Response options are 1 to 4. Higher score indicates better health-related quality of life., Baseline and up to 6 years|Change from Baseline in the EORTC-QLQ Ovarian Cancer Module OV28 (EORTC-QLQ-OV28) assessment, EORTC QLQ-OV28 is a validated questionnaire to assess the overall health-related quality of life in participants with local or advanced ovarian cancer. EORTC QLQ-OV28 consists of 28 questions evaluated across eight multi-item and 4 single item scales: abdominal/ gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hormonal symptoms, body image, attitude to disease/treatment, chemotherapy side effects, and sexuality, and single items scales for indigestion/heartburn, hair loss, upset due to hair loss, and taste. All questions are rated on a 4 point verbal rating scale: "Not at all," "A little," "Quite a bit," and "Very much.", Baseline and up to 6 years|Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), TFST is defined as the time from randomization until the start date of the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first, Up to 6 years|Time to second subsequent therapy (TSST), TSST is defined as the time from randomization until the start date of the second subsequent anti-cancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first, Up to 6 years|Time to progression on next-line therapy (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization until PD per investigator's assessment after starting follow-up anti-cancer therapy or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 6 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on study treatment as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria for participants with measurable disease., Up to 6 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR until the time of first documentation of PD as assessed by RECIST v1.1, or death by any cause in the absence of progression, whichever occurs first., Up to 6 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR, defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 6 years|Plasma concentration of dostarlimab, Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of dostarlimab, Up to 6 years|Number of participants with positive antidrug antibodies (ADAs) against dostarlimab, Serum samples will be collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays., Up to 6 years|Plasma concentration of niraparib, Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib., Up to 6 years|Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs are defined as, any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment., Up to 6 years|Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs), SAEs are any adverse event that may result in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital abnormality or birth defect, is an important medical event., Up to 6 years|Number of participants with treatment discontinuations or dose delays or dose reductions due to adverse events, Adverse events are any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to 6 years|Number participants with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), Following events are categorized as irAEs: Diarrhea/colitis, AST or ALT (\>3 and \<=5 X ULN), or increased bilirubin, T1DM or hyperglycemia, immune-related encephalitis, uveitis, myositis, hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, infusion-related reaction, pneumonitis, immune-related rash, renal failure or nephritis and recurrence of AEs after resolution to Grade \<=1., Up to 6 years|Number of participants with changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG performance status scale: ranging from Grade 0 to 5, Grade 0 denoting fully active and Grade 5 denoting death., Up to 6 years|Number of participants with abnormal hematology results, Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of hematologic parameters including: hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, coagulation factors-International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time., Up to 6 years|Number of participants with abnormal clinical chemistry results, Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters including: amylase, thyroid function (thyroid stimulating hormone \[TSH\]), urea or blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, total protein, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, Glucose, Magnesium, Calcium, Chloride, Potassium and Sodium., Up to 6 years
