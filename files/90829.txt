Safety Study of Sorafenib With Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy to Treat Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new drug- sorafenib, which is to be administered at the same time as standard treatment, which includes hormonal therapy and external beam radiotherapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Leuprolide acetate, Bicalutamide, Sorafenib
Determine the Safety and Maximally Tolerated Dose of Sorafenib Administered Concurrently With Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Intermediate- and High-risk Localized Prostate Cancer., Data of zero ("0") participants were analyzed due to lack of funding and prematurely terminating the study by sponsor. All subjects are following up in the clinic off the study., Day 29 and every 2 weeks
Biochemical Disease-free Survival, Data of zero ("0") participants were analyzed due to lack of funding and prematurely terminating the study by sponsor. All subjects are following up in the clinic off the study., after 9 months
Leuprolide acetate (a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist) and Bicalutamide (an anti-androgen) are hormonal agents which are commonly used to reduce testosterone blood level for prostate cancer treatment. Intensity modulated external beam radiotherapy is a standard treatment for localized prostate cancer. Previous studies have shown that combining hormonal therapy and radiation is more effective than radiation alone. Unfortunately, significant percentages (50-75%) of patients still relapse. Sorafenib reduces the growth of cancer cells and has proven effective in the treatment of solid tumors including kidney and liver cancer. This drug is approved by the FDA for treatment kidney and liver cancer. The study investigators believe that adding sorafenib to standard treatment, comprising hormonal therapy and radiation, might be more effective then standard hormonal therapy.
