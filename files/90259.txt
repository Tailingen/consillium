A Study of OLR in First-line Treatment of Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This is a single-arm, multicenter, open label phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OLR in the treatment of initially treated mantle cell lymphoma.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib in in combination of rituximab and lenalidomide(OLR)
Complete Response Rate, The proportion of patients receiving the treatment with complete remission, At the end of Cycle 6(each cycle is 28 days)
Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients with response of PR and CR., Approximately 2 years|Time to Response, Measured from the date of initiation of treatment to the time of response, Approximately 1 year|The Progression Free Survival Rate in 2 Years, The proportion of patients who didn't achieve disease progression or death in 2 years., 2 Years|The Overall Survival Rate in 2 Years, The proportion of patients who didn't achieve death in 2 years, 2 Years
Patients initially treated with mantle cell lymphoma were screened for OLR regimen according to study admission criteria. The study will accept up to 24 cycles of treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs and subjects voluntarily withdraw informed consent. Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after complete remission may begin stem cell collection after induction therapy for at least 6 months. Twenty-nine patients are expected to be enrolled
