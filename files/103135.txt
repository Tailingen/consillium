A Trial to Learn if the Combination of Fianlimab, Cemiplimab, and Chemotherapy is Safe and Works Better Than the Combination of Cemiplimab and Chemotherapy in Adult Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can be Treated With Surgery
This study is researching an experimental drug called fianlimab (also called REGN3767) with two other medications called cemiplimab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, individually called a "study drug" or collectively called "study drugs", when combined in this study. The study is being conducted in patients who have resectable stage II to IIIB (N2) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be treated with surgery.

The aim of the study is to see how effective the combination of fianlimab, cemiplimab, and chemotherapy is in comparison with cemiplimab and chemotherapy as peri-operative therapy in participants with NSCLC.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs
* How much of each study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)
* How administering the study drugs might affect quality of life

Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much." A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change., Up to 5 years|Overall change in patient-reported physical functioning per EORTC QLQ-C30, Up to 5 years|Overall change in patient-reported role functioning per EORTC QLQ-C30, Up to 5 years|Overall change in patient-reported chest pain per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13), The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer-specific supplemental questionnaire used in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Participant responses to the question "Have you had pain in your chest?" are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The change from baseline in chest pain (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 40) score will be presented. A lower score indicates a better outcome., Up to 5 years|Overall change in patient-reported dyspnea per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years|Overall change in patient-reported cough per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years|Overall change in patient-reported composite of chest pain, dyspnea, and cough per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years|Change in patient-reported general health status per EuroQoL 5-Dimensional 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) index, The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system assesses 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a 5-level scale: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems, Up to 5 years|Change in patient-reported general health status per Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 10 centimeter (cm) vertical, visual analogue scale. It is rated by the respondent on a scale 0 to 100, with 0 being "the worst health you can imagine" and 100 being "the best health you can imagine"., Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported global health status/QoL per EORTC QLQ-C30, Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported physical functioning per EORTC QLQ-C30, Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported role functioning per EORTC QLQ-C30, Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported chest pain per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported dyspnea per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported cough per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years|Time until definitive deterioration in patient-reported composite of chest pain, dyspnea and cough per EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 5 years
