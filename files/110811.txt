Safety and Efficacy of "Immuncell-LC" in TACE Therapy
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 'Immuncell-LC group' and 'non-treatment group' in the patients undergone Transarterial Chemoembolization for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
BIOLOGICAL: Immuncell-LC
Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 44 weeks, and then every 3 months until the data cut-off date or 12 months from baseline of last subject, baseline until 44 weeks, and then every 3 months until the data cut-off date or 12 months from baseline of last subject
Overall Survival (OS), Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 44 weeks, and then every 3 months until the data cut-off date or 12 months from baseline of last subject, baseline until 44 weeks, and then every 3 months until the data cut-off date or 12 months from baseline of last subject|Change of Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) level, Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 44 weeks, and then every 3 months until the data cut-off date or 12 months from baseline of last subject, Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 44 weeks, and then every 3 months until the data cut-off date or 12 months from baseline of last subject|Correlation of between Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cell change and Prognosis, Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy, Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy|Adverse event, From the time the patient provided written informed consent until drop-out or the end of the study or at least 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy, From the time the patient provided written informed consent until drop-out or the end of the study or at least 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), From the time the patient provided written informed consent until drop-out or the end of the study or 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy, From the time the patient provided written informed consent until drop-out or the end of the study or 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy|Hematological examination, Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy, Every 12 weeks from the baseline until 4 weeks after the last dose of immunotherapy
ILC-IIT-05 is randomized, open-label, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial. To confirm clinical efficacy and safety between 'Immuncell-LC group' and 'non-treatment group', primary outcome, recurrence free survival(RFS) will be evaluated.

For secondary outcome, overall survival(OS), changes of Alpha Feto Protein(AFP), correlation of between myeloid-derived suppressor cell change and prognosis, adverse event, ECOG-PS and hematological examination will be evaluated.
