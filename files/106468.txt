Study of 3D Radiotherapy With or Without Erlotinib (Tarceva速) in Patients With Localized Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
A phase II, multicenter, randomized trial of 3D Radiotherapy versus 3D Radiotherapy and erlotinib (Tarceva速) in patients with localized-unresectable (IA-IIIB) non-small cell lung cancer non susceptible for chemotherapy treatment, to compare safety and toxicity profile, and the progression-free survival in both arms of treatment (3D Radiotherapy versus 3D Radiotherapy + erlotinib) in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Erlotinib (Tarceva速)
To determinate the viability and toxicity profile of Erlotinib + 3D Radiotherapy treatment (% of patients presenting toxicity 3-4 during the treatment).
The progression-free survival.|1-year survival.|Overall survival.|Objective response rate, according to RECIST criteria.
