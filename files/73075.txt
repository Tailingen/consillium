SHR-A1811 and THPy in First or Second Line for HER2 Positive Advanced Breast Cancer Brain Metastases
The aim of this project is to evaluate whether the sequence of Trastuzumab，pyrotinib and Nab-Paclitaxel in first line followed by SHR-A1811 in second line is superior to the sequence of SHR-A1811 in first line followed by Trastuzumab，pyrotinib and Nab-Paclitaxel in second line for HER2 positive breast cancer brain metastases.
