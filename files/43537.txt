Exploratory Study in Achievement of Improved Survival by Molecular Targeted Chemotherapy and Liver Resection for Not Optimally Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastases
The correlation between the values of angiogenesis-related growth factors in plasma and efficacy, and biomarkers relevant as prognostic factors or predictive factors for sensitivity or resistance to treatment will be examined exploratively.

To evaluate the values of angiogenesis-related growth factors in plasma with Progression-free survival (PFS), To evaluate the values of angiogenesis-related growth factors in plasma with PFS centrally assessed, Baseline, Cycle 8, Progression Disease
To evaluate the correlation of values of angiogenesis-related growth factors in plasma with efficacy and adverse events, Response rate, Tumor shrinkage rate, Liver resection rate, R0 liver resection rate( pathologically confirmed ), Progression-free survival(CT/MRI image assessed by the attending physician), Time to treatment-failure, Overall survival, Incidence of adverse events (drag-related, surgery-related) , Exploratory endpoints, Baseline, Cycle 8, Progression Disease|Progression-free survival among the RAS wild type subpopulation, assessed every 8 weeks, up to 4 years|Exploratory analysis of the relevance of tumor size and expression level of angiogenesis-related growth factors in plasma, Baseline, Cycle 8, Progression Disease
The correlation between the values of angiogenesis-related growth factors in plasma and efficacy, and biomarkers relevant as prognostic factors or predictive factors for sensitivity or resistance to treatment will be examined exploratively.
