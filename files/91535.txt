Bendamustine in Combination With Bortezomib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin for Multiple Myeloma
This is an open label phase I/II trial to determine the safety and the biologic activity of the bendamustine, bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Filgrastim
Phase I: MTD of Bendamustine When Combined With Bortezomib and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin., In the first phase, MTD of bendamustine was determined in combination with bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to gain a better idea of safe dosing before proceeding with the second phase to assess efficacy. Assuming myelosuppression being a dose-limiting effect that could have been overcome with growth factor support, MTD of the combination with myeloid growth factor support was also tested., From C1D1 up to a maximum of 7 months or until death|Phase II : Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (CR+PR) of bendamustine in association with bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was assessed in patients with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. Per modified International Myeloma Working Group criteria: Complete Response (CR) : Negative for monoclonal protein by immunofixation on the serum and urine, and Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow ; PR : 50% or more reduction in serum M-protein and 90% or more reduction in urine M-protein or to \<200 mg/24hours or a 50% or more reduction in free light chain level ; Overall Response (OR) = CR +PR., From C1D1 up to a maximum of 52 months or until death
Phase I & Phase II : Toxicity of Treatment Regimen, Toxicity profile (for all patients) were presented by rate of overall toxicity and rates of grade 3 or 4 toxicities analyzed separately and combined., From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 54 months|Phase II : Time to Progression, The time from the start of treatment (i.e., first dose) of MM patients treated with bendamustine, bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to disease progression, with disease progression and death due to disease progression as events and deaths due to causes other than progression as censored. Censoring date will be the last disease evaluation date for patient without progression/death or date of death due to other diseases for patients' deaths due to other causes.Per modified International Myeloma Working Group criteria: Progressive disease (PD) is reported if any one of the following criteria is met:

Increase of 25% or more in serum or urine M-protein from baseline;Serum M-protein and/or the absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL;Urine M-protein and/or absolute increase must be ≥200 mg/24 hours ; Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas;Development of hyperc., From C1D1 up to a maximum of 54 months or until death|Phase II: Progression-free Survival (PFS), The time from the start of treatment of MM patients treated with bendamustine, bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. to disease progression or death (regardless of cause of death), whichever comes first. Censoring date will be the last disease evaluation date.Per modified International Myeloma Working Group criteria: Progressive disease (PD) is reported if any one of the following criteria is met:

Increase of 25% or more in serum or urine M-protein from baseline;Serum M-protein and/or the absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL;Urine M-protein and/or absolute increase must be ≥200 mg/24 hours ; Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas;Development of hyperc., From C1D1 up to a maximum of 54 months until death|Phase II: Duration of Survival, Duration of MM patients treated with bendamustine, bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. from first date of at least partial response to the time of progression or death due to disease progression as events, with disease progression and death due to disease progression as events and deaths due to causes other than progression as censored. Censoring date will be the last disease evaluation date or date of death due to other causes as appropriate., From C1D1 up to a maximum of 52 months|Phase II: Overall Survival, The time from the start of treatment to death from any cause with last date known alive as censoring date., From C1D1 up to a maximum of 54 months or until death
