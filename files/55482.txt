Study of Cirmtuzumab and Paclitaxel for Metastatic or Locally Advanced, Unresectable Breast Cancer
This is a pilot phase 1b study to investigate the safety and side effects of combining the ROR1-targeting monoclonal antibody, cirmtuzumab, with paclitaxel for patients with HER2 negative, metastatic breast cancer. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called receptor-tyrosine-kinase like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) on the surface of breast cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab blocks the growth and survival of the breast cancer cells in laboratory tests. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental and is not approved by United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

* This is a phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, fixed dose study in patients with HER2 negative metastatic, or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer.
* Cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cirmtuzumab or paclitaxel may be continued alone if the other drug is discontinued due to toxicity, as long as the subject is tolerating the drug and does not exhibit disease progression.
* Blood and tissue samples will be collected at pre-specified times to enable pharmacokinetic and correlative studies.
* Adverse events (AE) will be monitored throughout the trial. Reporting of AEs will be in accordance with CTCAE version 4.03.
* Assessment of tumor response will be performed by physical examination and/or by radiographic imaging and according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1.
* Patients will be assessed at 28 days following the last dose of cirmtuzumab to assess tumor response and at 56 days following the last dose of cirmtuzumab to assess any adverse events and to document any concomitant cancer therapy.
