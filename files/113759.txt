A Prospective Study on Sunitinib as First Line Therapy for Advanced/Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma in Asian Population
This is a multi-national, phase II, single arm study to explore the safety/efficacy and potential biomarkers on sunitinib 2/1 schedule for Asian patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib malate
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (safety and tolerability), To evaluate the safety and tolerance of sunitinib two weeks on, one week off for advanced renal cell carcinoma, 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), to evaluate the best response rate of sunitinib 2/1 schedule, 24 months|progression free survival (PFS), to evaluate the progression-free survival of sunitinib 2/1 schedule, 24 months|patient reported outcome (PRO), to evaluate the change of quality of life with sunitinib 2/1 schedule, 24 months
single nuclear polymorphism, to explore the relationship between select SNP associated with sunitinib 2/1 schedule, 24 months
Sunitinib 50mg daily on 4/2 dose schedule has been established as standard of care (SOC) for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, Asian patients in real world experienced grade III/IV adverse events much more than expected. This multi-national, phase II, single arm study is going to explore more on the safety/efficacy and relevant biomarkers on sunitinib 2/1 dose schedule in Asian people with advanced RCC.
