Evaluation of FDOPA-PET/MRI in Pediatric Patients With CNS Tumors
To determine if FDOPA-PET/MRI imaging can predict response to treatment of bevacizumab.
Astrocytoma, Oligoastrocytoma, Mixed|Ganglioneuroma|Glioma|Ganglioglioma|Glioblastoma Multiforme Glioma
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DEVICE: FDOPA-PET/MRI imaging
FDOPA-PET/MRI imaging, The imaging is evaluated: (a) the uptake of PET tracer FDOPA measured by average and maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) as well as tumor to normal brain ratios; and (b) tumor volumes defined by MRI signal abnormality., 1 year
Evaluate the feasibility of using FDOPA-PET/MRI pediatric patients with CNS tumors. Positive results in this small study would provide the data needed to expand the study to validate the use in a larger population of pediatric patients. Validating the use of FDOPA-PET imaging as an early predictor for response to anti-angiogenic therapy could greatly impact the standard of care for treating and evaluating pediatric brain tumors and provide a useful biomarker for assessing experimental therapeutics.
