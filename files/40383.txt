Phase IIa Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of BL-8040 in Relapsed/Refractory AML Patients
A study is designed to assess if BL-8040 in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) can help controlling the disease in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that have relapsed or did not respond adequately to previous treatment. The safety of the study drug combination will also be studied.

Response to Treatment by Dose, Response rate as assessed at final bone marrow evaluation based on Cheson et al 2003 criteria.

* CR defined as bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 10\^9/L (1000/μL); platelet count \>100 x 10\^9/L (100,000/μL); independent of red cell transfusions
* CRi defined as all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 x 10\^9/L \[1000/μL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 x 10\^9/L \[100,000/μL\])
* Partial Response (PR) defined as all hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%, Final bone marrow evaluation - Between Day 20 and Day 44|Apoptotic Effect, Change in leukemic cell apoptosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow, Final evaluation - between Day 20 and Day 44|Assessment of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of BL-8040 - t1/2 (h), Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BL-8040 after daily subcutaneous (SC) dosing for 2 days alone, followed by 5 days of combined administration of BL-8040 + Ara-C by dose level.

Standard Deviation is reported for N ≥ 3 t1/2 (h): The time required for plasma concentration of a drug to decrease by 50%, Blood samples for the determination of BL-8040 were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after BL-8040 administration on Day 1.|Assessment of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of BL-8040 - Tmax (h), Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BL-8040 after daily subcutaneous (SC) dosing for 2 days alone, followed by 5 days of combined administration of BL-8040 + Ara-C by dose level.

Standard Deviation is reported for N ≥ 3 tmax (h): The time to peak concentration, Blood samples for the determination of BL-8040 were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after BL-8040 administration on Day 1.|Assessment of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of BL-8040 - Cmax (ng/mL), Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BL-8040 after daily subcutaneous (SC) dosing for 2 days alone, followed by 5 days of combined administration of BL-8040 + Ara-C by dose level.

Standard Deviation is reported for N ≥ 3 Cmax is the highest concentration of a drug in the blood, Blood samples for the determination of BL-8040 were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after BL-8040 administration on Day 1.|Assessment of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of BL-8040 - AUC0-t (h*ng/mL), Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BL-8040 after daily subcutaneous (SC) dosing for 2 days alone, followed by 5 days of combined administration of BL-8040 + Ara-C by dose level.

Standard Deviation is reported for N ≥ 3 AUC0-t is the Area Under the Curve (AUC), definite integral of the concentration of a drug in blood as a function of time., Blood samples for the determination of BL-8040 were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after BL-8040 administration on Day 1.|Assessment of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of BL-8040 - AUC0-24 (h*ng/mL), Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BL-8040 after daily subcutaneous (SC) dosing for 2 days alone, followed by 5 days of combined administration of BL-8040 + Ara-C by dose level.

Standard Deviation is reported for N ≥ 3 AUC0-24 is the Area Under the Curve (AUC), definite integral of the concentration of a drug in blood from time zero to 24 hours post dose., Blood samples for the determination of BL-8040 were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after BL-8040 administration on Day 1.
Open-label, multicenter, Phase IIa, dose escalating study in subjects with relapsed/refractory AML, defined according to WHO criteria, including subjects who failed chemotherapy only and those who failed previous Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT)/ Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT), provided at least 6 months have passed from transplant.

Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 ("monotherapy period") over two days (one injection per day) followed by concurrent administration of BL-8040 with standard salvage chemotherapy ("combined period") over 5 days. During the "combined period," BL-8040 will be administered 4 hours prior to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy will consist of cytarabine (Ara-C) 1.5 or 3 g/m2/d per dose (based on age), administered intravenously (IV) over 3 hours, for 5 days and will not be escalated.

The first part of the study (Part 1) will include escalating dose groups and be considered the 'escalation phase'. Six potential dose levels will be investigated starting at dose level 1. Patients will be accrued in a conventional 3+3 design. Applying this study design, the first cohort of 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1 and evaluated for dose escalation.

At the discretion of the Sponsor, additional subjects may be enrolled into a selected dose group to confirm safety and efficacy for selected dose. the portion of this study is considered expansion phase.
