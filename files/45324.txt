Role of the Immune Environment in Response to Therapy in Breast Cancer
This is an observational case-control study of tissues collected from women with ER+HER2- breast cancers. The immune environments of these cancers will be compared to triple negative and HER2+ breast cancers. No randomization or changes to standard of care treatment will occur as part of the study.

Collecting, processing and archiving breast cancer tumor tissues, This study will collect and analyze tumor samples from women diagnosed with primary breast cancer. The investigators will dissociate fresh tumor samples and analyze single cell suspensions by flow cytometry. Percentage of dendritic cell and T cell subsets and dendritic cell and T cell activation markers will be compared between breast cancer subtypes (HR+HER2-, HER2+, triple negative). Percentage of dendritic cell and T cell subsets and dendritic cell and T cell activation markers will be compared between HR+HER2- untreated breast cancers compared to HR+HER2- chemotherapy treated breast cancers., Through study completion, average of 2 years
Associating breast cancer dendritic cell infiltrate with outcome, We will perform studies to associate dendritic cell infiltration and activation markers with patient outcome, including disease free survival, distant disease free survival, and overall survival., 5 years
