Survival and Prognostic Factors of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasal Vestibule
The goal of this observational study is to learn about survival and prognostic factors in patients who underwent surgical treatment for primary squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* what is the prognosis of patients affected by squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule?
* are there any specific factors that could influence prognosis?
* is it possible to elaborate a new staging system, able to overcome the limitations of the currently used ones? Data about patients, tumour and type of surgery performed will be collected. Participants will be followed-up for a minimum 6 months period after surgery.

This study will address the survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule (NV-SCC), and it will analyze factors influencing it.

In particular, apart from demographic features of the patient, data regarding the origin of the tumour and its extension will be collected and the lesion will be restaged according the the three classification systems used at present (Wang's classification, AJCC for nasal cavity cancers, AJCC for non-melanomatous skin cancer of head and neck region), given the current controversy regarding the best staging system. Furthermore data related to the surgery and the final histology will be collected.

All collected data will be analyzed in order to investigate any possible factor related to overall survival, disease specific survival and disease free survival.

Patients will be followed for a minimum of 6 months up to 5 years after surgery.
