A Study of Treatment Patterns in HER2-positive Unresectable and Advanced Gastric/ Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer in China
This study will be conducted to retrospectively evaluate the treatment patterns in first-line, second-line, and subsequent lines of therapy for HER2-positive Gastric Cancer/Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer (GC/GEJC) patients.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
OTHER: No drug
Percentage of patients receiving first-line, second-line, and third-line anti-tumor regimens, 72 months
Percentage of HER2 sample type and testing method among patients with a first diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive GC/GEJC, 72 months|Percentage of re-biopsies and re-biopsies with HER2-positive results among patients with a first diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive GC/GEJC, 72 months|Real-world Progression-Free Survival, 72 months|Real-world Time to Discontinuation, 72 months|Real-world Time to Next Treatment 1, 78 months|Overall Survival, 78 months
This is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective real-world study to analyze the treatment patterns for patients with GC/GEJC in the first-line, second-line, and subsequent lines of treatment. The study will also assess different HER2 sample types, testing methods, and HER2 re-biopsy situations. By evaluating the treatment and testing patterns in clinical practice, this study aims to provide evidence and recommendations for improving the strategies for the treatment and testing of HER2-positive GC/GEJC patients.
