A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study of the Effect of Laparoscopic Preservation of the Pylorus
For the patients with early gastric cancer (T1), preoperative evaluation (gastroscope, ultrasound gastroscope and abdominal enhanced CT) showed that the tumor was located in the body of the stomach, and the margin was enough to retain the pylorus and non lymph node metastasis (N0). Lappg (D1 + lymph node dissection) and traditional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (BII type anastomosis, D1 + lymph node dissection) were included A control study was conducted to evaluate the influence of two surgical methods on the long-term quality of life of patients after operation
Quality of Life
PROCEDURE: lappg
EORTC-QLQ-C30, score: 0-100. more global and functional scales is better. less symptom scales is better, 5 years
