ECP will be given to the patients \[UVAR®XTS TM Therakos system, Johnson \& Johnson\] according to the following schedule:

Starting at day 21 after transplant, if hematologic recovery allowed it: 2 ECP per week the first 2 weeks, and 1 ECP per week during 1 month.

Total = 8 ECP after transplantation.
