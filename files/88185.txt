Zanzalintinib in Combination With Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Patients With Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The investigators hypothesize that zanzalintinib in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab will be well tolerated and serve as a potential therapeutic strategy in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (mSTS) including myxofibrosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, cutaneous angiosarcoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma histologies.
Metastatic Soft-tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Zanzalintinib|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined in the protocol., Through day 42
Frequency and grades of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Graded per CTCAE v5.0., From start of treatment through 100 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 24 months and 100 days)|Rate of treatment discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), From start of treatment through completion of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)|Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, * Objective response (OR) is defined as number of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, * Clinical benefit is defined complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for 6 weeks.
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)|Duration of response (DoR), * DOR is time from treatment initiation to disease progression or death as a first event for patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)
