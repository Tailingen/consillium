Stereotactic Radiosurgery Using CyberKnife in Treating Women With Advanced or Recurrent Gynecological Malignancies
RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery using CyberKnife works in treating women with advanced or recurrent gynecological malignancies.

Disease-free Survival, Median disease free survival, completion of study at 24 months|Median Overall Survival, Length of time patients survived at study end., 24 months|Quality of Life, After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.|Clinical Response Rate, Percentage of patients with a clinical response following RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) Criteria: Confirmed complete response(CR), Stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or without progressive disease (PD)., at 6 months from study entry
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. The primary goal of this study is to estimate the rate of grade 3 or higher acute toxicities observed during a 6 month period following CyberKnife radiosurgery for gynecologic cancers.

II. To evaluate clinical response to radio-surgery for gynecologic tumors.

III. To assess general and site specific quality of life (using SF-12, FACT-En, FACT-O, FACT-Cx or FACT-V) and to evaluate patient's level of pain.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. As a secondary objective, toxicities during the 2 years following CyberKnife radiosurgery will also be described.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo 3 fractions of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
