Continuous Observation of Smoking Subject
The purpose of this study is to offer annual low-dose spiral CT radiological examination for 5 years to 5000 volunteers from the general population who are considered to be at high risk of developing lung cancer.
Subjects at High Risk of Lung Cancer Due to Smoking
RADIATION: Low dose CT scan
To determine the prevalence of malignant pulmonary disease at the first CT examination, CT scan, once after enrollment|To assess the radiological detection of disease during the 10 year follow-up, CT scan, once per year for a 10 year follow-up period
To determine the overall resectability of detected malignant tumours, once after detection of malignancy
Lung carcinoma is one the most fatal cancer in the world. The enormous fatality rate reflects the limited chance of cure, with a dismal overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 14%. The prognosis of lung cancer depends largely on early detection and immediate treatment prior to metastatic spread. For Stage 1 lung cancer the 5-year survival rate can be as high as 70% . These data suggest that early detection and surgical treatment would have a huge beneficial effect on the lung cancer population. We developed a single arm observational study for the early detection of lung cancer with low dose CT scan in high risk asymptomatic subjects. A mainly non invasive algorithm for management of undetermined nodules was designed including low dose CT at three months for baseline nodules with diameter between 5 and 8 mm, a PET scan for nodules larger that 8 mm (not reduced after antibiotics and one month follow up CT). Lesions increasing in diameter or in density or positive nodules at CT/PET were sent to surgical biopsy (videothoracoscopic approach preferred).

Spirometry was done in all subjects prior to CT scan to evaluate correlation between BPCO and lung cancer.
