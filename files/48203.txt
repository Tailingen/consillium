Exploratory Study of Novel MSLN CAR-T Cell Therapy in Patients With MSLN-positive Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel Mesothelin CAR-T in patients with Mesothelin-positive advanced refractory solid tumors.
