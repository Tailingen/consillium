Study to Evaluate t(11;14) Status and BCL2 Expression in Adult Participants With Multiple Myeloma (MM)
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare cancer caused by abnormal survival of plasma cells (blood cells). Most trial participants with MM relapse (cancer has come back) or become non- responsive to treatment and remission gets shorter after each line of treatment. This is a study to assess t(11;14) and BCL2 expression in adult participants with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM.

Approximately 500 adult participants with newly confirmed or relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) will be enrolled in around 15-20 countries.

Participants will receive standard of care while participating in this study. No drug will be administered as a part of this study.

Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic and will be asked to provide bone marrow and blood samples.
