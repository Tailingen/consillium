A Study of RC48-ADC Combined With AK104 For Perioperative Treatment of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous RC48-ADC combined with AK104 in perioperative treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Muscle Invasive Bladder Carcinoma
DRUG: RC48-ADC|DRUG: AK104
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, pCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having pCR. pCR is defined as absence of viable tumor (pT0pT0N0) in examined tissue from RC and PLND., Up to approximately 16 Weeks (Time of surgery)
Rate of Pathologic Response, No residual tumor (ypT0N0) and partial response (ypTis-1N0) in surgical specimen., Up to approximately 16 Weeks (Time of surgery)|1-3 year Disease Free Survival Rate, The percentage of participants disease free on 1-3 year after surgery., From approximately 12 Months up to approximately 36 Months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to approximately 16 Weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 60 Months
36 patients with Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer（MIBC） scheduled for radical cystectomy will participate in this study. The patient had not previously received any antitumor system therapy for MIBC. HER2 expression in MIBC patients is defined as the expression of HER2 in tumor tissues detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+. After enrollment, the subjects will receive 4 cycles neoadjuvant therapy and 14 cycles adjuvant therapy.
