Effect of Childhood Radioiodine Therapy on Salivary Function
Radioiodine (I-131) therapy for thyroid disease is known to decrease salivary function in adult patients. The impact of pediatric I-131 exposure on salivary function is unknown. The investigators goals are to answer this question by measuring salivary gland function before and after I-131 administration in children who receive radioiodine therapy at our hospital for thyroid disease.
Xerostomia|Hyperthyroidism|Thyroid Cancer
OTHER: Radioiodine
Salivary function (MST value), sterile paper strip is used to measure saliva production (noninvasive testing), 0 to 50 years after radioiodine treatment|Responses to Dry Mouth Questionnaire, Patient questionnaire/survey, At time of visit up to 4 months thereafter.
Caries history (number of caries noted in dental records), 1 year before radioiodine administration to 4 months after study visit.
Radioiodine (I-131) therapy for thyroid disease is known to decrease salivary function in adult patients. The impact of pediatric I-131 exposure on salivary function is unknown. The investigators goals are to answer this question by measuring salivary gland function before and after I-131 administration in children who receive radioiodine therapy at our hospital for thyroid disease. We will use a Modified Shirmer Test to measure saliva production and a questionnaire to evaluation symptoms of xerostomia.
