Gene Methylation in the Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus: Identification of Candidate Diagnostic Markers
This study is to identify potential markers from esophageal biopsies and brush cytology for feasibility of use in stool specimens for detection of Barretts Esophagus.
Barrett's Esophagus
to determine if assay of aberrantly methylated gene markers can discriminate Barrett's Esophagus tissue (and presence of dysplasia) from esophageal squamous and gastric cardia tissue., we will plan to identify the best markers from highly selected marker candidates to differentiate between subjects who have BE and those who do not have BE., 1 day
Assess the accuracy of candidate markers in stool for detection of Barrett's Esophagus, Assess the ability of stool markers to distinguish between subjects who have BE and those who do not., One day
