Effect of Low Intensity Vibration (LIV) on Aromatase Inhibitor- Induced Musculoskeletal Dysfunction in Early Stage Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of low intensity vibration (LIV) delivered for 10 minutes twice daily for 12 months on skeletal muscle function, in terms of energetic capacity measured by power generation on a stationary bicycle, among patients with early stage breast cancer planned to initiate aromatase inhibitor therapy who do not currently participate in regular exercise, compared to a wait- listed control.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Macrodyne LivMD plate
Mean change in energetic capacity measured by peak power generation on a stationary bicycle, Peak power will be measured using the Power Protocol-B, Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months
Change in muscle contractile properties including peak power, fatigue resistance, and time to recovery measured by isokinetic knee extension, A Biodex 4 system will be used to measure each subject's muscle contractile properties, Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months|Change in lean body mass, Lean mass, total adiposity measured by DXA scan, Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months|Change in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine by T score, Bone mineral density (T score) measured by DXA scan, Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months|Change in trabecular and cortical volumetric bone mineral density, By high resolution peripheral quantitative CT of the distal and diaphyseal tibia and radius, Baseline and 12 months|Change in serologic bone markers of bone turnover (TGF-beta and NTX) by quantitative measurements using ELISA, TGF-beta and NTX by quantitative measurements using ELISA, Baseline and 12 months|Patient reported fatigue measured by the Basic Fatigue Inventory score, Average of all 9 items ranging in a score of 0-10 (total possible score of 11) scores range from 1( no fatigue/does not interfere) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes), Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months|Patient reported aching muscles and joint pain measured by NCI Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events score, Average of 2 scale items for aching muscles and joint pain on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging in severity) with a total possible score of 5 (i.e. very severe/ almost constantly), Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months|Feasibility of low intensity vibration defined by patient compliance, Patients will be asked by the study nurse how they are doing with their LIV therapy, Once monthly from Baseline to 12 months
This is a randomized phase II, two arm, single-center study designed to compare the effect of LIV versus wait-list control on the clinical parameter of energetic capacity, or power generation, in patients with early stage breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy over a 12-month period. The primary endpoint is the 12-month change in energetic capacity since baseline.

Primary Objective To compare the effect of LIV delivered for 10 minutes twice daily for 12 months on skeletal muscle function, in terms of energetic capacity measured by power generation on a stationary bicycle, among patients with early stage breast cancer planned to initiate aromatase inhibitor therapy who do not currently participate in regular exercise, compared to a wait- listed control

Secondary Objectives

1. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait-listed control upon muscle contractile properties including peak power, fatigue resistance, and recovery, measured by isokinetic knee extension
2. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control upon body composition (lean mass, total adiposity) measured by DXA scan
3. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control upon bone mineral density (T score) measured by DXA scan
4. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control upon muscle adipose infiltration measured by muscle density on peripheral quantitative CT imaging of the proximal and distal tibia and radius
5. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait-listed control on trabecular and cortical volumetric bone mineral density by high resolution peripheral quantitative CT of the distal and diaphyseal tibia and radius
6. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed control on serologic markers of bone turnover, including TGF-beta and NTX
7. To compare the effect of LIV versus wait- listed controls upon patient reported outcome measures of fatigue (measured by the Basic Fatigue Inventory), muscle ache, and joint pain (measured by PRO-CTCAE)
8. To describe the feasibility of LIV in this patient population, defined by patient compliance and follow up with the intervention
