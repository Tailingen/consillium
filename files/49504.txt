The Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Lactobacillus Johnsonii in Combination with CapeOX and Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of MSS/pMMR Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
The goal of this clinical trial is to verify the effectiveness and safety of Lactobacillus johnsonii in combination with CapeOX and Pembrolizumab for the treatment of MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The main questions it aims to answer are:

① To verify the effectiveness of Lactobacillus johnsonii in the treatment of MSS/pMMR type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have failed the standard regimen of chemotherapy;

② To explore the safety of Lactobacillus johnsonii in the treatment of MSS/pMMR type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have failed the standard regimen of chemotherapy.

Participants who meet all the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the CapeOX + Pembrolizumab + placebo group or the CapeOX + Pembrolizumab + Lactobacillus johnsonii group.
