Comparison of Voice Results at 5 Years of Treatment of Glottic Squamous Cell Carcinoma T1 by Surgery Versus Radiotherapy
Patients with early-stage squamous cell carcinomas of the vocal cord can be treated in an equivalent way in terms of carcinology by surgery or radiotherapy. The study will be to analyse the vocal outcome at 5 years of these two types of management in order to define whether one is superior to the other on this criterion of voice quality after treatment.

It consists in the attribution by a listening jury made up of two people of a mark ranging from 0 to 3 for each of the 6 items: Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain, Instability.
