A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of FP-1305 in Cancer Patients (MATINS)
This is a first in human study to identify whether FP-1305 is suitable to use in humans. The previous pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that FP-1305 binds to a receptor known as CLEVER-1. CLEVER-1 has been shown to support tumour growth. No significant adverse events were witnessed in primates and the dose used will be 300 fold lower than the dose provided to primates which showed no toxicity.

The patients with advanced melanoma, uveal melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, ER+ breast, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal, liver or anaplastic thyroid cancer who have exhausted all licenced therapeutic options will die due to their disease. Based on the investigator's existing data CLEVER-1 is expressed in these tumour types. Inhibition of CLEVER-1 with FP-1305 may have an anti-tumour effect in these patients.
Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: FP-1305 (bexmarilimab)
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in the Trial Subjects., Tolerable dose(s) will be determined by the TITE-CRM based on the occurrence/non-occurrence of dose limiting toxicities in the trial subjects., Up to one year|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Number of adverse events and serious adverse events. Adverse events are collected, graded and reported according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., approximately 4 years and 9 months|The Response Objective Response Rate (ORR) to the Treatment Was Planned to be Determined by Tumor Imaging According to RECIST 1.1., The objective response rate (ORR) to the treatment will be determined by tumour imaging (tumor size) according to RECIST v.1.1. Results from each tumour type, dose level and dosing frequency are reported separately., approximately 4 years and 9 months|The Disease Control Rate (DCR) Response to the Treatment Was Planned to be Determined by Tumor Imaging According to RECIST 1.1., The disease control rate (DCR) response to the treatment will be determined by tumour imaging (tumor size) according to RECIST v.1.1 are presented by cycles and by doing so there is no difference in the definition of DCR and Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), approximately 4 years and 9 months
