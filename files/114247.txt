Study of Plerixafor Combined With Cytarabine and Daunorubicin in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this research study is to determine if plerixafor can make cells more sensitive to killing by cytarabine and daunorubicin, an anti-cancer drug regimen referred to as "7+3" that is commonly used in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, plerixafor is used with treatments cytarabine and daunorubicin and with and without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF). Subjects will be monitored to see how well they tolerate the use of these drugs together and how well they work to treat the leukemia.

The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) per plerixafor dosing schedule (once daily \[QD\] or twice daily \[BID\]), and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), by assessing safety and tolerability of plerixafor (Mozobil®) when used in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin, and with and without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Plerixafor
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of plerixafor when used in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin and with and without GCSF, 28 days from first dose and up to 42 days following last dose
Anti-leukemia activity of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Beginning at Day 14 and then until complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), or treatment failure (TF)|Maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax) of Plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last observed concentration (AUC 0-last) of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (τ) (AUC 0-τ) of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞ ) of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Half-life (T½) of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Volume of distribution (Vz/F for SC administration; Vz for IV administration); in the case of multiexponential disposition, volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) will be calculated of plerixafor when used with cytarabine and daunorubicin, Cycle 1 (1 week)|Obtain preliminary data on safety , tolerability, PK, leukemia cell mobilization and anti-leukemia activity of plerixafor when used in conjunction with G-CSF, cytarabine and daunorubicin., Cycle 1 (1 week) and then until complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), or treatment failure (TF)
