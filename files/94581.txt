A Study of DCC-2701 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug DCC-2701 and whether it will work to help people who have advanced solid tumors or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
Locally Advanced Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumors|Cancers With MET Genomic Alterations|Cancers With TRK Genomic Alterations
DRUG: DCC-2701 tablet
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of DCC-2701, 28 days (1 cycle)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of DCC-2701, Cycle 1: Predose and up to 24 hours postdose (Cycle = 28 Days)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of DCC-2701, Cycle 1: Predose and up to 24 hours postdose (Cycle = 28 Days)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of DCC-2701, Cycle 1: Predose and up to 24 hours postdose (Cycle = 28 Days)|Number of Participants with Tumor Response according to Response Evaluations Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Baseline through study completion (estimated as 18 months)
This is a first-in-human study of DCC-2701. The primary purpose of this study is to determine what dose of DCC-2701, can be given safely to patients with advanced solid tumors.

The study will have two phases. The first phase will assess escalating doses of DCC-2701 in order to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the optimal dosing regimen (ODR) of DCC-2701. Once the MTD and ODR is established, a dose expansion phase will further evaluate the safety of DCC-2701, as well as the activity of DCC-2701 in select solid tumor types.
