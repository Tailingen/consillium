A Study of PRT811 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, CNS Lymphoma and Gliomas
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT811, a protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) 5 inhibitor, in subjects with advanced cancers and high-grade gliomas who have exhausted available treatment options. The purpose of this study is to define a safe dose and schedule to be used in subsequent development of PRT811.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Recurrent Glioma
DRUG: PRT811
To describe dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of PRT811, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated through the first cycle, Baseline through Day 21|To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD will be established for further investigation in participants with solid tumors and gliomas, Baseline through approximately 2 years|To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of PRT811, The RP2D will be established for further investigation in participants with solid tumors and gliomas, Baseline through approximately 2 years
To describe the adverse event profile and tolerability of PRT811, Adverse events as characterized by type, frequency, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study therapy, Baseline through approximately 2 years|To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of PRT811, PRT811 pharmacokinetics will be calculated including the maximum observed plasma concentration, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days) on Days 1, 8 and 14. For subsequent cycles, Day 1 of each cycle through the end of study treatment, an average of 6 months|To describe any anti-tumor activity of PRT811, Anti-tumor activity of PRT811 will be based on the measurement of objective responses, Baseline through approximately 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-expansion Phase 1 study of PRT811, a PRMT5 inhibitor, in subjects with advanced cancers without any approved or available treatment options including solid tumors, CNS lymphoma, and /or high-grade gliomas. The study will consist of 2 parts, a dose escalation part evaluating subjects with advanced solid tumors, CNS lymphoma, and/or high-grade glioma and a cohort expansion part which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRT811 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and glioblastoma multiforme. For subjects, the study will include a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a post treatment follow-up phase. An end-of-study visit will be conducted within 30 days after the last dose of PRT811.
