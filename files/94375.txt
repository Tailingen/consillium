XELOX Combined With Sintilimab and HBO for Advanced or Metastatic GC/GEJC
This study investigates the efficacy and safety of XELOX chemotherapy combined with sintilimab and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as a first-line treatment for patients with Advanced or Metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The trial comprises two phases: a phase Ib study to determine the optimal HBOT regimen and assess safety and tolerability, followed by a phase II study to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes include progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), 2-year overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life. This study aims to provide a novel approach for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and improving patient outcomes by leveraging HBOT to address tumor hypoxia and augment the effects of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

ORR, The primary outcome measure is the overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria. ORR will be evaluated based on imaging and clinical assessments conducted during the study., ORR will be assessed after 4 to 6 cycles of treatment (approximately 12 to 18 weeks). Evaluation will include imaging performed at baseline and at the end of the treatment cycles to determine the tumor response.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first documented disease progression, as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From the start of treatment to the first disease progression or death, assessed up to approximately 24 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria., After 4-6 cycles of treatment (approximately 12-18 weeks).|Downstaging Rate, Downstaging rate is defined as the proportion of patients whose tumors are successfully reduced in stage, enabling resection or improved therapeutic options, as determined by imaging and clinical evaluations., After 4-6 cycles of treatment (approximately 12-18 weeks).|2-Year Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Two-year disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the percentage of patients who remain free of disease recurrence after achieving disease control or response to treatment within the study period., From the start of treatment to 2 years post-treatment.|2-Year Overall Survival (OS), Two-year overall survival (OS) is defined as the percentage of patients who are still alive 2 years after initiating treatment, regardless of disease progression., From the start of treatment to 2 years post-treatment.|Adverse Events, Safety will be assessed based on the incidence, nature, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v5.0., From the start of treatment to the end of the study (up to approximately 24 months).|Quality of Life (QoL), Quality of life (QoL) will be evaluated using validated patient-reported outcome measures, such as the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, to assess the physical, emotional, and functional well-being of patients during and after treatment., Baseline, every 3 weeks during treatment, and every 12 weeks post-treatment, up to 24 months.
This is a prospective, single-arm, phase Ib/II clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the XELOX regimen combined with sintilimab and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in patients with Advanced or Metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

In the phase Ib portion, 9 patients will be enrolled to identify the optimal HBOT protocol and assess the safety and tolerability of the combined treatment. The dose and schedule of HBOT will be refined based on observed safety data and adverse events.

In the phase II portion, approximately 48 patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the efficacy of the XELOX plus sintilimab and HBOT combination. Patients will receive treatment in 3-week cycles, with HBOT administered alongside chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The primary endpoint of the phase II study is the overall response rate (ORR) assessed per RECIST 1.1 criteria.Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), 2-year overall survival (OS), safety profile, and patient-reported outcomes related to quality of life. Exploratory endpoints will focus on biomarker analysis and the role of HBOT in modulating tumor hypoxia.This study aims to explore whether HBOT can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy by addressing tumor hypoxia, a known factor contributing to therapy resistance in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers. The findings from this trial may provide insights into a novel multimodal treatment strategy for improving patient outcomes in advanced disease settings.
