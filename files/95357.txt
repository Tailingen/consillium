The SENTRY Study: Testing Whether Changes in Platelet RNA Enhance the Early Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of the SENTRY (Stability Enhanced Transcriptional Analytics) Study is to test whether combining a unique analytical approach with changes in platelet RNA expression accurately diagnoses ovarian cancer. Using retrospective data, the investigators have developed an approach that appears to accurately classify ovarian cancer with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. The SENTRY Study will build upon these retrospective analyses to prospectively recruit women with ovarian cancer or an ovarian mass (and healthy control women), obtain platelet RNA samples from whole blood, and perform validation analyses to test our hypothesis.
Ovarian Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Platelet RNA expression
Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer Detection, The goal is to determine if changes in platelet RNA expression accurately diagnoses ovarian cancer. This outcome will report the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative results from this assay., Following informed consent (study visit 1, day 1).
