Treatment of Recurrent Glioblastoma With Fractionated Radiotherapy Combined With Cadonilimab
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma with Cadonilimab combined with fractionated radiotherapy.
Recurrent Glioblastoma
RADIATION: fractionated radiotherapy|DRUG: cadonilimab
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), 3 months after treatment
Local control rate (LC), The proportion of patients without tumor progression on imaging of brain glioma lesions was evaluated by RANO standard., from date of enrollment to date of first documented local progression. Assessed up to 6 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants having complete response or partial response to protocol treatment. Objective response will be measured by RECIST 1.1., from date of enrollment to the date of first documented complete response or partial response. Assessed up to 6 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response, partial response, or stable disease based on RECIST Version 1.1., from date of enrollment to the date of progress. Assessed up to 6 months|progression-free survival (PFS), the probability of 6-month disease progression-free survival was evaluated by RANO standard after treatment., from date of enrollment to the date of first documented progression. Assessed up to 6 months|survival (OS) rate, Probability of survival for 6 months after treatment, from date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause. Assessed up to 6months
