Cervical Cancer Susceptible Population Classification
Cervical cancer is the third most common lethal tumor globally, causing around a quarter million deaths annually, despite the availability of HPV vaccines. Recent Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic markers linked to cervical cancer, including rs10175462, rs10007915, rs35721900, and rs61646675, which have been verified as being related to susceptibility to cervical cancer. However, many reports lack clarity, consistency, and validation. In this comprehensive study, we will analyze the genomic risk factors associated with cervical cancer, classify individuals into different risk categories, and explore potential biomarkers and therapeutics.
