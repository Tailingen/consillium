New Antigens Against Glioblastoma
In this study the investigators will select and develop potential therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for glioblastoma (GB). Activities include tissue microarray (TMA) to test monoclonal antibodies specificity and target distribution, selection of glioblastoma specific functional monoclonal antibodies, identification of candidate targets.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
Validation of the tumour specificity of the identified monoclonal antibodies, Candidate monoclonal antibodies will be tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on sections of glioblastoma tissue and healthy counterpart., 4 years
Generate the single chain Fab antibody fragments (scFv) and then develop the Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, After defining a subset of potentially highly selective \~7 monoclonal antibodies, together with the \~6 that showed preliminary activity in cytotoxic tests (either alone or conjugated), the investigators will perform a thorough analysis of their specificity on a TMA platform. After establishing the staining conditions, the investigators will test multiple tumor and multiple normal TMAs, 4 years
