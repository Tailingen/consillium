Phase II Study of Concurrent Radiotherapy With Envafolimab and Capecitabine in LAPC
This is a single-arm prospective phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent radiotherapy with envafolimab and capecitabine in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.Eligibility patients will receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy(IMRT)or volumetric modulated arc therapy(VMAT) to pancreatic lesions,metastatic lymph nodes and high-risk lymphatic drainage areas,concurrent with and followed by envafolimab and capecitabine.

ORR, Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the total of CR (Complete Response) and PR (Partial Response). CR and PR were assessed by independent reviewers according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. ORR evaluated in 1 to 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy., 1-3 months after radiotherapy

This is a single-arm prospective phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent radiotherapy with envafolimab and capecitabine in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.Primary enrollment criteria is locally advanced non-resectable pancreatic cancer without systemic metastases other than retroperitoneal lymph nodes.Eligibility patients will receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy(IMRT)or volumetric modulated arc therapy(VMAT) to pancreatic lesions,metastatic lymph nodes and high-risk lymphatic drainage areas,concurrent with and followed by envafolimab and capecitabine.Concurrent and sequential dose of envafolimab is 200mg subcutaneous injection weekly.Capecitabine is with a concurrent and sequential dose of 500-800 mg/m2 bid po , taken orally for 2 weeks and stopped for 1 week (standard concurrent dose is 800 mg/m2 bid po , but for patients â‰¥70 years of age, 500 mg/m2 bid po depending on physical status ) until progression or intolerance.
