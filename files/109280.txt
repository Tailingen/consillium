A Trial of CTT1403 for Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose level of study drug, CTT1403, that can be safely administered to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: CTT1403|DRUG: CTT1057|DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11
Frequency of Dose-limiting Toxicity at Escalating Dose Levels of CTT1403, The dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any of the following:

1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \> 5 consecutive days
2. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia
3. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting ≥ 7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding or requirement for platelet transfusion
4. Any nonhematologic, treatment-related AE ≥ Grade 3, with the exceptions of Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, non-clinically significant electrolyte abnormality, constipation, fever, fatigue, or skin rash that resolves to Grade ≤ 2 within 72 hours with optimal medical management
5. Any other treatment-related toxicity that results in delay of Cycle 2 administration of CTT1403 by \> 21 days and/or toxicity considered by the Investigator and Sponsor's medical representatives to be dose-limiting., 6-8 weeks from time of injection on Cycle 1 - Day 1|Objective Response Rate by RECIST v1.1 Criteria, Changes in only the largest diameters (unidimensional measurment) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria. Data presented as RECIST Overall Response., Cycle 1-Day 35, Cycle 2-Day 35, 30 Days After Last Dose, 8 Weeks Post-Treatment. Each cycle lasted 35 days.
Assessment of Organ Dosimetry of CTT1403 by SPECT/CT Imaging, Organ dosimetry was assessed via SPECT/CT imaging until two imaging periods have been collected in which study drug cannot be detected by SPECT/CT. Time points included (2 hrs ± 1 followed by 24±12 hrs, 48±12 hrs, and 168±24 hrs post-infusion on Cycle 1-Day 1. Data calculated using OLINDA. Absorbed dose is calculated as single value wherein absorbed dose is proportional to the integral of activity over time., 2 hrs ± 1 followed by 24±12 hrs, 48±12 hrs, and 168±24 hrs post-infusion on Cycle 1-Day 1|Number of Participants With Change in Patient Reported Pain as Measured by Brief Pain Index, The Brief Pain Index uses a scale of 0-10 to rate the severity of pain. A rating of 0 indicates no pain. A rating of 10 indicates the worst pain imaginable., Cycle 1-Day 1 and Cycle 2-Day 1. Each cycle lasted 35 days.|Assessment of Pharmacokinetics of CTT1403, The distribution half-life and the elimination half-life of CTT1403 were calculated., Samples were collected during Cycle 1 (timepoints start at the initiation of infusion): Day 1 (30 min +/- 5 min and 2 hrs +/- 30 min), Day 2 (24 hrs +/- 12 hrs), Day 3 (48 hrs +/- 12 hrs), Day 8 (168 hrs +/- 24 hrs), Day 15 (336 hrs +/- 24 hrs)
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human dose escalation/dose expansion study evaluating escalating doses of CTT1403 in patients with PSMA-avid mCRPC with progressive disease on at least one androgen signaling inhibitor, followed by a dose expansion to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and biological activity of CTT1403. CTT1403 is a PSMA-targeted 177Lu-labeled radiotherapy being developed for prostate cancer with a unique PSMA binding scaffold and an albumin binding moiety to extend circulation half-life. The PSMA binding scaffold is shared with CTT1057, a PSMA-specific PET diagnostic imaging agent shown in Phase 1 clinical trials to be specifically taken up by PSMA+ tumor. PSMA PET imaging by CTT1057 will be used diagnostically to select patients with PSMA-avid disease for treatment. The purpose of this study is to identify the dose limiting toxicity and recommended phase 2 dose of CTT1403. Eligible participants with demonstrated therapeutic benefit will be offered a second dose of study drug.
