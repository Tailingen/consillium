Liquid Biopsy for Detection of Driver Mutation in NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic efficacy of liquid biopsy in different specimens and in different methods compared with tissue detection .
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
GENETIC: detection of driver mutation
concordance between tissue and plasma using detection method such as droplet digital PCR(ddPCR) or next generation sequencing(NGS) to detect the driver mutation in NSCLC, 6 months
concordance between tissue and other specimens using detection method such as droplet digital PCR(ddPCR) or next generation sequencing(NGS) to detect the driver mutation in NSCLC, 6 months|changes of driver mutation in quality and quantity in the process of targeted treatment to predict the prognosis, 5 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) in patients who have had driver mutation and received the molecular target therapy, compare the PFS between each participants via the change of driver mutation, 3 years|Overall survival(OS) in patients who had driver mutation and received the molecular target therapy, compare the OS between each participants via the change of driver mutation, 5 years
Collect plasma and other specimens from patients who are newly diagnosed with NSCLC or with drug-resistant and plan to receive gene detection to complete the diagnostic test for liquid biopsy .Participants who come from diagnostic test and plan to receive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy will be collected plasma and other specimens every month during the regiments and monitor the changes of driver motion to predict the prognosis of targeted therapy.
