Maintenance Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma and Biological Marker
Colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under first-line chemotherapy are candidates for an convenient maintenance treatment.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|OTHER: placebo
DDC:Duration of Disease Control, progression-free survival of first-line chemotherapy with second-line chemotherapy, 2 years
OS:Overall Survival, measured from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of the last follow-up or death, 2 years|DCR:Disease Control Rate, This is defined as the occurrence of either a confirmed complete (CR),a partial response(PR)or stable disease(SD) as determined by the RECIST criteria from confirmed radiographic evaluations of target and non-target lesions., 2 years
Safety, Adverse events and laboratory tests graded according to the NCI-CTC AE Version 4., 2 years
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, with the morbidity of approximate 100 million cases per year. About 40% of patients present with metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and about 25% of patients with local lesion will ultimately develop metastatic disease.Therefore, our study is designed to investigate that colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under first-line chemotherapy are candidates for an convenient maintenance treatment.
