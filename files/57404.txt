A Study of Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ATG-010 Combined With Chemotherapy Sequential With ATG-010 Monotherapy Maintenance in Peripheral T- and NK/T-cell Lymphoma
This trial is proposed with treatment of ATG-010 combined with chemotherapy regimens which will be chosen by investigators (ICE \[ifosfamide+carboplatin+etoposide\] or GEMOX \[gemcitabine+oxaliplatin\] or Tislelizumab), after treatments of 2 to 6 cycles transferring to ATG-010 monotherapy maintenance treatment, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and primary efficacy of ATG-010 in R/R PTCL and NK/T-cell lymphoma patients.

AEs/SAEs, Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0., 18 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), To determine the overall response rate according to Chenson 2014., 18 months
Duration of response (DOR), Duration of time from first occurrence of CR or PR until the first date that disease progression is objectively documented., 18 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients who achieve CR, PR, or SD for a minimum of 4 weeks, following the first dose of study drug (i.e., CR+PR+SD), 4 weeks to 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Duration of time from the first dose of study drug until progression or death due to any cause, 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), Duration of time from the first dose of study drug until death due to any cause, 18 months
This trial is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib clinical study that will evaluate ATG-010 combined with chemotherapy regimen selected by investigators (ICE regimen ifosfamide+carboplatin+etoposide; Or GEMOX regimen: gemcitabine+oxaliplatin; Tislelizumab) sequential ATG 010 monotherapy maintenance, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and primary efficacy in R/R PTCL and NK/T-cell lymphoma patients. 97 patients are planned to be enrolled.
