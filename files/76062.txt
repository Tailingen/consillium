Lu-177 PSMA Treatment in Cell Renal Carcinoma
Summary Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) consists of 2% of all malignencies. RCCs are generally divided to histopathological subtypes as clear cell and non-clear cell variants. Clear cell variant responsible for the 75-80% of all RCCs. It is reported that 20-30% of RCCs are metastatic at the diagnosis and 5 years survival is approximately is 10-20% in this group of patients. Moreover, 60% of patients who are not metastatic at the diagnosis, develop metastates within 2-3 years. 2nd and 3th line effective treatment option in metastatic RCCs patients has been a subject of interest.

PSMA (protatate specific membrane antigen) with the other name glutamate carboxypeptidase, is a transmembrane protein and overexpresses in prostate adenocarcinomas and neoangiogenesis spots of endothelium of other several tumor types. It infronts as a target for theranostic consept for mainly prostate cancer in nuclear medicine. As a radionuclide treatment option, Lu-177 PSMA treatment is proved as safe and effective treatment option in castration resistant prostata cancer patients. After its widely use in prostate cancer, it is reported that PSMA molecule can be used for imaging of RCC patients and PSMA uptake is higher than 18F-FDG. For this reason, Lu-177 PSMA treatment can be a systemic treatment option in RCC patients who have progress afer 1st cycle treatment. In this study we aimed to safety and efficacy of Lu-177 PSMA treatment in metastatic RCC patients as systemic radionuclide treatment option.
