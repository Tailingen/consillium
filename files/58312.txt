Lapatinib in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Failed Prior Antihormone Therapy
Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer, comprising 70-80% of all breast cancers. Endocrine therapy is the main type of initial treatment for patients with your type of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is treatment that tries to remove, or block certain hormones from binding to the cancer cells and thus slow or stop the growth of cancer. Although most patients with your type of breast cancer respond initially to endocrine therapies, it can lose its effectiveness. New therapies for this type of cancer are needed.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: lapatinib
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) will be defined as the interval between the date of study initiation and the earliest date of disease progression, determined by tumor assessment., 12 months
Endocrine therapy forms the backbone of treatment for both early stage and advanced stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Although most patients with advanced estrogen receptor positive metastatic disease respond initially to endocrine therapies, this response is short lived. New therapies able to provide additional benefit to patients with hormone receptor positive, endocrine-resistant, advanced metastatic breast cancer are required. This study proposes to add lapatinib to endocrine therapy to treat hormone receptor positive HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients.
