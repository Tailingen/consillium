Trial on Lenalidomide Given as Maintenance Therapy for Relapsed Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
This phase II multi-institutional trial will explore the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide monotherapy given as maintenance therapy following salvage chemo-immunotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory chemosensitive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide
1-year Progression-free Survival, It is defined as the number of participants alive after 1 year from enrolment to progression or relapse of lymphoma (if post-induction disease status was PR (Partial Response) or CR (Complete Response), respectively). Patients alive at last follow-up will be censored., 1-year
Progression Free Survival, Secondary measures to describe long term outcome of treatment

-Progression free survival It is defined as the number of participants, on a 5 yrs follow up, free from disease progression, 5 years|Progression, Progression It is defined as the number of participants with disease recurrence observed on a 5 yrs follow up., 5 years|Duration of Response, Secondary measures to describe long term outcome of treatment

* Duration of response It is defined as the number of participants experiencing a PFS (Progression Free Survival) from study therapy longer than previous line of treatment, 5 years|Overall Survival, Secondary measures to describe long term outcome of treatment

-Overall survival It is defined as the number of participants alive at 5ys from enrolment (death for any cause). Patients alive at last follow-up will be censored., 5 years
Patients older than 65 years or younger but not eligible to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation with biopsy-proven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma relapsed to previous combination chemotherapy regimen ± rituximab, who achieved at least a partial response to second-line chemotherapy (ICE or DHAP/DHAOx ((D)examethasone (H)igh-dose (A)ra-C - cytarabine (P)latinol (cisplatin)) or MINE (Mesna Ifosfamide Mitoxantrone Etoposide) regimen) + rituximab will receive single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg once daily for 21 days out of 28, as maintenance treatment until progression of disease. Dose reductions of study drug will be made in case of adverse events when reported as correlated and when clinically appropriate.

One-year progression free survival (PFS) will be the primary endpoint and overall survival, response rate and toxicity will be the secondary endpoints. With the null hypothesis (P0) of 1-year PFS of 30%, this study will consider a satisfactory efficacy of lenalidomide worth of further investigation a P1 corresponding to a 1-yr PFS of 50% (that is an absolute increase of 20% in terms of 1-yr progression-free survival). Considering a standard type I error (α) of 0,05 and a power of 80% (Type 2 error of 20%) 47 patients will be necessary for the trial.
