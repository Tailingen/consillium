Trebananib (AMG 386) in Combination With Docetaxel for Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
This study plans to learn more about the combination of AMG 386 and docetaxel for the treatment of advanced urothelial cancer. Subjects are being asked to be in this research study because they have advanced urothelial cancer which has progressed after treatment with a platinum-based therapy.

The hypothesis is that AMG 386 will increase the historical response rate of docetaxel as a single agent.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: AMG 386|DRUG: Docetaxel
Response rate, Determine the objective response rate (by RECIST 1.1 criteria) for the combination of AMG 386 (Trebananib) with docetaxel for the treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, after failure of a platinum-containing regimen, Up to 21 days
Overall survival, Determine the overall survival for the combination of AMG 386 with docetaxel in advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, Up to 24 months
AMG 386 is a medication made to stop the growth of blood vessels in cancer tissues. Cancer relies on new blood vessels to bring it oxygen and nutrients to grow. Docetaxel is currently approved by the FDA for advanced urothelial, hormone-refractory prostate, breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
