Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Pancreas Adenocarcinoma|Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: Enfortumab vedotin
Overall Response Rate (ORR), To determine anti-tumor activity by overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1, Every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of study (approximately 2 years), whichever is earlier
