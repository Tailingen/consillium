Long-Term TARP Vaccination Using a Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Previously Vaccinated Men on NCI 09-C-0139
Background:

- Few studies or literature are available about the long-term safety of repeated peptide vaccinations in people over a period of time. Long-term vaccination may be needed to control tumors. Researchers gave a group of men a series of vaccine injections over 2 years. Now they want to give those same men the new version of the vaccine. They want to see if it produces different types of immune responses and also ensure that repeated vaccinations are safe.

Objectives:

- To find out the long-term safety of repeated T-cell receptor alternate reading frame protein (TARP) peptide vaccinations.

Eligibility:

- Men who took part in National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol 09-C-0139.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with blood tests, scans, physical exam, medical history, and an evaluation of how well they perform everyday activities.
* Participants will have apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood, minus the white cells, will be returned through a needle in the other arm.
* Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit, they will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.
* Participants will get vaccine injections at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24. The vaccine will be made from the participants own cells.
* Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to complete after receiving vaccine.
* The study lasts 96 weeks.

Change in Slope Log PSA From Pre-study Baseline (-12 Months to Entry on the Current Study) to the Change in Slope Log PSA at Weeks 3-24 and 3-48 Post Multi-Epitope (ME) T-cell Receptor Alternate Reading Frame Protein (TARP) Vaccination, "PSA slope log" was calculated using Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Prostate Cancer Nomograms (http://nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/PsaDoublingTime.aspx) Slope log represents the speed of change of a series of values. Thus, it is reported without any units as it is with a concept of ratio. The clinical meaning of PSA slope change would be decrease or increase of the "speed (velocity)" of changes in PSA, not the changes in PSA values. Decreasing PSA slope after the investigational treatment would mean the PSA rise is slower than pre-treatment baseline.

A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 82 months and 6 days
TARP

* T-cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is an amino acid protein expressed by both normal and malignant prostate cancer tissue; 95% of prostate cancer specimens are positive for TARP expression. TARP is highly expressed in prostate cancers of all Gleason types, in primary as well as metastatic disease, and in hormone sensitive and castrate resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, TARP is an ideal tumor antigen target for a vaccine.
* A prospective, randomized pilot study of 1st generation TARP Peptide vaccination National Cancer Institute (NCI 09-C- 0139) utilizing TARP WT 27-35 and EE29-37-9V peptides was conducted in HLAA\* 0201positive men with stage D0 prostate cancer prostate specific-antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence) and a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of greater than or equal to 3 months and less than or equal to 15 months. TARP vaccination was found to be immunogenic, safe and well tolerated, with adverse events limited to injection site reactions less than or equal to Grade 2. TARP vaccination was also associated with a decreased slope log PSA compared to pre-vaccination baseline in 72% of subjects reaching 24 weeks and 74% reaching 48 weeks (p=0.0012 and p=0.0004 for overall changes in slope log PSA, respectively); TARP vaccination also resulted in a 50% decrease in calculated tumor growth rate constant: prevaccine g = 0.0042/day, post-vaccine g = 0.0021/day (p=0.003); TARP-specific IFN- \>= enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) responses were detected in the majority of subjects but did not correlate with decreases in slope log (PSA).

Multi-Epitope (ME) TARP Vaccine

* The vaccine platform includes the original two 9-mer HLA-A\*0201 binding TARP peptide epitopes (WT27-35 and EE29-37-9V) utilized in NCI 09-C-0139 as well as an additional five 20-mer TARP peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids for a total of 7 peptides that span the amino acid sequence of the entire TARP protein.
* The advantage of this multi-epitope TARP peptide vaccine platform is that the overlapping epitopes cover the entire TARP protein, resulting in potential for induction of a multi-valent anti-TARP response. In addition, these longer synthetic peptides include TARP-specific MHC class II CD4 T lymphocytes (CD4+ T) cell helper epitopes that will allow generation of better cyctotoxic T cells (CD8+ T) cell responses with improved functional avidity and longevity as well as humoral anti-TARP antibody responses.
