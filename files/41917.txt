Evaluation of the accumulation of [68Ga]-NOTA-hGZP in tumor foci in participants receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy (absolute number of avid lesions per subject), Identification by the central reader of the number of avid lesions observed in each subject and the number of subjects with avid lesions seen on the PET images, up to one-hour post injection|Quantification of accumulation of [68Ga]-NOTA-hGZP in tumor foci in participants receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy., To be determined by region of interest analysis the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) (SUV does not have any units), up to one-hour post injection|Evaluate the correlation of [68Ga]-NOTA-hGZP accumulation in tumor foci to 6-month outcome., Compare quantified \[68Ga\]-NOTA-hGZP uptake to participant treatment response in individual lesions as assessed at 6-month clinical follow-up and/or CT assessments.

The number of lesions that were avid and the lesions that showed a decrease in size compared to those which increased in size., 6 months|Correlate uptake of [68Ga]-NOTA-hGZP tracer and granzyme B expression as assessed on optional excisional biopsy when available (melanoma only)., Compare granzyme B protein quantification from biopsied tissue to the \[68Ga\]-NOTA-hGZP PET uptake acquired at the same location., up to one-hour post injection
This is a first in human research study (Phase I clinical trial) to test the safety and effectiveness of a new radioactive PET imaging drug and biomarker \[68Ga\]-NOTA-hGZP. It is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized, two dose study to evaluate the safety of \[68Ga\]-NOTA-hGZP and the ability to predict the clinical response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy within 2 cycles of treatment.
