Hypofractionation With Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Early Breast Cancer
Simultaneous integrated boost radiotherapy has been investigated in some malignant tumors and appears to be safe and feasible. However, Hypofractionation with simultaneous integrated boost has been investigating in breast cancer.

Investigators initiated this phase II prospective trial to analyse acute toxicity of hypofractionation with simultaneous integrated boost in patients with early breast cancer.
