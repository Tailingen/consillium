Prostatic Artery Embolization for the Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to learn if the prostatic artery embolization procedure can reduce urinary tract symptoms in patients with enlarged prostates and prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Prostatic artery embolization
Mean change from baseline in symptom score using the International Prostate Symptom Scale (IPSS), Patients will be classified into one of 3 symptom severity categories based on their total IPSS score as follows:

Mildly symptomatic: 0-7 Moderately symptomatic: 8-19 Severely symptomatic: 20-35, 2 months
Mean change from baseline in maximal urinary flow measured, at baseline, 2 months, and 12 months after intervention|Mean change from baseline in post-void residual measured, at baseline, 2 months, and 12 months after intervention|Mean change from baseline in prostate volume measure, at baseline, 2 months, and 12 months after intervention|Mean change from baseline in international prostate symptom scale to measure long term subjective outcomes measured, Patients will be classified into one of 3 symptom severity categories based on their total IPSS score as follows:

Mildly symptomatic: 0-7 Moderately symptomatic: 8-19 Severely symptomatic: 20-35, at baseline, 2 months, and 12 months after intervention|Mean change from baseline prostate specific antigen measure, at baseline, 2 months, and 12 months after intervention
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

1. To evaluate the symptomatic improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms after prostatic artery embolization (PAE)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

1. To evaluate objective measures of improved urinary obstruction after PAE: urine flow rate, prostate volume, and post-void residual
2. To measure effects of PAE on prostate specific antigen (PSA).
3. To evaluate if PAE reduces the prostate volume and simplifies radiation therapy
4. To evaluate the safety of PAE performed in this patient population
