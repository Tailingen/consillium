Epigenetic Reprogramming in Relapse/Refractory AML
This is a pilot study using decitabine and vorinostat before and during chemotherapy with fludarabine, cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG).
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Filgrastim (G-CSF)|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cytarabine
The dose of decitabine that can be safely given with vorinostat, fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG), The incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be measured. The maximum tolerated dose will be the highest study dose at which 1 or fewer of six patients experience DLT during cycle 1 of therapy, during course 1, approx 5 weeks
To examine peripheral blood mononuclear cells for immunophenotypic changes., To examine peripheral blood mononuclear cells for immunophenotypic changes using peripheral blood samples, approx 8 weeks|To analyze plasma for cytokine content., To analyze plasma for cytokine content using plasma samples., approx 8 weeks|To analyze the correlation between biological changes and clinical response., To analyze the correlation between biological changes and clinical response using standard statistical methods, approx 8 weeks|To establish the extent of hypomethylation of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) pre- and post- decitabine and vorinostat treatment:, Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) will be used to analyze the genome-wide methylation profiles on a single nucleotide level; To quantitatively assess global changes in DNA methylation, a LINE-methylation assay will be utilized and specific genes monitored through advanced Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip from Illumina. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies specific for histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) and repression (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and isotype controls, followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq); RNA sequencing analysis will be used to measure global transcriptome changes. Profiles of CD33+ umbilical cord blood cells, whole bone marrow, or Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSCs) will be used as normal controls for each sample., approx 8 weeks|To analyze the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression pre- and post-treatment with decitabine and vorinostat., Assessment of the in vivo effects of combined DNMTi/HDACi on the functional epigenetic profile by comparing the following in paired pre- (Day 0) and post-exposure (Day 5, Day 14 and Day 35) leukemic blasts: Reversal of DNA promoter hypermethylation of "repressed" genes of interest using RRBS, validated with Pyrosequencing-based methylation assay; Increase in H3K9/14 acetylation in association with "repressed" genes of interest using H3K9/14 ChIP-seq, validated with ChIP-qPCR; Reversal of transcriptional silencing of "repressed" genes of interest using RNA seq, validated by qRT-PCR. Since significant acute cell kill is unlikely during the 5-day "window" of DNMTi/HDACi, we will have a unique opportunity to assess the in vivo effects of epigenetic therapy with the Day 5 sample. The Day 14 peripheral blood and Day 35 marrow samples will also contribute in patients whose leukemic blasts persist at these time points., approx 8 weeks
Decitabine is a demethylating agent and vorinostat is a HDAC inhibitor. The use of demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors in combination have been previously shown to have synergistic effects in altering neoplastic pathways of cancer cells and be well tolerated in human clinical studies. With the ability of decitabine and vorinostat to alter the abnormal cellular pathways of leukemic blasts and essentially turn off anti-apoptotic proteins, the leukemia cells have become primed for cytotoxic cell kill via chemotherapeutic agents. This study will ask the question as to whether or not the combination of decitabine and vorinostat followed by chemotherapy is feasible and whether it can positively impact outcome in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia.
