MWA With or Without Furmonertinib for Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a single-center randomized trial that investigates microwave ablation (MWA) combined with EGFR-TKI therapy in 120 early-stage NSCLC patients (T1-T2N0M0, EGFR-mutant) unsuitable for standard treatments. Participants are stratified by tumor characteristics and randomized equally to MWA alone, MWA-TKI concurrent, or TKI induction followed by MWA-TKI, assessing disease-free survival, overall survival, and safety outcomes. The study compares the clinical benefits and optimal sequencing of local ablation with targeted therapy in early-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC management.

3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in the MWA-TKI and TKI-MWA-TKI groups, The proportion of subjects who remain free from disease recurrence or death from the start of treatment until 3 years post-treatment., From the time of treatment to the time of disease progression or death, assessed up to 3 year
1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates in the MWA-TKI and TKI-MWA-TKI groups, The proportion of subjects who remain free from disease recurrence or death from the start of treatment until 1year post-treatment or 2 years post-treatment., From the time of treatment to the time of disease progression or death, assessed up to 1 year or 2 year|1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates in the MWA-TKI and TKI-MWA-TKI groups, The proportion of subjects who remain alive from the start of treatment until 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-treatment., From the time of treatment to the time of death, assessed up to 1 year, 2 year and 3 year.|Overall survival (OS) in the MWA-TKI and TKI-MWA-TKI groups, The time from the start of treatment to the subject's death or the last follow-up., From the time of treatment to the time of death, assessed up to 5 year.|1-year, 2-year, and 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates in the MWA group., The proportion of subjects who remain free from disease recurrence or death from the start of treatment until 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-treatment., From the time of treatment to the time of disease progression or death, assessed up to 1 year, 2 year or 3 year.|1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates in the MWA group, The proportion of subjects who remain alive from the start of treatment until 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-treatment., From the time of treatment to the time of death, assessed up to 1 year, 2 year and 3 year.|Overall survival (OS) in the MWA group, The time from the start of treatment to the subject's death or the last follow-up., From the time of treatment to the time of death, assessed up to 5 year.|The incidence of adverse events (AEs), AEs include procedure-related adverse reactions during or after MWA and drug-related adverse reactions caused by targeted therapy., 24 months after treatment|Exploration of potential predictive biomarkers and synergistic effects of MWA combined with targeted therapy, By comparing pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsy specimens, peripheral blood samples, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, this study investigates changes in local lesions and the systemic microenvironment, including biomarkers, metabolites, and the immune microenvironment, and their relationship with efficacy and prognosis. Additionally, potential regulatory pathways are explored. Furthermore, by comparing the three groups, the study examines whether MWA combined with targeted therapy can produce synergistic effects, whether these effects are related to the timing of targeted therapy, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms of such synergy., Disease progression or up to 2 years (whichever occurs first)
This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, exploratory study enrolling patients with mixed ground-glass or solid lesions on CT, histologically or cytologically confirmed as NSCLC, harboring EGFR mutations, and clinically staged as Ia, Ib, or IIa (size ≤5 cm, T1-T2N0M0). Patients deemed unsuitable for or refusing surgery/radiotherapy after multidisciplinary assessment were included. Eligible participants who provided informed consent were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into three groups: microwave ablation alone (MWA), MWA combined with targeted therapy (MWA-TKI), or targeted therapy induction followed by MWA combined with targeted therapy (TKI-MWA-TKI). Randomization was stratified by solid tumor proportion (\<50% vs ≥50%), tumor size (8-30 mm vs \>30 mm), and EGFR mutation status (Ex19del vs Ex21 L858R). The study aims to enroll 120 participants. The primary endpoints include disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and the incidence of adverse events. The study evaluates the efficacy, safety, and clinical benefits of MWA combined with EGFR-TKI therapy in early-stage NSCLC, comparing different treatment sequences.
