S0715: Acetyl-L-Carnitine in Preventing Neuropathy in Women With Stage I, II, or IIIA Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemo
RATIONALE: Acetyl-L-carnitine may prevent or lessen neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether acetyl-L-carnitine is more effective than a placebo in preventing neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying acetyl-L-carnitine to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing neuropathy in women with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

12-week FACT-Taxane Neurotoxicity Model-adjusted Score in ALC and Placebo Groups, Compare whether treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride vs placebo prevents symptoms of neuropathy as measured by the 11-item neurotoxicity (NTX) component of the Functional Assesment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Taxane Questionnaire at 12 weeks after study registration in women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy. Linear regression model adjusted for baseline score, taxane regiment, and age. Lower scores indicate worse CIPN. Total possible range is 0 to 64.

Linear regression model adjusted for baseline score, taxane regiment, and age. Lower scores indicate more fatigue. Total possible range is 0 to 52.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare whether treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride vs placebo prevents symptoms of neuropathy as measured by the 11-item neurotoxicity component of the FACT-Taxane Questionnaire at 12 weeks after study registration in women with stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer undergoing adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy.

Secondary

* Compare the functional status of these patients using the Trial Outcome Index from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Taxane Questionnaire.
* Compare fatigue in these patients using the Function Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Symptom Module.

Other

* Compare the proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neuropathy.
* Compare serum nerve growth factor levels in these patients.
* Describe the total dose of taxane received and treatment delays, compliance with therapy, and use of concurrent medications, dietary supplements (e.g., glutamine), vitamin E, and complementary and alternative medicines in these patients.
* Explore the relationship between nerve growth factor levels and the degree of neuropathy and functional status in these patients.
* Explore the relationship between genetic markers responsible for taxane metabolism and clearance (e.g., CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1, and GSTP1) and the degree of neuropathy in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for breast cancer (paclitaxel weekly for 12 weeks vs paclitaxel biweekly for 4 courses \[8 weeks\] vs paclitaxel biweekly for 6 courses \[12 weeks\] vs docetaxel every 3 weeks for 4 courses \[12 weeks\] vs docetaxel every 3 weeks for 6 courses \[18 weeks\]) and age (\< 60 years vs â‰¥ 60 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride 3 times daily for 24 weeks.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times daily for 24 weeks. Patients complete the FACT-Taxane Trial Outcome Index and the FACIT-Fatigue Symptom Module questionnaires at baseline, at 12, 24, and 36 weeks, and at 1 and 2 years.

Blood samples are collected at baseline and at week 12 for biomarker analysis (nerve growth factor levels) by ELISA, DNA extraction, and genotyping analysis.
