Rilvegostomig + Chemotherapy as Adjuvant Therapy for Biliary Tract Cancer After Resection (ARTEMIDE-Biliary01)
A global study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rilvegostomig compared to placebo in combination with investigator's choice of chemotherapy in participants with BTC after surgical resection with curative intent.
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Rilvegostomig|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine/Cisplatin|DRUG: S-1 [Tegafur/Oteracil/gimeracil]
Recurrence free survival (RFS) for Arm A vs. Arm B, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) is defined as the time from randomization until the date of radiological recurrence guided by RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 5 years
Overall Survival (OS) for Arm A vs. Arm B, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., up to 7 years
Patient-reported tolerability Arm A vs. Arm B., Patient-reported tolerability is a multi-component endpoint defined as the proportion of participants in each arm reporting side effect bother, clinically meaningful impact on physical functioning and descriptive data on treatment-related symptoms., Up to approximately 7 years.|Progression Free Survival (PFS) following recurrence Arm A vs. Arm B., Progression-free survival following recurrence is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest progression event after the start of the first subsequent therapy or death., Up to approximately 7years
This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rilvegostomig compared to placebo in combination with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, S-1(tegafur/ gimeracil/ oteracil) or gemcitabine/cisplatin) as adjuvant treatment in participants with BTC after resection with curative intent. This study will be conducted in patients with BTC who are at risk of recurrence after resection with curative intent.
