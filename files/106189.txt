An Open Label Navigational Investigation of Molecular Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy for Patients With Incurable Hematologic Malignancies (I-PREDICT Heme)
The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective study that is histology-independent personalized navigation approach to cancer therapy based upon tumor molecular profile as determined by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified comprehensive genomic analysis. The molecular mutation profile will then be matched to existing, FDA-approved, targeted agents or to existing clinical trials using investigational agents for treatment of patients with incurable hematologic malignancies for whom no effective standard therapy exists or who have either exhausted or are intolerant of standard options.
Hematologic Cancer
