Efficacy of Auricular Pressure Beans with Electroacupuncture and Estazolam Treating Insomnia Caused by Cancer
The core objectives of this study are to assess the short-term and long-term efficacy of auricular acupoint pressure beans combined with electroacupuncture and estazolam in the treatment of cancer-caused insomnia. The study aims to accurately compare the differences between this combination therapy and standard Western medicine in improving sleep quality and effectively alleviating anxiety and depression. Additionally, it will meticulously observe the safety of the combined treatment and record the occurrence and potential causative factors of any adverse reactions.

The Insomnia Severity Index(ISI), The scale is a simple tool used for screening insomnia, consisting of 7 items designed to assess the nature and symptoms of sleep disturbances in the subjects., Data will be collected at the end of the 0th, 4th, and 8th weeks of treatment and during follow-up (12th, 16th, and 20th weeks).
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is used to assess the sleep quality of subjects over the past month . It consists of 9 self-rated items and 5 other-rated items, with a total of 18 items grouped into 7 factors. Each factor is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, and the cumulative scores of the factor components make up the total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality., Data will be collected at the end of the 0th, 4th, and 8th weeks of treatment and during follow-up (12th, 16th, and 20th weeks).|Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA), The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) includes 14 items and is one of the most widely used clinician-administered scales in psychiatry. It is primarily used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms in patients with neuroses and other conditions., Data will be collected at the end of the 0th, 4th, and 8th weeks of treatment and during follow-up (12th, 16th, and 20th weeks).|Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HAMD), The scale includes 24 items and is primarily scored through the clinician's observation and questioning of the patient, aiming to provide a comprehensive assessment of various aspects of depression., Data will be collected at the end of the 0th, 4th, and 8th weeks of treatment and during follow-up (12th, 16th, and 20th weeks).
This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of auricular pressure beans combined with electroacupuncture and estazolam in treating cancer-caused insomnia. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a control group and an experimental group, each consisting of 30 patients.Patients in the control group will follow the standard estazolam treatment program, with the drug dosage adjusted according to individual conditions to achieve the best therapeutic effect. In the experimental group, auricular pressure points and electroacupuncture will be skillfully integrated with estazolam treatment. The auricular pressure points will be carefully selected based on their relation to insomnia (e.g., Shenmen, heart, sympathetic) and will be replaced once or twice a week. Electroacupuncture will target key acupoints such as Baihui, Shenmen, and Sanyinjiao, with each session lasting 30 minutes and conducted twice a week.Data collection will involve the Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and other assessments through questionnaires and clinical evaluations at the end of the 0th, 4th, and 8th weeks of treatment, as well as during follow-up (12th, 16th, and 20th weeks). All adverse reactions occurring throughout the treatment process will be closely monitored and recorded, including both drug-related and non-drug-related adverse reactions. Professional statistical software will be used to analyze the data rigorously, comparing dynamic changes in various indicators between the experimental and control groups before and after treatment, thereby scientifically assessing the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment for cancer-related insomnia. This rigorous study design and comprehensive data analysis aim to provide new perspectives and evidence for treating cancer-related insomnia.
