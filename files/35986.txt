Part 1 of the study is dose evaluating and aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of AMG 424 while determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or biologically active dose in subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma.

Part 2 of the study will further evaluate safety and tolerability of the AMG 424 MTD dose determined in Part 1, in groups of subjects with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma that include those with high or low cytogenetic risk.
