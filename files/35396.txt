Clinical Evaluation of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay on the BD Viper™ LT System With Cervical Specimens
The purpose of the study is to compare the results of the Becton Dickinson (BD) Onclarity™ Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Assay on the BD Viper™ LT instrument from liquid-based cytology (LBC) media diluted in BD HPV LBC diluent to adjudicated histology results from biopsy and a molecular composite comparator.

DEVICE: BD Onclarity™ HPV assay on BD Viper™ LT|PROCEDURE: Colposcopy
Sensitivity of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay for the Detection Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)2 or Greater, Sensitivity is calculated: Number of subjects with a positive BD Onclarity™ HPV test with adjudicated histology results of CIN2 or greater divided by the total number of subjects with adjudicated histology results of CIN2 or greater (multiplied by 100)., Up to 14 weeks|Sensitivity of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay for the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)3 or Greater, Sensitivity is calculated: Number of subjects with a positive BD Onclarity™ HPV test with adjudicated histology results of CIN3 or greater divided by the total number of subjects with adjudicated histology results of CIN3 or greater (multiplied by 100)., Up to 14 weeks|Specificity of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay for Detecting Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)2 or Greater, Specificity is calculated: Number of subjects with a negative BD Onclarity™ HPV test with adjudicated histology results of CIN2 or greater divided by the total number of subjects with adjudicated histology results of less than CIN2 (multiplied by 100)., Up to 14 weeks|Specificity of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay for Detecting Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)3 or Greater, Specificity is calculated: Number of subjects with a negative BD Onclarity™ HPV test with adjudicated histology results of CIN3 or greater divided by the total number of subjects with adjudicated histology results of less than CIN3 (multiplied by 100)., Up to 14 weeks|Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay for Detecting Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)., Positive Predictive Value is calculated: Number of subjects with a positive result for the BD Onclarity™ HPV test and adjudicated histology results of CIN2 or greater divided by the total number of subjects with positive result for the BD Onclarity™ HPV test (multiplied by 100). Similar for CIN3 or greater., Up to 14 weeks|Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay for Detecting Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)., Negative Predictive Value is calculated: Number of subjects with a negative result for the BD Onclarity™ HPV test and histology results less than CIN2 divided by the total number of subjects with negative results for the BD Onclarity™ HPV test (multiplied by 100). Similar for CIN3 or greater., Up to 14 weeks|Likelihood Ratio for the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2 or Greater)., The likelihood ratio for each BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome summarizes how many times more (or less) likely subjects with CIN2 or greater disease are to have that particular BD HPV Onclarity™ test outcome than subjects without the disease. Significant likelihood ratios (defined in cases where 1 is not contained within the 95% confidence interval) indicate that a test result is informative., Up to 14 weeks|Likelihood Ratio for the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN3 or Greater)., The likelihood ratio for each BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome summarizes how many times more (or less) likely subjects with CIN3 or greater disease are to have that particular BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome than subjects without the disease. Significant likelihood ratios (defined in cases where 1 is not contained within the 95% confidence interval) indicate that a test result is informative., Up to 14 weeks|Absolute Risk for the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2 or Greater)., The Absolute Risk (AR) of CIN2 or greater disease for each BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome is the probability of the disease for that particular BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome. A higher absolute risk indicates a higher probability overall for an event to occur., Up to 14 weeks|Absolute Risk for the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN3 or Greater)., The Absolute Risk (AR) of CIN3 or greater disease for each BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome is the probability of the disease for that particular BD Onclarity™ HPV test outcome. A higher absolute risk indicates a higher probability overall for an event to occur., Up to 14 weeks|Relative Risk of the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2 or Greater)., Relative Risk is the ratio between two different absolute risks. The relative risk of having CIN2 or greater disease will be evaluated to compare two different BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay test outcomes., Up to 14 weeks|Relative Risk of the Detection of Cervical Disease as Defined by Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN3 or Greater)., Relative Risk is the ratio between two different absolute risks. The relative risk of having CIN3 or greater disease will be evaluated to compare two different BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay test outcomes., Up to 14 weeks|Positive Percent Agreement of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay as Compared to a Composite HPV Comparator Incorporating Results for the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV Test and PCR/Sequencing on Both Strands of the PCR Amplicon (Bidirectional Sequencing), Positive percent agreement is calculated: Number of subjects with a positive BD Onclarity™ HPV test with composite comparator positive divided by the total number of subjects with composite comparator positive (multiplied by 100)., Up to 14 weeks|Negative Percent Agreement of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Assay Compared to a Composite HPV Comparator Incorporating Results for the Digene HC2 HPV Test and PCR/Sequencing on Both Strands of the PCR Amplicon (Bidirectional Sequencing), Negative percent agreement is calculated: Number of subjects with a negative BD Onclarity™ HPV test with composite comparator negative divided by the total number of subjects with composite comparator negative (multiplied by 100)., Up to 14 weeks|Non-reportable Rate of the BD Onclarity™ HPV Test, Non-reportable rate is calculated as the number of non-reportable BD Onclarity™ HPV test results divided by the total number of BD Onclarity™ HPV test results (multiplied by 100). Not included in this calculation are specimens that did not yield a result due to specimen labeling, processing and volume issues., Up to 14 weeks|Number of Participants With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)2 or Greater and CIN3 or Greater Within Each Cytology Category., Prevalence is calculated as the rate of CIN2 or greater and CIN3 or greater within each cytology category., Up to 14 weeks
