A Study of the Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) Using B10 L-BPA in Malignant Brain Tumors
This Phase I/II study, titled 'A Phase I/II Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of the Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) using B10 L-BPA as Boron Carrier in Malignant Brain Tumors.', aims to assess the efficacy of B10 L-BPA with BNCT in patients with malignant brain tumors. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BNCT with B10 L-BPA for malignant brain tumors treatment, using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as the standard for assessment.
Malignant Brain Tumors
DRUG: B10 L-BPA Injection
Safety of BNCT using B10 L-BPA in treating malignant brain tumors, Safety will be assessed by monitoring the occurrence, severity, and relationship of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including serious adverse events and events leading to permanent discontinuation of therapy, according to protocol definitions and CTCAE v5.0., 6 months|Efficacy of BNCT using B10 L-BPA in treating malignant brain tumors, Efficacy of BNCT with B10 L-BPA for treating malignant brain tumors will be assessed by the percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Tumor response will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1 criteria via high-resolution CT or MRI., 6 months
Progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time from receiving the B10 L-BPA-based BNCT until progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whenever comes the first. PFS is evaluated by imaging according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria., 6 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated questionnaire that evaluates cancer patients' quality of life through functional, symptom, and global health scales. It primarily using a 4-point scale (1='Not at All' to 4='Very Much'), and a 7-point scale for two items, where higher scores indicate more symptoms., 6 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by the EORTC QLQ-BN20 Questionnaire, The EORTC QLQ-BN20 is a validated module for brain tumor patients that assesses disease- and treatment-specific symptoms such as motor dysfunction, communication issues, and visual or cognitive changes. It uses a 4-point scale (1 = "Not at All" to 4 = "Very Much"), where higher scores indicate more severe symptoms., 6 months
The population of circulating immune cells, Blood samples will be collected to assess MDSCs, T cells and IL-1Î² at multiple time points: before and after BNCT. This approach aims to clarify whether the levels of circulating immune cells could serve as prognostic indicators for BNCT treatment outcomes., 6 months
