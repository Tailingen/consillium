A Randomized Two-Arm Proof of Concept Study Testing a Novel Approach to Exercise Promotion Based on Affect-regulation
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of an affect-based exercise prescription on moderate-vigorous physical activity participation among survivors of breast cancer who completed primary treatment within the last 5 years. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Do at least 50% of participants assigned to the affect-based exercise prescription engage in ≥90 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity by the end of 12-weeks follow-up?
2. What level of satisfaction do breast cancer survivors who receive the affect-based exercise prescription report relative to breast cancer survivors who receive an effort-based exercise prescription.
3. What proportion of participants assigned to the affect-based exercise prescription stay enrolled in the study relative to the number of participants who stay enrolled in the effort-based exercise prescription.

All participants will:

* Be assigned to either the Affect-based exercise prescription or the Effort-based exercise prescription.
* Participate in two meetings with a member of the study team meant to help them get started increasing weekly exercise. These meetings are the same for all participants.
* Be asked to wear an activity monitor and respond to brief surveys for 10 straight days at 4 points in time: Baseline, 2weeks, 6weeks, and 12weeks.

Average Minutes of Daily Moderate-vigorous Physical Activity Measured Using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT Accelerometer at 2 Weeks Follow-up, The research grade ActiGraph wGT3X-BT model is a valid measure of physical activity intensity and duration among multiple populations, including breast cancer survivors. Minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity will be collected from the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT every day for 10-days. Average minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity completed per day of valid wear time will be calculated., 2-weeks follow-up assessment.|Average Minutes of Daily Moderate-vigorous Physical Activity Measured Using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT Accelerometer at 6 Weeks Follow-up, The research grade ActiGraph wGT3X-BT model is a valid measure of physical activity intensity and duration among multiple populations, including breast cancer survivors. Minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity will be collected from the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT every day for 10-days.

Minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity will be collected from the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT every day for 10-days. Average minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity completed per day of valid wear time will be calculated., 12-weeks follow-up assessment.
Satisfaction With Study Participation as Measured by the Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire, An 8-item self-report questionnaire used to assess participant satisfaction with study participation using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 . Scores are summed and then averaged; total scores range from 1- 4. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction., 12-weeks follow-up assessment.|Study Retention at 2-weeks Follow-up, Number of participants who complete the 2-week follow-up assessment out of the number of participants who enroll in the study., 2-weeks follow-up assessment.|Study Retention at 6-weeks Follow-up, Number of participants who complete the 6-week follow-up assessment out of the number of participants who enroll in the study., 6-weeks follow-up assessment.|Study Retention at 12-weeks Follow-up, Number of participants who complete the 12-week follow-up assessment out of the number of participants who enroll in the study., 12-weeks follow-up assessment.|Acceptability of the Affect-regulated Exercise Prescription Measured Using the Treatment Acceptability and Preferences (TAP) Measure, A 4-item self-report questionnaire used to measure acceptability of the affect-regulated exercise prescription using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Total scores range from 0 - 16. Higher scores indicate greater acceptability., 12-weeks follow-up assessment.|Change in Voluntary Exercise Behavior Measured Using The Voluntary Exercise Questionnaire, A 6-item self-report measure of exercise performed over the last month and week. Two items range from 1 (never) to 7 (often) and four items range from 0 (0 days per week) to 7 (7 days per week). Total scores range from 2-21. Higher scores reflect higher levels of voluntary exercise behavior., Baseline, 6-weeks follow-up, and 12-weeks follow-up.|Change in Physical Activity Category Completed in the Past Month Measured Using the Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (L-Cat), A single item self-report measure that present six statements describing various levels of monthly physical activity. Response options range from 1 (I did not do much physical activity) to 6 (I did vigorous activities almost daily). Total scores range from 1-6. Higher scores reflect more vigorous, more frequent physical activities completed in the past month., Baseline, 6-weeks follow-up, and 12-weeks follow-up.|Change in Physical Activity using The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Short Form, A 7-item self-report measure calculating the amount of health-related vigorous and moderate-intensity physical activity as well as sitting time performed by adult participants over a one-week period. The number of minutes per day participants report for 3 categories vigorous, moderate, and walking activities are multiplied by the average metabolic equivalent (METs) for each category (8.0 METs, 4.9 METs, and 3.3 METs, respectively). Scores for each category are summed to calculate a physical activity score for the past week quantified as total MET values. Higher METS demonstrate a higher total volume of physical activity completed in the prior week. MET values between 0-599 are considered "low active," MET values between 600-1499 are considered "moderately active," and MET values 1500 or higher are considered "High active." This measure also assesses participants' total sitting time in the past week. Total number of minutes reported for sitting time is not part of the physical activity, Baseline, 6-weeks follow-up, and 12-weeks follow-up.
Change Overtime in Cancer-related Fatigue Measured Using the PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a, An 8-item self-report measure with response options ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) and fatigue interference ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always) over the past 7 days. Total scores range from 8 - 40. Higher scores reflect more fatigue., Baseline and 12-weeks follow-up assessments.|Change Overtime in Health-related Quality of Life Measured Using the PROMIS Global Health Scale, A 10-item self-report measure with response options ranging from 1 (poor/never/not at all) to 5 (excellent/completely/always) for items 1-9 and 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) for the item 10.
