Management of Ovarian Masses in Pediatric Patients: an Italian Survey
Objectives: The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) provides a specific terminology for adult ovarian masses, while, currently, there is no systematic classification for preoperative assessment of adnexal lesions in childhood and adolescence. This study aims to survey Italian pediatric surgeons to evaluate ovarian masses' management (from diagnosis to treatment) in patients aged 1-18.

Methods: A 27-question survey was distributed. It consisted of questions regarding the management and use of ultrasound and IOTA terminology in diagnosing ovarian masses in childhood and adolescence, in emergency regimes and in planned surgeries.
