Tranexamic Acid Use to Reduce Blood Transfusion in Pediatric Cancer Patients Undergoing Limb Salvage Procedure
This is a randomized double-blind control trial evaluating the use Tranexamic acid (TXA) to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements in pediatric and young adult cancer patients undergoing a limb salvage procedure that frequently requires perioperative or post-operative transfusions of blood products.

Primary Objective

* To evaluate the difference in intra-or post-operatively transfused blood volume (mL/kg) for patients undergoing limb salvage procedures of the distal femur or proximal tibia who are randomized to receive perioperative tranexamic acid (TXA) versus placebo.

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate changes in platelets and in hemoglobin from pre-op to post-op level for patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.
* To evaluate differences in post-operative daily surgical drain output for patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.
* To evaluate changes in estimated blood loss (EBL) for patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.
* To evaluate the association between the intra-or post-operatively transfused blood volume and estimated blood loss (EBL) for patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA and placebo, respectively.

Exploratory Objectives

* To evaluate differences in functional outcomes post-operatively for patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.
* To explore if significant correlations are observed between parameters reported with rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEMÂ®) and EBL and transfusion requirements in pediatric and young adult patients undergoing limb salvage procedure who are randomized to perioperative TXA versus placebo.
* To evaluate differences in the prevalence and management of wound complications such as superficial or periprosthetic infections, wound dehiscence, contact dermatitis, post- operative hematomas, or any other clinically significant wound complication between patients randomized to receive perioperative TXA versus placebo.

To Evaluate the Difference in intra-or Post-operatively Transfused Blood Volume (mL/kg) for Patients Undergoing Limb Salvage Procedures of the Distal Femur or Proximal Tibia Who Are Randomized to Receive Perioperative Tranexamic Acid (TXA) Versus Placebo., The intra-or post-operative volumes of transfused blood for both the TXA treated group and placebo group will be estimated with a two-sided 95% confidence interval. The blood volumes transfused per kilogram of body weight of the two groups (TXA vs. Placebo) will be evaluated using a two-sided student's t-test after log(1+x) transformation., intra- or post-operatively transfused blood volume (mL/kg), 6 months
To Evaluate Changes in Platelets From Pre-op to Post-op Level for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA Versus Placebo., Summary statistics will be provided for the changes in platelet level for both the TXA and placebo group. Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the differences between the two groups. Multiple comparison correction might be used for p-values to address the multiple testing issues due to measurements at multiple time points., changes in platelets from pre-op to post-op level, 6 months|To Evaluate Changes in Hemoglobin From Pre-op to Post-op Level for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA Versus Placebo., Summary statistics will be provided for the decline in hemoglobin from pre-op to post-op level, for both the TXA and placebo group. Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the differences between the two groups. Multiple comparison correction might be used for p-values to address the multiple testing issues due to measurements at multiple time points., changes in hemoglobin from pre-op to post-op level, 6 months|To Evaluate Differences in Post-operative Daily Surgical Drain Output for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA Versus Placebo., Summary statistics will be provided for postoperative daily surgical drain output (in milliliters per 24 hour period for the duration of the drain) for each group. The group difference will be compared using two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test depending on the distribution of the observed data. Multiple comparison correction might be used for p-values to address the multiple testing issues due to measurements at multiple time points., Conclusion of surgery to time of drain removal (prior to discharge from inpatient)|To Evaluate Changes in Estimated Blood Loss (EBL) for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA Versus Placebo., The EBL for pre-op to post-op level, for both the TXA treated group and placebo group will be estimated with a two-sided 95% confidence interval. The EBL of the two groups (TXA vs. Placebo) will be evaluated using a two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test depending on the distribution of the observed data., At conclusion of surgery|To Evaluate Log Transfused Blood Volume Between the intra-or Post-operatively for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA and Placebo, Respectively., Mean and Standard Deviation of log Transfused Blood Volume for both the TXA treated group and placebo group will be estimated., At conclusion of surgery|To Evaluate Log Estimated Blood Loss (EBL) Between the intra-or Post-operatively for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA and Placebo, Respectively., Mean and Standard Deviation of log Estimated Blood Loss for both the TXA treated group and placebo group will be estimated., At conclusion of surgery|To Evaluate the Association Between the intra-or Post-operatively Transfused Blood Volume and Estimated Blood Loss (EBL) for Patients Randomized to Receive Perioperative TXA and Placebo, Respectively., Regression model will be used to access the correlation between the log transformed intra-or post-operatively transfused blood volume and EBL., At conclusion of surgery
Eligible participants undergoing limb salvage procedures will be randomized to receive either tranexamic acid (TXA) or placebo peri-operatively.

The initial dose of tranexamic acid/placebo will be given at the initiation of surgical preparation. The second dose will be given 6 hours after the first dose (either intraoperatively or post-operatively). All doses will be given intravenously. Doses will be double blinded and randomized for each surgical procedure.
