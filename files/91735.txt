Post Market TRUST Study
This Post Market study is being conducted to compare the direct and indirect cost of three approaches (GFA, myomectomy, and uterine artery embolization) for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
Uterine Fibroids
PROCEDURE: Global Fibroid Ablation (GFA)|PROCEDURE: Abdominal or Laparoscopic Myomectomy|PROCEDURE: Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)
Compare direct cost of GFA compared to those of myomectomy and UAE, To compare medical, surgical, and hospitalization costs (including procedural complication costs) of Global Fibroid Ablation (GFA) compared to those of Myomectomy and Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)at 3 months post procedure., 3 months post procedure|Compare rates of acute and near-term serious complications to the acute and near-term treatment-related serious adverse events of pivotal study., Overall rates of acute (within 48 hours post procedure) and near-term (between 2 and 30 days post procedure) serious complications in all GFA subjects compared to the acute and near-term treatment-related serious adverse event rates in the pivotal study., 3 months post procedure
Assess the comparative safety of the three treatment alternatives, Safety measures will be assessed by comparing the complication rate for all three alternatives (GFA, Myomectomy, UAE)., 60 Months|Assess factors that influence indirect costs of the three treatment alternatives, Compare incidence costs of post discharge procedure-related complications and re-interventions we well as indirect cost factors defined as days to return-to-work, return to normal activities of daily living, and cost of care up to 60 months post discharge., 60 Months|Assess UFS-QoL pre-treatment to post treatment in all treatment groups, To compare fibroid symptom severity and quality of life scores at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post procedure as compared to baseline using the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL0 assessment tool., 60 Months|Assess subjects menstrual bleeding using the MIQ, Compare subjects menstrual bleeding pre-treatment and up to 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post treatment using the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ)., 60 Months|Assess subject's satisfaction with her treatment, Compare subject's satisfaction and general health outcome at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post procedure as compared to baseline using the EQ-5D (a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome)., 60 Months
Uterine fibroids are the most common pelvic neoplasms in women; they severely impact quality of life and are the leading indication for hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment for myomas; however, many patients seek alternative uterine-sparing therapy and desire to conserve their fertility. Myomectomy is a much-reported surgical option for women with symptomatic fibroids and, until recently, the abdominal approach has been the approach of choice for most surgeons. Over time, patients have requested less invasive procedures and minimally invasive, laparoscopic options are becoming more popular among patients and their gynecologists. Standard surgical and interventional treatments for uterine fibroids are costly to society and to the health care system. New technologies such as GFA may offer a low-cost alternative to the standard treatments for symptomatic uterine fibroids in women who desire uterine conservation. This study seeks to evaluate those cost differences between three available uterine-sparing techniques and to explore the qualitative outcomes such as symptom severity, health related quality of life, and overall treatment effect.
