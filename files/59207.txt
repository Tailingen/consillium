A Prospective Randomized Comparison of HDAC Vs AD in the Induction Chemothrapy for AML.
This trial is a single-center, non-blind, two-arm randomized prospective controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of two induction chemotherapy regimens (high-dose cytarabine plus daunorubicin \[HDAC\] vs. cytarabine plus high-dose daunorubicin \[AD\]) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary hypothesis of the study is that AD is superior to HDAC in terms of event-free survival (EFS, time from registration to induction failure, relapse, or death).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: High dose Cytarabine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Hign dose Daunorubicin
Cumulative incidence of relapse, defined for all patients achieving CR; measured from the date of CR achievement until the date of relapse; patients not known to have relapsed are censored on the date they were last examined; patients who died without relapse are counted as a competing cause of failure, 3 years
Event-free survival, Defined for all patients; measured from the starting date of registration to the date of induction treatment failure, or relapse from CR, or death from any cause; patients not known to have any of these events are censored on the date they were examined, 3years|Overall survival, Defined for all patients; measured from the starting date of registration to the date of death from any cause-patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive, 3years
* Induction chemotherapy

  * Arm I \[HDAC\]: cytarabine 3.0 g/m2 q12hr 3-hour iv infusion on days 1, 3, 5 plus daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day continuous iv infusion for 3 days (D1-3).
  * Arm II \[AD\]: cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day continuous iv infusion for 7 days (D1-7) plus daunorubicin 90 mg/m2/day continuous iv infusion for 3 days (D1-3).
* Interim bone marrow examination Interim bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be done between 14 and 21 days after start of induction chemotherapy. If bone marrow has blasts \< 10%, no additional chemotherapy will be given until the recovery of blood counts (absolute neutrophil counts rise over 1,000/μL and platelet counts over 100,000/μL) or post-induction day 35, when bone marrow examination will be repeated to evaluate CR. After the marrow examination, re-induction course will be given. If interim bone marrow examination shows persistent leukemia (blasts ≥ 10%), re-induction course could be given. Patients who did not attain CR after the re-induction chemotherapy will be eliminated from the study.
* Re-induction chemotherapy

  * Cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day iv infusion for 5 days (D1-5) plus daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day iv infusion for 2 days (D1-2) Post-remission consolidation chemotherapy
  * Adverse risk group: up to 3 courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine (1.0 g/m2/day iv for 5 days \[D1-5\]) plus etoposide (150 mg/m2/day iv for 3 days \[D1-3\])
  * Favorable/intermediate risk group: up to 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine (3.0 g/m2/day q12 hr iv for 3 days \[D1, 3, 5\])
  * Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be performed based on the risk of relapse.
  * The bone marrow examination will be done after the completion of consolidation chemotherapy or before HCT.
