Radiotherapy With Durvalumab Prior to Surgical Resection for HPV Negative Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm phase I/Ib safety trial. Patients eligible for treatment must be diagnosed with non-metastatic, biopsy-proven stage II-IVB oral cavity, stage III-IVB larynx and hypopharynx, or stage III-IVB HPV/p16 negative intermediate-high risk oropharynx head and neck cancer, and must be eligible and amenable to surgical resection.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Durvalumab|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)|PROCEDURE: Standard of Care Therapy
Maximum Tolerated Dose and Dose Limiting Toxicities, The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be discovered by using the 3+3 study design., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months
Pathologic Response, Tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy (durvalumab + SBRT) will be assessed by pathology review of the surgical specimen. Response will be labeled as complete pathologic remission, microscopic residual tumor (only scattered foci of residual tumor cells) or macroscopic residual tumor., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Clinical Response, Overall survival (OS), along with locoregional control and distant control will be determined from the time of enrollment to date of death due to any cause. OS will be evaluated by Kaplan-Meier estimate., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Evaluate Biomarkers: Gene Expression, Analysis of gene expression of RNA levels and entire genome sequences using the 10X Genomics single-cell RNA-sequencing platform., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Evaluate Biomarkers: Phenotypic Analysis, Phenotypic analysis of T cells and assessment of intracellular and circulating cytokines using multiplex mass flow cytometry to analyze phenotypic changes, functional response of cytokine production, and activation status of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), circulating T cells (especially CD8 and PD-1 expression), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Evaluate Biomarkers: Immune Cell Infiltration, Examination of intratumoral immune cell infiltration using the Perkin Elmer Vectra 3 and tissue microarrays., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Toxicity Profile, Grading of adverse effects (AEs) will follow the guidelines provided in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Short Term Quality of Life, Short- and long-term quality of life will be obtained using FACT H\&N v4 and will be assessed at baseline, with each cycle, post-SBRT, post-surgically, and throughout adjuvant therapy on a standard schedule., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months
This study will be enrolled using a 3+3 model. Patients will receive one dose of neoadjuvant durvalumab 1500 mg approximately 3-6 weeks prior to standard of care surgery. It will be given concurrently with the first dose of radiation (RT). The starting RT dose level will be given as 6 Gy for 2 fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately one week to sites of gross disease (Table 1) only to minimize exposure to normal tissue. If toxicity develops and surgery is delayed by more than 8 weeks (qualifying as a DLT), the radiation dose will be dropped per protocol for the next set of patients. If this dose is tolerated, the dose will be increased to 6 Gy for 3 fractions (18 Gy total) for the next 3 patients. Patients will proceed to surgical resection approximately 3-6 weeks after radiation as recommended by the ENT surgeon.
