Study ADCT-402-101 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in participants with B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) participants will receive infusions of ADCT-402, at escalating doses. Part 1 will continue until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. In Part 2 (expansion), participants will be assigned to the recommended dose level(s) and schedule(s) of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

For each participant, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be dependent on overall participant tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3 years from first participant treated to last participant completed.
