Detection and Pathogenesis of Novel Protein F
From December 6, 2019 to March 23, 2020, the research group of Qingkun Fan found a novel protein(temporarily named protein F) in heparin anticoagulant plasma of three patients with heart disease. One patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.However, protein F cannot be detected by serum protein electrophoresis. Preliminary studies have shown that this novel protein F have an obvious absorption peak at about 600nm. Placed at 2-8 degrees for 7 days, protein F will be isolated from heparin plasma. To the naked eye, protein F appear to be transparent jelly between the red blood cells and the plasma. The specific protein F, how it is produced, how it causes disease are still unknown. This study will explore how to detect protein F and how it is produced.
Cardiac Disease|Multiple Myeloma
Concentration of plasma protein F content, the protein F content was measured by turbidimetric assay in automatic biochemical analyzer, six month
Number of Participants with Multiple myeloma, Develop or be diagnosed with multiple myeloma, 3 years
Protein F screening was performed on anticoagulant blood plasma with heparin Lithium or blood serum by in-house turbidimetric method in Automatic biochemical analyzer.

All patients were followed-up for 3 years by telephones, routine appointment out-patient clinic or returning visit.
