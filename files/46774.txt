AUS/FNAC allows the identification of tumors without axillary tumor involvement, or with low axillary tumor burden, many of which do not benefit from SLNB, in the staging of early breast cancer.

Objective: To calculate the negative predictive value of AUS/FNAC in those patients with breast cancer who meet ACOSOG Z0011 criteria.
