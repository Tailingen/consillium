Clinical Study on the Effect of Selenium Yeast Capsule on Prognosis of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma
Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, but the mechanism is not clear. The thyroid is the organ with the most abundant selenium content, and selenium may be involved in protecting the gland from the influence of large amounts of H2O2 produced during thyroid hormone biosynthesis.

Selenium may exert anti-tumor activity through a variety of mechanisms, including inducing apoptosis and anti-oxidation to change the DNA methylation state of tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle arrest and stimulation of the immune system, as well as playing an anti-tumor role through its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenesis properties.

The whole blood and thyroid selenium concentrations in patients with thyroid cancer were lower, and the decreased serum selenium levels were also associated with the high TNM stage of thyroid cancer.

According to the Nutrition Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, selenium yeast supplements with a daily selenium content of 200 MCG have been shown to reduce the incidence of total cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, and cancer mortality. The active agent in selenium yeast supplements is known as selenium methionine (SEMET).

In general, the association between selenium and thyroid cancer is still inconclusive, the question of whether low selenium is a predisposition factor or a consequence of thyroid cancer has not been resolved, and the clinical effect of selenium supplementation in preventing thyroid cancer or improving its prognosis remains to be studied.

The hypothesis is that supplementation with selenium yeast will improve the prognosis of patients with differentiated alpha-carcinoma.
