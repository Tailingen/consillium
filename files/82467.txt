DRUG: ponatinib - Phase 1|DRUG: ponatinib - Phase 2
Phase 1: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) as a Measure of Safety Profile to Determine Recommended Dose of Ponatinib, DLT was evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 and was defined as any of the following events: 1. Grade greater than or equal to (\>=) 3 non-hematologic, with the exception of medically controllable toxicities (example; nausea, vomiting, fatigue, electrolyte disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions) lasting \<=3 days, but excluding alopecia; 2. Missed doses: \>25% of planned ponatinib doses over 28 days due to AEs in the first cycle; 3. Febrile neutropenia (the occurrence of an ANC \<500/microliter concurrently with a temperature elevation of \>101 degree Fahrenheit), when neutropenia is not related to underlying acute leukemia, as defined hematologic toxicity: Dose-limiting hematologic toxicity is the occurrence of a Grade 4 cytopenia \>28 days, not related to underlying disease according to the investigator. Bone marrow examination must demonstrate \<5% cellularity., Cycle 1 (Cycle length= 28 days)|Phase 2, CP-CML Participants: Percentage of Participants With Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR), MCyR was defined as percentage of participants who achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) after the initiation of study treatment. Cytogenic response was the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) metaphases in bone marrow. CCyR: no Ph+ cells. PCyR: 1% to 35% Ph+ cells. Participants entering the study already in PCyR had to achieve a CCyR in order to be considered a success for the confirmed MCyR rate., Baseline up to 60 months|Phase 2, BP-CML and Ph+ALL: Percentage of Participants With Major Hematologic Response (MaHR), MaHR was defined as percentage of participants with complete hematologic response (CHR) or no evidence of leukemia (NEL).

Participants entering the trial in less than PCyR must achieve two consecutive assessments of PCyR or CCyR no fewer than 28 days apart in order to be considered as meeting the criteria for confirmed MCyR. CCyR: no Ph+ cells. PCyR: 1% to 35% Ph+ cells., Baseline up to 60 months|CP-CML, AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL Participants: Percentage of Participants With Major Molecular Response (MMR), MMR was defined as a ratio of reverse transcribed transcript of BCR-ABL to ABL \<=0.1% on the International scale (equivalent to a 3-log reduction in transcript). Participants were non-responders in any of the following situations: BCR-ABL or ABL levels not detectable at baseline, no valid baseline or post-baseline assessment, and baseline assessment for e1a2 variant only., Baseline up to 60 months|CP-CML, AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL Participants: Median Time to Response (TTR), Time to response was defined as the interval from the first dose of study treatment until the criteria for response were first met, censored at the last assessment of response. Median time to response was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method., From the first dose of study treatment until the criteria for response were first met (up to 60 months)|CP-CML and Advanced Phase Participants: Median Duration of Response (DOR), DOR: interval between first assessment at which criteria for response was met, until criteria for progression was met, censored at last date at which criteria for response was met. DOR was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression criteria for CP was: death, development of AP/BP, or loss of CHR (in absence of cytogenic response), or loss of MCyR, or increasing WBC in participant without CHR (doubling of WBCs to \>20,000 on 2 occasions at least 4 weeks apart, after first week of therapy), as confirmed by development in complete blood cells (CBCs) at least 4 weeks apart; AP was: death, development of confirmed BP, loss of previous major/minor hematologic response over-2 week period, or no decrease from baseline levels in percentage blasts in peripheral blood/BM on all assessments over a 4-week period; and BP/Ph+ALL was: death/increasing blasts in peripheral blood or BM over a 4-week period.

As planned, PFS is reported for all participants by entry mutation (T315I and Other)., From the first assessment at which criteria for response was met until the criteria for progression or death was met (up to 60 months)|CP-CML and Advanced Phase Participants: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the interval from the first dose of study treatment until death, censored at the last date at which participant was known to be alive. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. As planned, OS is reported for all participants by entry mutation (T315I and Other)., From the first dose of study treatment until death (up to 60 months)|Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Ponatinib, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Cmax for Ponatinib, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|AUC(0-24): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours Post-dose for Ponatinib, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|T1/2: Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life for Ponatinib, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)
This multi-center, phase 1/2, open-label study will consist of two phases. The first will be a dose escalation phase employing a modified 3+3 design with two dose cohorts (30mg and 45mg). After 6 patients complete the first cycle in a cohort, safety events will be evaluated before opening the next dose cohort. Patients will continue on treatment as long as it is tolerated and disease progression has not occurred. Phase 2 will occur at the recommended dose determined in phase 1 in an additional 25 patients. Another 3 patients will be dosed at 15mg for collection of pharmacokinetic data. These patients may also escalate to the recommended dose and be assessed for efficacy and safety as phase 2 patients.

Efficacy measures include molecular, cytogenetic, and hematologic response rates at various time points; time to response; duration of response; and survival follow-up. Safety measures include routine physical and laboratory evaluations, adverse event monitoring, and ECGs. Other measures include mutation testing and molecular genetic assessment. Accrual is expected to take approximately 12 months, and patients will be followed for survival for up to 60 months from the last dose of study drug; therefore, the estimated duration of the trial is 72 months.
