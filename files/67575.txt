Sargramostim or Hypertonic Saline Before Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Treating Patients With Stage IB-II Melanoma
This randomized phase III trial studies sargramostim before sentinel lymph node biopsy to see how well it works compared to hypertonic saline before sentinel lymph node biopsy in treating patients with melanoma. Biological therapies, such as sargramostim, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known whether sargramostim is more effective than hypertonic saline in treating patients with stage IB-II melanoma undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.
Stage IB Melanoma|Stage IIA Melanoma|Stage IIB Melanoma|Stage IIC Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim|PROCEDURE: sentinel lymph node biopsy|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: hypertonic saline
Reversal of alterations in the SN, A series of analysis of variance (ANOVA) models will be employed., Up to 30 days|Proportion of subjects with positive SN in each group, The primary analysis will be a two group continuity corrected Chi-squared test. A logistic regression analysis will also be run., Up to 30 days
Disease free survival (DFS), A two sample t-test will be used., Up to 30 days|Overall survival (OS), A two sample t-test will be used., Up to 30 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if the alterations in morphology and phenotype to the sentinel lymph nodes are reversible.

II. To determine if the restoration of the morphology or phenotype of sentinel lymph nodes results in diminished regional tumor burden.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) 3-5 days prior to undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.

ARM II: Patients receive hypertonic saline SC 3-5 days prior to undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
