Improving Understanding of Glioblastoma Through Preservation of Biologically Active Brain Tissue
To collect and preserve glioblastoma tissue during standard of care tumor resection surgery and blood for future molecular and genetic testing. Tissue for research will be collected from three different regions within the same tumor to study how these regions differ in their structure, DNA, and RNA and also to compare the data obtained from this testing to imaging data found in the medical record. The goal of this study is to help us better understand what the glioblastoma tumor tissue looks like and how it functions. This understanding can lead to new therapies for the treatment of glioblastoma in the future.
