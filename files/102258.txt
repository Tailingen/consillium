The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy profile of the antibody-cytokine fusion protein L19TNF in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse

Phase I:

The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate the safety of L19TNF in patients with IDH-wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse and to establish and confirm the recommended dose (RD) for phase II.

Phase II:

The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate antitumor activity of L19TNF in patients with IDH-wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse.
