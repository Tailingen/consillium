Assess Efficacy and Safety of Durvalumab Alone or Combined With Bevacizumab in High Risk of Recurrence HCC Patients After Curative Treatment
A global study to assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with bevacizumab or durvalumab alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are at high risk of recurrence.

DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|OTHER: Placebo
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) for Arm A vs Arm C, RFS (per RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by BICR) will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the first objective radiologic recurrence or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 49 months after first patient randomized
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) Arm B vs Arm C, RFS (per RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by BICR) will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the first objective radiologic recurrence or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 49 months after first patient randomized|Overall Survival (OS) for Arm A vs Arm C and Arm B vs Arm C, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, No timeframe|Recurrence-free survival at 24 months (RFS24) and 36 months (RFS36) for Arm A vs Arm C and Arm B vs Arm C, Proportion of RFS at 24 months and at 36 months, At 24 and at 36 months|Time to recurrence (TTR) for Arm A vs Arm C and Arm B vs Arm C, TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of disease recurrence, Up to 49 months after first patient randomized|Time from randomization to recurrence/progression on next therapy (RFS2/PFS2) for Arm A vs Arm C and Arm B vs Arm C, Time from randomization to recurrence/progression on next therapy (RFS2/PFS2), Up to 49 months after first patient randomized
This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, global study to assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with bevacizumab or durvalumab monotherapy or placebo as adjuvant therapy. This study will be conducted in patients with HCC who are at high risk of recurrence after curative hepatic resection or ablation.
