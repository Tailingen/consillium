VMAC+DLI Treatment of Patients With Relapse of AML After Allo-HSCT
This clinical trial included 30 cases and aimed to understand the effectiveness and safety of the VMAC regimen combined with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who have relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

The safety and efficacy of VMAC combined with DLI in the treatment of allo HSCT recurrence in AML patients;
Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome
CRR, All tumor target lesions disappear, no new lesions appear, and tumor markers are normal, maintained for at least 4 weeks, 1 year
PR, The maximum sum of diameters of tumor lesions decrease≥ 30% and is maintained for at least 4 weeks, 1 year|ORR, CR+PR, 1year|2-year OS, The time from the start of treatment to death due to any reason, 2 years|DFS, The time from the start of treatment to disease recurrence or death from any cause, 2 years
venetoclax 400 mg/d (reduced to 100 mg when combined with an azole), d1-7; liposomal mitoxantrone 30 mg/m2/d, d1; cytarabine (Ara-C) 100 mg/m2/d, d1-7; cyclophosphamide (CY) 400 mg/m2/d, d2, 5)，and then rest for 1 day before giving cryopreserved donor stem cells.MNC1-2X10\^8/kg infusion, low-dose (25 mg Bid), short-course treatment (2-3 weeks after DLI) oral cyclosporine (CSA) is added to prevent graft-versus-host disease starting 3 days before the infusion of cryopreserved stem cells.

Monitor the occurrence of serious infections, cardiac toxicity, GVHD and other adverse reactions during the medication process; Blood routine recovery or bone marrow re examination 4 weeks after DLI to evaluate the efficacy of one course of VMAC combined with DLI; The patient was followed up for 2 years to evaluate long-term efficacy.
