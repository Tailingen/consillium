Evaluation of Nutritional Scores as Predictive Factors of Postoperative Outcome After Pancreatic Surgery
Patients scheduled for major pancreatic surgery will be screened for malnutrition by five screening scores chosen depending on their clinical applicability. After surgery, it will be evaluated which score predicts the best complications.
Pancreatic and Peripancreatic Tumors
Evaluation of nutritional assessment score as predictive of pancreatic surgery outcomes, Five nutritional questionnaires are administered to each patient to assess their nutritional status and then evaluate if there is a correlation between them and the postoperative outcomes., The nutritional assessment scores are administred between 15 and 1 day before the operation. The evaluation of outcomes ends when patient are dismissed.
The correlation between nutritional scores and postoperative outcomes is based on age, type of disease, possible preoperative oncological treatments, and operation technique., Association of each score with postoperative outcomes depending on certain patient's characteristics:age,type of disease,operation technique (open surgery versus laparoscopy), The nutritional assessment scores are administred between 15 and 1 day before the operation. The evaluation of outcomes ends when patient are dismissed.
Patients scheduled for major pancreatic surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal resection, total resection) will be screened for malnutrition by the following screening scores: Nutritional Risk Screening Score 2002; Subjective Global Assessment; Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool; Mini Nutritional Assessment and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire.

The postoperative outcome will be recorded, and the predictive value of each score will be calculated.
