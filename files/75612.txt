INK Cells As Maintenance Therapy After Chemoradiotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a clinical study on the use of iNK cells for the treatment of small cell lung cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: iNK cells
Number of Participants with Adverse Event (AE) according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), v5.0, 12 months|Objective-response rate (ORR), 12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), 12 months
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system and could recognize and kill a wide range of cells in distress, particularly tumour cells and cells infected with viruses. Induced pluripotent setm cells(iPSCs) derived NK cells have better proliferative capacity and homogeneity than donor peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood derived NK cells. The investigators conduct this clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INK cells as maintenance therapy after chemoradiotherapy for small cell lung cancer and The purpose of investigators is to find new treatment option.
