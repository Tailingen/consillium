Neural Network-based Treatment Decision Support Tool in Patients With Refractory Solid Organ Malignancies
DRUID is a treatment decision support tool combining predictive models and public databases related to multi-gene markers, drug response screens, gene essentiality and clinical status of drugs to provide drug recommendations personalized based on an input genomic profile. We hypothesize that DRUID analysis of patients' somatic mutational profile from NGS diagnostic platform can be used as a treatment decision support tool in patients with refractory cancer without targetable mutations.
Solid Organ Malignancies
OTHER: DRUID AI Program
Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as patient exhibiting a best study response of complete or partial clinical response based on radiological imaging per RECIST 1.1 criteria., 10 months
Clinical benefit, Defined as presence of best study response of complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria)., 10 months|Progression free survival, Defined as the time from the date of study enrolment to the first date of documented disease progression., From enrolment till disease progression or date of death or final follow-up visit (1 year).
2.1. Hypothesis We hypothesize that DRUID analysis of patients' somatic mutational profile from NGS diagnostic platform can be used as a treatment decision support tool in patients with refractory cancer without targetable mutations. Using algorithm selected treatment from a panel of 60 drugs we predict an objective response rate (ORR) of ≥ 25%.

2.2. Primary Objectives

• To prospectively determine if DRUID selected therapy based on NGS diagnostic profile input can lead to objective responses in refractory solid organ malignancies.

2.3. Secondary Objectives

* To assess clinical benefit rate (complete response, partial response and stable disease for ≥ 24 weeks)
* To assess progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with DRUID-guided therapy
