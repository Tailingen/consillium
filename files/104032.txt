Pharmacist for Detecting Opioid Misuse
Opioid use is increasing in Western countries and is associated with harms as hospitalization, addiction and deaths(1). Community pharmacists interact frequently with patients, giving them the opportunity to identify and prevent the risk of prescribed opioid misuse. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the risk of prescribed opioids misuse in ambulatory patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) seen in community pharmacies.

Method: A questionnaire (including the Prescription Opioid Misuse POMI(2)) have been proposed to patients with opioid prescription by pharmacy students, in 86 pharmacies of Occitanie-Est, in April 2019. Eligible patients were adults with CNCP that consented to participate.

A total of 414 patients (62.4% women, mean age 58 Â± 16.00) have been included. The main pains were spinal (37.3%) and osteoarticular (33.1%). The median visual analog scale (VAS) was 7 \[IQR25-75: 5-8\]. The prescribed opioids are mainly weak opioids (73.2%): paracetamol/tramadol (35%), paracetamol/codeine (17.4%), paracetamol/opium (16.8%). Strong opioids (32.6%) were oxycodone (11.95%), fentanyl (9%), and morphine (9%). The median morphine milligram equivalent (MME) was 40 mg/day \[IQR25-75: 20-80\].

POMI score was superior to 2/6 in 45.4% and superior to 4 in 16%. The main positive question were feel high (40.3%), take the opioid more often (39.3%), take more medication (36.6), and need to early renew opioid medication earlier (30.8%).

Patients with POMI score \> 4 were younger (49 years versus 55.9; p\<0.01), more urban (78.1% versus 69.2%; p=0.03), had higher VAS (7.3 versus 6.2; p\<0.01), received higher median MME (112 mg versus 64.9 mg; p\<0.01), and consumed more strong opioid (45.3% versus 27.3%; p=0.04).
