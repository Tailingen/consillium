This study is an open label, multi-center, dose-escalating clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of IMC008 in the treatment of CLDN18.2 positive advanced solid tumors. DLTs observations will be performed 28 days after IMC008 administration. During the study, regular safety meetings will be held according to the progress of the study, and recommendations will be made on dose escalation, safety of subjects and possible study change.
