Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of QBS10072S
This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of QBS10072S in patients with advanced or metastatic cancers with high LAT1 expression. The MTD of QBS10072S will be confirmed in patients with relapsed or refractory grade 4 astrocytoma.

DRUG: QBS10072S
Determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD will be determined by presence of AEs as characterized by type, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapy., 28 days
Safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events and serious adverse events, Safety and tolerability will be determined by adverse events as characterized by type, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapy., 28 days|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Determine the maximum plasma concentration of QBS10072S., 28 days|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of QBS10072S, Determine the plasma concentration of QBS10072S over time., 28 days|Half-life of QBS10072S in plasma (t1/2), Determine the half life of QBS10072S in plasma; the half-life of a drug is the time taken for the plasma concentration of a drug to reduce to half its original value., 28 days|Time to maximum concentration of QBS10072S in plasma (Tmax), Determine the time it takes to achieve maximum concentration of QBS10072S in plasma., 28 days
