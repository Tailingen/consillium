Consistency Analysis of PD-L1s in Advanced NSCLC Tissues and in Plasma Exosomes Before and After Radiotherapy
The detection of tissue PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in NSCLC has an important role in guiding for the treatment of immune detection point.Radiation therapy can enhance the effect of immunotherapy,but radiation dose and timing are waiting to be solved. At the same time,tissue detection is time-consuming and laborious, liquid biopsy can reflect the information of tumor tissue,PD-L1 mRNA in plasma exosomes (pExo) is expected to be simple, rapid, non-invasive means of detection. The project is planned to explore the consistency analysis of PD-L1 expression level detected in advanced non-small cell cancer patients' cancer tissues and pExo before and after radiotherapy.The investigators have designed five kinds of radiation-division with bioequivalent doses, and detected the expression levels of PD-L1 in pExo after 24h, 48h of each stage of radiotherapy.PD-L1 mRNA levels in pExo detected at different time points,by using variance analysis of repeated measures design information.Probing the best timing and manner of radiotherapy division which can make PD-L1 express more,guiding clinical practice of radiotherapy combining with immunotherapy.
