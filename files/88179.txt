Using Liquid Biopsy in Newly Diagnosed Patients With High Grade Adenocarcinoma of Ovarian Origin, Fallopian Tubes or Primary Peritoneal
BOVARY-CE is a monocentric, pilot, longitudinal, real-life study with a total duration of 36 months. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using liquid biopsy as a substitute for tissue multisampling, in order to describe clonal heterogeneity and tumor evolution in patients with ovarian cancer. The method involves the inclusion of 20 patients with high-grade ovarian adenocarcinoma, fallopian tubes or primary peritoneal origin, not pretreated, newly diagnosed, and eligible for treatment who will participate in the research. These patients will have several samples throughout their treatment for a period of 2 years: blood samples which will be taken at each therapeutic moment of interest.

Tissue samples which will be taken at the time of the diagnostic laparoscopy and at the time of surgery.

The concentration of cfDNA and tumor heterogeneity will be used to predict disease-related events defined as relapse, progression or death.
