The Effect of Cerebral Oxygenation on Postoperative Recovery in Intracranial Surgery
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cerebral oxygenation on postoperative compilation in intracranial surgery.
Intracranial Neoplasm
DEVICE: cerebral oxygen monitoring|DEVICE: routine monitoring
cerebral oxygen monitoring data, cerebral oxygen monitoring will measure peroperative, cerebral oxygen values reported will be measured at 10 min intervals (intraoperative) and It would be reported by the first postoperative 10 minute intervals up to 30 minutes
Patients undergoing intracranial surgery will be divided into two groups; group (Group Control n = 100) and cerebral oxygenation monitoring group (Group Oxygen). all hemodynamic parameters such as systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, Et CO2, SpO2;% and BIS during anesthesia during anesthesia will be recorded intraoperatively and 10 postoperatively in 5 min intervals. After extubation, Modified Aldrete Score, GKS (Glasgow Coma Scale), Ramsey Sedation Scale (RSS), nausea-vomiting and pain will be recorded in the recovery room. Pain assessment will be done with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patient satisfaction will be recorded. MMST (mini mental state test) and ASEM (antisaccadic eye movement test) tests will be performed preoperatively and postoperatively at 1st, 2nd and 3rd days.
