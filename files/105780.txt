SAR3419 Administered Weekly in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory CD19-positive B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR3419 according to the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed when administered as a single agent once weekly.

Secondary objectives are:

* to characterize the global safety profile
* to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR3419 in the proposed dosing schedule
* to assess preliminary evidence of anti-lymphoma activity.
