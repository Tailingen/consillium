A Multiomics Study Based on the Dynamic Evolution of Endometrial Carcinogenesis
The goal of this observational study is to draw the characteristic maps of imaging omics, genomics, transcriptome, proteomics, pathological omics, metabolomics, etc. of the dynamic evolution of endometrial carcinogenesis in 100 patients with normal endometrium, 100 patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and 100 patients with endometrial cancer; and then to explore the underlying molecular mechanism, and establish the database system for the dynamic evolution of endometrial carcinogenesis.
the Dynamic Evolution of Endometrial Carcinogenesis|Multiomics Analysis
The mutant genes of participants and their expression as assessed by gene sequencing, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis, August 2023 to June 2026|Differences in the expression of these mutant genes among the three groups of participants as assessed by SASÂ® 9.4, January 2026 to June 2026
