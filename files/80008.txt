Study to Evaluate Monotherapy and Combination Immunotherapies in Participants With PD-L1 Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This randomized phase 2 open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of zimberelimab (AB122) monotherapy, domvanalimab (AB154) in combination with zimberelimab, and domvanalimab in combination with zimberelimab and etrumadenant (AB928) in front-line, PD-L1 positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
