Neoadjuvant Epirubicin, Cisplatin and Capecitabine (ECX) Followed by Definitive Chemoradiation With/Without Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oesophagus
This is a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to radical chemoradiotherapy using capecitabine and cisplatin as radio-sensitisers in patients with newly diagnosed localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.
