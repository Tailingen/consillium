Safety and Efficacy of Tenalisib (RP6530) in Combination With Romidepsin in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory T-cell Lymphoma
To characterize safety, tolerability and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Tenalisib in combination with Romidepsin in patients with R/R T-cell lymphoma.
T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Tenalisib|DRUG: Romidepsin
Number of Participants With and Without Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The DLTs will be classified according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., 28 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR) With Tenalisib and Romidepsin Combination, Overall response (ORR) = CR + PR) was assessed according to the Lugano classification with PTCL and according to the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT)/Global assessment in patients with CTCL., 12 weeks|Duration of Response (DoR) With Tenalisib and Romidepsin Combination, The time period from the response achieved in patient until the disease progression, 28 weeks|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Assessment of Cmax in subjects treated with Tenalisib and Romidepsin combination. Blood samples for measurement of RP6530 plasma concentrations were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 11 hours after dosing on Day 8 of the first cycle. Maximum (peak) drug concentration (Cmax in nanograms/milliliter) was estimated using Single-Dose data., 8 days
