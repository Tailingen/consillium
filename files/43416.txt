A Salvage Trial of AR Inhibition With ADT and Apalutamide With Radiation Therapy Followed by Docetaxel in Men With PSA Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy (STARTAR)
The purpose of this study is to describe the rate of 3-year progression free survival in men with recurrent PSA-only disease after prostatectomy, who receive combined apalutamide (ARN-509) and standard ADT with salvage radiation therapy followed by docetaxel, ADT, and apalutamide, AND who have had testosterone recovery to \>100 ng/dl at 36 months. The hypothesis is that AR inhibition with apalutamide added to standard salvage external beam radiation with androgen deprivation therapy, as well as the addition of 6 cycles of docetaxel, will further prolong progression free survival.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Androgen deprivation|RADIATION: Salvage radiation therapy|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 36 Months (3 Years), The percentage of subjects with testosterone \>100 ng/dl at 36 months post-Cycle 1 Day 1 without one or more of the following: Serum PSA value of 0.2 ng/mL or more above the post-radiotherapy PSA nadir and confirmed (at least) 4 weeks later by a second PSA measurement higher than the first by any amount; Continued rise in the PSA level following study treatment if no nadir is experienced, defined as 2 rising values greater than the baseline PSA and separated by at least 4 weeks; Evidence of clinical progression or initiation of systemic therapy for progressive disease; Death, up to 36 months
