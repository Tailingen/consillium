Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone and Lenalidomide for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase II, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg/dose in combination with bortezomib at 1.0 mg/m2/dose, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) at 4.0 mg/m2/dose, and intravenous (IV) dexamethasone at 40 mg/dose in adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The study consists of a screening period, followed by up to eight 28 day open label treatment cycles, a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle, and a follow-up period.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: DVD-R
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria, The investigator will evaluate each patient for response to therapy according to criteria augmented from those developed by Blad√© et al., 1998 presented below (Table 7-1). Assessment of disease response will be performed prior to drug administration on Day 1 of Cycles 2 8 and at the End of Study Treatment visit. If a patient is determined to have complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), or minor response (MR), then assessment of disease response is to be performed 4 weeks later to confirm the response., Up to 7.5 months (eight 28-day cycles)
Time to First Response, Up to 7.5 months (eight 28-day cycles)|Time to Best Response, Up to 7.5 months (eight 28-day cycles)|Duration of Response, First evidence of PR or better (for overall response) and MR or better (for clinical benefit response) to start of disease progression or death.|Time to Progression, Time from the start of treatment to progressive disease|Progression-free Survival, Time from the start of treatment to progressive disease or until death|Follow-up Time, time that patients were monitored for disease progression and overall survival, Follow-up visits for disease progression and overall survival every 3 months after study discontinuation. After progression, follow-up visits for survival status every 6 months or until alternate therapy needs to be started or death intervenes
Studies have shown that combinations of PLD and bortezomib have striking synergy in preclinical studies and impressive response rates (73 \& 89%) in early clinical trials for MM patients with relapsed/refractory disease as well as first-line therapy. In addition, the efficacy of PLD with bortezomib in anthracycline-insensitive patients has been greater than single-agent bortezomib when comparing across studies. The immunomodulatory drugs, thalidomide and lenalidomide, target the tumor cell microenvironment, are antiangiogenic, have an immune activation effect and also exert a direct cytotoxic effect on myeloma cells. A phase 1 clinical study by our group also demonstrated that low dose PLD, administered at a more frequent dosing schedule, in combination with bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVD regimen) is well tolerated and associated with high response rates and durable responses. In this phase II prospective trial, we will evaluate this regimen and show that this change enhances the DVD-R regimen's safety and efficacy for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.
