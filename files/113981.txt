Safety Study to Evaluate CHR-2797 in Patients With Advanced Tumours
The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CHR-2797 when administered orally, once daily, to patients with advanced solid tumours.

The secondary objectives of this study were:

* To determine pharmacokinetic parameters for CHR-2797 when administered orally at increasing dose levels;
* To investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of CHR-2797 in blood mononuclear cells and, when possible, tumour cells; - To enable a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour activity of CHR-2797.
