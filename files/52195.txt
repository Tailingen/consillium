Measurement Skin Temperature During Pulsed Laser Exposure
Lasers are the treatment modality of choice for Port Wine Stain birthmarks.The epidermis is not totally spared due to partial absorption of energy therein by melanin that presents an optical barrier through which the light must pass to reach the underlying blood vessels. Absorption of laser energy by melanin causes localized heating in the epidermis, which may, if not controlled, produce permanent complications such as hypertrophic scarring or dyspigmentation.
Port-Wine Stain
PROCEDURE: cooling spray during laser treatment
skin temperature during laser treatment, 90 days
The researchers want to establish a correlation between non-invasive skin temperature measurements and the minimum laser energy during skin laser treatment using cryogen spray cooling.

This study would eliminate the need for test pulses to estimate the safe and acceptable radiant exposure prior to laser treatment.
