Comparison of Catecholamine Concentrations in Venous Blood During Selective Adrenal Artery Embolization
To explore the relationship between perioperative blood pressure and catecholamine concentrations in adrenal venous blood and peripheral venous blood in hypertensive patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) who underwent percutaneous selective adrenal artery embolization (SAAE). In order to elucidate the related phenomena and possible mechanisms of blood pressure fluctuations caused by SAAE treatment in hypertensive patients with PA.

Percutaneous selective adrenal artery embolization (SAAE) is a minimally invasive interventional procedure that allows for necrosis of diseased adrenal glands by selectively embolizing the adrenal arteries supplying the lesion using an embolic agent to block the overproduction of aldosterone, and has been used as a treatment for PA as a minimally invasive alternative. However, it is of concern that in our team's SAAE practice, we have found that some patients with PA experience a dramatic increase in blood pressure during surgery, even exceeding 220/130 mmHg, yet some patients do not experience significant fluctuations in blood pressure. The perioperative risk is undoubtedly significantly increased for patients with high blood pressure fluctuations. What are the reasons for this discrepancy phenomenon? Therefore, the present study was designed to synchronize adrenal vein blood collection in PA hypertensive patients undergoing SAAE, and to compare the perioperative adrenal vein blood and peripheral venous blood catecholamine concentrations, with a view to discovering the patterns and possible causes of blood pressure fluctuations, hormone level changes, and other phenotypic changes, and elucidating the possible mechanisms of blood pressure fluctuations triggered by SAAE treatment of PA hypertension, in order to provide an evidence-based basis for minimally invasive interventional therapy for PA.
