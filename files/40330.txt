QL1706 for the Neoadjuvant Treatment of HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if QL1706 is effective in early HR+/HER2- breast cancer. It will also learn about the safety of QL1706. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does QL1706 combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy improve the pCR rate of early HR+/HER2- breast cancer? What adverse events do participants have when receiving QL1706? Participants will: Receive QL1706 plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 6 cycles; All patients will receive surgery, and the primary end point is pathological complete response at the time of definitive surgery; After definitive surgery, the participants will receive adjuvant QL1706 every 3 weeks for up to 6 months from the beginning of the treatment.
