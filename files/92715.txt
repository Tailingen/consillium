Study of Olaparib (± Degarelix) Given to Men With Intermediate/High Risk Prostate Cancer Before Prostatectomy
Despite recent advances in the treatment of Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), there remains an unmet medical need to identify and optimise additional treatment for those patients with early prostate cancer who are at greatest risk of relapse following first-line treatment with curative intent.

This is a phase I study investigating the feasibility and tolerability of a short course of neoadjuvant treatment with olaparib, either as a monotherapy or in combination with degarelix) given in the window-of-opportunity prior to radical prostatectomy in men with early, localised intermediate-/high- risk prostate cancer. Our primary objective is to determine the pharmacodynamic biomarker effects of olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) in this patient population.

Participants will receive either single agent olaparib or olaparib in combination with degarelix (androgen deprivation) for two weeks prior to routine radical prostatectomy. We will use immunohistochemistry to quantify changes in the levels of biomarkers of PARP inhibition, e.g. PAR, gamma H2AX, pH2A(s129) and Rad51 foci, using tumour samples taken at baseline and at the time of radical prostatectomy. An intra-operative prostate biopsy will permit us to examine biomarker variability between the samples.

The incidence and severity of Adverse Events will be documented and we will assess the number of trial participants who undergo surgery on schedule. We will assess preliminary evidence of tumour response, e.g. pathological changes and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). We also intend to investigate changes to the ctDNA profile by comparing blood samples collected throughout the study.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Degarelix
Determination of PARP Inhibition, Measure the degree of PARP inhibition by comparison of tumour samples taken from men with early prostate cancer at baseline and following treatment with olaparib (either alone or in combination with degarelix). Inhibition of PARP will be measured by the change in IHC levels of biomarkers such as PAR, gamma H2AX, pH2A(s129), Rad51 foci, FancD2 foci and ATM/ATR/CHK1/2., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)
Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events, Determine the incidence and severity of adverse events caused by treatment for 14 days with olaparib (either alone or in combination with degarelix) prior to radical prostatectomy. The severity of adverse events will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03)., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)|Feasibility of treatment approach, Assess the number of patients who undergo radical prostatectomy on schedule after 14 days of treatment with olaparib (either alone or in combination with degarelix)., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)|Clinical benefit rate, To assess preliminary evidence of tumour response, e.g. pathological changes and Prostrate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, following 14 days treatment with olaparib (±degarelix)., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)
DNA repair defect and PARP inhibition, Measure the DNA damage response, to compare with effects of or response to two weeks olaparib treatment (± degarelix), Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)|Immunomodulatory effects of PARP inhibition, Measure the immunophenotype, e.g. B and T cell subsets, of tumour samples taken at baseline and following 14 days treatment with olaparib (±degarelix) using, for example, IHC and FACS analysis., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)|Biological effects of PARP inhibition, Measure biological effects, e.g. reduced tumour proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) or altered androgen receptor/ETS regulated gene function in tumour samples taken from patients treated with olaparib., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)|Investigating changes to the ctDNA profile, Measure changes in ctDNA profile following treatment with olaparib (either alone or in combination with degarelix)., Two week olaparib therapy (alone or in combination with degarelix)
