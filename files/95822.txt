The Role of Interventional Pulmonology, Microbiota and Immune Response in the Patient With Lung Cancer
This study is designed to evaluate complications, specificity, diagnostic yield of radial endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial cryobiopsy and transbronchial forceps biopsy with fluoroscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesion; the interplay between non-small-cell lung cancer associated-bacteria along the gut-lung axis and immune response in the cancer microenvironment.
