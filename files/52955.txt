Safety and Pharmacokinetics of SAR245408 Daily Oral in Patients With Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

- To confirm safety and tolerability of global recommended phase three dose (RPTD) of SAR245408 tablets when administered on continuous once daily dosing (CDD) in patients with solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of daily oral administration of SAR245408 in CDD treatment schedule in patients with solid tumors.
* To gather preliminary efficacy data after repeated administration of SAR245408 in patients with solid tumors.
