A Trial of Selinexor, Ruxolitinib and Methylprednisolone
Selinexor, a first-in-class, oral selective exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibitor, has shown promise in pre-clinical and clinical studies. It functions by inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO1, resulting in the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins and inhibition of oncoprotein mRNAs, which is selectively lethal to myeloma cells. Selinexor has demonstrated activity in combination with various drugs, including glucocorticoids and proteasome inhibitors, leading to its FDA approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

1. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD):, ● A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schedule will be used for all escalations, 30 months|2. Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Primary objective of a phase 1 study is to define a safe and tolerable dose to use in further studies designed to determine efficacy, the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), 30 months
1. Overall Response Rate ([ORR]=CR+VGPR+PR), ORR is a measure of how many patients in a study experience a significant reduction or complete disappearance of their cancer following treatment, essentially indicating the percentage of patients who have a partial or complete response to the therapy being tested. ORR is calculated by adding the number of patients with a "Complete Response" + Very Good Partial Response + Partial Response., 30 months|2. Clinical Benefit Rate ([CBR]=CR+VGPR+PR+MR), The percentage of patients with advanced cancer who experience a complete or partial response to a treatment. CBR is calculated by adding the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) + Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) + Partial Response (PR) + Minor Response., 30 months|3. To determine disease parameters for study treatment:, * Time to progression (TTP) - define as the time from the initiation of therapy to progressive disease
* Progression-free survival (PFS) - defined as the time from initiation of therapy to progressive disease or death from any cause, whichever occurs first
* Time to first response - defined as the time from the initiation of therapy to the first evidence of confirmed clinical benefit defined as \> minimal response (MR, including patients who achieved a complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), or MR
* DOR - defined as the time from the first response to progressive disease
* Overall survival (OS) - Overall survival, defined as the time from initiation of therapy to death from any cause or last follow-up visit, 30 months
Background and rationale for assessment of serum B cell maturation antigen levels (sBCMA), Only for MM patients participating in the optional biomarker including sBCMA analysis study.

To evaluate the ability of MM-related biomarkers including sBCMA, to serve as:

* Diagnostic biomarker by determining specificity and sensitivity in MM patients
* Prognostic biomarker by determining its ability to predict the probable course of the disease including its recurrence.
* Stratification biomarker by examining its ability to predict clinical outcomes of MM patients, 30 months

Ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/2 inhibitor, has been approved by the FDA for myelofibrosis treatment. Preliminary experiments have shown that Ruxolitinib, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, effectively inhibits MM cell proliferation. Additionally, the combination of Ruxolitinib and dexamethasone has demonstrated enhanced anti-MM effects. Clinical results indicate that Ruxolitinib in combination with steroids is well-tolerated in heavily treated MM patients.

This proposed study aims to investigate the efficacy of a lower dose of Selinexor in combination with Ruxolitinib and methylprednisolone for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The study builds on the existing evidence of the individual and synergistic effects of Selinexor and Ruxolitinib, both in preclinical and clinical settings and seeks to provide a potential new treatment option for MM patients.
