A Study of Trilaciclib Combined With Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patients
This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Trilaciclib in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP.
DLBCL
DRUG: Trilaciclib+R-CHOP
Occurrence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia, Proportion of subjects with at least one absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 1.0 × 10\^9/L enrolled and treated with at least one dose of trilaciclib, Up to 6 months
ORR, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for tumor volume reduction and maintaining the minimum duration requirement based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 6 months|2y-PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS per RECIST 1.1) is defined as the time until the first imaging disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Up to 2 years|2y-OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time until the subject's death due to any reason, Up to 2 years|Neutrophil-related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence of febrile neutropenia adverse events(AEs), Up to 6 months|Neutrophil-related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence of Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) administration, Up to 6 months|RBC related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence of Grade 3/4 decrease of hemoglobin, occurrence and number of RBC transfusions on/after Week 5, Up to 6 months|RBC related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent(ESA) administration, Up to 6 months|Platelet related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence of Grade 3/4 decrease of platelets, Up to 6 months|Platelet related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence and number of platelet transfusions, Up to 6 months|Platelet related myeloprotection efficacy, Occurrence of rhTPO/Recombinant human interleukin-11(rhIL-11) administration, Up to 6 months|Myeloprotection efficacy, Hospitalization due to chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, Up to 6 months|Chemotherapy dosing, Chemotherapy dose reductions and delays due to chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, Up to 6 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, To assess the effects of trilaciclib administered prior to chemotherapy on the occurrence and severity of adverse events by CTCAE 5.0, study treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, and trilaciclib adverse events of special interest., Up to 6 months
Exploratory analysis of potential biomarkers related with the outcome, The change from baseline in immune cell levels in peripheral blood after treatment includes, but is not limited to:

T cells (CD3, CD4, and CD8) B cells (CD19) Effector T cells (IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells, IL-2-producing CD4+ T cells, IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells, IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells, IL-2-producing CD8+ T cells) T cell activation markers (HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells, HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells) Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) (FoxP3, CD25, and CD127) Proportion of cells in the S phase, Up to 6 months|Exploratory analysis of potential biomarkers related with the outcome, Tumor Biomarkers: Including but not limited to the relationship between the CDK4/6-Cyclin D-RB pathway and antitumor efficacy, the relationship between PD-L1, Ki67, and antitumor efficacy, Up to 6 months
This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, phase II clinical study to investigate the myeloprotection efficacy, antitumor efficacy, and safety of Trilaciclib in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or Epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). 38 eligible subjects who met the inclusion criteria were screened and given a treatment regimen of Trilaciclib before chemotherapy R-CHOP, after signing informed consent. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was used as the primary endpoint to observe whether Trilaciclib could reduce the occurrence or degree of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (CIM). Researchers will monitor potential adverse events (AEs) throughout the entire trial and grade the severity of adverse events according to the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0.
