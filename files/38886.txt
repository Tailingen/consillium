Phase I/II Study of Neoadjuvant Cemiplimab and Dupilumab in Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase 1b/2a study evaluates the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of combining dupilumab (anti-IL-4Rα) and cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) in patients with early-stage, resectable NSCLC. Phase 1b focuses on safety and feasibility, using a 3+3 design to monitor dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), while Phase 2a assesses the major pathological response (MPR) rate with a Simon's two-stage minimax design. Secondary endpoints include event-free survival, overall survival, and translational objectives such as deep immune monitoring from patient samples, with the trial expected to enroll 24 patients at CHUM over five years.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Immunotherapy|Neoadjuvant Therapy
DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Dupilumab
Safety, (Phase 1b) Determine the safety (dose-limiting toxicities) of combined treatment with anti-IL-4R-alpha (dupilumab) and anti-PD-1 (cemiplimab) in patients with early-stage, resectable NSCLC., First 30 days after immunotherapy|Major pathological response (MPR) rate, (Phase 2a) Assess efficacy of combined cemiplimab and dupilumab in patients with early stage, resectable NSCLC. Efficacy is defined as percentage of patients achieving major pathological response (MPR), i.e. 90% or greater tumor necrosis at time of resection., Day of surgery
Rate of curative-intent surgery, (Phase 1b and 2a) Describe and quantify rate of curative-intent surgery following treatment intervention, Day of surgery|Tolerability, (Phase 2a) Assess general tolerability in patients treated with dupilumab and cemiplimab treatment combination, For up to 5 years or until death|Event-free survival (EFS), (Phase 1b and 2a) Assess event free survival (EFS) as it relates to neoadjuvant cemiplimab and dupilumab treatment combination and following surgery, For up to 5 years or until death|Overall survival (OS), (Phase 1b and 2a) Assess overall survival (OS) as it relates to dupilumab and cemiplimab treatment combination and following surgery, For up to 5 years or until death|Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, (Phase 1b and 2a) Assess pathological complete response (pCR) rate, Day of surgery
