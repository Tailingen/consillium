Strategies for Ovulation Induction in Anovulatory Infertile Patients With PCOS
Anovulatory infertility is a common feature of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Even if several first-step treatments have been proposed for anovulatory infertile PCOS patients, very few data are available in literature regarding the best integrated strategy. In fact, a single compound could be effective as first-step approach but not or less useful when integrated in a more complex strategy.

The goal of the current protocol will be to compare three different strategies for treating anovulatory infertility in PCOS patients having as primary end-point the multiple pregnancy rate.
Anovulatory Infertility Related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Clomiphene citrate, metformin, metformin plus clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins
Multiple pregnancy rate, 9 months
Ovulation rate, 15 months|Pregnancy rate, 15 months|Abortion rate, 15 months|Live-birth rate, 24 months|Adverse-events, 15
All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of antropometric, hormonal, and ultrasonographic assessments. Successively, patients enrolled will be allocated in three different strategies (strategy A, B, and C).

A total of 184 infertile PCOS patients per arm will be enrolled and treated with three different integrated strategies: clomiphene followed by clomiphene plus metformin followed by gonadotropins (strategy A); metformin followed by metformin plus clomiphene followed by gonadotropins(strategy B); and metformin plus clomiphene followed by gonadotropins(strategy C).

In all patients, the same regimen will be used to administered clomiphene, metformin, and gonadotropins.Both clomiphene and metformin will be administered at incremental doses in each case.Gonadotropins will be administrated to obtain a controlled ovarian stimulation using highly purified urinary FSH in a low-dose step-up protocol.

During the study, the clinical and reproductive outcomes, and adverse experiences will be evaluated in each woman.
