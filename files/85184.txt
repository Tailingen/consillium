Study of AGEN1571 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, Phase 1, 2-part trial to determine recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) and evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of AGEN1571 both as a monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab (PD-1 inhibitor) and/or botensilimab (2-agent combination or 3-agent combination) in participants diagnosed with advanced solid tumors.

Part 1 will be the dose escalation phase to determine the RP2D of AGEN1571 monotherapy or AGEN1571 in combination with balstilimab and/or botensilimab. Part 2 will be the dose expansion phase for specific disease indications. Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years, or until any disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or participant wishes to withdraw consent for any reason.
