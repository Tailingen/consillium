NKX019, Intravenous Allogeneic Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer Cells (CAR NK), in Adults With B-cell Cancers
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 study to determine the safety and tolerability of an experimental therapy called NKX019 (allogeneic CAR NK cells targeting CD19) in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)

BIOLOGICAL: NKX019
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Incidence, nature, and severity of treatment related adverse events will be evaluated. An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, symptom or disease., 30 days after last dose of NKX019|Proportion of subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities of NKX019, DLTs are defined as adverse events attributable to NKX019 treatment that occur during Cycle 1 and meet protocol-specified criteria, 28 days from first dose of NKX019|Objective response rate to NKX019 in Part 2, Percentage of subjects with complete and partial response. Response to treatment will be assessed based on: Lugano classification with LYRIC refinement for subjects with NHL (except CLL/SLL and WM); 2018 iwCLL guidelines for subjects with CLL/SLL; Version 1.2020 NCCN for subjects with B-ALL; consensus criteria from the 6th International Workshop on Waldenström Macroglobulinemia for subjects with WM., Primary assessment: 28 days after the first dose of NKX019 followed up to 2 years after the last dose of NKX019]
Assessment of NKX019 half-life, Time required for 50% reduction from maximum amount of circulating NKX019, Time Frame: 28 days from first dose of NKX019|NKX019 duration of persistence, Testing NKX019 in peripheral blood every 3 months after dosing to determine persistence, Followed up to 2 years after last dose of NKX019|Evaluation of host immune response against NKX019, Serum samples will be measured for antibodies against NKX019, Followed up to 2 years after last dose of NKX019|Objective response rate to NKX019 in Part 1, Percentage of subjects with complete and partial response. Response to treatment will be assessed based on: Lugano classification with LYRIC refinement for subjects with NHL (except CLL/SLL and WM); 2018 iwCLL guidelines for subjects with CLL/SLL; Version 1.2020 NCCN for subjects with B-ALL; consensus criteria from the 6th International Workshop on Waldenström Macroglobulinemia for subjects with WM., Primary assessment: 28 days after first dose of NKX019 followed up to 2 years after last dose of NKX019
This is a dose-finding study of NKX019 and will be conducted in 2 parts:

Part 1: dose finding utilizing a "3+3" enrollment schema and safety lead-in to confirm dose for NKX019 in combination with rituximab expansion cohorts (as applicable) Part 2: dose expansion to further evaluate safety and tolerability, cellular kinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor response in expansion cohorts of patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), indolent lymphoma (IL), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), CLL/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and B-ALL.
