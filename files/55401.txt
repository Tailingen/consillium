Biomarkers in Samples From Younger Patients With Wilms Tumor
This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from younger patients with Wilms tumor. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment
Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Relationship of tumor-associated macrophages and prognosis, Correlation of each type of macrophage score with tumor staging, presence of vascular invasion, and disease-free survival will be assessed., 1 month
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages is related to clinicopathological factors in Wilms tumor (tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor progression, and survival).

OUTLINE:

Paraffin-embedded specimens are analyzed for macrophage markers. Results of each sample are then compared with patient's tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor progression, and survival.
