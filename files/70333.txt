Open-label Study Comparing AAA817 Versus Standard of Care in the Treatment of Previously Treated PSMA-positive mCRPC Adults Who Have Disease Progressed on or After [177Lu]Lu-PSMA Targeted Therapy
This is a Phase II/III study. Patient population is adult participants with PSMA-positive mCRPC who had treatments with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and taxane-based chemotherapy and progressed on or after \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA targeted therapy.

Treatment of interest: the investigational treatment is AAA817 regardless of subsequent anti-neoplastic treatment. The control treatment is investigator's choice of Standard of Care, regardless of subsequent anti-neoplastic treatment

Study CAAA817A12201 consists of 2 parts: a randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, phase II study (Phase II) to collect more information to support the proposed dose of AAA817 and a randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, 2- arm phase III study (Phase III) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of proposed dose of AAA817 vs. investigator's choice of standard of care (SoC) in the treatment of adult participants with PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had treatments with ARPI and taxane-based chemotherapy, and progressed on or after \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA targeted therapy. The purpose of the phase II part (Phase II) of this study is to collect additional information to support proposed phase III dose of AAA817.
