A Non-interventional Prospective Study of 1-st Line Treatment Approaches in OVArian Cancer Patients With HRD+ Status in Russian Federation
Study population will consist of HRD+ (BRCAm +/- positive genomic instability score according to used test system) OC with available medical history. It is estimated that approximately 400 patients will be enrolled in approximately 25 sites. Demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment approaches and outcomes in HRD+ patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer will be collected at baseline and on prospective visits.
