VIC-1911 Combined With Osimertinib for EGFR -Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a nonrandomized, open phase I dose escalation and extension clinical study designed to evaluate Aurora A inhibitor VIC-1911 tablets in combination with oxitinib in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary antitumor efficacy were analyzed.

The entire study included the screening period (28 days prior to initialadministration of the investigational drug) and the treatment period (Cycle) EoT is defined as disease progression or intolerable toxicity or premature withdrawal Out\]) and the safety follow-up period (28 days after EoT). During dose increments and expansions, subjects followed Safety assessment, PK blood collection, imaging examination and efficacy assessment were performed during the visit plan. Observation subject The safety, tolerability, and occurrence of DLT until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, Death, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up or termination of the study by the sponsor shall prevail.
