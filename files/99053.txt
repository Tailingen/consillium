Sequential vs Upfront Intensified Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Large Resectable or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.
2 different treatment schedules may be used for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer using adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and taxotere. The most optimal sequence- concurrent or sequential- is however unclear. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T(adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, taxotere) versus TAC ( with upfront T) in patient with large resectable or locally advanced breast cancer.

The pathologic complete response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
The delivered chemotherapy dose and dose-intensity of both chemotherapy regimens|The tolerability (grade 3/4 CTC toxicities) of both chemotherapy regimens.|The clinical responses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlated to pathological responses after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.|The value of breast MRI in evaluating response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as compared to clinical palpation, ultrasound techniques and histo-pathological outcome.|The false-negative rate of the sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.|The disease-free and overall survival after 3 and 5 years follow-up.|The relation between pCR and DFS/OS.|The feasibility of the criteria for reporting pathological tumour response in surgical breast and axillary node resection specimens.|The prognostic and predictive value of tumour- and molecular markers, including ER, PgR, c-erbB2, microarray and other tumour characteristic analyses.
