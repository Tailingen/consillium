Universal Dual-target NKG2D-NKp44 CAR-T Cells in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of universal chimeric natural killer receptor modified T-cells (CNK-UT) targeting NKG2D-Ligands and NCR2-Ligands with or without lymphodepletion in advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Universal Chimeric Natural Killer Receptor Modified T-cells (CNK-UT)
Incidence of Treatment Related adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Treatment Related AEs, AEs of special interest and serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, up to 1 year|Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) & incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), up to 21 days since first infusion of CNK-UT
Objective response rate (ORR), The number of cases in which tumor size is reduced to PR or CR / the total number of evaluable cases (%). In the event of PR or CR, the participants should confirm it no less than 4 weeks after the first evaluation, up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), The number of cases in which response are achieved from the start of cells infusion/the total number of evaluable cases (%), up to 1 year|Best overall response(BOR), The best efficacy recorded from the beginning of treatment to the progression or recurrence of the disease, up to 1 year|Duration of response (DOR), The period from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the first evaluation of PD or death of any cause, up to 1 year|Progression-free survival (PFS), The period from the day when the participant receives the infusion of cellss to the first recorded tumor progression (whether treated or not) or death of any cause, which occurs first, up to 1 year|Overall survival (OS), The period from the first infusion to any cause of death, up to 1 year|Pharmacokinetics (PK), CNK-UT DNA in peripheral blood detected by q-PCR after infusion, up to 48 weeks|Pharmacodynamics (PD), IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, up to 48 weeks|tumor marker, specific tumor related biomarker(such as CEA、CA19-9，CA125、CA50、CA242、AFP) will be analyzed, up to 48 weeks|Immunogenicity, Antidrug antibodies (ADA) in peripheral blood detected by q-PCR, up to 48 weeks
biomarkers, Detection the expression of NKG2D ligand, NKp44 ligand, PD-L1, TIL infiltration ( biomarkers related to clear indications in tumor tissue using immunohistochemical methods, such as RAS and BRAF gene mutations, MSI/MMR, etc. in colorectal cancer.), Enrollment|HLA typing, Evaluate the impact of HLA typing matching between donors and participants on the survival time and efficacy of CNK-UT in vivo., Baseline
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase I, dose escalation/indications expansion study to assess the safety and tolerability of CNK-UT cells therapy, and to obtain the preliminary efficacy, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity result in participants who have been diagnosed with advanced solid tumors and failed to standard systemic treatment.
