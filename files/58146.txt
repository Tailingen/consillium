Dose Escalation, Combination Chemotherapy Safety Study of Birinapant (TL32711), in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a dose escalation safety study of birinapant (TL32711) in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Cancer
DRUG: Birinapant
Number of Subjects With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability including changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), safety and laboratory parameters, 1 Cycle (3-4 weeks)
Evaluation of Anti-tumor Efficacy, Tumor burden according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and time to progression, Every 2 cycles|Evaluation of Pharmacokinetics and Translational Biomarkers, Measurement of TL32711 pharmacokinetics: Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (t1/2) and assessment of translational biomarkers in plasma, PBMC's and tumor biopsies. Gene expression profiling of tumor tissue., Cycle 1 and Cycle 2
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of birinapant (TL32711) as a 30 minute intravenous infusion once a week, for 2 consecutive weeks, when combined with standard regimens of chemotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Additionally the study will assess anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory biomarkers as a measurement of pharmacodynamic effects.
