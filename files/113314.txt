A Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Ceritinib in Patients With ALK-positive NSCLC Metastatic to the Brain and/or to Leptomeninges
This was a phase II, multi-center, open-label, five-arm study in which the efficacy and safety of oral ceritinib treatment was assessed in patients with NSCLC metastatic to the brain and/or to leptomeninges harboring a confirmed ALK rearrangement, using the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc.) test and scoring algorithm (including positivity criteria). If documentation of ALK rearrangement as described above was not locally available, a test to confirm ALK rearrangement was performed by a Novartis designated central laboratory. Patients waited for the central laboratory result of the ALK rearrangement status before initiating treatment with ceritinib.

Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per Investigator Assessment, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the whole body as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by the investigator.

Approximately 160 patients diagnosed with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC (according to the 7th edition of the AJCC \[American Joint Committee on Cancer\] Cancer Staging Manual) and active lesions in the brain and/or diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis were included in the study, approximately 40 patients in Arm 1 and Arm 2, approximately 30 patients in Arms 3 and Arm 4, and approximately 20 patients in Arm 5. Additional patients were enrolled in Arm 4 to achieve approximately 60 patients in Arms 3 and 4 together (i.e. ALKi naïve patients), if enrollment rate in Arm 3 was slow.

* Arm 1 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain and with prior exposure to an ALKi.
* Arm 2 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain but with prior exposure to an ALKi.
* Arm 3 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain but with no prior exposure to an ALKi.
* Arm 4 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain and with no prior exposure to an ALKi
* Arm 5 included any patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with or without evidence of active lesion at the baseline Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI.

Note: Previous treatment with ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib was not allowed in Arms 1, 2, and 5.

Ceritinib was administered orally once daily at a dose of 750 mg (five 150 mg capsules) on a continuous dosing schedule. The treatment period started on Cycle 1 Day 1.

Complete tumor assessments including gadolinium enhanced brain MRI was repeated at Week 8 (on Cycle 3 Day 1) and every 8 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) thereafter or earlier if clinically indicated. Safety evaluations included (S)AEs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, laboratory parameters and WHO performance status. Blood and CSF samples for PK were also collected.
