Disease Status Assessment During the Vaccination Period, The disease status was assessed by computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT at baseline and after the fourth vaccination of each cycle. During the "booster vaccines" period, imagery examinations were performed every 3 months for patients with measurable disease and every 6 months for patients with non measurable disease.

The tumor response was assessed according to the classification World Health Organization (WHO) 1979 and defined as:

* No Evidence of Disease (NED)
* Stable disease (SD): Change in size of all measurable lesions (the sum of the products of the greatest and perpendicular parameters), of less than a 25% increase or 25% decrease from baseline for at least 4 weeks, without appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion.
* Progressing disease (PD): Appearance of new tumors, or increase in size of any measurable tumor by at least 25% of the sum of the product of the greatest and perpendicular diameter., Disease status at baseline, after cycle 1 (3 months), after cycle 2 (8 months), after cycle 3 (13 months) and if applicable after boost cycles (16 months, 19 months or 22 months)
Current peptide vaccines suffer from low efficiency, since they induce only weak immune activation. We have recently confirmed that in humans the immune response was readily detectable in local lymph nodes while no or only weak activation could be identified in circulating lymphocytes. Increased doses of antigen and adjuvant allow a better extension from local to systemic immune responses.
