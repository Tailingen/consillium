Anti-GD2 3F8 Antibody and Allogeneic Natural Killer Cells for High-Risk Neuroblastoma
Funding Source - FDA OOPD FDR004128

The goal of this study is to see if it is safe and feasible to give chemotherapy, natural killer (NK) cells, and an antibody called 3F8. The NK cells must come from a family member who shares half of the HLA proteins which are immune proteins important in transplant. NK cells are a type of white blood cell. They can recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body and can work together with antibodies to kill target cells. The antibody 3F8 specifically recognizes a protein present on the target cancer cell.
