An Organoid-on-chips Technique Based on Biopsy Samples and Its Efficacy in Predicting the Response to HAI in HCC
This study is aimed to establish an organoid-on-chips technological system based on biopsy samples and evaluate its efficacy in predicting the response to mFOLFOX6 infusion in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

This is a two-stage, multi-center real-world observational study. In stage 1, we aim to establish the technical system of organoid-on-chips culture system based on biopsy samples from patients with malignant solid tumors including breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, bile duct cancer and pancreatic cancer, et.al. In stage 2, we aim to evaluate the predicting efficacy of the established organoid-on-chips system in HCC patients who undergo hepatic artery infusion (HAI) with mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85mg/m\^2, d1, HAI for 2h; calcium folinate 200mg/m\^2, d1, HAI for 1h; fluorouracil 400mg/m\^2, hepatic artery injection; fluorouracil 2400mg/m\^2, HAI for 46h).
