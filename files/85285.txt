A Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of BMS-986158 Alone and in Combination With Either Ruxolitinib or Fedratinib in Participants With Blood Cancer (Myelofibrosis)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BMS-986158 alone and in combination with either Ruxolitinib or Fedratinib in participants with Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS)-intermediate or high risk blood cancer. Part 1 consists of BMS-986158 in combination with either Ruxolitinib or Fedratinib and Part 2 consists of BMS-986158 in combination with either Ruxolitinib or Fedratinib and BMS-986158 alone.
