Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Single Dose Tranexamic Acid in Reducing Blood Loss During Colorectal Cancer Surgery
A total of 46 patients scheduled for explorative laparotomy with the aim of radical debulking surgery for colorectal cancer will be randomized into two equal groups one will receive tranexamic acid and one placebo.

The TA group will receive an intravenous bolus of (10 mg/kg) in 100 ml of normal saline over 20 minutes after induction of anesthesia and before surgical incision. In the control group, patients will receive a placebo of 100 mL 0.9% normal saline. The primary endpoint is reduction in blood loss, while the secondary endpoint was the number of patients needing transfusion and occurrence of postoperative thrombotic complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days after surgery.
