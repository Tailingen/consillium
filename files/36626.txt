Safety Study of a Liposomal Docetaxel Formulation in Patients With Solid Tumors Who Have Failed Previous Therapies
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of ATI-1123 a liposomal formulation of docetaxel, in the treatment of cancer patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Non-Small Cell Lung
DRUG: ATI-1123 (active drug = docetaxel)
To determine the (MTD) and (DLTs) of ATI-1123 administered every 3 weeks, over a range of doses in patients with advanced solid tumors., Duration of study|To establish the dose recommended for future phase II studies with ATI-1123., End of Study
To establish the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered ATI-1123., Cycle 1 (various time points within the cycle)|To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of ATI-1123 by objective radiographic assessment., Every 8 weeks
The majority of advanced stage human cancers are fatal if not treated promptly and aggressively. Standard treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Docetaxel, the active ingredient in ATI-1123 and the FDA approved drug Taxotere, is a chemotherapy given by IV to patients to treat various types of cancers.

Docetaxel is a poorly water soluble semi-synthetic taxane analog commonly used in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including non-small cell lung, prostate, breast, gastric and head and neck cancer. Because of its poor water solubility it is formulated with co-solvents that can potentially contribute to treatment related adverse events such as hypersensitivity. Current taxane formulations often complicate drug delivery and can alter both pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles.

Results from nonclinical evaluations show that ATI-1123 retains the antineoplastic activity of docetaxel while removing the need for unwanted solvents like Tween 80. The administration of ATI-1123 versus other docetaxel chemotherapy formulations is expected to reduce hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching at the infusion site), eliminate the requirement for premedications, have a broader therapeutic index, and enhance systemic docetaxel exposure.
