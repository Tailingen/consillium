A Study of Gentuximab + Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
The objective of the study is to evaluate Tolerability, Safety, and primary Efficacy of Gentuximab Injection at different dosage in combination with Paclitaxel in Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer patients, to ensure adequate treatment dosage for further study. Meanwhile, the study also evaluate Pharmacokinetics of Gentuximab Injection at different dosage in combination with Paclitaxel.
Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
DRUG: Gentuximab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), Number of Participants With One or More Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs) defined as DLT in the protocol, Up to 4 Weeks|AEs or SAEs, Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Baseline through Study Completion, about 24 weeks
Objective response rate（ORR）, Proportion of Participants With CR and PR, Up to 6 cycles (28 days for every cycle)|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from randomization to the patient tumor progression or death., Up to 6 cycles (28 days for every cycle)|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of Participants With CR, PR and SD, Up to 6 cycles (28 days for every cycle)|Time-to-progress (TTP), The time from randomization to the patient tumor progression., Up to 6 cycles (28 days for every cycle)|Time-to-failure (TTF), The time from randomization to the patient withdraw from the study., Up to 6 cycles (28 days for every cycle)|Anti-drug antibody, Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies, Up to 6 cycles (28 days for every cycle)|Pharmacokinetics Cmax, Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cycle 1(day1-day 15)& Cycle 2(day 15-day26) & Cycle 3(day 1) (28 days for every cycle)|Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), Cycle 1(day1-day 15)& Cycle 2(day 15-day26) & Cycle 3(day 1) Cycle 1(day1-day 15)& Cycle 2(day 15-day26) & Cycle 3(day 1) （28 days for every cycle）
The study includes dose-limiting toxicity （DLT）observing period and randomization period with two cohorts as low-dose group（Gentuximab Injection 8mg/kg+ paclitaxel） and high-dose group（Gentuximab Injection 12mg/kg+ paclitaxel）. During the study，the anti-cancer efficacy, safety and anti-drug antibody were evaluated in all patients. DLT observation is only to subjects enrolled in DLT observation period and it lasts one treatment period. PK were doing in part of subjects.
