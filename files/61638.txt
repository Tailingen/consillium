Randomized Study of Preoperative Dexamethasone for Quality of Recovery in VATS Lung Resection Patients
The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation if a small dose of IV dexamethasone during induction anesthesia in association to pre and postoperative intercostal nerve block, improves quality of recovery of thoracoscopic lung resection patients.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Dexamethasone IV|DRUG: Saline solution
The primary outcome of this study will be postoperative quality of recovery measured by postoperative quality of recovery score 40 (QoR-40) global score., During the hospital stay and 1 year later
Time of analgesia between the final intercostal nerve block and the first patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) request;, During the hospital stay and 1 year later
Correlation between pain with visual analog scale and lung function through spirometry test with forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) and diffusion capacity (DLCO), During the hospital stay and 1 year later|Total opioid dose consumption in each group, During the hospital stay and 1 year later|Side-effect of dexamethasone in the stress response to surgery, During the hospital stay and 1 year later
This is a study composed by 2 groups of 50 patients undergoing VATS for lung cancer. All subjets will receive intraoperative intercostal nerve block with a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg of bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200.000 at the beginning and at the end of procedure.

The control group will receive a bolus dose of dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) and the placebo group saline solution. The study drug or placebo will be administered at the time of anesthetic induction (approximately 30 minutes before surgical incision). Patients will be evaluated daily with the quality of recovery questionary, visual analogue pain and portable spirometry. And, the patients will have pulmonary lung function assessed by portable spirometry.
