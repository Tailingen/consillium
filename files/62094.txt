Assessment of Efficacy and Safety of Front-line Fludarabine, Cyclophoshamide and Ofatumumab Chemoimmunotherapy in Young Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
Assessment of safety and efficacy of with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) combined with ofatumumab (FCO2) in previously untreated "young" patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).
B-cell Lymphoid Leukemia|Young Patients
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Ofatumumab
Number of complete responses., The complete response (CR) rate after FCO2 front-line treatment., After 8 months from study entry.
Number of overall responses., Overall Response (OR) rate after FCO2 front-line treatment., After 8 months from study entry.|Number of patients in progression-free survival., Progression-free survival (PFS) calculated from the date of first treatment dose - induction phase - until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease or until death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first. Patients still alive and known to be progression free will be censored at the moment of last follow-up., After 32 months from study entry.|Number of patients needing a new CLL Treatment., Time to a new CLL treatment (TTT) will be calculated from the date of last treatment dose until date of a new treatment received for CLL, where death occurred before the new treatment will be considered as competing risk. Patients still alive without receiving a new treatment will be censored at the time of the last follow-up., After 32 months from study entry.|Number of patients in overall survival, Overall survival (OS): defined as the time interval between the date of first treatment dose - induction phase- and the date of death for any cause; patients still alive will be censored at the moment of last follow-up., After 32 months from study entry.|Number of toxic events., Toxicity of treatment according the last NCI criteria., After 32 months from study entry.|Outcome of patients according to clinical and biologica variables., Outcome of patients (response, PFS OS) according to clinical and biologic variables (age; size of nodes, 2-microglobulin, lymphocyte count, stage, IgVH, p53, FISH, ZAP-70, CD38, FLCs)., After 32 months from study entry.
Given that:

* rituximab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR) front-line treatment was associated with a high OR rate, superior PFS and OS as compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide regimen;
* a direct relationship between the dose of rituximab and the response rate has been reported;
* ofatumumab, as single agent, proved activity in CLL patients with refractory disease;
* ofatumumab, fludarabine and cylophosphamide (O-FC) front-line treatment has been associated with a high complete response (CR) rate;
* the expected grade 3-4 granulocytopenia could led to reduce the dose intensity of study drugs (FC) and increase the infection rate; a schedule combining FC with an increased dose of ofatumumab associated to primary phrophylaxis of granulocytopenia could be associated with an improvement in the CR rate. The purpose of this study is to determine whether we could improve the CR rate of the golden standard treatment for fit patients with CLL , the FCR regimen, with a chemoimmunotherapy including FC combined with an increased dose of the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, given every other week (FCO2) associated with a primary prophylaxis of granulocytopenia.
