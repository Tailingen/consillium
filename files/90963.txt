Elranatamab Post Cilta-cel in Patients With Clinical High Risk Relapsed Myeloma
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Elranatamab therapy after cilta-cel measuring how long a patient with high risk relapsed myeloma lives without the myeloma getting worse(progressing), also known as progression-free survival (PFS). Patients with clinical high-risk myeloma, defined as having history of myeloma that has grown outside of the bones or having high risk mutations in the myeloma cells, benefit less from cilta-cel compared to myeloma patients without these characteristics.
Myeloma
DRUG: Elranatamab
Progression Free Surival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is measured from the date of initiation of Elranatamab (i.e., on-treatment date) to either the date of death from any cause or the date of disease progression, whichever comes first., Up to 24 Months
Complete Response, Proportion of participants with a complete response at the end of treatment., Up to 12 months|MRD Negative, Proportion of participants with MRD negativity at the end of treatment., Up to 12 months
