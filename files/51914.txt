Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS) by IRR in Participants With a BRCA Alteration, The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is rPFSirr, defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic progression, or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first).

Interim Overall Survival in Participants With a BRCA Alteration, Overall survival time is calculated as the time from randomization to death (by any cause) +1 day. Participants who have not died will be censored on the date the participant was last known to be alive., From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 5 years)|Interim Overall Survival in Participants With a BRCA or ATM Alteration Combined, Overall survival time is calculated as the time from randomization to death (by any cause) +1 day. Participants who have not died will be censored on the date the participants was last known to be alive., From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 5 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by IRR in Participants With a BRCA Alteration, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed best response of Complete response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) in participants with measurable disease at study entry. Modified RECIST Version 1.1 criteria is used to determine ORR (ie, CR or PR by IRR assessment and no progression in bone per PCWG3 by IRR assessment).

CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., From enrollment to primary completion of study (Total follow-up was up to approximately 4 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by IRR in Participants With a BRCA or ATM Alteration Combined, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed best response of Complete response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) in participants with measurable disease at study entry.
