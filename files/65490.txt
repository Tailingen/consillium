Cabozantinib and Dostarlimab in Recurrent Gynecologic Carcinosarcoma
Immunotherapy has gained a significant amount of attention recently, but its efficacy as a single agent in gynecological cancers has been disappointing. Pre-clinical evidence supports the combination of using Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF) inhibitors with immunotherapy. VEGF inhibitors suppress the activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF has been shown to affect the functional maturation of dendritic cells; therefore, VEGF inhibitors could improve the function of antigen presentation. In this study, Cabozantinib (VEGF inhibitor) and Dostarlimab (immunotherapeutic drug) will be admnistered as a combination to patients with recurrent gynecologic carcinosarcoma.
