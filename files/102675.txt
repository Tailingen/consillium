Exploring Relevant Immune-based Biomarkers and Circulating Tumor Cells During Treatment With Immunotherapy in Genitourinary Malignancies (CTC Immune Based Biomarkers)
This pilot study purpose of this study is to describe peripheral circulating immune cell profiles at baseline and change on treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.
