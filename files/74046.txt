An Observational Study of Radiotherapy After Injection of SpaceOAR Hydrogel
This observational study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of radiotherapy for subjects with localized T1-T2 prostate cancer in China who were injected with SpaceOAR Hydrogel, via collecting clinical data related to radiotherapy.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: SpaceOAR Hydrogel
Change of Dose Rectum Volume Receiving Radiation Between Radiotherapy Plannings Pre and Post SpaceOAR Hydrogel Injection., Change of dose rectum volume receiving radiation,which is measured by Dose-volume histogram in radiotherapy planning pre and post SpaceOAR hydrogel injection radiotherpy planning is made based on CT simulation scans., Post injection gel surgery 1-10 days
Urinary, Bowel and Sexual Function Assessment Score, Descrpition of change of urinary, bowel and Sexual function assessment score, which are measured by Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26. EPIC-26 is short form version to measure health related quality of life among men with prostate cancer, which contains 26 item and 5 domains : Urinary Incontinence, Urinary irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly from 0 score to 100 scores, with higher scores representing better., After the completion of radiotherapy, the month 3 Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 score was compared to the baseline EPIC-26 score.|Quality of Life Was Measured by EQ-5D-5L Scale（the Five-level Version of the EuroQol 5-Dimension Scale), Frequencies and proportions of responses in five dimension (Mobility, Anxiety/Depression, Pain/Discomfort, Usual Activities and Self-Care) and different levels will be tabulated, which was measured by EQ-5D-5L scale（the five-level version of the EuroQol 5-Dimension scale).The minimum value and maximum value of EQ VAS (EQ visual analogue scale) are from 0 score to100 scores, which a higher value means a beter outcome., After the completion of radiotherapy, the month 3 EQ-5D-5L scale（the five-level version of the EuroQol 5-Dimension scale) score was compared to the baseline EQ-5D-5L scale score.|The Distance Between Prostate and Rectum, The distance between the posterior prostatic capsule and anterior rectal wall is measured on the axial image slice closest to halfway between apex and base, from posterior edge of prostate to inner rectal wall via MRI., After the completion of radiotherapy, the weeks 6 the distance between prostate and rectum measured by MRI was compared to the baseline the distance between prostate and rectum measured by MRI.|the Distance Between the Prostate and Rectum, The presence of SpaceOAR hydrogel between prostate and rectum is evaluated by MRI via distance indirectly., After the completion of radiotherapy, the month 10 the distance between prostate and rectum measured by MRI was compared to the baseline the distance between prostate and rectum measured by MRI.|Adverse Event Related to SpaceOAR Hydrogel (Safety), The relationship of AE /ADE/SAE/SADE/UADEs will be assessed by investigators., Through the entire study phase until 10 months after the completion of radiotherapy.
This study protocol is for the second part of SpaceOAR real world study in which long term follow-up visits will be performed (up to 1 year) outside Boao Medical Tourism Pilot Zone. The SpaceOAR real world study is a retrospective and prospective, single arm, observational study (Ptotocol of SpaceOAR RWS Windchill#: 92743236). Subjects with localized T1-T2 prostate cancer who have already been injected with the SpaceOAR and have received radiotherapy or will receive radiotherapy will be enrolled, and clinical data related to radiotherapy will be collected. For subjects who have already completed radiotherapy before study kick-off, clinical data will be collected retrospectively, such as data related to radiotherapy, AE (if any) and MRI (if any). Follow up vist will be completed if applicable. For subjects who receive therapy after study kick-off, follow up visits at 2 weeks, 6weeks, 3 months and 10 months after radiotherapy will be scheduled to assess bowel, urinary and sexual function and quality of life.
