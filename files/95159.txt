A Study of Radspherin® in Patients with Primary Advanced Epithelial Cancer, with Peritoneal Metastasis That Are Homologous Recombination Proficient Scheduled to Undergo Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Interval Debulking Surgery
This is a Phase 2, controlled, randomised, parallel assignment, open label, multicentre study to evaluate efficacy and safety of a single intraperitoneal injection of Radspherin® in patients with primary advanced high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, with peritoneal metastasis that are HR proficient and scheduled to undergo NACT and IDS. The study will be conducted in 2 parts; first, a Safety Lead-in Cohort will be recruited followed by the randomised part of the study. For both parts of the study, patients must be scheduled to undergo NACT and IDS and complete resection to no residual tumour (R0) should be deemed to be achievable during diagnostic work-up. Patients in both parts of the study will undergo the same procedures and assessments.
