Investigate the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Vandetanib and Concurrent Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Brain Metastases
A clinical study to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of Vandetanib and concurrent WBRT in patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. All patients will receive WBRT, 10 fractions of 3 Gy. Patients will start 7 days prior to start of radiation treatment with Vandetanib. Total treatment time with Vandetanib is 3 weeks (21 days).
