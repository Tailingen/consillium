Folfiri/aflIbercept in Metastatic coloreCTal Cancer patIents With RAS Validated Wild typE Status
The study will a be a biologically enriched, prospectively stratified phase II trial in RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients progressing after first-line treatment with oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines and an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody.

All patients will receive aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI according to the Italian label.
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Aflibercept, 5fluorouracil, Folinic Acid andIrinotecan
Overall survival (OS) according to VEGFR2 levels, evaluating the difference in terms of median OS among patients with high VEGFR2 activity and patients with low VEGFR2 activity, Overall survival time is defined as the time from inclusion to the date of death. If subject has not died, survival will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive (last date of follow-up), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years
Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the interval between the start of Aflibercept-FOLFIRI therapy to tumor progression or death or last follow up visit if not progressed, PFS time will defined as the time of inclusion until the date of first observed disease progression or death due to any cause, if death occurs before progression is documented, time from the start of treatment untill the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years|Response rate (RR) defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), v. 1.1, All patients must be considered in response analysis, including those who discontinue treatment or who die for any reason prior to respnse evaluation, Response of treatment is evaluated according to the RECIST criteria at the end of chemotherapyassessed up to 24 weeks|Toxicity Profile defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03, Treatment-emergent adverse events, drug-related adverse events and safety laboratory parameters will be analysed by CTCAE grade, every 4 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle is 15 days), up to 16 weeks|Angiogenetic factors levels concentration before and during treatment., Angiogenetic factors levels concentration (VEGF, PlGF, HGF, VEGF-R, IL8, IL1a, T-cad, VEGFR3, SAP, VDBP, neuropilin1, CRP, endoglin plasma concentrations), evaluated before treatment and before each cycle (each cycle is 15 days) according to an ELISA-based technique, through completion, an overage of 1 year
The study will a be a biologically enriched, prospectively stratified phase II trial in RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients progressing after first-line treatment with oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines and an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. Eligible patients will be prospectively allocated to either of two groups according to VEGFR2 levels (ELISA-based technique, pg/ml) at study entry.

Others angiogenetic factors levels concentration before and during treatment. VEGF, PlGF, HGF, VEGFR1, IL8, IL1a, T-cad, VEGFR3, SAP, VDBP, neuropilin1, CRP, endoglin plasma concentrations will be evaluated before each cycle according to an ELISA-based technique All patients will undergo a blood test for retrieving circulating tumor DNA (Liquid Biopsy) at selected time-points before and during treatment for determining whether the status of selected tumor biomarkers evolve during tumor progression by comparing different ctDNA samples.

All patients will receive aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI according to the Italian label.
