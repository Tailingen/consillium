Study of ET140202 T Cells in Adults With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a open-label, dose escalation, multi-center, Phase I / Phase II study to assess the safety of an autologous T-cell product (ET140202) in adult subjects with advanced Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) positive/Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) A-2 positive Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

BIOLOGICAL: ET140202 autologous T cell product
Incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) after infusion of ET140202 T cells, Safety and tolerability of ET140202 T cells as assessed by committee review of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) after infusion, 28 days|The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen of ET140202 T-cell therapy, The RP2D will be determined by the study Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) and primarily based on DLT, and secondarily on the best tumor response, up to 2 years
Assess efficacy of ET140202 T cells by overall response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., As a measure of activity, overall response rate will be assessed by radiographic scans and assessed according to RECIST criteria., up to 2 years|Assess efficacy of ET140202 T cells by complete response (CR) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., As a measure of activity, CR rate will be assessed by radiographic scans and assessed according to RECIST criteria., up to 2 years|Assess efficacy of ET140202 T cells by partial response (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., As a measure of activity, PR rate will be assessed by radiographic scans and assessed according to RECIST criteria., up to 2 years|Assess efficacy of ET140202 T cells by progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., As a measure of activity, PFS rate will be assessed by radiographic scans and assessed according to RECIST criteria., up to 2 years|Assess efficacy of ET140202 T cells by overall survival (OS) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)., As a measure of activity, OS rate will be assessed by radiographic scans and assessed according to RECIST criteria., up to 2 years|Assess the expansion of ET140202 T cells in the blood shortly after infusion., The maximum (peak) expansion of ET140202 T cells in the blood post infusion will be determined., up to 2 years|Assess the persistence of ET140202 T cells circulating in blood over time., The level of ET140202 T cells in blood will be determined to assess the persistence of ET140202 T cells during the treatment and follow-up phases of the study., up to 2 years
The purpose of this study is to investigate a genetically modified autologous T-cell therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET140202 T cells are autologous T cells genetically modified to carry a TCR-mimic (TCRm) construct capable of mediating cell killing by targeting tumor specific intracellular antigens and addressing solid tumor therapy challenges.
