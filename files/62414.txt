A Randomized Study to Compare a Hydrogel Packing System to Standard Packing During HDR Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer
In this study, a new, low cost packing system ("BrachyGel VHPS") is being tested as a packing option during brachytherapy along with standard options to make sure that it keeps the unrelated organs away from radiation at least as well as the standard options, and to better understand the safety and patient discomfort associated with BrachyGel VHPS and the standard packing options.

As part of vaginal brachytherapy, the organs that do not need to receive radiation (unrelated organs) are moved out of the way of the radiation with a "packing system". The usual low cost and available standard of care packing systems to move these unrelated organs out of the way can sometimes be uncomfortable for the patient, may not move all of the unrelated organs all the way out of the radiation's path, and rely on the doctor to place them correctly.

If you participate, you will receive 5 fractions of brachytherapy according to standard clinical care. For three of the fractions, a standard packing option will be used and for two of them BrachyGel VHPS will be used. For the first fraction both groups will have the same packing option but participants will be randomized to either have BrachyGel during fractions 2 and 4 or during fractions 3 and 5. You'll be asked to complete a questionnaire after fractions 2-5 to get your feedback on any discomfort you have during or after brachytherapy from the packing system.
