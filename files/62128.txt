Neoadjuvant Darolutamide and Relugolix Combination Preceding Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of a new combination of darolutamide and relugolix as neoadjuvant therapy preceding radical prostatectomy (RP) for high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) in adult males.
Prostate CA|Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)|Prostate Cancer Surgery
DRUG: Darolutamide|DRUG: Relugolix|PROCEDURE: Radical Prostatectomy
Percentage of patients completing therapy without severe adverse events., From enrollment, up to 8 weeks after radical prostatectomy.|Number of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events using CTCAE version 5.0., From enrollment, up to 8 weeks following radical prostatectomy (RP)
Objective Radiographic Response, Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes in millimeters (mm). Response refers to the reduction in tumor size according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) criteria (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, or Progressive Disease)., From enrollment, up to 12 weeks (end of neoadjuvant therapy).|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Response, The unit of measure is nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). A PSA response is defined as a decline of â‰¥50% from baseline levels., From enrollment, up to 8 weeks after radical prostatectomy.|Plasma Concentration of Darolutamide and Relugolix, This measure involves assessing the plasma concentration of darolutamide and relugolix at specified time points to determine their pharmacokinetic profiles. Units of measure: Concentration in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)., From enrollment, up to Day 1 of Cycle 3 (Each cycle is 28 days).
