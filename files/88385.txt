Advanced MR Imaging as Predictor of Treatment Response in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastomas
This clinical trial studies advanced MR imaging techniques in measuring early response of standard treatment may become predictors of long-term treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas.

DEVICE: 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging|DEVICE: Chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI|DEVICE: Diffusion weighted MRI|DEVICE: Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI
Diagnostic Performance of Response Rate, The response was determined by a modification of the RANO criteria that combined the image assessment, neurologic evaluation and assessment of steroid use. Clinical and radiologic assessments were carried out at pre-CCRT; 4 weeks after completion of the CCRT; and every 2 or 3 months during the adjuvant TMZ therapy. Complete Response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance on MR of all enhancing tumor; Partial Response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MR by bi-dimensional measurement; Pseudoprogression was defined when there was a decrease or stabilization of the contrast-enhancing lesions for a minimum of six months and combined with no change in treatment/ or a increase in contrast-enhancing lesion on the first subsequent follow-up MR image, as long as it stabilized on the second follow-up and there was no need for treatment change. Responder = CR+PR+Pseudoprogression, Non-responder = Progression., 6 month
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Estimated probable duration of life without disease progression, from on-study date to earlier of progression date or date of death from any cause, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring. Disease progression is defined under Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as \>=20% increase in sum of longest diameters (LD) of target lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions., On-study date to lesser of date of progression or date of death from any cause (assessed at 6 months)|Quantitative changes to tumor protein content and tumor acidosis, Amide proton transfer asymmetry (APTasym, %) from Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) Amine proton transfer asymmetry (AmPTasym %) from CEST, Baseline imaging within 4 weeks after surgery and 4 weeks after completion of CCRT|Quantitative changes to tumor cellularity, Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, mm2/s) from Diffusion weighted MRI, Baseline imaging within 4 weeks after surgery and 4 weeks after completion of CCRT|Quantitative changes to tumor perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, Normalized Cerebral blood volume (CBV, %) from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI, Baseline imaging within 4 weeks after surgery and 4 weeks after completion of CCRT|Quantitative changes to tumor perfusion using dynamic contrast enhancement MRI, Initial area-under-the-curve (IAUC) from dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)-MRI, Baseline imaging within 4 weeks after surgery and 4 weeks after completion of CCRT
The standard care of patients with glioblastoma is concomitant chemoradiation and adjuvant temozolomide. Allowing for assessment of tumor therapy prior to treatment completion is important to select patients most likely to benefit from alternative treatment option. Multimodal advanced MR imaging- contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging, and perfusion imaging on 3T enables quantitative assessment of treatment response. Quantifying changes in advanced MR imaging techniques would allow predict outcome for early and long-term treatment response and survival in glioblastomas.
