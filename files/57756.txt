Molecular Diagnosis on Circulating Tumor DNA of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to develop an ultra sensitive assay of mutation detection on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for treatment, diagnosis and monitoring disease progression of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Stage IIIb and IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
