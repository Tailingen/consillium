Neuromuscular Deconditioning and Reconditioning in Colon Cancer Patients: an APA Muscle Rendorcement Program
Colon cancer is a real public health problem with more than 46,000 new cases diagnosed per year in France and about 650 cases in Burgundy. Muscle deconditioning (MD), which is characterized by a loss of muscle mass and function, is a frequent consequence in cancer patients and conditions the prognosis. Therefore, it is essential to understand its complex etiology in oncology in order to address the real need for therapeutic countermeasures in clinical practice. DM is a multifactorial process that is exacerbated by therapies. It induces neurogenic and muscular alterations that can profoundly affect patients' quality of life.

Currently, analyses of this phenomenon in oncology have been limited essentially to a global evaluation of physical performance, neglecting the muscular and nervous nature of the adaptations responsible for it.

Most studies analyzing the therapeutic effects of physical activity (PA) have shown numerous physiological and psychological benefits of aerobic exercise. However, this form of PA is still not very effective in preserving muscle mass.

Only muscle strengthening can have an anabolic effect by accelerating the rate of protein synthesis.
