Lung B.A.S.E.S. 4 Life Mobile Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) Screening: Ages 40-54
Low-dose CT Screening has been shown in two large trials in the United States (NLST) and Europe (NELSON) to increase overall survival in subjects 55 years of age and older with a strong smoking history. Unfortunately, in both North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC), subjects are found to have the above referenced smoking history prior to reaching the minimum age in these studies. This study is aimed at decreasing the minimum age of screening in a high-risk population.

OTHER: Mobile Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) Screening
Lung cancer diagnosis rate in individuals 40-54 years of age at their first screening (T0) with mobile low-dose CT., The lung cancer diagnosis variable will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject's T0 screening results in a diagnosis of lung cancer., 1 day
Lung cancer diagnosis rate in individuals 40-54 years of age at subsequent screening visits (T1 and T2), The lung cancer diagnosis variable will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject's T1 and T2 screening results in a diagnosis of lung cancer., up to 24 months|Positive screening rate at T0, T1, and T2, The positive screening variable at T0, T1 and at T2 will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject's screening results indicate a Lung RADS of 3 or 4., up to 24 months|Impact of baseline demographic (including insurance status), socioeconomic, and healthcare-related factors on lung cancer rates and positive screening rates, All binary outcomes will be analyzed using logistic regression models to evaluate the impact of baseline demographic, socioeconomic, and health care-related factors., up to 24 months|Incidence rate of all types of cancer found with low-dose lung CT during lung cancer screening, Incidental cancer diagnosis resulting from LDCT scan findings at T0, at T1, and at T2 will be captured for each subject including binary value of yes vs no for other cancer diagnosis, diagnosis date, type of cancer, and stage of disease., up to 24 months
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the lung cancer diagnosis rate in individuals 40-54 years of age at their first screening (T0) with mobile low-dose CT. Secondary objectives include evaluating the lung cancer diagnosis rate in individuals 40-54 years of age at subsequent screening visits (T1 and T2); evaluating the positive screening rate at T0, T1, and T2; evaluating the impact of baseline demographic (including insurance status), socioeconomic, and healthcare-related factors on lung cancer rates and positive screening rates; and summarizing the incidence rate of all types of cancer found with low-dose lung CT during lung cancer screening. Enrollment will continue until 174 subjects are identified in the evaluable population with a total of 1160 subjects anticipated to be enrolled and screened.
