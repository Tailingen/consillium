Molecular Imaging of HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer Using 99mTc-HE3-G3
The study should evaluate distribution of 99mTc-HE3-G3 in patients with primary HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.

The primary objective are:

1. To assess distribution of 99mTc-HE3-G3 in normal tissues and in tumours over time;
2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-HE3-G3;
3. To obtain initial information concerning safety and tolerability of 99mTc-HE3-G3 after single intravenous injection:

The secondary objective are:

1.To compare the tumour imaging data with the concerning HER2 expression obtained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of biopsy samples.

DRUG: SPECT
Gamma camera-based whole-body 99mTc-HE3-G3 uptake value (%), Whole-body 99mTc-HE3-G3 uptake coinciding with normal organs and tissues will be assessed using gamma camera and calculated as percentage (%) of the injected dose of the radiopharmaceutical, 6 hours|SPECT-based 99mTc-HE3-G3 uptake value in tumor lesions (counts), 99mTc-HE3-G3 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions will be assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography and measured in counts, 6 hours|SPECT-based 99mTc-HE3-G3background uptake value (counts), Focal uptake of 99mTc-HE3-G3 in the regions without pathological findings will be assessed with SPECT and measured in counts, 6 hours|Tumor-to-background ratio (SPECT), The SPECT-based tumor-to-background ratio will be calculated as follows: the value of 99mTc-HE3-G3 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions (counts) will be divided by the value of 99mTc-HE3-G3 uptake coinciding with the regions without pathological findings (counts), 6 hours
Safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections (physical findings), The safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the assessments of physical examination, vital signs, and ECG (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 24 hours|Safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections (laboratory tests), The safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the blood and urine laboratory tests (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 24 hours|Safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections (incidence and severity of adverse events), The safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of adverse events (%), 24 hours|Safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections (concomitant medication), The safety attributable to 99mTc-HE3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of administration of concomitant medication (%), 24 hours
Overall goal of the project: To determine HER2 expression level in primary breast cancer and possibly in axillary lymph node metastases before neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy.
