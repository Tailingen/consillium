Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Copanlisib in Pediatric Patients
This study is designed to investigate whether the use of copanlisib is safe, feasible and beneficial to pediatric patients with solid solid tumors or lymphoma that are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy.
Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma in Children|Neuroblastoma|Osteosarcoma|Rhabdomyosarcoma|Ewing Sarcoma
DRUG: Copanlisib (BAY806946)
Phase 1: The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD): the Highest Dose Level of Copanlisib That Can be Given so That Not More Than 1 Out of 6 Patients Experience a DLT During the DLT Evaluation Period., Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for copanlisib was defined as the highest dose level where 6 patients have been treated and ≤ 1 participant experienced a DLT. This endpoint was performed on SAF., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Phase 1: Number of Subjects With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was observed during first cycle of treatment, and assessed as possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment with copanlisib. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose-escalation was the first cycle of therapy., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Phase 1: Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAE was defined as any event arising or worsening after start of study drug administration until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug intake (end of safety follow-up).

This endpoint was performed on SAF., After the first study intervention up to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug intake (end of safety follow up), with a maximum of 145 days.|Phase 1: Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), This endpoint was performed on SAF., Up to 150 days.|Phase 1: Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs)., This endpoint was performed on SAF., Up to 145 days.|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined separately in each indication, as the number of responders divided by the number of subjects in FAS in the indication., Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR was defined as the number of subjects with disease control divided by the number of subjects in FAS or per protocol set (PPS) in the indication., Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS), Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.
Phase 1: Copanlisib Maximum Drug Concentration (Cmax), Cmax: maximum concentration after the 3rd dose in a sequence of 3 nominal doses of copanlisib.

PK analysis set: All participants with at least one intake of study drug and with at least one valid measurement for copanlisib were included in the copanlisib PK analysis., Age ≥ 6 years: Pre-dose, Post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15 (1-1.25 hour (h), 1.5- 3h, 22-24h). Age < 6 years: Pre-dose, Post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15 (1-1.25h, 22-24h). Cycle length is 28 days.|Phase 1: Area Under the Curve (AUC(0-168)), AUC(0-168): Area under the concentration-time curve \[AUC\] from 0 to 168 hours after the 3rd dose in a sequence of 3 nominal doses of copanlisib.

PK analysis set: All participants with at least one intake of study drug and with at least one valid measurement for copanlisib were included in the copanlisib PK analysis., Age ≥ 6 years: Pre-dose, Post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15 (1-1.25 hour (h), 1.5- 3h, 22-24h). Age < 6 years: Pre-dose, Post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15 (1-1.25h, 22-24h). Cycle length is 28 days.|Phase 1: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR by dose cohort is defined as the number of responders divided by the number of subjects in FAS in the indication.

The analysis of ORR was performed on FAS., Up to 150 days|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR), Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: PFS in Each Indication Except for Osteosarcoma, Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs, Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent SAEs, Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.|Phase 2: Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Clinically Significant Change in Laboratory Parameters, ECGs and Vital Signs, Data was not collected for this endpoint due to study was terminated before the initiation of phase 2.
