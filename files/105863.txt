Evaluation of Clinical Significance and Feasibility of CT Guided Biopsy of Double Site Lesionsï¼šA Preliminary Lung Centered Study
This study aims to explore the clinical significance and feasibility of double site biopsy by analyzing the pathological characteristics and the incidence of main complications of CT guided puncture biopsy of lung and other parts coexisting lesions.

for the combination of two site biopsies, The incidence of 4 kinds of combined pathological results in different lesion location groups was analyzed., up to 2weeks|for the combination of two site biopsy approaches 1, The incidence of pneumothorax on the surgical side after unilateral lung biopsy, up to 2weeks|for the combination of two site biopsy approaches 2, the incidence of pneumothorax on the surgical side after bilateral lung biopsy, up to 2weeks|for the combination of two site biopsy approaches 3, the incidence of intra tissue hemorrhage after biopsy were statistically analyzed., up to 2weeks
CT guided biopsy is minimally invasive, accurate and low cost. It is often used as an important diagnostic method when the clinical suspect of malignant disease or the treatment effect of the disease is not good. In patients with suspected malignant lung disease, metastasis of other parts of lung, pulmonary door, mediastinum, bone, and distant soft tissue may be combined at the same time. It is the key link of clinical work to evaluate the nature of these coexisting lesions accurately and choose appropriate treatment methods. At present, there is little clinical study on lung centered double site biopsy. This study aims to explore the clinical significance and feasibility of double site biopsy by analyzing the pathological characteristics and the incidence of main complications of CT guided puncture biopsy of lung and other parts coexisting lesions.
