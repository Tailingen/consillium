A Study to Learn About the Investigational Medicine Called PF-06821497 (Mevrometostat) in Men With mCRPC Who Were Previously Treated With Abiraterone Acetate for Prostate Cancer (MEVPRO-1).
Pfizer MEVPRO-1 (C2321014) is a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical trial evaluating whether combining the study medicine (PF-06821497) with enzalutamide is safe and effective compared to physician's choice of either second-line androgen receptor (AR) directed therapy with enzalutamide or docetaxel (chemotherapy) for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after progression on prior abiraterone acetate treatment.

The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) of the combination of PF-06821497 plus enzalutamide versus physician's choice of enzalutamide or docetaxel.
