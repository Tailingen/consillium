Mitoxantrone Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer at High Risk for Recurrence
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of mitoxantrone given after surgery in treating patients who have prostate cancer that is at high risk for recurrence.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: mitoxantrone hydrochloride
Decrease in time to failure, Up to 3 years
Decrease in the number of treatment failures, Up to 3 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility of enrolling patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate at high risk for recurrence following radical prostatectomy in an adjuvant mitoxantrone trial. II. Determine if this adjuvant therapy results in a delay in time to failure or a decrease in the number of treatment failures compared to historical controls in this patient population.
