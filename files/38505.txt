Real-world Study on Liver Cancer Risk in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients With Family History of Liver Cancer
This study is a prospective, multicenter, real-world cohort study designed to compare the long-term outcomes of chronic hepatitis B patients with a family history of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who receive PEG IFNα-2b combined with nucleos(t)ide analogues or nucleos(t)ide monotherapy. The primary endpoint is the incidence rate of HCC, and secondary endpoints include the rate of HBsAg seroclearance, changes in liver fibrosis, and survival rates. The study will last for 5 years and enroll approximately 15,000 patients, aiming to provide evidence-based optimization for CHB treatment regimens.
