Step Into Support for Endurance and Strength (SISTERS)
The Step into Support for Endurance and Strength (SISTERS) research study is evaluating whether a mobile health game designed to increase physical activity is feasible and acceptable in patients with gynecologic cancers.

-SISTERS is testing a mobile health intervention can help increase physical activity. Participants will be randomized to receive either 1) a Fitbit or 2) a Fitbit + a game + help from a friend or family member whom you chose will help the participant reach their goals. (i.e. a Teammate).

Rate of Enrollment, Feasibility will be demonstrated if ≥50% eligible participants enroll, 3 months|Rate of Completion, Feasibility will be demonstrated if ≥75% of eligible participants complete the post-baseline outcome assessments., 3 months|Burden Rate, Acceptability will be defined as: ≤20% of participants reporting high study burden and ≤10% study withdrawal., 3 months|Rate of Activity, Perceived effectiveness will be defined as ≥70% of participants indicate that study participation motivated them to increase their activity levels., 3 months
This study is a two-arm randomized controlled pilot study designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of using a wearable accelerometer (Fitbit) vs. a wearable accelerometer (FItbit) + a game designed to help participants increase physical activity + social support improves participants' average daily step counts.

Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups

1. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) or
2. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) + game + help from a self-selected teammate

The study interventions involved in this research are:

* Surveys/Interviews
* Fitbits (also known as a wearable accelerometers or fitness trackers)
* Way to Health Platform
* Help from a Teammate (i.e. a friend or family member that participants choose to help them reach their goals)

It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.
