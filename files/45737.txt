Guadecitabine in Combination With Carboplatin in Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase II, open-label, single arm, single-stage study. Both, chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant patients will be enrolled and treated with 4 cycles of combination of Guadecitabine and carboplatin

DRUG: Guadecitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. PFS is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death. Up to a maximum of 7 months.
Adverse Events, All adverse events (AEs) had been determined according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for (NCI CTCAE) V5. A summary of the total number of participants is provided., AEs had been recorded from time of signed informed consent until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug(s) or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first, up to a maximum of 5 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

ORR is defined as the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1, Up to a maximum of 7 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

DCR defined as CR + PR + Stable Disease (SD) \>=8 weeks per RECIST 1.1, Up to a maximum of 7 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death or date of last contact., Time of treatment start until death or date of last contact, up to a maximum of 16 months.
