Navigated Abdominal Lymph Node Dissections
Image-guided navigation surgery allows for full utilization of pre-operative imaging during surgery, and has the potential of reducing both irradical resections and morbidity. In this study we will randomize patients which will undergo an abdominal lymph node dissection in order to evaluate the actual technical and clinical benefit of navigation
Image-guide Surgery|Lymph Node Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Surgical navigation|PROCEDURE: Conventional
Number of failed procedures, Failed procedure is defined as: presence of any residual target lymph node on follow-up imaging, 3 months
Surgical time to remove lymph node, time from having the surgical field prepared for lymph node localization to actual removal of the lymph node, overall surgical time,, After surgery|LN success, individual LN retrieval rate, 3 months
In the study patients will be randomized between the use of a surgical navigation system or not. The operation itself will be performed according to current clinical practice, and the navigation system will be used for better localization and orientation during the procedure.
