Anti-CD19 CAR-T Therapy Bridging to HSCT for CD19+ B-Cell Malignancies
This is the second stage of the previous anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy (NCT02965092). The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of consolidative allo-HSCT following CAR-T therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B Cell Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Allogeneic hematological stem cell transplantation
Number of participants with adverse events, To evaluate the safety of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy bridging to allo-HSCT. Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0), 5 years
Overall survival, OS was calculated from the date of inclusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 5 years|Event-free survival, EFS was calculated from the date of inclusion to death, progression of the disease, relapse or gene recurrence, whichever came first, or last visit (censored)., 5 years|Relapse-free survival, RFS was calculated from the date of inclusion to relapse or last visit (censored)., 5 years
Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy has been confirmed effective for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. However, its ability to keep patients in maintained remission is limited. In order to keep patients in long-term remissions, patients who had achieved MRD-negative complete remissions through CAR-T therapy (NCT02965092) will, on their own accord, receive allo-HSCT if there are no previous HSCT, contraindications, and other restrictions.
