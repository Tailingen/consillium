SHR-A1811 Versus Investigator's Chemotherapy in Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer Clinical Trial
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the progression-free survival of SHR-A1811 was superior to investigator-selected chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low recurrent/metastatic breast cancer. To evaluate whether SHR-A1811 is superior to investigator-selected chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low recurrent/metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: SHR-A1811|DRUG: Capecitabine/Eribulin/Gemcitabine/Paclitaxel/Nab-paclitaxel
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Blind Independent Video Review Committee (BIRC), within approximately 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of death for any cause. If there is no death reported for a participant before the data cutoff for OS analysis, OS will be censored at the last contact date at which the participant is known to be alive., within approximately 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), confirmed by a second assessment., within approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death., within approximately 2 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1., within approximately 2 years
