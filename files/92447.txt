Clinical Outcome of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy in Patient With Axillary Web Syndrome
Axillary web syndrome(AWS) is common complication of breast cancer surgery. Overall, AWS affects more than a half of the patient receiving axillary lymph node dissection. The symptoms of AWS include pain, limited function and range of motion. Geater risk of secondary lymphedema was found if the patient developed AWS during the first postoperative year.

ESWT was used for treating myofascial pain for decades. Low energy ESWT combined with complex decongestive therapy had a benefit on shoulder joint ROM and skin thickness improvement in patients with BCRL in recently studies. Investigators wonder if ESWT can also be applied to patients with axillary web syndrome for increasing ROM and relieving pain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of low energy ESWT in patients with axillary web syndrome.

DEVICE: Low energy ESWT
Shoulder range of motion, Flexion, extension, external rotation, internal rotation, abduction over upper limbs, 2 months|Pain score, Visual Analogue Scale (0-10 points, higher score represented higher degree of pain), 2 months
Muscle strength, Muscle strength of upper limb measured by ergometer, 2 months|Upper limb functional score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score(qDASH) (0-100 points, higher score indicated higher level of upper limb impairment), 2 months
