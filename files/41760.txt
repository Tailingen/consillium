Pelvic IMRT With Tomotherapy in Post-Hysterectomy Endometrial Cancer Patients
This study is evaluating the feasibility of using helical tomotherapy to deliver IMRT in post-hysterectomy endometrial cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy.
Endometrial Cancer
RADIATION: IMRT|RADIATION: Intracavitary vaginal brachytherapy|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
The study will evaluate the feasibility of using helical tomotherapy to deliver IMRT in post-hysterectomy endometrial cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy., The study will be deemed infeasible if greater than 10% of patients experience one of the following:

* Patient cannot be given the treatment because her anatomy is such that a dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan cannot be devised for her.
* The patient experiences any grade 4 acute toxicity judged to be related to her external radiation treatment.
* Within 1 year of the start of radiation therapy, the patient develops any grade 4 late toxicity judged to be related to her external radiation treatment.
* Within 1 year of the start of radiation therapy, the patient develops any in-field pelvic recurrence.
* Within 1 year of the start of radiation therapy, the patient dies from causes judged to be related to her treatment., 1 year from the start of radiation therapy.
Evaluate incidence of early toxicities, 30 days after last day of radiation therapy|Evaluate incidence of late toxicities, 1 year from the start of radiation therapy|Evaluate local, regional, and distant recurrence rates, 5 years from start of radiation therapy|Evaluate 5-year disease-free and 5-year overall survival rates, 5 years from start of radiation therapy
