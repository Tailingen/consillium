Genotype-drive Study of Irinotecan-Cisplatin Combination for Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and irinotecan in advanced gastric cancer, and try to find out the optimal dosage of combination chemotherapy.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: irinotecan and cisplatin
Overall response rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate of CPT11 plus cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma., 1 year
Time to event efficacy, The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate:

The following time to event efficacy measures:

* Duration of overall response for responding patients
* Time to documented progressive disease
* Overall survival
* The quantitative and qualitative toxicity of irinotecan plus cisplatin.
* Determinants of efficacy and toxicity of the treatment with irinotecan and cisplatin in the patient population by means of pharmacogenomic investigations: Quantitative analysis of UGT1A1 and ERCC1, 1 year
Open label single arm phase II study of cisplatin and irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma not previously treated with palliative chemotherapy. 40 Patients will be enrolled in this local trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate of the treatment.Schedule for this study is as follows: 8 cycles/14 days of irinotecan 125 mg/m2 on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day2. This study will also include genotype investigations of UGT1A1 and ERCC1 expression in order to assess determinants of efficacy and toxicity of the treatment with cisplatin and irinotecan in the study population.
