Support Program for Adoption of Cancer Screening Interventions at a Rural Community-Based Organization
This pilot trial study uses a structural support program for adoption of cancer screening interventions at a rural community-based organization. Rural communities face unique barriers in implementation of evidence-based interventions due to a lack of infrastructure, community capacity, and expertise as academic and research centers are often clustered in urban areas. The support program may help a rural community-based organization select, adapt, and implement cancer prevention and control evidence-based interventions.

OUTLINE:

Community-based organizations participate in the support program, consisting of 2 half-day training workshops over 2 weeks, and 30-minute bi-weekly consultations in order to adapt and implement the cancer screening intervention for community members.

After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.
