Papillomavirus Load in Rheumatic Inflammatory Diseases
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) are the two most common chronic inflammatory rheumatism, with a prevalence in the French population of 0.3% and 0.4%, according to the criteria European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology (EULAR / ACR) 2010 and Assessemnt of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 2009 respectively. In patients whose pathology is resistant to first-line treatment, such as methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis and peripheral spondyloarthritis, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for axial spondyloarthritis, the treatment is based on biotherapies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs. -TNF, to obtain effective control of the disease and prevent joint damage.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the leading risk factor for cervical carcinoma, is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) with a particularly high prevalence among young women.

In addition, anti-TNF, used in the treatment of RA and SpA, and anti-IL6 receptor, used in that of RA, could have opposite effects on HPV-dependent oncogenesis.

Thus, patients with RA or SpA may have a higher risk than the general population of progression to cervical cytological abnormalities. Evaluation of the chronic carriage of HPV would then be a useful tool in the management of these patients.

Prevalence of papillomavirus chronic load in women with rheumatic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis), compared to the prevalence in general population, Papillomavirus chronic load is defined as a positive HPV test at the end of the study combined with at least 3 positive HPV tests during the 24 months follow-up., At the end of the 24 months follow-up.
To determine the prevalence of HPV infections, whatever the type of HPV, Number of patients with a positive HPV test at enrollment, At enrollment|To determine the incidence of HPV infection in women with a negative HPV test at enrollment., Number of patients with a negative HPV test at enrollment and having at least one positive HPV test during the 24 months follow-up, At 24 months.|To determine the clearance of HPV with women with appositive HPV test at enrollment, Number of patients with a positive HPV test at enrollment and having a negative HPV test at the end of the study., At 24 months|To evaluate the incidence of cytological abnormalities in women with normal cytology at enrollment according to HPV chronic load and type., Number of patients with low-grade and high-grade cytological abnormalities during follow-up among those who had normal cytology at enrollment., At 24 months.|To determine the evolution (regression, persistence or invasion) of cytological abnormalities in women with abnormal cytology at enrollment and according to HPV chronic load and type., Number of patients ,with normal cytology at enrollment, whose cervical smear indicates a regression in cytological abnormalities or a persistence of cytological abnormalities or a development of abnormalities into cervical cancer or dysplasia, during the 24 months follow-up., At 24 months.|To determine the number of conization according to HPV chronic load and type., Number of conization, At 24 months.
