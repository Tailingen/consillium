Clinical Utility of a Non Endoscopic Device EsoCheck and Biomarker EsoGuard as Alternative to Endoscopy for Screening for Barrett's Esophagus in At Risk Population
This will be a prospective randomized, controlled, virtual, patient study to measure the impact of EsoCheck/EsoGuard on health care provider's decision for upper endoscopy referral.

The participants will complete two rounds of questions concerning the assessed risk for BE and decision for endoscopy referral of 6 patient cases (clinical vignettes).

After the first round has been completed, an EsoCheck/EsoGuard educational information package and the second round of 6 clinical vignettes including EsoGuard results will be sent.

DEVICE: EsoGuard result
The impact of EsoCheck/EsoGuard on health care provider's decision for upper endoscopy referral, The change in the percentage/rate of virtual patient cases who will be referred for endoscopy in the intervention round compared to the control round.

The proportion of patient cases in round 2 for which the provider indicated that the EsoGuard result influenced his/her decision to refer the patient for upper endoscopy divided by all patient cases in round 2., 1 month
The impact of EsoCheck/EsoGuard on health care provider's patient risk assessment for BE, The change in the provider's virtual patient risk assessment for BE in the intervention round compared to the control round., 1 month
This will be a prospective randomized, controlled, virtual, patient study to measure the impact of EsoCheck/EsoGuard on health care provider's decision for upper endoscopy referral.

Around 200 US physicians will be asked to participate in this study and at least 100 will be enrolled. Physicians eligible for participation are those whose scope of practice includes preventative care and disease screening - namely screening of BE, such as primary care physicians, family medicine physicians, and general practitioners; physicians whose scope of practice include diagnosis and management of esophageal disease may also participate.

The participants will complete two rounds of questions concerning the assessed risk for BE and decision for endoscopy referral of 6 patient cases (clinical vignettes). Per round, there will be 3 different questionnaires consisting of 6 clinical vignettes (A/B/C). Participants will be randomized to questionnaire A, B or C according to the randomization scheme. After the first round has been completed, an EsoCheck/EsoGuard educational information package and the second round of 6 clinical vignettes including EsoGuard results will be sent.
