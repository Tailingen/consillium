Clinical Evaluation of Moment Tumor Hip Replacement Products
The aim is to ensure that the patients are functionally adequately and painlessly mobilized with the proximal femoral tumor resection prosthesis used, to increase the survival of patients who underwent wide resection, and to determine the complications of the treatment applied and the clinical performance of the Moment Tumor Hip Replacement Products used.
Primary and Secondary Bone Tumor in the Proximal Femur Region

This study is a 6-center, prospective local medical device clinical trial. Trial period is 6 months. Patient recruitment will continue until the target sample number determined by the power analysis is reached. Since the application is surgical, it is within the scope of a one-time application. The patients will be followed for 6 months from the day of surgery. The study was designed as a prospective cohort study planned to be cross-sectional. The aim of this study is to ensure that the patients are functionally adequately and painlessly mobilized with the proximal femoral tumor resection prosthesis used, to increase the survival of patients who underwent wide resection, and to determine the complications of the treatment applied and the clinical performance of the Moment Tumor Hip Replacement Products used and to contribute to the medical literature on proximal femoral resection prosthesis as a result of the study.
