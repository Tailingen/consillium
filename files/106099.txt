Oral Gallium Maltolate for the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory Glioblastoma
This is a phase 1 investigational study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of oral gallium maltolate (GaM) in participants with relapsed glioblastoma (GBM).
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Gallium maltolate (500 mg)|DRUG: Gallium maltolate (1,000 mg)|DRUG: Gallium maltolate (1,500 mg)|DRUG: Gallium maltolate (2,000 mg)|DRUG: Gallium maltolate (2,500 mg)|DRUG: Gallium maltolate (recommended phase 2 dose)
Maximum-tolerated dose., This will be determined from the incidence of dose limiting toxicities at each dosage., Each 28-day cohort
Progression-free survival, This measure is the number of months participants remain free from evidence of disease. Imaging will be done every eight weeks and reported at six months., 6 months|Overall survival, Overall survival is determined as the average number of months subjects survived following enrollment., 6 months|Dose-limiting toxicity, Number of participants experiencing a dose limiting toxicity., 28 days for each cohort
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label phase 1 study to determine the antineoplastic activity, safety and tolerance of GaM in participants with relapsed, treatment-refractory GBM. Although GaM has been studied in previous phase 1 clinical trials in normal individuals and in participants with a variety of different solid tumors, it has never been evaluated in this population of participants. Dosages in this study have been defined to have limited side effects in other phase 1 trials. The maximum number of participants to enroll in the dose escalation part will not exceed 36. The trial will follow a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design.
