Phase II Study of the Effects of Laparoscopic Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer
To assess if PD-L1 expression can be upregulated in peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer after the administration of HIPEC with greater frequency compared to systemic chemotherapy alone
Gastric Cancer|Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Mitomycin
The PD-L1 expression can be upregulated after administration of HIPEC with greater frequency, To examine if PD-L1 expression can be upregulated in peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer after the administration of HIPEC with greater frequency compared to systemic chemotherapy alone. PD-L1 expression will be measured quantitatively by combined positive score (CPS), with upregulation defined as an quantitative increase in PD-L1 expression via CPS compared to the previously measured timepoint (baseline CPS of 0)., 2 years
The rate of conversion to resectability with repeated interval laparoscopic HIPEC, To examine the rate of conversion to resectability with repeated interval laparoscopic HIPEC as defined by the Phase II trial published by Badgwell et al., 2 years|To quantitatively assess peritoneal cancer index (PCI) change with repeated interval laparoscopic HIPEC., To quantitatively assess peritoneal cancer index (PCI) change with repeated interval laparoscopic HIPEC., 2 years|Overall Survival Rate, To examine overall survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease. Given the potential for longer survival with repeated interval laparoscopic HIPEC compared to systemic chemotherapy alone, this metric will be assessed. In addition, in (+)PD-L1 patients, survival data in this population undergoing repeated interval laparoscopic HIPEC and systemic PD-1 inhibition is unknown., 2 years|Perioperative morbidity at 30 days, To assess perioperative morbidity at 30 days., 30 days|Perioperative mortality at 30 days, To assess perioperative mortality at 30 days., 30 days
