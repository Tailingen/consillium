This is a single arm prospective, monocentric, open, experimental pilot study. The response to NAC in breast cancer is extremely heterogeneous. The study and the identification of factors that can predict the response to treatment is therefore a priority, constituting a relevant "clinical unmet need".Modern molecular biology techniques as well as imaging diagnostics could be valuable tools for characterizing the response to NAC toward the definition of more personalized therapies.The prediction of therapy response after two cycle of chemotherapy rather than at the end of six cycles using non-invasive procedures will spare unwanted toxicity to the patients and resources to the Regional and National Health system. This study will also provide the patients, their familiar and all the stakeholders involved in the cure of Breast Cancer new important information regarding the management of breast cancer patients.This is a non-interventional study; therefore, the treatment will be as per physician choice according to the most appropriate therapeutic opportunities available for each patients' based on the type and stage of disease and the patients' performance status.Currently, the NAC regimens commonly used at CRO-Aviano for NAC are Epirubicine 90 mg/mq + Ciclophosphamide 600 mg/mq d1 q21 or q14 (EC)(dose dense) followed by weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq for a total of 12 administrations. Occasionally, due to patients and tumor features only weekly Paclitaxel is used, and usually in this case up to 24 administrations may be given. Only in the case of HER2 positive BC trastuzumab 2 mg/kg is added to weekly Paclitaxel. Given the low response rate of hormone-based neoadjuvant therapy, only in rare cases (e.g. patients not amenable of surgery due to comorbidities), this approach is used.
