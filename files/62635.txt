A Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of QL1101 and EU-Avastin® in Healthy Volunteers
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the pharmacokinetic and safety similarity of QL1101 with EU-Avastin® in healthy male volunteers.

Participants will receive a single injection of QL1101/ EU-Avastin®.Researchers will compare pharmacokinetic, safety, and immunogenic similarities between the 2 groups.

This is a phase I,single center, randomized, double-blind and parallel group clinical trial .

The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic similarity of single injections of QL1101 or EU-Avastin® in healthy volunteers.

The secondary objective are to assess the clinical safety and immunogenicity similarity of single injections of QL1101 or EU-Avastin® in healthy volunteers.

Subjects would receive a single 100mg（4ml） of QL1101or EU-Avastin® injection.
