Pilot Study to Characterize the Microbiome in Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma Skin Lesions Before and After Use of CLnÂ® Skin Care Body Wash
In this pilot study of patients with mycosis fungoides, the most common form of CTCL, we propose to primarily evaluate the impact of daily use of the CLn Body Wash (dilute sodium hypochlorite (0.006% NaOCl)) on the microbiota of CTCL lesions. Should dilute sodium hypochlorite body wash improve the microbiome of MF, reducing the abundance of S. aureus, future, larger studies can more fully evaluate the impact on pruritus, erythema, scaling, disease evolution and its role in CTCL management.
