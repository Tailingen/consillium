A Study of MM-111 in Patients With Advanced, Refractory Her2 Amplified, Heregulin Positive Cancers
This study is an open-label Phase 1 trial of MM-111.
Her2 Amplified Solid Tumors|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: MM-111
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Feasible Dose, The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose level in which a DLT is experienced by fewer than two patients in a cohort of 3 - 6 patients. If a DLT is observed in at least two patients in a cohort of 3 - 6 patients, the MTD will be determined to have been exceeded and an additional three patients (up to a total of six) are to be treated at the next lower dose level., 28 days
To Determine the Clinical Activity of MM-111 in Patients Based on Objective Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Response (DoR), Progression Free Survival (PFS), and 16 & 24-week Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), December 2011|To Explore the Role Functional Imagining (FDG-PET CT Scan), as a Predictor of Clinical Activity, December 2011
Phase 1: Patients with any solid tumor type may be enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MM-111.
