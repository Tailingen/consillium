Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: Alisertib
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0 and was defined as any of the following events related to therapy with alisertib:

1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥7 consecutive days
2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection
3. Platelet count \<25,000/mm\^3
4. Grade 3 or greater nausea and/or emesis despite use of optimal antiemetic prophylaxis
5. Grade 3 or greater diarrhea despite maximal supportive therapy with loperamide
6. Any other Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity, with the following exceptions: Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgias, Any grade of alopecia, Brief (\<1 week) Grade 3 fatigue
7. Treatment delay of \>1 week due to failure of adequate hematologic or nonhematologic recovery from previous cycle of treatment
8. Other alisertib-related nonhematologic toxicities ≥Grade 2 that, in the opinion of the investigator, required a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with alisertib., Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Day 35 (alisertib daily for 7 to 21 days followed by a 14-day recovery period)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Alisertib, MTD was defined as the highest dose at which DLT occurred in 0/3 or 1/6 patients., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose (up to 1011 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose (up to 1011 days)

The drug tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to treat people who have advanced malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) for alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days. This open label study enrolled 87 participants. Participants were enrolled in one of 3 treatment groups:

* Powder-in-Capsule (PIC) Dose Escalation (alisertib 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 110 or 150 mg PIC , once daily (QD) for 7 days (D),or alisertib 25 mg, PIC, orally, QD 14D, or alisertib 25, 50 or 70 mg, PIC, orally, QD 21D, or alisertib 50 or 60 mg, PIC, orally, twice daily (BID) 7D, alisertib 40 mg, PIC, orally, BID 14D
* ECT Dose Escalation (alisertib 10 or 20 mg, Enteric-coated Tablets (ECT), orally, QD for 7 to 21 days
* Relative Bioavailability (alisertib 40 mg ECT or PIC, orally, BID 7D in cycle 1, followed by alisertib 40 mg in the opposite formulation (PIC or ECT) orally, BID 7D in cycle 2, followed by alisertib 50 mg PIC orally, BID 7D in each additional All participants received treatment until their disease progressed or they experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity. This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 1011 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.
