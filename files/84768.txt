Genetic Investigation of Cancer Predisposition
Clinical information and samples (blood, saliva, and tumor) will be collected from patients with multiple cancers and/or a family history of cancer as well as from affected and unaffected relatives; samples will be systematically sequenced and evaluated for candidate driver mutations.
Genetic Predisposition|Cancer
GENETIC: DNA or RNA Sequencing
Identification of Rare Genetic Variant, Genetic screen detects a mutation that is likely responsible for tumor development, through study completion- approximately 6-12 months|Identification of somatic (tumor only) mutation, Genetic screen detects a mutation that is likely responsible for tumor development, through study completion- approximately 6-12 months|Identification of Rare Genetic Variant in family members, Genetic screen detects a mutation that is likely responsible for tumor development, through study completion- approximately 6-12 months
Identification of clinical spectrum of the disease in families, Genetic and clinical analysis reveals clinical features not previously assigned to the disease, through study completion- approximately 6-12 months
Genetic screening will be performed on DNA (and/or RNA) isolated from collected samples from affected individuals by whole exome sequencing or RNA sequencing using in-house pipeline to identify candidate sequence variants. These variants will be tested for segregation with the phenotype in other relatives (affected/unaffected). Candidate variants will be subjected to additional downstream analysis, to be guided by the actual type of gene/variant.
