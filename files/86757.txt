SRG-514 Administered Intraoperatively to Patients Undergoing Breast-conserving Cancer Surgery
This is a multicenter, first-in-human (FIH), open label, Phase 1 dose escalation and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) extension trial with a primary objective to define the RP2D of SRG-514 when administered intraoperatively to patients undergoing breast-conserving cancer surgery. SRG-514 will be investigated utilizing a 3+3 convention dose escalation cohorts.

This is a multicenter, first-in-human (FIH), open label, Phase 1 dose escalation and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) extension trial with a primary objective to define the RP2D of SRG-514 when administered intraoperatively to patients undergoing breast-conserving cancer surgery. SRG-514 will be investigated utilizing a 3+3 convention dose escalation cohorts, with 3 to 6 patients enrolled at each dose level, and a minimum of 6 patients enrolled at the highest dose level, for a total of approximately 12-18 patients in the dose escalation portion of the study.

SRG-514 doses will be escalated based on safety and potential dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the 14-day period following SRG-514 administration. Patients who do not complete the DLT period for reasons other than study drug related toxicity would be considered non-evaluable for DLT assessment and may be replaced.
