Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab in Combination with Paclitaxel in Subjects with Head and Neck Cancer Unable for Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy (NIVOTAX)
Chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is palliative and usually platinum based, and the patients often present with poor physical condition. Consequently, many of them are not able to withstand a platinum-based chemotherapy. The addition of taxanes to the armamentarium of drugs improve the outcome in this group of patients. An alternative and better tolerated regimen for these patients is paclitaxel in combination with cetuximab, included the in guidelines of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology.

Recently, new treatments such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising activity and good tolerability in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and has been included in the recently published guidelines from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer. Nivolumab (anti-PD1) has been approved for patients progressing on or after platinum-based therapy, as it clearly impacts on overall survival.

This randomized phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab plus paclitaxel for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC in the platinum ineligible and platinum refractory settings. Control arm will be paclitaxel in combination with cetuximab, treatment included in the guidelines of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology.
