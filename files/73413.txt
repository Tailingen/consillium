FArial NErf MRI in the Preoperative Assessment of PArotide Tumors
1. st visit: Inclusion, 3Tesla injected parotid MRI performed as part of routine care for characterization, to which two specific high resolution sequences will be added. Evaluation of the exact position of the parotid tumor relative to the trunk of the facial nerve and its first branches, classification into two categories: on contact (≤ 5 mm) or at a distance (\> 5 mm).
2. nd visit: Surgical intervention of the parotid tumor. The surgeon will specify the same data as that collected by the radiologists after the MRI.
3. rd visit: Post-operative consultation in the week following the intervention. The surgeon will look for the occurrence of post-operative facial paralysis.
