A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of Subcutaneously-Administered Cytokine ALKS 4230 (Nemvaleukin Alfa) as a Single Agent and in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Antibody (Pembrolizumab) in Subjects With Select Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (ARTISTRY-2)
This study will characterize the safety and tolerability and identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of subcutaneous (SC) ALKS 4230 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: ALKS 4230|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), and identify the RP2D of ALKS 4230 in Part A, Includes AEs that are both serious and drug-related, From time of initiation of therapy until 30 days after last dose of study drug, assessed up to 24 months|Number of subjects experiencing AEs that are both serious and drug-related in Part B, Includes AEs that are both serious and drug-related, From time of initiation of therapy until 30 days after last dose of study drug, assessed up to 24 months|Clinical Activity of combination treatment with ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab in each Part B tumor type., Overall Response rate (ORR) will be based on investigator review of radiographic and photographic images, From time of therapy until the date of first documented tumor progression, assessed up to 24 months
Proportion of subjects with objective evidence of Complete Response (CR)/immune CR (iCR), Overall response rate (ORR) will be based on investigator review of radiographic or photographic images, From time of initiation of therapy until the date of first documented tumor progression, assessed up to 24 months|Proportion of subjects with objective evidence of Partial Response (PR)/immune PR (iPR), ORR will be based on investigator review of radiographic or photographic images, From time of initiation of therapy until the date of first documented tumor progression, assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response in subjects with CR/iCR, CR/iCR duration, Time from the first documentation of complete response, measured approximately every 6 weeks, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (estimated up to 24 months)|Duration of response in subjects with PR/iPR, PR/iPR duration, Time from the first documentation of complete response, measured approximately every 6 weeks, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (estimated up to 24 months)|Non-progression for Part B, Time from first dose of SC ALKS 4230 to the time of progression or death, Assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival for Part B, Time from first dose of SC ALKS 4230 to the time of death, Assessed up to 24 months|Serum concentrations of ALKS 4230 will be determined at various time points, Concentration vs time and standard pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be summarized by dose level, From time of initiation of therapy until the last treatment cycle (each cycle is 21 days), assessed up to 24 months|Serum will be assayed for the presence of anti-ALKS 4230 antibodies, Results will be summarized by dose level, From time of initiation of therapy until the last treatment cycle (each cycle is 21 days), assessed up to 24 months|Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be performed by flow cytometry at various time points, Results will be summarized by dose level, From time of initiation of therapy until the last treatment cycle (each cycle is 21 days), assessed up to 24 months|Serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines will be assessed using a multiplex method at various time points, Results will be summarized by dose level, From time of initiation of therapy until the last treatment cycle (each cycle is 21 days), assessed up to 24 months
This study will evaluate ALKS 4230 administered SC as lead-in monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
