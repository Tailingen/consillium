Celiac plExus Block to Reduce OpioID Consumption Following Hepato-pancreato-biliary Mini-invasive Surgery
The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of intraoperative celiac plexus block (CPB) to reduce opioid consumption following laparoscopic hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Liver, Cancer of, Primary Resectable
DRUG: Ropivacaine 0.5%|DRUG: Normal Saline
Postoperative opioid use, The primary outcome will be morphine equivalent during the first postoperative 24 h, Up to 24 h after surgery
Postoperative opioid use, Patients will be recorded for up to 72 h postoperative opioid consumption., Up to 72 h after surgery|Numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain, Patients will be asked to complete a daily diary up to 72 h that records numeric pain rating scale, Up to 72 h after surgery|Postoperative vomiting, Incidence of postoeprative vomiting will be recorded for up to 72 h, Up to 72 h after surgery|Quality of recovery using the 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-15), Patients will be asked to complete a 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire up to 72 h after surgery, Up to 72 h after surgery|Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) time, Length of PACU stay, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Post-operative hospital time, Length of hospital stay, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
A bilateral CPB is convenient and safe to perform under the direct laparoscopic vision of the surgeons during surgery; however, perspective data are warranted. The investigators hypothesize that a bilateral CPB using 0.5% ropivacaine will improve the quality of recovery following a laparoscopic hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery. The primary endpoint is the Postoperative opioid use. Secondary endpoints include acute postoperative pain, opioid consumption, the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting (PONV), the 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-15), length of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, length of post-operative hospital stay, and chronic post-surgical pain at 90 d after surgery.
