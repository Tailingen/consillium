The Accuracy of Modified TTMB in the Spatial Distribution of Prostate Cancer
Investigators plan to use modified TTMB technology to puncture prostate of participants suspected prostate cancer, especially those with the first negative biopsy , but having a rising PSA.Then, Investigators will simulate the spatial distribution of prostate cancer in patients with positive biopsy before radical prostatectomy by way of the TPS software system . And after the radical prostatectomy ,Investigators will simulate the spatial distribution with the help of large tissue slice technique to compare with preoperative simulation ,which to verify the two simulations are consistent.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: trans-perineal template-guided mapping biopsy
the spatial distribution based on the biopsy tissue, to simulate the spatial distribution of cancer based on the biopsy tissue contained cancer with the help of TPS system, 2 years
the spatial distribution based on the large tissue slice technique, to simulate the spatial distribution based on the large tissue slice technique after radical prostatectomy, 2 years
Investigators mainly plan to determine the accuracy of the modified TTMB technology in combination with the TPS system on the location of the tumor space distribution by comparing the two simulation, which is significant for the accurate focal thearpy.
