G-CSF PMRD: Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Stimulated Bone Marrow and In Vivo T-Cell Depletion in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies or Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome
The purposes of this study are:

* To examine the engraftment rate in patients receiving in vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF stimulated bone marrow from partially mismatched related donors.
* To evaluate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients receiving in vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF stimulated bone marrow from partially mismatched related donors.
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor
Engraftment Rate, The number of participants who received in vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF stimulated bone marrow from partially mismatched related donor who reached engraftment by Day 45., Day 45|Incidence of Acute Graft-versus-host Disease, The number of participants diagnosed with new acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)., Day 100|Incidence of Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease, The number of participants diagnosed with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)., Duration of Study (Up to two years)
This study is a single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study. Patients meeting the criteria for this study will be entered sequentially until completion or closure of the study. Early stopping rules will be employed to ascertain whether an unacceptable rate of toxicity (non-engraftment, and/or acute GVHD) occurs.

Patients will be prepared for transplant through the administration of the following conditioning regimen based on their primary disease:

* Total body irradiation (1400 rads in 8 fractionated doses) and high dose chemotherapy, including cytosine arabinoside, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. Patients with bone marrow failure syndrome will not receive etoposide in the conditioning regimen.
* Post transplant immunosuppression prophylaxis against acute GVHD will include sequential administration of cyclosporine, methotrexate, basiliximab and mycophenolate.
* The donor will receive 3 daily G-CSF injections prior to marrow harvest starting on day -3. The injections may be initiated by the donor's primary physician prior to donor's arrival, or by the BMT service at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.
* Patients will receive daily GM-CSF injections (250 mcg/m2) starting from day +7 post transplant until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than 2,000/ÂµL for three days.
