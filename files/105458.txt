Efficacy and Safety of BAI Combined With DEB-BACE of EqualSpheres in the Treatment of Advanced NSCLC
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bronchial infusion chemotherapy（BAI） combined with drug-loaded microsphere embolization of EqualSpheres in advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Progression-free survival (PFS) will be evaluated as the primary endpoint.
