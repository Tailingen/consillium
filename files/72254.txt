Comparison of Clinical Efficacy of Liver Resection, RFA, TACE, and Drug Therapy in Patients with GIST LM
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the overall survival benefits of local treatment combined with imatinib(IM) and IM alone in patients suffering from GIST liver metastases. The main question it aims to answer is:

â€¢ Whether IM combined with hepatic resection (HR) or other local treatments such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has better long-term survival benefits compared to IM monotherapy.

Patients are divided into different treatment groups:

* IM group
* IM combined with HR group
* IM combined with RFA or TACE group

Researchers will compare the IM + HR group and IM + RFA/TACE group with the IM group to see if it has a better Overall survival (OS).
GIST, Malignant|Liver Metastases
DRUG: imatinib (IM)|PROCEDURE: hepatic resection (HR)|PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation (RFA)|PROCEDURE: transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was the span between GIST liver metastases diagnosis and the date of death., up to 200 months
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) represent the most prevalent type of mesenchymal tumor within the gastrointestinal tract, and the liver is the most common site of metastasis from GIST. Imatinib (IM) has significantly enhanced clinical outcomes for patients with advanced disease. Since its approval in February 2002 for treating metastatic or unresectable GISTs, 38% of patients have shown a partial response, while 13.6% have experienced disease progression within 1 to 3 months of IM administration. Over half of the patients with metastases experienced disease progression within two years of IM treatment, attributed to secondary drug resistance. Few studies are comparing the survival benefits of different surgical modalities. The investigators aimed to evaluate IM combined with hepatic resection (HR) or other local treatments such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), compared to IM monotherapy in long-term survival benefits in patients suffering from GIST liver metastases.
