Bladder Perforation Post-TURBT: Definition, Incidence and Natural HistoryStudy
In view of sparse data of precise definition, risk factors, natural history and management of bladder perforation following Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). We aim to correlate the relation between the site, depth and extent of resection with bladder perforation. Also, correlation between vertical depth, horizontal extent of resection and recurrence and progression of tumor

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Computed tomographic cystography
Prevalence of bladder perforation post-Transurethral resection of bladder tumour, calculate the numbers of bladder perforation diagnosed by CT cystogram divided by the total number of patients, 24 months
Correlation between the cystoscopical and radiological bladder perforation, compare the numbers of bladder perforation diagnosed by CT cystogram by the number of bladder perforation described by surgeon, 24 months|assess the recurrence free rate in bladder perforation groups at 2 year follow up, calculate the number of recurrence pf bladder tumor in bladder perforation at 2 year follow up, 24 months
