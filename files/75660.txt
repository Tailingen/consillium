Mechanisms of Disease R/R in CAR-T for Hematologic Malignancies
The primary purpose of this IRB protocol is to perform immune profiling focusing on the measurement of Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) over time in patients receiving Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy and determine the correlation between immune profile and disease relapse/resistance in CAR T therapy.
Hematologic Malignancy
GENETIC: Blood draw
Correlation between change in immune profile and disease relapse/resistance in CAR T therapy, multivariable regression, before CAR T therapy, 1 week after CAR T and then every 3-6 months, and at the time of disease relapse (up to 5 years)
Correlation between change in molecular/genetic analysis and disease relapse/resistance in CAR T therapy, bulk RNA-sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, single cell ATAC seq or metabolomics on peripheral blood samples, before CAR T therapy, 1 week after CAR T and then every 3-6 months, and at the time of disease relapse (up to 5 years)|Correlation between changes in cytokine and molecular pathway profiling with disease relapse/resistance in CAR T therapy, Cytokine profiling and molecular/genetic correlation with disease relapse/resistance in CAR T therapy, before CAR T therapy, 1 week after CAR T and then every 3-6 months, and at the time of disease relapse (up to 5 years)
The primary purpose of this IRB protocol is to perform immune profiling focusing on the measurement of MDSCs over time in patients receiving CAR T therapy and determine the correlation between immune profile and disease relapse/resistance in CAR T therapy. Blood samples and accompanying health information (including PHI) may be collected from standard of care, non-significant risk, research-only procedures or obtained from our Division Research Repository and Database (Duke IRB Pro00006268) or DUHS Biospecimen Research and Biobanking protocol (Duke IRB Pro00035974). All hematologic malignancy patients treated with commercial CAR T products will be screened and enrolled for the study.

The investigators will perform multivariable regression to see if the number and function of MDSCs can be used as independent factors to predict disease relapse at 1 year after CAR T treatment, overall survival or progression-free survival. The studies will not require additional invasive procedure solely for the study.

The investigators will use blood samples that are performed as part of standard care. Therefore, no additional procedure is needed. The major potential risk associated with the study is the breach of confidentiality.
