Optimization of Systemic Treatment Strategies in Elderly Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to assess whether the presence of a Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) , Idiopathic Cytopenia of Undetermined Significance (ICUS) or Idiopathic Dysplasia of Undetermined Significance (IDUS), correlates with treatment intensity and clinical outcome in older patients with advanced malignancies receiving palliative chemotherapy. We will study the relation between sarcopenia, comprehensive geriatric assessment en pharmacokinetics with treatment related toxicity as well. We hypothesize that a standardized flow cytometry test to determine bone marrow capacity, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and/or measurement of human body composition with computerized tomography will provide an accurate tool to optimize treatment strategies in elderly patients with advanced malignancies.

To determine whether the presence of a low - intermediate 1 risk MDS, IDUS or ICUS can predict for (myelo)toxicity in older patients with advanced malignancies receiving palliative chemotherapy, from date of study inclusion until 30 days after end of treatment
