Comparison Between Two Methods of Bilateral Stenting for Malignant Hilar Obstruction
Internal biliary drainage using stent is used for malignant hilar obstruction such as cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and other malignancy including metastasis.

Bilateral drainage is more physiologic and have more long patency than unilateral drainage.

There are two methods of bilateral drainage: Y-stent and side by side.

However there are no clinical data about comparing the effectiveness of these two methods.

Therefore the investigators want to compare the clinical outcomes of two methods:

Y-stent and side by side.
