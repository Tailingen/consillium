Feasibility of Total Mastectomy in Ambulatory Care
Breast cancer is the first female cancer in France. Total mastectomy occurred in 30% of breast cancer patient population.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of outpatient surgery for the total mastectomy.

In France, Ambulatory care is developed as part of the new national health plan.

Breast conserving surgery for tumorectomy or partial mastectomy is already done in outpatient vacation.

Total mastectomy is an extension of this surgery, and, as such, underpins the investigator's hypothesis that total mastectomy is feasible in outpatient care .
