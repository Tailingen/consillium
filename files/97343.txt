Bevacizumab With Pelvic Radiotherapy And Primary Chemotherapy in Patients With Poor-Risk Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and bevacizumab before surgery in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
Rectal Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Raltitrexed|DRUG: levofolinic acid|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Percentage of Patients With Complete Tumor Regression Rate (TRG1), Complete tumor regression rate (TRG1) was the ratio of patients with TRG1, graded at surgical resection, and total patients included in the study, expressed in percentage.

Tumor regression grade (TRG) was misured according to the Mandard Scale. Briefly,TRG1 was a complete tumor regression (regardless of the presence of acellular mucine lakes), and TRG2 was a nearly complete tumor regression with extensive fibrosis; TRG3 presented with clear evidence of residual cancer cells but with predominant fibrosis;TRG4 was a residual of cancer cells outgrowing fibrosis; TRG5 was the absence of regressive changes., In 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Up to 8 weeks after surgery|Number of Patients With Sphincter Preservation, Sphincter preservation in patients with tumor \< 5 cm from anal verge in 8 weeks after chemoradiation therapy, In 8 weeks after chemoradiation therapy|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was calculated from the date of the initial treatment until tumor progression or relapse, death for any cause or last follow up.

Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 10 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was calculated from the date of initial treatment to the date of death for any cause or last follow up., 10 years|Clinical Response Rate, Clinical response was assessed before surgery with the same imaging modalities that were used for the inclusion in the study.

Clinical response rate was the ratio between complete and partial response, evaluated by RECIST CRITERIA, and total of patients evaluated, expressed in percentage of patients.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 7 weeks after chemoradiation therapy up to 11 weeks|Patients With Metastatic Lymphnodes at Pathology Exam After Surgery, Number of patients with metastatic lymphnodes at pathology exam after surgery., In 8 weeks after chemoradiation therapy completion
To determine the pathological complete response (pCR-TRG1) rate in patients treated with 2 different schedule of bevacizumab plus primary chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the pelvic region when optimal surgery is applied.

Bevacizumab will be given by intravenous infusion at the dose of 5 mg/kg concurrent with chemotherapy and radiotherapy every 2 weeks for 4 cycles from -14 days to start chemo-radiotherapy (classical schedule) or 4 days before the concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for 2 cycles if the number of TRG1 was not reached in the first stage with the classical schedule Simon's methods will be used to calculate sample size.Setting a and b errors as 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, and defining as minimum activity of interest (p0) a TRG1 rate=30%. In order to demonstrate a TRG1 rate â‰¥50% (p1), at least 6 TRG1 on the first 15 patients, and at least 19 TRG1 on a total of 46 patients should be reported in the first and second stage, respectively.
