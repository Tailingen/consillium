This study aims to evaluate the efficacy brentuximab vedotin as consolidation treatment in patients with stage I/II Hodgkin's lymphoma and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET positivity after 2 cycles of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine).

Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first cycle of ABVD to the first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause., 2 years
Complete Response rate (CR rate), according to Cheson 2007, 35 weeks|Overall survival, 4 years
This study aims to evaluate the progression free survival after treatment for patient with stage I/II supradiaphragmatic HL patient and PET positive after 2 courses of ABVD.

The treatment consist of 3 phases :

* induction treatment with 2 cycles every 3 weeks of bleomycin, etoposide, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, oncovin, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) escalated
* radiotherapy 30 Gy starting 3 to 4 weeks after last day of second course of BEACOPP-escalated
* consolidation treatment with 8 cycles every 21 days of brentuximab vedotin
