Iressa Re-Challenge in Advanced NSCLC EGFR M+ Patients Who Responded to Gefitinib USed as 1st Line or Previous Treatment
the primary objective is to characterise the impact of gefitinib on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) based assessments; objective response rate (ORR ; confirmed complete response(CR) or partial response (PR)) and disease control rate (DCR; confirmed complete response(CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)) in patients with EGFR M+ NSCLC
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Gefitinib 250mg
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is the sum of Complete response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) response.

Evaluated by recist criteria v 1.1., for target lesions and assesed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disapperance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR),\>=30% decrease in the sum of longest diamteter of target lesions; Objective response rate (RR)=CR+PR, every 6 weeks after the Start of Study Treatment until objective disease progression or time of data cut off (6 months after the last patient has started study treatment)|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate is the sum of patients with a best visit response of Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Desease Objective Response Rate is the sum of Complete response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) response.

Evaluated by recist criteria v 1.1., for target lesions and assesed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disapperance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR),\>=30% decrease in the sum of longest diamteter of target lesions, Stable Desease (SD) defined as no progression for\>= 6 weeks. Objective response rate (RR)=CR+PR, every 6 weeks after the Start of Study Treatment until objective disease progression or time of data cut off (6 months after the last patient has started study treatment)
Progression Free Survival, Progression free Survival was calculated as the time from the first dose of gefitinib study treatment until the date of (i) progression or (ii) death from any cause in the absence of progression., every 6 weeks after the Start of Study Treatment until objective disease progression or time of data cut off (6 months after the last patient has started study treatment)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was calculated as the time from the first dose until the day of death from any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of data analysis was censored at the time of the last follow-up date., every 6 weeks after the Start of Study Treatment until death or time of data cut off (6 months after the last patient has started study treatment)|Treatment Duration With Gefitinib, Treatment duration was calculated from the date of the first to the date of the last intake., every 6 weeks after the Start of Study Treatment until discontinuation of drug or time of data cut off (6 months after the last patient has started study treatment)|Time to Worsening of Disease Related Symptoms, Time to worsening of disease related symptoms (LCS) Time to worsening of disease-related symptoms based on FACT-L LCS was defined as the interval from the date of enrollment to the first visit response of 'worsened' without a subsequent response of 'improved' or 'no change' within 21 days (or to the last assessment), death due to any cause, or early discontinuation from the study. Time to worsening was censored at the last non-missing assessment visit if the worsening was not observed., every 6 weeks after the Start of Study Treatment until the worsening of desease related symptoms or time of data cut off (6 months after the last patient has started study treatment)
A phase II Open Label, Multicentre, Single Arm Study to Characterise the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Gefitinib 250 mg (IRESSAï¿½) as 3rd line treatment re-challenge in Patients, who have Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and who responded to gefitinib in 1st line and progressed after 2nd line chemotherapy
