Bortezomib in KRAS-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Never Smokers or Those With KRAS G12D
The purpose of this study is to test the drug Bortezomib to see how well it works. The investigators want to find out what effects, good or bad, it has on patients with a limited smoking history or who have a specific mutation associated with their lung cancer.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Acyclovir
Radiographic Response Rate, The following evaluations will be conducted to assess the efficacy of bortezomib - radiographic response rate by RECIST v1.1. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2 years
Progression Free Survival, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 2 years|Participants Evaluated for Toxicity, Before each drug dose, the patient will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may have occurred after the previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0,)., 2 years|Overall Survival, 2 years
