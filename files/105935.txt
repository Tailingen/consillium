Sequential and Concurrent FOLFOXIRI/Bevacizumab Regimens Versus FOLFOX/Bevacizumab in First-Line Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) / bevacizumab regimens (concurrent and sequential) versus folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) / bevacizumab in first-line in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive bevacizumab 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously every 2 weeks with either concurrent or sequential FOLFOXIRI or with FOLFOX for 4 to 6 months of induction therapy, followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus either leucovorin/5-fluorouracil or capecitabine until disease progression occurs. After disease progression, participants will receive treatment with a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.

Percentage of Participants With Overall Response During First-Line Therapy (ORR1), ORR1 was the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during first-line therapy as assessed by investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1). CR was defined as disappearance of all extranodal target lesions and all pathological lymph nodes had to have decreased to \<10 millimeter (mm) in short axis. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR1 = CR + PR, Randomization up to disease progression during first-line therapy or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|Progression-Free Survival During First-Line Therapy (PFS1), PFS1 was defined as time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression during first-line therapy, as assessed by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was defined as sum of longest diameters increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study. The sum of longest diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., Randomization up to disease progression during first-line therapy or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)
Time to PFS2, Time to PFS2 was defined as time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression after reinduction of second-line therapy, as assessed by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was defined as sum of longest diameters increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study. The sum of longest diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm., Randomization up to disease progression during second-line therapy or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Randomization until death due to any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|Proportion of Participants Who Underwent Liver Metastases Resections, Reported here is the proportion of participants who underwent liver metastases resections calculated as follows: number of participants who underwent liver metastases resections divided by total number of participants in each arm., Randomization up to approximately 3 years|Proportion of Participants Considered by the Investigator to be Unresectable on Study Enrollment Who Subsequently Underwent Attempted Curative Resections of Metastases, The proportion of participants considered by the investigator to be unresectable at study enrollment who subsequently underwent attempted curative resections of metastases was calculated as follows: number of participants considered by the investigator to be unresectable at study enrollment who subsequently underwent attempted curative resections of metastases divided by total number of participants in each arm. This outcome represents a measure of the rate of conversion from unresectable to resectable disease., Randomization up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Randomization up to approximately 3 years
