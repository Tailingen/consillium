A Study of SAR444245 Combined With Other Anticancer Therapies for the Treatment of Participants With Lung Cancer or Mesothelioma (Pegathor Lung 202)
Primary Objective:

-To determine the antitumor activity of SAR444245 in combination with other anticancer therapies.

Secondary Objectives:

* To confirm the dose and to assess the safety profile of SAR444245 when combined with other anticancer therapies.
* To assess other indicators of antitumor activity.
* To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR444245 when given in combination with pembrolizumab.
* To assess the immunogenicity of SAR444245.
Pleural Mesothelioma|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: THOR-707|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), derived based on Investigator's assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for Cohort A1, Cohort A2, and Cohort B1; per modified RECIST (mRECIST) for Cohort C1., Baseline to the date of first documented progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy or approximatively 9 months after the last participant receive first dose

The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main informed consent and include a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period \[max 35 cycles {cohorts A1, A2, and B1} = 735 days or until PD {cohort C1}\], an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier
