ERectile Dysfunctions, gOnadotoxicity and Sexual Health Assessment in Men With Lung Cancer
Although many phase III clinical trials evaluate the quality of life as a secondary endpoint, male sexuality remains a neglected topic in oncology research. In light of the long-term efficacy of new-generation anticancer treatments for ANSCLC (i.e. targeted therapies and immunotherapy), there is a paucity of data about any detrimental effect on fertility and sexuality that could complicate the therapy proposal, especially in young patients.

The aim of this trial is to assess incidence of endocrine toxicity and sexual dysfuction in male patients receiving active treatment for ANSCLC
