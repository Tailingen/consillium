PV-10 Chemoablation of Recurrent Breast Carcinoma
The objective of this study is to investigate the safety of intralesional (IL) PV-10 for the treatment of recurrent breast carcinoma. This study will also include a preliminary assessment of response of injected lesions by histologic assessment upon lesion excision at 1-3 weeks following IL PV-10 administration. Post-excision wound healing will be assessed clinically at 1 week and 4 weeks following excision of PV-10 injected lesions.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: PV-10 (rose bengal disodium 10%)
Systemic and locoregional adverse experience, 5-7 weeks post dosing (4 weeks post excision)
Histopathologic response of PV-10 injected lesions, 7-21 days post dosing|Wound healing of PV-10 injected lesions, 5-7 weeks post dosing (4 weeks post excision)
This is a single center, open label, ascending dose study. Subjects with at least one recurrent, histologically confirmed measurable soft tissue breast carcinoma who are candidates for lumpectomy (removal of the lesion from the site of recurrence in the breast or at another site) or mastectomy will receive a single intralesional injection of PV-10 into a single target lesion to uniformly infiltrate the target lesion and up to a 0.5 cm margin at a dose of up to 1.0 mL/cc lesion volume. Systemic and locoregional adverse events will be monitored over the study interval. Subject accrual and PV-10 administration will be stopped if more than 1 subject has a treatment related Grade 3 non-hematological or Grade 4 hematological toxicity within a period of two weeks after PV-10 administration.
