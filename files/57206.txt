StrataPATH™ (Precision Indications for Approved Therapies)
StrataPATH™ is a non-randomized, open-label trial designed to explore efficacy and safety of multiple FDA-approved and commercially available cancer therapies in new, biomarker-guided patient populations.

DRUG: lorlatinib|DRUG: encorafenib + binimetinib|DRUG: talazoparib|DRUG: sacituzumab govitecan|DRUG: axitinib|DRUG: Fam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan-Nxki|DRUG: enfortumab vedotin
Overall response rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, RECIST criteria will be used to assess the clinical activity of cancer treatments in participants with pre-specified biomarker profiles., Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years
Duration of Response (DoR) defined as the time from first documentation of disease response (CR or PR) until first documentation of progressive disease, DoR will be used to assess the duration of response of cancer treatments in participants with pre-specified biomarker profiles., Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years|Time to Treatment Discontinuation (TTD) defined as length of time from the date the participant initiates the systemic treatment to the date the participant discontinues treatment as compared to prior TTD from prior cancer treatment, TTD will be used to assess the duration of response of cancer treatments in participants with pre-specified biomarker profiles., Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years|TTnT (Time to Next Treatment) defined as the length of time from the date the participant initiates study treatment to the date the participant initiates their next systemic treatment or death., TTnT will be used to assess the duration of response of cancer treatments in participants with pre-specified biomarker profiles., Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years|ctDNA response: The proportion of participants with a <50% ratio of mean variant allele frequency (VAF) will be defined as ctDNA responders, Molecular response calculated as a ratio of mean VAF on treatment at 6 months compared to baseline VAF will be used to assess the clinical activity of cancer treatments in participants with pre-specified biomarker profiles., 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), Evaluate overall survival (OS) for participants who received a cancer treatment with pre-specified biomarker profiles, Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), Monitor and summarize any unexpected safety events in participants who received a biomarker-guided cancer treatment, Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years|ctDNA Response Rate, Evaluate ctDNA response rate at additional timepoints for participants who received cancer treatment with pre-specified biomarker profiles, Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years
Explore the correlation between serial ctDNA levels over time and participant response to cancer therapy based on RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the investigator., Assessed throughout end of study, up to 5 years
StrataPATH is a non-randomized, open-label trial designed to explore efficacy and safety of multiple FDA-approved and commercially available cancer therapies in new, biomarker-guided patient populations. Aiming to increase clinical benefit for patients, this study will leverage technology advancements, scientific literature, and Strata's real-world evidence to define novel, highly responsive pan-tumor molecular indications for FDA-approved therapies in both the advanced and micro-metastatic settings. Strata will rapidly identify participants who have efficacy signals for possible expansion into adaptive or randomized studies. Enrollment in each drug/biomarker cohort is competitive. Cohorts may be added, changed, or discontinued over the course of the study
