Induction Chemoimmunotherapy Combined With Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Cancer
Although unprecedented advances have been made in the field of esophageal cancer in recent decades, the prognosis for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains extremely poor, accounting for 30-40% of overall survival at 5 year. In recent years, multimodal treatments have proven to be an appropriate therapeutic approach for locally advanced ESCC. Recently, immunotherapy developed rapidly. The purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of cardonilizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced ESCC.
