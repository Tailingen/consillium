A Study of Regorafenib Combined with Envafolimab for Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors with Kit Gene Exon 17 Mutation That Failed Standard Treatment
This study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled Phase II clinical trial. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regorafenib combined with envafolimab compared to previously effective maintenance regimens in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring KIT exon 17 mutations who have failed standard treatments.
Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)
DRUG: regorafenib combined with envafolimab|DRUG: Control Group
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Assessed by the investigator according to mRECIST 1.1 criteria, From enrollment to disease progression or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS): Assessed by the investigator according to mRECIST 1.1 criteria., Overall Survival (OS): from enrollment to death, assessed up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR): Assessed by the investigator according to mRECIST 1.1 criteria., assessed up to 2 years|Safety, The safety parameters of this study include clinical symptoms, vital signs, physical examinations, and laboratory tests (routine, urinalysis, blood biochemistry, thyroid function, coagulation function, etc.). Adverse events (AEs) observed will be evaluated according to version 5.0 of the NCI-CTCAE, including type, incidence, severity, onset and end times, whether they are serious adverse events, and their relationship to the study drug.

The assessment of postoperative complications includes type, incidence, and grading (based on the Clavien-Dindo classification system)., assessed up to 2 years
Exploratory Study Endpoints-Correlation between the immune microenvironment of GIST and the efficacy of immunotherapy., Before enrollment, provide 15 paraffin tissue sections for the detection of immune microenvironment-related indicators, including PD-L1, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)., From enrollment to the end of the study, assessed up to 2 years
This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled phase II clinical trial aims to explore the efficacy and safety of Regorafenib combined with envafolimab in treating metastatic GIST with KIT exon 17 mutation that has failed standard treatment. It also seeks to investigate the correlation between the immune microenvironment and the efficacy of immunotherapy. The study includes patients with histologically confirmed advanced metastatic GIST containing the KIT exon 17 mutation, requiring at least one evaluable lesion. Using a block randomization method, the study is open-label and assigns patients to either the treatment group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment group receives Regorafenib combined with envafolimab, while the control group continues with previously effective targeted drugs until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal from the trial. A total of 82 patients are planned to be enrolled, with imaging assessments conducted at baseline and every two months during treatment.
