* Clast
* Time of Clast, up to 15 years after GF-CART01 infusion|Efficacy of GF-CART01, Assess the overall survival (OS) up to 15 years after GF-CART01 infusion, up to 15 years after GF-CART01 infusion
This comprehensive long-term follow-up study is meticulously designed to assess the safety and persistence of GF-CART01. Subjects who participated in the initial study of GF-01-01 and received treatment with GF-CART01, irrespective of their completion status, are eligible to participate in this follow-up study. The study may allow for a maximum enrollment of 18 subjects.
