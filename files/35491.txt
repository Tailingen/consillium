A Multimodal Predictive Recurrence Score for Patients With Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
The main goal of this observational study is to construct a predictive recurrence model for renal clear cell carcinoma through an artificial intelligence multimodal algorithm, which will improve the prognosis and survival time of ccRCC patients by helping clinicians to formulate individualised follow-up and to screen for appropriate adjuvant therapy candidates.
Renal Cell Carcinoma, Clear Cell
Disease free survival, Defined as from surgery to tumor recurrence or follow-up deadline, "Baseline, immediately after the surgery", "Tumour recurrence or further follow-up", "Three months after surgery", "Six months after surgery", "Every year after surgery, at least follow-up 2years, up to 10 years"
