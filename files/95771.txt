Evaluation of Revumenib in Participants With Colorectal Cancer and Other Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of revumenib in participants with colorectal cancer (CRC) or other solid tumors who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy.

The study will be conducted in two parts. The Phase 1 portion of the study consists of a dose escalation cohort, and a signal-seeking expansion where anti-tumor activity signals will be evaluated. The Phase 2 portion of the study will further confirm the anti-tumor activity signals of revumenib.
