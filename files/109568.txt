Glioblastoma, the most prevalent primary intracranial tumor, is characterized by its formidable therapeutic resistance, primarily attributed to its intrinsic heterogeneity. This heightened heterogeneity is not solely confined to inter-tumoral variations across different individuals but also encompasses considerable intratumoral diversity. The pervasive notion among the scientific community posits that this intratumoral heterogeneity substantiates an endogenous mechanism for drug resistance, thereby exerting substantial influence upon the design of clinical trials, prognostic prediction, and patient outcomes. Preceding methodologies for assessment are beleaguered by a constellation of challenges, impeding precise evaluation of global tumor heterogeneity and necessitating innovative modalities to surmount this impasse. MRI imaging, endowed with non-invasiveness and user-friendliness, surmounts the biases of single-point sampling, enabling comprehensive and dynamic appraisal of glioblastomas. Notably, high-grade gliomas exhibit pronounced microenvironmental pressure selectivity and adaptability, akin to species occupation within distinct ecological niches. This phenomenon, termed "habitat," manifests as a visual representation of the tumor's spatial distribution and temporal evolution, thus facilitating real-time, longitudinal monitoring. Given the substantial imaging heterogeneity inherent to glioblastomas, they stand as an opportune subject for habitat imaging techniques compared to their neoplastic counterparts.

The present investigation endeavors to leverage multi-center, multi-dimensional MRI spatial heterogeneity analysis to predict pivotal genes germane to prognosis and therapy in high-grade gliomas, ultimately constructing a stratified prognostic model for afflicted patients.
