Prevalence of FID and QoL in Patients with Oncological and with Haematological Malignancies
Prospective single-center observational study assessing prevalence of FID (Laboratory work-up) and Quality of Life (Questionnaire) in adult patients with oncological and with haematological malignancies within four weeks prior to disease-directed therapy.
Functional Iron Deficiency
The primary endpoint is the determination of the prevalence of FID in patients with oncological and with haematological malignancies., Prevalence of functional iron deficiency in the study population using full blood count, reticulocytes, transferrin saturation, serum-ferritin, CRP and ALAT., through study completion, an average of 1 year
The secondary endpoint is the collection of data on quality of life using FACT-An., Data on quality of life using FACT-An, which covers a fatigue and anemia subscale, as well as generic QoL domains including physical well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being and socal well-being subscales - this is done at study entry estimating scores at various subscales of FACT-An., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Patients included into the study will have a laboratory work-up assessing the occurence of functional iron deficiency using laboratory parameters (full blood count, reticulocytes, transferrin saturation, serum-ferritin, CRP, ALAT) and have to fill in once the FACT-An questionnaire generating data on Quality of Life at time of study entry.
