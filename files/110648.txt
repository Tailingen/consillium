BGB324 in Combination With Pembrolizumab or Dabrafenib/Trametinib in Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BGB324 given together with standard treatment, pembrolizumab or dabrafenib and trametinib, compared to standard treatment alone,

This is an investigator initiated randomized randomized clinical phase 1b/2 clinical trial comparing safety and efficacy of the Axl inhibitor BGB324 in combination with pembrolizumab or dabrafenib+trametinib with that of pembrolizumab or dabrafenib+trametinib alone. Patients with non-resectable stage III or stage IV melanoma will be stratified based on BRAF mutation and tumor load to start dabrafenib+trametinib (BRAF mutation and high tumor load) or pembrolizumab (BRAF wild type or BRAF mutation and low tumor load) in first line. The patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive BGB324 in combination with pembrolizumab or dabrafenib+trametinib or to receive pembrolizumab or dabrafenib+trametinib alone. A 3+3 dose escalation will be performed for the combination of BGB324 and dabrafenib+trametinib. There is a major focus on predictive markers of treatment response evaluated in blood samples and biopsies.
