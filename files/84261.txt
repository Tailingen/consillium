A Study of HS-10342 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
HS-10342 is a small molecular, oral potent, selective CDK4/6 inhibitor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety/tolerability and the pharmacokinetic profile of HS-10342 in Chinese advanced solid tumor patients. Preliminary efficacy will be also investigated in this study.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HS-10342
Dose-Limiting Toxicity and Maximum Tolerated Dose of HS-10342., The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one out of three subjects experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within the 5 week after the first dose., 5 weeks
This is a phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of HS-10342 in patients with advanced solid tumor by using a "3+3" dose escalation.
