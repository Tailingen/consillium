SIBYL: obServation of Therapy Response With lIquid BiopsY evaLuation
The purpose of SIBYL is to generate clinical validity data for the ability of a future version of Guardant360 developed by Guardant Health to measure response to systemic therapy in patients with unresectable advanced solid tumors. It is necessary to collect clinical data points and treatment outcomes in order to demonstrate clinical validity for longitudinal monitoring with ctDNA and correlation of ctDNA dynamics with therapeutic response, as evaluated by standard methods, including RECIST 1.1 and CT scan measurements.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Guardant360
Sensitivity of ctDNA to Detect Disease Progression, The Primary Endpoint, sensitivity of ctDNA to detect disease progression, will be evaluated from all eligible subjects within the primary study cohorts (breast cancer, NSCLC, or CRC), 6 years
RECIST Response, RECIST v1.1 response: defined as the tumor response to treatment as measured by restaging scans in subjects who have increasing or decreasing ctDNA quantities before the time of scan and correlating this change with the clinical response, 6 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS: defined as the quantitative changes in ctDNA that correlate or associate with participant's progression free survival on each line of SOC therapy, 6 years|Lead Time, Lead time: defined as the interval between ctDNA detection or increase and clinical detection of disease progression, 6 years
