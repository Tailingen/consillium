Low Grade Chondrosarcoma Versus Enchondroma
The purpose of this project is to verify possible clinical and radiological findings with regard to distinguishing enchondroma from low grade chondrosarcoma of the long bones. In addition, this study presents the outcome of patients with enchondroma and low grade chondrosarcoma of the long bones who were treated with curettage (intralesional surgery).
Chondroma|Chondrosarcoma
PROCEDURE: curettage (intralesional surgery)
Local recurrence rate of patients with chondroma or low grade chondrosarcoma treated by curettage (intralesional surgery), 36 months
The investigators retrospectively review the records of 65 patients with enchondroma and 37 patients with low grade chondrosarcoma of the limbs treated by curettage between 1988 and 2014 in a single Institution.
