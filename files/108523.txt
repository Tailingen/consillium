Evaluation of ArTificial Intelligence System (Gi-Genius) for adenoMa dEtection in Lynch Syndrome.
The purpose of this study is to assess if artificial intelligence aid colonoscopy colonoscopy is superior to conventional colonoscopy for the detection of adenomas during surveillance colonoscopy in patients with Lynch syndrome.
Lynch Syndrome
DEVICE: Gi Genius, Medtronic|OTHER: White light standart colonoscopy
Mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy, Compare mean number of adenomas in both arms calculated by dividing the total number of adenomas detected by the total number of colonoscopies in each arm, 18 months
Withdrawal time, time spent on inspection, from the cecum to endoscope extraction through the anus, excluding the time needed for therapeutic measures (including polypectomy)., 18 months|Mean number of polyps per colonoscopy, Compare mean number of polyps in both arms calculated by dividing the total number of polyps (including serrated lesions and adenomas) detected by the total number of colonoscopies in each arm, 18 months|Adenoma detection rate, proportion of individuals undergoing a complete colonoscopy who had at least one adenoma detected between two arms., 18 months|Polyp detection rate, proportion of individuals undergoing a complete colonoscopy who had at least one polyp detected between two arms., 18 months|False positives in CAD arm, Combination of:

* Lesions detected by CAD (\>2s green box) after an adequate inspection with a high confidence optical diagnosis negative for neoplasia made by the endoscopist.
* Lesions detected by CAD (\>2s green box) after an adequate inspection resected by the endoscopist and with a clinically non-significant histology., 18 months|Mean number of non-clinically significant removed lesions, Lesions removed and with a histology of normal or inflammatory mucosa or removed diminutive recto-sigmoid polyps with a histology of hyperplastic, 18 months|Subjective endoscopist measures, Questionary addresing the easiness and satisfaction of the procedure, detection of lesions and performance of artificial intelligence will be filled in by each endoscopist, 18 months
To compare the performance of white-light colonoscopy (HD-WLE) versus white-light + CAD (CAD) for detection of adenomas (1:1 ratio). The CAD system will include an artificial intelligence-based medical device (GI Genius, Medtronic) trained to process colonoscopy images and superimpose them, in real time, on the endoscopy display as a green box over suspected lesion. An adequate bowel preparation and minimum withdrawal time of 6 min will be required. Colonoscopies will be performed by experienced endoscopists and with high-definition scopes. Lesions will be collected, and histopathology findings used as the reference standard. The primary outcome of this trial will be the mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy (APC).
