A Retrospective Analysis of Pancreatic Injuries and Treatment Outcomes
The goal of this observational study is to compare the presentation, treatment, and outcomes in patients suffering traumatic pancreatic injuries from blunt or penetrating trauma.

The questions this study aims to answer are:

1. Does a statistically significant association exist between pancreatic injury grade and the following individual factors:

   * Mortality
   * Morbidity
   * Injury severity score
2. Is there an association between post-operative pancreatic complications and operation-specific intervention?
3. Does pancreatic injury score correlate with certain intra-abdominal organ injuries?

Participants meeting criteria are greater than 18 years old, with no history of pancreatic surgery who were hospitalized at Kern Medical Center after presenting to the institution's emergency department as tier 1 or 2 trauma activations following blunt or penetrating abdominal injury and were diagnosed with pancreatic injury during the same hospitalization.
