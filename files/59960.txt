Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Sintilimab or Placebo in Combination With XELOX as First Line Treatment in Patients With Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to estimate overall survival of Sintilimab+ oxaliplatin + capecitabine and placebo+ oxaliplatin + capecitabine, as first-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
