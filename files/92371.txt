Combination of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin in Metastatic or Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The aim of the study is to assess if gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin as 1st line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma has reasonable efficacy and a favourable toxicity profile that warrants further comparative study. A parallel group of randomly selected patients of equal number to the carboplatin and gemcitabine combination arm will be treated with the cisplatin and 5-FU combination chemotherapy (active control arm).

The hypothesis is that this combination of chemotherapy is at least as active and less toxic than the reference regimen of cisplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
The primary efficacy variable is response to therapy. Response will be evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee., 12 months
Progression free survival defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months|Duration of response defined as the interval between the first documented response (CR or PR) and the first documented sign of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months|Safety and tolerability assessments will consist of 1.Monitoring and recording all AE and SAE, 2.Regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry and urinary laboratory parameters, 3.Regular performance of physical examinations, including vital signs, 12 months
52 patients with metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. After initial screening, patients will attend clinic for baseline examination. Subjects will then be randomly allocated to carboplatin and gemcitabine or cisplatin and 5-FU combinations in a ratio of 1:1. Study visits will occur depending on which arm the patient is on.

An economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of gemcitabine-carboplatin will be implemented within this protocol.
