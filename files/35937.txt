American Ginseng in Treating Patients With Fatigue Caused by Cancer
RATIONALE: American ginseng may reduce fatigue in patients with cancer. It is not yet known whether American ginseng is more effective than a placebo in treating cancer-related fatigue.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying American ginseng to see how well it works in treating patients with fatigue caused by cancer.

Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the General Subscale of the MFSI-SF, Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) general subscale is a six-item subscale to measure the subjective experience of fatigue. The items include feeling "pooped, worn out, fatigued, sluggish, run down and tired". Answers are on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The subscale scores were the sum of all six items. The scores were converted to a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating less fatigue. Change from baseline to week 4 was calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at week 4., Baseline and week 4

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the efficacy of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) as therapy for cancer-related fatigue as measured by the general subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF).

Secondary

* To evaluate toxicities and tolerability of American ginseng when used for cancer-related fatigue.
* To examine stress as a mediating variable on the effects of American ginseng on cancer-related fatigue.
* To explore the impact of American ginseng on various dimensions of fatigue as measured by the other subscales of the MFSI-SF, functional interference as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, and well being as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), as well as the single measure of fatigue.
* To determine clinically significant changes in fatigue scores using the global impression of change.
* To evaluate whether there are differences in the efficacy of American ginseng for fatigue based on minority populations.

Tertiary

* To describe cortisol and cytokine values in fatigued cancer survivors and to evaluate the relationship of cortisol and cytokines to fatigue severity as well as to patterns of alterations previously documented in fatigued breast cancer survivors.
* To evaluate whether Wisconsin Ginseng impacts the expression of cortisol and cytokine in fatigued cancer survivors.
* To evaluate the role of cortisol and cytokine changes as the mechanism by which Wisconsin Ginseng can ameliorate cancer related fatigue.
* To evaluate the relationships between cytokine and cortisol levels with secondary outcomes such as mood and stress.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to baseline fatigue score (4-7 vs 8-10), disease status of current cancer (initial diagnosis vs recurrent disease), current treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, endocrine therapy \[i.e., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors\], or other targeted therapy) ( yes vs no), duration of all prior cancer treatment in patient's lifetime (none vs ≤ 180 days vs \> 180 days), and current tumor type (hematologic vs solid tumor malignancy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral American ginseng twice daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses.

Patients are instructed to complete the Ginseng Symptom Experience Diary and the Linear Analogue Scale weekly. Patients also complete the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study therapy.

Patients who are not actively receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy undergo blood and saliva sample collection at baseline and periodically during study therapy for correlative studies.
