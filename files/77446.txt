Factors Predicting Persistence of Oncogenic HPV and Cervical Dysplasia in HIV Infected Kenyan Women
This study will utilize a longitudinal study design to better understand the natural history of oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected Kenyan women, including the potentially modifiable (and non-modifiable) factors that are associated with progression of oncogenic HPV infection to clinical disease, including cervical cancer.
