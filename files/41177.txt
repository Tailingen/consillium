Evaluation of a Proactive Identification and Digital Mental Health Intervention Approach to Address Unmet Psychosocial Needs of Individuals Living With Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a mobile application (app) for depression treatment called "Moodivate" among cancer survivors. Moodivate was developed by the investigators to assist with the treatment of depressed mood.

Participants will be randomly assigned to either download the mobile app, "Moodivate", or not. Approximately 2/3 of participants enrolled will receive the mobile app and the remaining 1/3 will not.

All participants will complete electronic questionnaire measures throughout the study period. Questionnaires will assess symptoms of depression, as well as the participant's experiences using Moodivate and participating in this trial. Participation in this study will take about 4 weeks, beginning today.

Participation in this study may help in the treatment of future cancer survivors. The greatest risks of this study include frustration, worsening of emotional distress, data breach, and/or loss of confidentiality. Alternative treatments include the participant contacting their primary care provider or their oncology care team to discuss other available treatments for depressed mood.
