Adjuvant Chemotherapy for High Risk Uterine Leiomyosarcoma
The purpose of this trial is to study the benefits of giving chemotherapy to women after they have had surgical resection of their primary disease and have no evidence of disease remaining(known as adjuvant therapy). The major objective of this study is to determine the progression free survival. The goal is to prevent relapse or recurrence of their uterine leiomyosarcoma.
Leiomyosarcoma|Uterine Neoplasm
DRUG: gemcitabine, docetaxel, doxorubicin
Two-year Progression-free Survival Among Women Treated With This Adjuvant Regimen for High Risk Uterine LMS, Every 3 months up to two years
Tolerability/Toxicity of This Regimen, Unacceptable toxicity is defined as grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity events that are considered to be treatment-related, excluding alopecia and fatigue., Every 28 days during dosing and then every 3 months thereafter until patient comes off study|Correlation Between Age and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), 2 years|Correlation Between Menopausal Status at Diagnosis and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), 2 years|Correlation Between Uterine Serosal Involvement and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), AJCC Stage I: No serosal involvement AJCC Stage II: No serosal involement AJCC Stage III: Serosal only, 2 years|Correlation Between Mitotic Rate and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), Mitotic rate is measured in mitoses per 10 high-power fields, 2 years|Correlation Between Estrogen Receptor (ER) Status and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), 2 years|Correlation Between Progesterone Receptor (PR) Status and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), 2 years|Correlation Between 1988 FIGO Stage and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), Stage I: confined to the uterine corpus Stage II: confined to corpus and cervix Stage IIIA: serosa involvement only (disease could involve the uterine serosa, but patients must have had no other evidence of local spread), 2 years|Correlation Between Estrogen Receptor (ER) or Progesterone Receptor (PR) Positive and Tumor Response to Treatment (PFS), 2 years
Patients with a diagnosis of early-stage uterine leiomyosarcoma have a 70% chance of relapse or recurrence of their disease. Patients enrolled in this trial will receive 4 cycles of gemcitabine and docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of adriamycin. Following completion of chemotherapy, they will be have repeat imaging at regular intervals to monitor for disease recurrence along with periodic clinical evaluations.
