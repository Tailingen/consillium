A Phase 1/2 Study to Evaluate OTX-2002 in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumor Types Known for Association with the MYC Oncogene
This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of OTX-2002 as a single agent and in combination with standard of care in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumor types known for association with the MYC oncogene.

The study consists of Part 1 (OTX-2002 monotherapy) and Part 2 (OTX-2002 combined with standard of care in hepatocellular carcinoma). Part 1 consists of escalation and expansion, and Part 2 consists of safety run-in and expansion. The objective of Part 1 escalation and Part 2 safety run-in will be safety and tolerability, while anti-tumor activity will be evaluated as the primary endpoint in Part 1 and Part 2 expansion.

This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of OTX-2002 as a single agent and in combination with standard of care in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumor types known for association with the MYC oncogene. The study consists of Part 1 (OTX-2002 monotherapy) and Part 2 (OTX-2002 combined with standard of care in hepatocellular carcinoma).

In Part 1, during dose escalation, participants with HCC and other solid tumors that progressed on, relapsed after, are refractory to, or are intolerant of standard of care for which no treatment options are available will be administered an intravenous infusion of OTX-2002 as a single agent. The escalation will be conducted using a 3+3 design, with the primary endpoint of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In Part 1 expansion, 15-25 participants with BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh Class A HCC who have received at least 1 prior line of systemic anticancer treatment, and without available subsequent standard of care, will receive OTX-2002 at the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) for monotherapy. The primary endpoint of Part 1 expansion will be overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).

In Part 2, during safety run-in, participants with BCLC stage B or C, Child-Pugh Class A HCC who have received at least 1 prior line of systemic anticancer treatment, and without available subsequent standard of care, will receive OTX-2002 at the selected dose in combination with standard of care therapies at the local approved dose. The primary endpoint of Part 2 safety run-in will be DLT, MTD, and incidence of TEAE. Once the combination therapies have been determined to be tolerable in the safety run-in, 15-25 HCC participants will be enrolled in Part 2 expansion for each of the combination therapies. The primary endpoint of Part 2 expansion will be ORR and DoR.
