UTB-VBN-EBUS With or Without Fluoroscopy for the Diagnosis of PPLs
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility,efficacy and safety of ultrathin bronchoscopy(UTB) combined with virtual bronchoscopic navigation(VBN) and endobronchial ultrasound(EBUS) for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) without radiographic fluoroscopy.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: VBN|PROCEDURE: EBUS|PROCEDURE: X-ray
The difference of diagnostic value of UTB-VBN-EBUS with fluoroscopy as compared to UTB-VBN-EBUS alone, The diagnostic value means diagnostic yields in two groups for benign and malignant lesions, Up to half year
The difference of the operation time of UTB-VBN-EBUS with fluoroscopy as compared to UTB-VBN-EBUS alone, The operation time means the total operation time and the total EBUS time., Up to half year
The difference of complications of UTB-VBN-EBUS with fluoroscopy as compared to UTB-VBN-EBUS alone, Complications mean a composite of operation-related serious adverse events (pneumothorax,bleeding,etc.) during and after the operation in two groups., Up to half year
The investigators evaluate feasibility,efficacy and safety of UTB combined with VBN and EBUS for the diagnosis of PPLs without radiographic fluoroscopy.Bronchoscopes with a 3.0-mm distal end diameter and a 1.7-mm working channel diameter are used (BF-Y0058;Olympus).The final diagnoses are established by pathological evidence from biopsy or cytology specimen including bronchoscopy or other procedures,microbiological analysis and clinical follow-up.The study is designed as a single center prospective randomized controlled trial.The participating center is Department of endoscopy, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to UTB-VBN-EBUS-X-ray group and UTB-VBN-EBUS group based on a randomization schedule.The study is expected to enroll 200 patients with 100 patients of each group.
