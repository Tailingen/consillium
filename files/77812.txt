Single-Port RAS Using Da Vinci SP Surgical System for UTUC Patients
To evaluate patient-reported outcomes of radical nephroureterectomy using single-port robotic surgery
Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer
DEVICE: Da Vinci SP Surgical System
Incidence of conversion rate, The primary performance endpoint will be assessed as the ability to successfully completed the planned procedure with da Vinci SP System, with no conversion to alternative surgery including open surgery or laparoscopy., During Surgery
Perioperative Parameters: Operative Time, First skin incision to closure of wound by minutes., immediately after the surgery|Perioperative Parameters: Console Time, Surgeon on Console Time by minutes, immediately after the surgery|Perioperative Parameters: Transfusion, Blood transfusion amount by bags, immediately after the surgery|Perioperative Parameters: Estimated Blood Loss, Estimated blood loss by mL, immediately after the surgery|Postoperative Parameters: Length of Stay, Total length of stay = discharge date - admission date, 30 days post operation|Complication, Intraoperative and/or postoperative complication rate in 30 days by Clavien-Dindo Classification, 30 days post operation|Postoperative Parameters: Readmission, Readmission rate by %, 30 days post operation|Postoperative Parameters: Reoperation, Reoperation rate by %, 30 days post operation|Perioperative Mortality, Mortality by %, 30 days post operation|Pain Score, measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain assessment at baseline, post operation, and discharge day. VAS ranged from 0 to 10, representing no pain to extreme pain., 30 days post operation
