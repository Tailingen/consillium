Assessments of pain through pain score parameter, Assessments of pain through pain score parameter of the NRS questionnaire. Pain will be measured using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) which is a 11 point scale from 0 to 10 which is a validated score of measuring pain in which 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain, 20 minutes|Assessments of pain through physiological parameters, Assessments of pain through physiological parameters of pulse rate. Heart Rate will be measured using heart rate beats per minute, 20 minutes
A prospective, open-label, randomized control trial in a tertiary university affiliated medical center between March 2021 to March 2023. Overall, 100 women referred for conization of cervix due to cervical dysplasia will be randomly allocated to undergo conization either with the use of virtual reality glasses (study group) or with standard treatment (control group). The primary outcome measures will include self-reported pain, anxiety scores, and vital signs as an indirect measurement of pain and anxiety, including pulse rate (PR) and respiratory rate (RR). Pain and anxiety outcomes will be measured as numeric rating scores.
