Telemedicine for Early Detection of Cytokine Release Syndrome and Neurotoxicity
The purpose of this research is to replace one of participants' outpatient chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy follow up visits with a virtual or "telemedicine" visit. The telemedicine visit will use an electronic tablet with a camera and a microphone that allows participants to communicate with their physicians and nurses. Participants will be provided with the necessary equipment to complete these visits.

OTHER: Telemedicine visit
Number of Successfully Completed Telemedicine Visits, To determine feasibility of telemedicine for outpatient cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity assessment. Investigators will consider telemedicine feasible in this population if at least 13 of the 15 patients successfully complete 80% of telemedicine visits. A visit will be considered successful if all measurements are recorded OR if the visit is interrupted because the participant needs to come into the CAR-T unit for assessment. If a patient is admitted, then the 80% benchmark will be calculated based on the number of days the patient was outpatient at 11 pm. The proportion meeting the 80% benchmark will be reported along with an exact 95% confidence interval., 3 years
Number of Times a Telemedicine Visit Triggered Action, To determine how many times a telemedicine visit triggered an inpatient admission or outpatient observation status, 3 years|Number of Patients to Have Cytokine Release Syndrome, Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the number of cases of cytokine release syndrome based on telemedicine visits., 3 years|Number of Patients to Have Neurotoxicity, Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the number neurotoxicities reported based on telemedicine visits., 3 years
Primary Objective: To determine feasibility of telemedicine for outpatient cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity assessment (how many telemedicine visits successfully completed per patient)

Secondary Objective(s)

* To determine how many times a telemedicine visit triggered an action (inpatient admission/ outpatient observation status)
* To determine how many patients were detected to have cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity based on their telemedicine visit
