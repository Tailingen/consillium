Prioritising Prevention of COVID-19 in Persons With Cancer in the French West Indies
The public health council (Haut Conseil de Santé Publique) published a statement on 14 March 2020 relating to the management of patients with severe forms of COVID-19, stipulating specific recommendations for patients with cancer.

The statement notes that patients with cancer at much higher risk (four to five times higher) of several respiratory complications, which develop very rapidly, especially if they had recently undergone surgery or chemotherapy in the previous few weeks, and that this risk could be life-threatening, on top of the cancer-related risk. In addition, the statement noted that:

* COVID-19 appears to be more frequent in patients with cancer than among the general population (1% vs 0.29%)
* Among those infected, the risk of severe respiratory complications requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is higher in patients with cancer than among those without (39% vs 8%, P=0.0003).
* A history of chemotherapy or surgery in the previous months is an important prognostic factor for the development of severe respiratory complications (odds ratio (OR) = 5.34, P= 0.0026).
* Deterioration of respiratory function occurs more quickly in patients with cancer (13 vs 43 days, hazard ratio (HR) 3.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) \[1.65-7.69\]).

In addition, COVID-19 may lead to a change in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with cancer, with potential consequences such as use of oral treatments at home, discontinuation of anticancer therapy depending on the context, or prioritization of management according to curative/palliative treatment type, age, and line of therapy.

International studies previously reported the psychological repercussions of major epidemics on the emotional state. The impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer therefore warrants evaluation, among cancer patients in the French West Indies, in the current situation of nationwide lockdown.
