Trial of Eribulin/Cyclophosphamide or Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally Advanced HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
The investigators propose a randomized phase II study evaluating the pCR and toxicity profiles of combination eribulin/cyclophosphamide (ErC) and docetaxel /cyclophosphamide (TC) as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer.
HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Docetaxel
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate in Patients Treated With ErC for 6 Cycles Prior to Surgery, One cycle = 21 days. Pathologic CR is defined as the absence of invasive tumor in the breast and lymph node tissue removed at the time of definitive surgery as judged by the local pathologist., 18 weeks
The Number of Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability., Treatment-Related Adverse Events occurring in \>= 15% of treated patients, 43 months|Clinical Response Rate (cRR) of ErC as Neoadjuvant Therapy, Defined as the number of patients with a best response of clinical complete or partial response (cCR or cPR) divided by the number of patients qualified for tumor response analysis per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT. Complete Response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD;, 43 months|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at 2 Years, Defined as the percent probability that participants had not experienced disease recurrence or died from any cause at 2 years post-surgery, analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology., 24 months
