NYU Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program Blood and Genetics
Improving current strategies for detection of early stage disease can impact favorably on long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer. To reduce the morbidity and mortality of ovarian cancer, screening for this disease must detect early stage disease rather than advanced stage disease. Thus the challenge for the future is to identify and develop highly sensitive and specific tumor markers that can be applied to population-based screening for the early detection of ovarian cancer.

identification and development of highly sensitive and specific tumor markers for ovarian cancer, 5 years
The aim of NYU Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program is to establish an effective, early detection program employing state-of-the-art science and technology in collaboration with other nationally recognized clinicians and scientists.

This proposed research study will foster collaboration between clinicians and scientists that will facilitate the rapid identification of a set of molecular, biochemical, functional, and genetic markers which can be employed to effectively detect and manage ovarian cancer and other gynecological malignancies.
