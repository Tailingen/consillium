PI Pembro in Combination With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Liver Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this research study is:

* To find out how safe the study drug, pembrolizumab, is when combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver.
* To see how well subjects can tolerate treatment with pembrolizumab and SBRT.
* To find out how often colorectal cancer comes back 1 year after surgically removing all known disease and being treated with SBRT and pembrolizumab.

RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Recurrence rate at 1 year, Determine the recurrence rate at 1 year following clearance of metastatic disease in the setting of treatment with SBRT and pembrolizumab, 1 year
Time to recurrence estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The 95% confidence of the median time to recurrence will be calculated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method, up to 6 years|Disease-free survival estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The 95% confidence of the median time to disease free survival calculated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method., up to 6 years|Overall survival estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The 95% confidence of the median time to overall survival calculated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method., up to 6 years
PET/MR imaging parameters, Imaging biomarkers (SUVtot, SUVmean, SUVmax) will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics in terms of means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges. Percentage changes in imaging biomarkers will be calculated between assessment time points. Logistic regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate whether changes in imaging biomarkers predict the recurrence rate at 1 year following clearance of metastatic disease., 1 year|Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, The number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes will be summarized in terms of means and standard deviations for each assessment time point. A negative binomial regression or overdispersed Poisson regression model with patient specific random effects will be used to evaluate changes in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes., 1 year|Expression levels of PDL1, Linear regression analysis will be conducted to examine the correlation between expression levels of PDL1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases., 1 year
This is a phase 1b feasibility study to evaluate the use of PD-1 blockade in combination with ablative radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). This study will examine the sequential combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and pembrolizumab for patients for whom the goal is eradicating all known sites of disease. It is very likely that for many patients the SBRT therapy will be completed following other modalities including operative resection or ablation.
