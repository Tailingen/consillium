Intravenous T3011 Given as a Single Agent and in Combination With Other Therapy in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase 1/2a Open-Label Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Study of T3011 when Administered Intravenously as a Single Agent and in Combination with Other Therapy in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
Solid Tumor|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Colorectal Cancer|NSCLC|Ovarian Cancer|Endometrial Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: T3011
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of single agent IV T3011 Characterize DLTs and identify the MTD and/or the RP2D of single agent IV T3011, Number of participants with Adverse Events (TEAEs, SAEs, AESIs), with abnormal clinically significant vital signs, with abnormal physical examination findings and abnormal laboratory tests results, Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011
Evaluate the immunogenicity of single agent IV T3011., Measurement of ADAs and Nabs of IL-12, anti-PD-1 antibody and HSV-1 (test Nabs when ADAs are positive)., Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of subjects who have best overall response (BOR) as CR or partial response (PR), as determined according to RECIST v1.1. CR or PR will be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point at 4-8 weeks later., Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of subjects who have BOR as CR or PR or stable disease (SD) (if a subject develops SD, it needs to be confirmed at least 6 weeks later, that is, SD lasts at least 6 weeks), as determined according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|Duration of response (DOR), Defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever comes first), as determined according to RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever comes first), as determined according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause., Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|time to treatment failure（TTF）, Defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from the date of first treatment to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death., Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011|PFS2, Defined as the time from the date of initiation of new antitumor therapy to the first occurrence of disease progression after new antitumor therapy or death from any cause (whichever comes first), Up to 2 years from first dose of T3011
This is a multicenter, open-label study conducted in two phases (as outlined in the subsections below):

Phase 1: T3011 administered intravenously as a single agent in subjects with pathologically confirmed locally recurrent or metastatic solid tumors, who have failed or declined SOC treatment. Phase 1 will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of single agent T3011. Cohorts of three subjects will be enrolled at each T3011 dose level with expansion to six subjects, if necessary, to assess toxicity. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities observed, with approximately 36-42 evaluable subjects enrolled in phase 1.

Phase 2a: An expansion study will be conducted based on phase 1 results.
