Multiple Dose Study In Cancer Patients: Safety and Tolerability of BMS-754807 in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
A Phase I dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BMS-754807 in combination with chemotherapy drugs, paclitaxel and carboplatin, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In addition, the study is expected to identify the recommended dose or dose range of BMS-754807 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for Phase 2 studies
