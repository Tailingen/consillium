A Study to Characterize Access to Specialty Care Received by American Indians/Alaska Natives
This is an observational study to define current care pathways for American Indian or Alaska Native patients who require specialty care and potential feasibility of conducting clinical research within the existing framework. The study is designed with the flexibility to enroll patients with any indication requiring referral to one of the following specialists: neurologist, ophthalmologist, or oncologist. Eligible patients will have recently (≤6 months) been referred to a specialty care provider and not yet seen a specialist (in addition to meeting the other eligibility criteria). The PPD virtual site can enroll patients from anywhere across the United States.

The study will collect data to determine whether a patient was seen by a specialist, diagnosed with a specialized disease, patient characteristics potentially associated with being seen or not seen by a specialist, and the reasons/barriers why a patient was not seen by a specialist through a number of patient surveys.
