Clinical Trial of SL1904B CAR-T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a study of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SL1904B in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR-T
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after SL1904B infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, First month post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: Overall Remission Rate (ORR), Overall Remission Rate (ORR) including partial remission and complete remission rate after infusion of SL1904B, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
Efficacy:duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of CD19 CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR method and percentage of CD19 CAR- T cells measured by flow cytometry method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry method, First month post CAR-T cells infusion
The CARs consist of an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment（scFv） that was derived from the FMC63 mouse hybridoma, a portion of the human CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.

The Main research objectives:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SL1904B in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

The Secondary research objectives:

To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of SL1904B in patients with recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
