Phase 2 Study of Autologous Followed by Nonmyeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation Using TLI & ATG
To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of this tandem autologous/allogeneic transplant approach for patients with advanced stage multiple myeloma.
Transplantation, Homologous|Transplantation, Autologous|Multiple Myeloma|Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT)
PROCEDURE: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (auto-PBSC) transplantation|PROCEDURE: Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (allo-PBSC) transplantation|DRUG: Filgrastim|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Cyclosporine|RADIATION: Total lymphoid irradiation|BIOLOGICAL: Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin|DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil 250mg|DRUG: Solumedrol|DRUG: Diphenhydramine|DRUG: Acetaminophen|DRUG: Hydrocortisone
Incidence of Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD), To evaluate the incidence acute GvHD of this tandem autologous/allogeneic transplant setting, 2 years after the last participant is enrolled.
Median Time to Engraftment After Auto-PBSC Transplant, Engraftment is assessed as:

* Neutrophil engraftment is \> 0.5 x 10⁹/L after cytopenia
* Platelet engraftment is \> 20 x 10⁹/L after cytopenia, 1 month|Median Time to Engraftment After Allo-PBSC Transplant, Engraftment is assessed as:

* Neutrophil engraftment is \> 0.5 x 10⁹/L after cytopenia
* Platelet engraftment is \> 20 x 10⁹/L after cytopenia, 1 month|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) = Complete Response Rate (CRR) + Partial Response Rate (PRR), 1 year|Complete Response Rate (CRR), Complete response rate (CRR) was assessed as all of:

* Negative immunoflixation on the serum and urine
* Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas
* \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow, 1 year|Partial Response Rate (PRR), Partial response rate (PRR) was assessed as

* \> 50% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein reduction by 90% or \< 200 mg/24 hr
* If serum M-protein is not measurable, then \> 50% reduction in the involved serum free light chain
* If involved serum free light chain is not measurable, then \> 50% reduction in the bone marrow plasma cell percentage + \> 50% reduction in the size of any soft tissue plasmacytoma., 1 year|Event-free Survival (EFS), To evaluate the graft versus myeloma effect by monitoring rate of event-free survival (EFS), 2 years after the last participant is enrolled|Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the graft versus myeloma effect by monitoring rate of overall survival (OS), 2 years after the last participant is enrolled
Development of cell-based immunotherapy from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is dependent upon stable T-cell engraftment and the success of this therapeutic approach is likely to be greatest when directed against a minimal rather than gross tumor burden. To this end, tandem transplants with high dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) for tumor cytoreduction followed by non-myeloablative allotransplant have been conducted. In myeloma, this tandem approach results in greater efficacy compared to conventional AHCT.
