Perioperative Treatment of Resectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma With the Combination of Adebrelimab and Apatinib and HAIC
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the efficacy and safety of combined infusion chemotherapy with Adebrelimab and Apatinib in the perioperative treatment of resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients. The main question it aims to answer are:

How to improve the survival of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and prolong the recurrence time after surgery.

Participants will receive receive neoadjuvant therapy with Adebrelimab combined with apatinib and FOLFOX-HAIC for 2 cycles (1 treatment cycle every 21 days, apatinib only used for the first cycle), and surgery was performed 14-28 days after the end of treatment. After 28 days of surgery, patients will continue to receive adjuvant treatment with Adebrelimab combined with apatinib for a maximum of one year.
