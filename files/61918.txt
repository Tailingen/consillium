Enzastaurin Before and Concomitant With Radiation, Followed by Enzastaurin in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
The purpose of the protocol was to induce a novel radiochemotherapy with enzastaurin as first-line treatment regimen in glioblastoma: Participants with active, unmethylated MGMT promoter were treated with enzastaurin before, concomitant, and after radiotherapy to determine safety and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6) in phase II.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Enzastaurin 500 milligram (mg) Once Daily (QD)|DRUG: Enzastaurin 250 mg Twice Daily (BID)
Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival at 6 Months (PFS-6), PFS-6 is defined as the percentage of participants with PFS at 6 months from the date of diagnosis to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (based on radiological assessment) or death from any cause. It is assumed that PFS follows an exponential distribution.Estimation using Kaplan-Meier technique., Baseline to 6 months
Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival at 1 and 2 Years After Surgery, Overall survival (OS) time is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. For participants who are still alive at the time of analysis, survival time will be censored at the last contact date. OS rate at 1 year (respectively 2 years) is determined using the OS times., Baseline to 1 and 2 year|Response Rate, Response rate is calculated as the number of participants with best response: complete response(CR: disappearance of all enhancing tumor on consecutive CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at least 1 month apart, off steroids, and neurologically stable or improved ) or partial response (PR:-50% reduction in size of enhancing tumor on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least 1 month apart, steroids stable or reduced, and neurologically stable or improved), divided by the number of participants treated, multiplied by 100. CR and PR were assessed according to the criteria defined by MacDonald et al. 1990. A CR or PR must be confirmed by a second assessment, performed â‰¥28 days after the first evidence of response., Baseline to 30 months|Change in Neurologic Status as Measured by Mini Mental Status Questionnaire, Total Score, Mini Mental State Status questionnaire is 11 questions, total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function and a negative change in baseline indicating decrease in cognitive function., Baseline through Week 12 .
