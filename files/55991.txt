Dose-finding Study of Hexaminolevulinate (HAL) Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) to Treat Cervical Neoplasia
An effective and safe medical therapy would be most welcome to reduce the need for surgical interventions and related adverse events and psychological impact on patients with cervical cancer precursors. In this clinical trial, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using hexaminolevulinate (HAL) for mild to moderate-grade CIN (grade 1-2).
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
DRUG: HAL 5% with illumination|DRUG: HAL 1% with illumination|DRUG: HAL 0.2% with illumination|DRUG: Placebo ointment without illumination
Comparison of Lesion Response Rates of Three Different Doses of HAL PDT and Placebo at 3 Months After Treatment., Lesion response was defined by three variables: Histology, cytology and HPV. Patient response at three months required histology regression to CIN1 or normal, cytology of LSIL or less severe, and HPV negative., 3 months after last treatment
Comparison of HPV Response of Three Different Doses of HAL PDT and Placebo at 3 Months After Treatment., HPV response was defined as clearance of baseline HPV infection, asssessed by genotype, 3 months after treatment
