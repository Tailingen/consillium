Neoadjuvant Anti-PD-1 and TP Versus TPF on Pathological Response in OSCC
To compare the pathological efficacy of neoadjuvant Toripalimab and Albumin paclitaxel /Cisplatin (TTP) with Docetaxel/ Cisplatin/ 5-flurouracil (TPF) for patients with locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and to determine the safety of neoadjuvant TTP. In order to explore a better protocol of neoadjuvant therapy to improve the efficacy in patients with locally advanced OSCC.
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Neoadjvant Therapy|Anti-PD-1|Chemotherapy
DRUG: Toripalimab (anti-programmed death-1 inhibitor)|DRUG: Albumin paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
Major pathologic response, The major pathologic response (MPR): the percentage of tumor cells before and after treatment was compared according to biopsy specimens before neoadjuvant therapy and pathological specimens after surgery; the percentage of residual viable tumor (RVT) cells was evaluated on resected tumor slides. MPR was defined as â‰¤ 10% RVT%., 3 months
2-year disease-free survival rate, Disease-free survival was calculated from the date of randomization to tumor recurrence or death from any cause., 24 months|2-year overall survival rate, Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to death from any cause., 24 months
In the previous "Illuminate" trial, neoadjuvant anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) of Toripalimab and Albumin paclitaxel /Cisplatin (TTP) therapy was used in 20 patients with locally advanced and resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and the neoadjuvant therapy was well-tolerated. The major pathologic response (MPR) rate was 60% (12/20), including 30% (6/20) pathological complete response (pCR). Furthermore, the MPR might transfer to survival benefit in the patients received neoadjuvant therapy. Therefore, in this randomized trial, we aimed to compare the pathological response of neoadjuvant TTP therapy versus TPF chemotherapy in the patients with locally advanced OSCC (Illuminate-2 trial). A total of 80 patients will be enrolled in this trial, and the primary endpoint is MPR rate. The neoadjuvant TTP arm will receive two cycles of intravenous Albumin paclitaxel (260mg/ m\^2), Cisplatin (75mg/ m\^2) and Toripalimab (anti-PD1 inhibitor, 240 mg) on d1 and d22, followed by the standard treatment of surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy. The neoadjuvant TPF arm will received two cycles of intravenous Docetaxel (75mg/m\^2), Cisplatin (75mg/m\^2) on d1 (d22), and 5-Fu(750mg/m\^2/day) for 5 days (d1-5 and d22-26), followed by the standard treatment of surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy.
