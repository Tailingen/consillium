A Study of Subcutaneously Injected Epcoritamab Plus Oral Lenalidomide Tablets Compared to Intravenously (IV) Infused Rituximab Plus IV Infused Gemcitabine and IV Infused Oxaliplatin in Adult Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
B-cell Lymphoma is an aggressive and rare cancer of a type of immune cells (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). This study will assess how safe and effective epcoritamab plus lenalidomide (E-Len) is compared to rituximab plus gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) )in treating adult participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Adverse events and change in disease condition will be assessed.

Epcoritamab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of DLBCL. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 3 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. Around 360 adult participants with R/R DLBCL will be enrolled in approximately 165 sites across the world.

Participants in arm A will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of epcoritamab plus oral lenalidomide capsules (E-Len) for up to 12 cycles (each cycle is 28 days). Participants in arm B will receive intravenously (IV) infused R-GemOx for up to 4 cycles (each cycle is 28 days). Participants in arm C will receive SC injections of epcoritamab for up to 12 cycles (each cycle is 28 days).

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Epcoritamab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Arm A vs Arm B: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression determined per Lugano 2014 criteria as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 4 Years
Arm A vs Arm B: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Complete response (CR), CR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR determined by Lugano 2014 criteria, as assessed by an IRC that is blinded to treatment arm prior to the initiation of new anti-lymphoma therapy., Up to 4 Years|Arm A vs Arm B: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 4 Years|Arm A vs Arm B: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate, The MRD negativity rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve MRD negative status prior to the initiation of new anti-lymphoma therapy., Up to 4 Years
