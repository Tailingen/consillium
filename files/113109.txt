Development of Preclinical Models Derived From Tumors With a Molecular Abnormality of Interest to Test Their Sensitivity to New Anti-tumor Therapies.
This study aims to collect tumor samples from patients carrying a mutation of interest to develop a cell culture technique for "spheroids.

The goal is to use these spheroids to model responses to anticancer treatments. Various therapeutic molecules can be tested on these spheroids, enabling the evaluation of the potential of new molecules or the activity of existing ones specifically on the tumor (bearing the mutation of interest) from which the spheroid was developed.

Tumor samples will be collected as part of biopsies or surgeries conducted during routine patient care.
Neoplasm Malignant
PROCEDURE: Surgery or biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood sample
Development of a cell culture technique for spheroids derived from fresh tumor samples collected among patients carrying a mutation of interest., The primary evaluation criterion is the percentage of patients for whom viable spheroids were obtained from tumors with a molecular abnormality of interest, measured by cell viability one month after the tumor sample was collected., 1 month
Obtain spheroids that are phenotypically and genotypically stable., The phenotypic and genotypic stability of spheroids over time will be assessed using molecular characterization techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry, sequencing)., 1 month|Validate preclinical models to study the tumor response to innovative therapies., The ability of spheroids to mimic aspects of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and extracellular matrix formation, will be evaluated., 1 month|Test the efficacy of molecules targeting variations identified in these tumors., The response of the spheroids to specific anti-tumor therapies will be evaluated through drug sensitivity tests (e.g., cytotoxicity assays)., 1 month
