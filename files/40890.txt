Evaluation of a Plasma Protein Profile as a Predictive Biomarker for Metastatic Relapse in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
The INSTIGO study aims to assess a plasma protein profile at different stages of patient follow-up as a predictive factor of metastatic recurrence in triple negative breast cancer. It also aims to look at other potential biomarkers of metastatic relapse such as Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes, circulating tumor DNA, figurative elements in blood, or a tumor RNA signature.

The investigators propose to carry out a study that measures the concentrations of a set of plasma proteins in order to assess their ability to predict metastatic relapse of triple negative breast cancer. A plasma protein profile could be an interesting biomarker since it is easily accessible and quantifiable.

The investigators also propose to search relation between metastatic relapse in TNBC and other biomarkers or potential biomarkers such as Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), figurative blood components and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA).

Finally, they also want to validate a TNBC RNA signature, established at Jean PERRIN Center, by analyzing the RNA expression of 8 genes.

Before treatment begins, the patient will take an initial blood sample. A second blood sample will be taken on the day of the first surgery or the day of the surgery post chemotherapy. A third blood sample will be done on the day of the beginning of the radiotherapy. A 4th and a 5th blood sample will be done at 6 months and 1 year respectively after the end of the radiotherapy. A part of these blood samples will be used for the quantification of circulating proteins, for the determination of the blood's figurative elements and for the quantification of circulating tumour DNA.
