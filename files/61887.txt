GCS-100LE in Combination With Etoposide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of GCS-100 in combination with etoposide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: GCS-100|DRUG: Etoposide; Dexamethasone
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of GCS-100 in combination with etoposide and dexamethasone by comprehensive lab, pharmacokinetics, physical assessments, and PET-CT imaging., Study Day 12 for toxicity, and 21-day cycles assessed every 2 cycles by physical and imaging assessments until disease progression
Overall response rate; correlate response to GCS-100 with the expression of galectin-3 in tumors; correlate serum galectin-3 levels with the administration of GCS-100, Baseline, Day 1, and Day 5 laboratory assessments
This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of GCS-100 with etoposide and dexamethasone. In vitro data demonstrates potentiation of the killing of lymphoma cells when GCS-100 is combined with dexamethasone or etoposide (Linda Baum, unpublished data; Finbarr Cotter et al, Annals of Oncology, vol 16, 205, Suppl 5.) GCS-100 will be administered in increasing doses to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with these chemotherapeutic agents. When the MTD is defined, the cohort will be expanded to characterize the efficacy of this combination.
