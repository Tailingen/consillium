Evaluation of NSCLC Patients' Oxygen Uptake On-kinetics at Cycle-ergometer During Prehabilitation
In developed countries cancer has become the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease. The lung is a particularly exposed organ since broncho-pulmonary cancers rank second in terms of incidence, and the first rank in terms of mortality of all cancers listed in like reported in United States.

Lung resection surgery is currently the recommended curative treatment for the early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite this preferred indication, some patients can not be eligible for surgery because of their cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities or their impaired functional capacity.

Thus, the evaluation of aerobic capacity through cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) of patients estimated at risk of postoperative complication is now recommended to estimate the level of predictive risk associated. The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Socitety agree on thresholds of \<10 and\> 20 ml/kg/min of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2peak) respectively determining a high or low postoperative risk, between these two thresholds risk is considered moderate.

Aerobic capacity is traditionally expressed in terms of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max or VO2peak) evaluated during an incremental CPET. In patients with significant respiratory impairment, these tests are often limited by ventilation and sub-maximally on the metabolic or cardiac parameters. However, the analysis of the VO2 kinetic during a constant-intensity test of moderate intensity is also a relevant way of measuring aerobic conditioning. Indeed, the time constant (τ) of phase II of VO2 kinetics (VO2τ) is a marker that closely reflects the adjustment of oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the cardio-respiratory response to exercise has been shown to be reproducible and training-sensitive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The value of VO2τ was also reported to be strongly correlated with markers of severity and prognosis in COPD patients. Previous work has shown that exercise training can improve the speed of the VO2 kinetic response in COPD patients as well as in healthy subjects.

To date, no study to our knowledge has evaluated the kinetics of the cardiorespiratory response during moderate intensity constant-load test in patients with NSCLC. In this context, this work aims to evaluate the applicability of this measure as well as its evolution during a preoperative exercise training program in patients with NSCLC.
