A Phase II Window of Opportunity Trial of PRMT5 Inhibitor, GSK3326595, in Early Stage Breast Cancer
This is a Phase II Randomized Window of Opportunity Trial Evaluating Clinical and Biological effects of PRMT5 inhibitor, GSK3326595, in Early Stage Breast Cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: GSK3326595
Complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA), The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve a Complete Cell Cycle Arrest (CCCA), defined as a reduction in the proportion of Ki67 positively staining cells to ≤ 2.7%., 2 years
Rate of complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA) in patients with wild-type TP53, The secondary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition preferentially results in CCCA in patients with wild-type TP53., 2 years|Assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in reduced expression of ER-α signaling compared to patients with no treatment based on gene expression analysis., A secondary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in reduced expression of ER-α signaling., 2 years|Assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in changes in breast-cancer stem cell signature particularly FOXP1 compared to patients with no treatment based on gene expression analysis, A secondary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in changes in breast-cancer stem cell signature particularly FOXP1., 2 years|Perform molecular analysis to identify immunomodulatory effects of GSK3326595 determined by abundance of different immune cells in tumor (CD4, CD8, NK cells, macrophages, etc) in the tumors treated with GSK3326595 alone versus the untreated tumours., A secondary outcome is to identify the immunomodulatory effects of GSK3326595, by performing exploratory analyses., 2 years
Rate of alternative splicing of Murine Double Minute 4 (MDM4), A tertiary outcome is to assess if PRMT5 inhibition results in alternative splicing of MDM4., 2 years|% of response in participants with high Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) expression and Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) loss, A tertiary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in preferential response in patients with high PDCD4 expression and CDKN2A loss., 2 years|% of response in participants with defects in homologous recombination DNA repair, A tertiary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in preferential response in patients with defects in homologous recombination DNA repair., 2 years|% of response in participants with defects in Cyclin D (CCND)/ Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) pathway, A tertiary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in preferential response in patients with defects in CCND/CDK pathway., 2 years|% of response in patients with defects in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (AKT) pathway, A tertiary outcome is to assess whether PRMT5 inhibition results in preferential response in patients with defects in PI3K/AKT pathway., 2 years
This is a phase II, randomized, open label, multi-center, parallel design, window of opportunity trial in up to 60 patients with early stage Hormone Receptor (HR) positive breast cancer evaluating GSK3326595. In a 2:1 randomization, patients will receive GSK3326595:no treatment for 15 +/- 3 days prior to breast surgery. There is no placebo in this trial.
