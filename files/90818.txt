Evaluation of Survival Prognostic Factors for Patients With Exocrine Pancreatic Cancer Resectable or Potentially Resectable
This study aims to collect clinical, biological and quality of life data from patients with a borderline or resectable pancreatic cancer. It will collect information from the date of diagnosis along the therapeutic care of the patients, and a 3-years follow-up after the end of the treatment. The database will be updated at each patient's visit. Biological samples will include: tumor, and plasma. Epidemiological data will also be collected, whereas Quality of life will be assessed by the EORTC standard. The objectives of this database are to identify new biomarkers (genomic, immunologic, and epidemiologic) and promote high quality standard research protocol.
