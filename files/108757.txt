A phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single arm clinical trial in adults with newly diagnosed aggressive high-risk DLBCL.
High-risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Blinatumomab|DRUG: Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Participants With Treatment-Emergent (Blinatumomab) Adverse Events, Overall incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events occurring during the blinatumomab investigative product (IP) treatment period graded by investigators according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and based on the scale:

Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity, assistance may be needed; minimal medical intervention required; Grade 3 = Severe - marked limitation in activity, assistance usually required; medical intervention required, hospitalization is possible; Grade 4 = Life threatening - extreme limitation in activity, assistance required; medical intervention, hospitalization or hospice care probable; Grade 5 = death., From the start of first infusion of IP to 30 days after the end of last infusion of IP; median (min, max) treatment duration was 56 (16, 84) days|Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Blinatumomab Treatment, Overall incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events deemed by investigators to be related to blinatumomab treatment. Severity was graded by investigators according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and based on the scale:

Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity, assistance may be needed; minimal medical intervention required; Grade 3 = Severe - marked limitation in activity, assistance usually required; medical intervention required, hospitalization is possible; Grade 4 = Life threatening - extreme limitation in activity, assistance required; medical intervention, hospitalization or hospice care probable; Grade 5 = death., From the start of first infusion of IP to 30 days after the end of last infusion of IP; median (min, max) treatment duration was 56 (16, 84) days
Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR) Expressed as the Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Metabolic Response (CMR) and Partial Metabolic Response (PMR) Using Lugano 2014 Criteria During Cycle 1 and During Treatment Period, Tumor response assessment was performed by a central reader according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. Overall objective response rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR). CMR: a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake \</=mediastinum), or 3 (uptake \<mediastinum but \</=liver) with/without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. PMR: a score 4 (uptake moderately greater than \[\>\] liver) or 5 (uptake markedly \>liver and/or new lesions) with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size on PET 5-PS for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; and reduced residual uptake in bone marrow compared with baseline., Cycle 1: Day 78 (3 weeks following end of Cycle 1 IP treatment) Treatment Period: Either the Cycle 1 timeframe or approximately Day 128 (3 weeks after Cycle 2 ended) for participants who completed Cycle 2|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Duration of Response, Duration of response was calculated only for responders during cycle 1. For participants who had CR or PR on the PET/CT scan at the end of the run-in period, response was measured from the start of blinatumomab treatment. For participants who had stable disease at the end of the run-in period, duration was calculated from documentation of the first assessment of either PR or CR on blinatumomab.

Progression was defined as the first diagnosis of progressive metabolic response/progressive disease based on PET/CT scan per central or investigator review during the treatment period or relapse based on clinical tumor assessment during the long-term follow up period.

Response duration was calculated until the start of new anti-tumor treatment (excluding any stem cell transplantation), PD, or death, whichever was the earliest event. Participants who did not have new anti-tumor treatment (excluding stem cell transplantation), PD, or death were censored at the last tumor assessment date., The median (range) follow-up time was 11.5 (8.2, 14.5) months|Complete Response Rate Expressed as the Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Metabolic Response (CMR) Using Lugano 2014 Criteria During Cycle 1 and During Treatment Period, Tumor response assessment was performed by a central reader according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan.

Participants who are alive at the date that triggers the analysis were censored at the date last known to be alive.

Months were calculated as days from the first dose date of blinatumomab to death/censor date, divided by 30.5., The median (range) follow-up time was 12.0 (10.7, 14.5) months.|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Progression Free Survival (PFS) From First Dose of Blinatumomab, PFS was calculated as the time from the date of first IP infusion until the date of diagnosis of progression of DLBCL or the date of death, whichever was the earliest. The diagnosis of progression of DLBCL was defined as the first diagnosis of progressive metabolic response/progressive disease based on PET/CT scan per central or investigator review during the treatment period or relapse based on clinical tumor assessment during the long-term follow up period. Participants who were alive and did not have progression were censored at the last evaluable non-missing tumor assessment date prior to the analysis trigger date., The median (range) follow-up time was 12.0 (8.2, 14.5)|Percentage of Participants Who Had Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), Percentage of participants who had HSCT during the Long Term Follow-Up Period., Day 1 up to 14.5 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Results for Blinatumomab: Steady-State Concentrations at Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3 for Cycle 1, The steady-state serum concentration (Css), summarized as the observed concentrations collected after at least 10 hours after the start of continuous IV infusion.

PK blood samples were analyzed in a central lab., Day 2 at least 24 hours after blinatumomab was started and on Day 9 and Day 16 at least 24 hours after blinatumomab dose was increased in the cycle|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Results for Blinatumomab: Clearance for Cycle 1, PK blood samples were analyzed in a central lab., Day 2 at least 24 hours after blinatumomab was started and on Day 9 and Day 16 at least 24 hours after blinatumomab dose was increased in the cycle
The safety profile of blinatumomab after frontline rituximab (R)-chemotherapy, consisting of either R-CHOP (14 or 21) (rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) or R-DA-EPOCH (rituximab and dose adjusted-etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin), or R-CHOEP (rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and etoposide), will be determined. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 14 days, a standard of care (SOC) R-chemotherapy run-in period of approximately 21 weeks, a 12 to 16 week blinatumomab treatment period, a 30-day safety follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period that begins after the safety follow-up visit is completed until 1 year from the first dose blinatumomab.
