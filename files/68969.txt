A Phase 2 Study of Mutant-selective PI3Kα Inhibitor, RLY-2608, in Adults and Children With PIK3CA Related Overgrowth Spectrum and Malformations Driven by PIK3CA Mutation
This is a 3-part Phase 2 randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the mutant-selective PI3Kα inhibitor, RLY-2608, in adults and children with PIK3CA Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) and malformations driven by PIK3CA mutation. Part 1 is a dose selection, Part 2 is a basket design with exploratory single-arm cohorts for various subpopulations of participants, and Part 3 is randomized, double-blinded study vs placebo.
PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)|Lymphatic Malformations|Vascular Malformations|PIK3CA Mutation|CLOVES Syndrome|Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome|Megalencephaly-capillary Malformation Polymicrogyria Syndrome (MCAP)
DRUG: RLY-2608|DRUG: Placebo
Parts 1 and 2: Determination of a recommended phase 2 dose RP2D(s) for Groups 1, 2, and 3, Cycle 1 (4-week cycle) of treatment and at the end of every cycle (4-week cycles) until study discontinuation|Parts 1 and 2: Occurrence/frequency of Adverse Events (AEs), changes in vital signs, ECGs, and safety laboratory tests and their relationship to the study drugs (safety and tolerability)., Cycle 1 (4-week cycle) of treatment and at the end of every cycle (4-week cycles) until study discontinuation|Part 3: Percentage of participants with volumetric Response., Baseline, Week 24
Part 1 and 2: Percent change from baseline in lesion volume, Baseline, Week 24|Part 1 and 2: Duration of response, defined as the time of first documented response to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, Approximately every 3 months for approximately the first year, and then every 6 months during treatment|Part 1 and 2: Percentage of participants with volumetric response, Baseline, week 12, week 24|Part 1 and 2: Plasma concentrations and PK parameters of RLY-2608, Approximately every 2 weeks in Cycle 1 (4-week cycle), then again at Cycle 4 and Cycle 7|Part 1 and 2: PIK3CA mutational status in lesional fluid and/or tissue, Prior to enrollment|Part 3: Percentage of participants with improvement compared to baseline based on PGI-S, PGI-C and IGIC, Approximately once a month until end of treatment|Part 3: Change from baseline by age-appropriate PROMIS Profile, Approximately once a month until end of treatment|Part 3: Change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-Y-3L, or EQ-5D-Y-3L Proxy 1, Approximately once a month until end of treatment|Part 3: Percent change from baseline in lesion volume, Approximately every 3 months for approximately the first year, and then every 6 months during treatment
