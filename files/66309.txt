Effect of a Symptom Diary on Symptom Care and Symptom Burden in Patients Treated With Chemotherapy: a Before-and-after-study
This study investigates whether the implementation of a symptom diary for reporting and communicating chemotherapy-related symptoms improves symptom care and decreases symptom burden in adult patients treated with chemotherapy.

The hypothesis is studied using a before-and-after design. First, symptom care and symptom burden will be observed in a sample of patients not being offered a symptom diary. Next, the symptom diary will be implemented at the participating hospital and symptom care and symptom burden will now be observed in a new sample of chemotherapy patients.

symptom distress, for each of 9 symptoms: how distressing was the symptom perceived by the patient? (ordinal variable), T1 (cycle 1, day 1), T2 (cycle 2, day 1), T3 (cycle 3, day 1), T4 (cycle 5, day 1)
symptom severity, for each of 9 symptoms: how severe was the symptom? (ordinal variable), T1 (cycle 1, day 1), T2 (cycle 2, day 1), T3 (cycle 3, day 1), T4 (cycle 5, day 1)
symptom care, binary variable expressing whether the patient has received care (either medication or advice) to help with the symptom, T1 (cycle 1, day 1), T2 (cycle 2, day 1), T3 (cycle 3, day 1)
