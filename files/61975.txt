Bevacizumab as a Palliative Treatment for Patients With Symptomatic Malignant Ascites Due to Advanced-stage Gastrointestinal Cancers
Malignant ascites represents a severe clinical problem for physicians and patients being confronted with this common symptom of advanced-stage gastrointestinal cancer. Unfortunately, there is no standardized and evidence-based treatment for malignant ascites and therapies which are commonly being used are only temporarily effective. Newer modes of therapy, such as the application of the tri-functional antibody catumaxomab, are associated with significant side effects and are limited to patients in stages of good overall performance. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for more effective, longer-lasting, and less toxic modes of treatment for peritoneal effusions caused by gastrointestinal cancers.

Preclinical data strongly suggest that bevacizumab might be a very effective agent for the treatment of malignant ascites, which is in large part caused by the hyperpermeability-promoting factor VEGF. Emerging clinical results from cancer patients with malignant ascites treated with bevacizumab add further support to this idea. Bevacizumab has been tested in a variety of large clinical trials, has a good toxicity profile, and is effective in a number of human cancers underlying malignant ascites.

In the present study, Bevacizumab will be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion at an absolute standardized dosage of 400 mg. This dosage was chosen because it is comparable to the approved standard dosage for intravenous administration which was also used in both studies reporting the successful and safe intraperitoneal administration of Bevacizumab to patients with malignant ascites. Finally, a standardized dosage seems more practical in the particular patient population treated in this study.

paracentesis-free survival (ParFS), The first primary endpoint will consist of paracentesis-free survival (ParFS) which will be calculated as the time period between the initial puncture after randomization to the first subsequent paracentesis or other symptomatic treatments for ascites with the exception of diuretics or until death (whichever occurs first), one year
Best Response (BR), Best Response representing the longest period of time from one paracentesis until next paracentesis within the treatment period or, if longer, from the last paracentesis performed within the treatment period until first subsequent symptomatic treatment for ascites with the exception of diuretics (before end of the standard 4 week follow-up) or, if longer, from the last paracentesis performed within the treatment period until death (before end of the standard 4 week follow-up) or, if longer, from the last paracentesis performed within the treatment period until 4 week follow-up, 12 weeks from 1st application|Volume of ascites, Volume of ascites drained by routine paracentesis (ascites volume minus lavage volumes, if applicable), 12 weeks|Quality of life, Quality of life as assessed by standardized questionnaires, 12 weeks|Changes in ECOG performance status, Calculation: 12 weeks minus baseline, baseline and 12 weeks|Pharmacokinetics of Bevacizumab and VEGF concentrations, 12 weeks|Proportions of patients with adverse events grades 3, 4, or 5., 12 weeks|Proportions of patients with adverse events of special interest, any grade of gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal fistulas or other internal fistulas, wound-healing disturbances, hemorrhagic events and arterial thrombo-embolic events., 12 weeks|All adverse events, 12 weeks|Changes in laboratory values and vital signs., Calculation: Value from later timepoints minus baseline value, baseline, every two weeks up to week 12
