This is a Phase 1b, dose-ascending study to assess the safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of STI-1386 in subjects with relapsed and refractory solid tumors (RRSTs). STI-1386 is a second generation oncolytic virus.

This is a two-stage study, the first stage uses a single ascending dose, followed by the multiple ascending dose stage.
