Study of Arixtra (Fondaparinux Sodium) to Prevent Blood Clots in Women Undergoing Abdominopelvic Surgery for Likely Gynecologic Malignancy
This is a randomized trial to compare intermittent compression devices with or without post-operative Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium) in women undergoing major abdominal surgery for known or presumed gynecologic malignancies. This trial seeks to determine if there is a difference in the rate of deep venous thrombosis between these two groups.
Venous Thrombosis
DRUG: Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium)|DEVICE: Intermittent compression devices (ICD)
Comparison of Deep Venous Thromboembolism (DVT) Using Intermittent Compression Devices With and Without Arixtra, Deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) rates are determined from lower extremity doppler ultrasound measurements., 21 days
Incidence of Untoward Effects With Arixtra, Adverse events will be evaluated to determine untoward effects., 21 days
To assess the effectiveness of Arixtra (fondaparinux sodium) in the prophylaxis of deep venous thromboembolism in gynecologic oncology patients undergoing abdominopelvic surgery.
