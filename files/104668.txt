Photobiomodulation Therapy for the Management of Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema
Up to one out of five patients with breast cancer will develop lymphedema in the upper extremity after cancer treatment. Patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) suffer from pain, heaviness, tightness, and a decreased range of motion. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive therapy based on the application of visible and/or near-infrared light produced by a laser diode or a light-emitting diode. The scientifically proven biologic effects of PBM are improved wound healing, and a reduction in pain, inflammation, and oedema. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBMT on the management of BCRL.

Arm circumference and volume, The arm circumferences will be measured at olecranon and at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 cm proximal and distal of olecranon. The circumference at each point will be recorded in cm.

The calculated arm volume will be estimated by the formula of the truncated cone of each 4 cm segment proximal (towards the wrist) and distal (towards the acromion) from the olecranon. The following truncated cone formula was used: 4 \* (C1\* C1 +C1\*C2+C2\*C2)/12π C1 is the upper circumference and C2 is the lower circumference of each segment. The calculated volume of whole arm is the sum of the volume of all segments of the arm expressed in kubic centimeter, Baseline|Arm circumference and volume, The arm circumferences will be measured at olecranon and at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 cm proximal and distal of olecranon.

This aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of PBMT in combination with the institutional therapy on the management of BCRL. Therefore, we hypothesize that PBMT in combination with manual lymphatic drainage is able to reduce the limb circumference and the associated pain and improve the QoL of patients with BCRL during treatment and up to 12 months post-treatment.

Primary Objective 1: Arm circumference

The study seeks primarily to determine the effectiveness PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage in reducing the arm circumference in patients with established BCRL during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

Primary Objective 2: Activity and participation

Another primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage in the enhancement of the patients' activity and participation status.

Secondary Objective 1: Pain

A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can reduce the BCRL-related pain during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

Secondary Objective 2: Quality of life

A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can improve the patients' QoL during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

Secondary Objective 3: Depression

A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage can improve the patients' mental status during PBM treatment and up to 12 months post-PBMT.

Secondary Objective 4: Patient satisfaction

A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if patients are satisfied with PBMT and manual lymphatic drainage as a treatment for BCRL during the treatment sessions and up to 12 months post-therapy.

Secondary Objective 5: PBM safety

A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of PBM in oncologic patients up to 5 years post-PBMT.
