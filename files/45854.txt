Conventional vs Ultrathin Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions
This study's purpose is to evaluate whether the use of an ultra-thin bronchoscope can improve sensitivity and diagnostic yield in peripheral pulmonary nodules. The ultra-thin probe is expected to reach further bronchi and allow to reach peripheral lesions. Moreover, the ability to identify molecular pattern of lung cancer is essential nowadays, and it will be therefore evaluated.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Lung biopsy
Assess if sensitivity is higher in the "ultrathin" arm than in the "conventional" arm, percentage, through study completion, an average of 6 months
Assess if diagnostic yield is higher in the "ultrathin" arm than in the "conventional" arm, percentage, through study completion, an average of 6 months
Assess if sensitivity is similar in both arms, percentage, through study completion, an average of 6 months
142 patients with at least one peripheral pulmonary nodule will be enrolled. They will underwent randomization in 2 arms: patients in the first arm will undergo transbronchial needle aspiration with a conventional bronchoscope patients in the second arm will undergo transbronchial needle aspiration with a ultra-thin bronchoscope. Every bronchoscopy will be performed by the same operator and will contemplate 3 passes for each nodule, followed by Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) assessed by a dedicated cytologist. If the cytological on-site evaluation is negative in patients in the first arm, they will be shifted to the second arm. Histological and molecular diagnosis will be assessed by a dedicated pathologist. Data will be collected and analyzed.
