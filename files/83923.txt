Target Volume Delineation After NACT in LA-NPCarcinoma Patients Treated With NACT+ CCRT
The gross tumor volumes of the primary site and the neck nodes (GTVnx and GTVnd) could be delineated according to the post-NACT tumor position and receive radical radiation dose, while the tumor disappear after NACT could be encompassed in the first clinical target volume (CTV1) and receive high preventive radiation dose. Through this method,it is more likely to achieve the ultimate goal that maximize the chance of cure while minimize the injury of surrounding normal tissues, maintaining organ function and life quality. Therefore, this stage II clinical trial was designed to study the prognosis and locoregional failure patterns of this target volume delineation method in LA-NPC treated with NACT plus CCRT.
