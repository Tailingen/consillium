Overcoming Therapy Resistance in ER+ Breast Cancer Patients: a Translational Project (OVERTuRE)
Patients presenting with a de novo diagnosis of luminal-like advanced breast cancer (ABC) or with disease recurrence after \>12 months from the end of adjuvant ET, are generally candidate to a first line therapy with an aromatase inhibitor in association with a CDK4/6i. Disease recurrence in \<12 months from the end of adjuvant ET defines the disease as "endocrine resistant" and identifies patients that should receive a first line therapy with the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) Fulvestrant in association with the CDK4/6i Ribociclib, according to the results of the MONALEESA-3 trial.

A significant percentage of ABC patients develops a primary resistance with disease progression within the first 6 months from the beginning of the treatment. Furthermore, another relevant percentage of patients initially responding to the therapy, will later develop a secondary resistance, thus progressing after a median of 2 years from the beginning of the treatment. Thereby, it is crucial to identify biomarkers that could be predictive of a response or a resistance to ET and/or CDK4/6i, to provide the best therapeutic strategy, tailored upon both clinico-pathological and molecular characteristics.

Numerous pathways associated with resistance to CDK4/6i have been investigated by means of liquid biopsy analysis. The aim of this study is to identify potential biomarkers predictive of a clinical benefit in patients receiving a first line therapy with AI/fulvestrant (+/- LH-RH analogue) in association with a CDK4/6i for luminal-like advanced breast cancer.

To identify potential biomarkers predictive of a clinical benefit in patients receiving a first line therapy with AI/fulvestrant (+/- LH-RH analogue) in association with a CDK4/6i for luminal-like ABC., Mean difference in mean VAF in most frequently mutated gene found at baseline, with respect to first evaluation after 15 days between responders (CR-PR-SD, Complete Response - Partial Response - Stable Disease) and non-responders (PD, Progressive Disease), up to 3 years|To identify potential biomarkers predictive of a clinical benefit in patients receiving a first line therapy with AI/fulvestrant (+/- LH-RH analogue) in association with a CDK4/6i for luminal-like ABC., Mean difference in mean VAF in most frequently mutated gene found at baseline, with respect to 6 months evaluation between responders (CR-PR-SD, Complete Response - Partial Response - Stable Disease) and non-responders (PD, Progressive Disease), up to 3 years
To explore the impact of ctDNA-based biomarkers in terms of treatment resistance, Differences in time-to-progression (TTP) probability between patients with or without selected ctDNA-based biomarkers. TTP will be defined as the time from first biomarker assessment until objective PD or end of follow-up, whichever comes first., from first biomarker assessment until objective PD or end of follow-up, up to 3 years|To explore the impact of ctDNA-based biomarkers in terms of survival, Differences in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients with or without selected ctDNA-based biomarkers. PFS will be defined as time from beginning of the therapy until objective PD, death or end of follow-up, whichever comes first., from beginning of the therapy until objective PD, death or end of follow-up, up to 3 years|To explore the impact of ctDNA-based biomarkers in terms of survival, Differences in Overall survival (OS) between patients with or without selected ctDNA-based biomarkers. OS will be defined as time from beginning of the therapy until death from any cause or end of follow-up, whichever comes first., from beginning of the therapy until death from any cause or end of follow-up, up to 3 years|Mean difference in mean VAF in most frequently mutated gene found at baseline, between baseline and progression in non-responders (PD, Progressive Disease), Mean difference in mean VAF in most frequently mutated gene found at baseline, between baseline and progression in non-responders (PD, Progressive Disease), up to 3 years
Patients presenting with a de novo diagnosis of luminal-like advanced breast cancer (ABC) or with disease recurrence after \>12 months from the end of adjuvant ET, are generally candidate to a first line therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (+/- LH-RH analogue depending from the menopausal status) in association with a CDK4/6i. Disease recurrence in \<12 months from the end of adjuvant ET defines the disease as "endocrine resistant" and identifies patients that should receive a first line therapy with the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) Fulvestrant in association with the CDK4/6i Ribociclib, according to the results of the MONALEESA-3 trial.

The choice of the endocrine backbone and of the CDK4/6i is mostly influenced by the patient's clinical characteristics and by disease factors.

However, a significant percentage of ABC patients develops a primary resistance with disease progression within the first 6 months from the beginning of the treatment. Furthermore, another relevant percentage of patients initially responding to the therapy, will later develop a secondary resistance, thus progressing after a median of 2 years from the beginning of the treatment.
