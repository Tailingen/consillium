The Effect of Rituximab on Mobilization With AMD3100 (Plerixafor) Plus G-CSF in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin Disease (HD)
Participants with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin disease (HD) will be assigned to one of 2 arms based on the immunophenotype of their lymphoma.

(A)Participants with CD20(-) lymphoma will undergo mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor.

(B) Participants with CD20(+) lymphomas will undergo mobilization with rituximab, G-CSF, and plerixafor. They will receive a weekly dose of rituximab beginning 1 week prior to, and continuing until 2 weeks after, the first dose of G-CSF.

Participants in both groups will receive G-CSF twice daily for 4 days. In the evening on Day 4, a dose of plerixafor will be administered. Apheresis will be initiated the next morning. Participants will continue to receive G-CSF twice daily and to receive the evening dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis the next morning for up to a total of 4 aphereses or until ≥5\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected.

Participants who are transplanted will be monitored for the time to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), platelets (PLT), and lymphocyte engraftment. Follow-up assessments will be done at 100 days, and 6 and 12 months post-transplantation.

Summary of Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) collected from Day 1 (start of G-CSF mobilization in participants with CD20- lymphoma or start of rituximab in participants with CD20+ lymphoma) to the day before starting chemotherapy. AEs were graded by the investigator using the World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Event Grading Scale and were assessed for seriousness and relatedness to study treatment., Day 1 and up to Day 59 (maximum time before start of chemotherapy)

This is a single-center, 2-arm, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety of plerixafor when used in combination with rituximab (Rituxan®) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Participants will be assigned to one of 2 arms based on the immunophenotype of their lymphoma.

(A)Participants with CD20(-) lymphoma will undergo mobilization with G-CSF and plerixafor.

(B) Participants with CD20(+) lymphomas will undergo mobilization with rituximab, G-CSF, and plerixafor. They will receive a weekly dose of 375 mg/m2 rituximab by intravenous (iv) infusion beginning 1 week prior to, and continuing until 2 weeks after, the first dose of G-CSF.

Participants in both groups will receive 7.5 µg/kg G-CSF twice daily (morning and evening) for 4 days. In the evening (approximately 10:00 pm) on Day 4, a dose of plerixafor (240 µg/kg) will be administered. Apheresis will be initiated the next morning, approximately 10 to 11 hours after plerixafor is given. Participants will continue to receive G-CSF twice daily and to receive the evening dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis the next morning for up to a total of 4 aphereses or until ≥5\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected.

Participants with an adequate number of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) collected by apheresis will be admitted to the study center for the administration of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation. After transplantation, the times to PMN, PLT, and lymphocyte engraftment will be measured. Participants will remain hospitalized until they achieve an absolute granulocyte count of \>500/µl in the peripheral blood. Graft durability will be assessed at 100 days, and 6 and 12 months post-transplantation.
