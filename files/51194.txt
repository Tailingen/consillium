Eylea to Treat Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED) Secondary to Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD)
Primary Objectives:

To assess the efficacy of intravitreal administered Eylea in preventing visual loss in subjects with a retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED) subtype of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) measured by mean change in BCVA at Month 12 compared to Baseline.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea in subjects with the PED subtype of neovascular AMD for a period of 1 year
2. To assess the effect of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea on Central Subfield Thickness (CSFT), Central Subfield Volume (CSFV), and PED height and volume.
3. To assess the effect of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea on vision related quality of life in subjects with PED study type of neovascular AMD assessed using the NEI/VFQ-25 questionnaire
