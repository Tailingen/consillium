Intrathecal Pemetrexed Combined With High-dose Furmonertinib and Beva for EGFR-m NSCLC With Leptomeningeal Metastases
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal pemetrexed with high-dose Furmonertinib plus bevacizumab for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastases after resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs.

LM-overall survival, LM-OS was defined as the duration from the start of intrathecal pemetrexed to patient death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to last follow up
Extracranial progression-free survival, Extracranial Progression-Free survival was defined as the duration from the start of intrathecal pemetrexed to the progression of extracranial disease or patient death or last follow up, Time from first dose to the progression of extracranial disease or patient death or last follow up|Clinical response rate, Clinical Response Rate was defined as the ratio of the patient whose neurological symptoms and KPS improved according to the criteria of clinical response, Time from first dose to the improvement of neurological symptoms and KPS score|Adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, From first dose until 28 days after the last dose, up to 24 month
This prospective interventional study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal pemetrexed with high-dose Furmonertinib plus bevacizumab for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with leptomeningeal metastases after resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs.

Approximately 30 EGFR-mutant Non-small cell lung cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis or leptomeningeal progression after resistant to third generation EGFR-TKIs were enrolled and treated with intrathecal pemetrexed with high-dose furmonertinib plus bevacizumab. cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples will be collected before and after pemetrexed resistance to analyze molecular mechanisms. Second-generation gene detection will be performed to identify potential resistance mechanisms to pemetrexed. The study is expected to commence recruitment in mainland China in about August 2024. It is expected that the trial will end in April 2026.
