Caries Cognition and Identification in Adults
This study will evaluate the effect of the International Dental Federation (FDI) criteria, compared to CARS (Caries Associated with Restorations or Sealants) detection criteria for evaluation of caries lesions around restorations in permanent teeth, in the outcomes related to oral health of adults, in a randomized clinical trial.
Secondary Caries
PROCEDURE: Dental treatment|PROCEDURE: Dental treatment
Change from baseline in number of surfaces restored requiring new intervention, The primary endpoint will be the number of surfaces restored requiring intervention, which is composed of the sum of components with different levels of severity: number of surfaces with new caries lesions, number of surfaces restored in need of repair, replacement, teeth with episodes of pain, teeth requiring endodontic treatment or extraction., 12 months, 24 months
Impact of intervention on quality of life measured by a validated questionnaire - OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile-14), 12 months, 24 months|Cost-effectiveness measured by a scale, Effectiveness will be measured through the number of restored surfaces without intervention. The cost-effectiveness ratio will be expressed by the cost ratio of the FDI and CARS criteria and effectiveness (number of surfaces without the need for new interventions), 12 months, 24 months
The study will consist of a randomised controlled trial of two parallel groups. One group will correspond to adults who will receive the diagnosis and indication of treatment according to the standard criteria, following the FDI criteria to classify the restorations marginal conditions and the presence of secondary caries (traditional group). And the other group will receive a diagnosis and treatment decision according to a minimal intervention approach, using as reference the detection criteria "Caries Associated with Restorations or Sealants" (CARS) - ICCMS (International Caries Classification and Management System) - conservative group). Patient evaluations will be performed yearly after 12 months. The primary outcome will be the number of surfaces restored with the need for new interventions. Secondary outcomes will be the impact of oral health on quality of life and cost-effectiveness.
