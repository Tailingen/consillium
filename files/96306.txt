Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide. Treatments on HER2 negative breast cancer are still under exploration. Therefore, it is imperative to find a novel therapy to treat these patients.

Anlotinib is an anti-angiogenic small-molecule butyrate kinase inhibitor, and preliminary phase II study results show that anlotinib has good efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of HER-2-negative advanced breast cancer.

This study is a prospective, multicenter, observational clinical study that will collect and report anlotinib in combination with anlotinib in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in a real-world clinical setting Efficacy and safety data for chemotherapy treatments.
