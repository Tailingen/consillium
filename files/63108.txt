Systems Oncology Approach to Optimize Ovarian Cancer Treatment
The overall aim is to identify effective therapeutic strategies to ovarian cancer (OC) using serial tumor, ascites and blood samples, and carry out state-of-the-art sequencing approaches, functional assays and associated bioinformatics to understand mechanisms behind chemoresistance in OC and identify new treatment options for OC patients. In this observational trial, we will systematically collect, analyze and interpret functional, molecular and clinical data from real-world ovarian cancer patients.
Ovarian Cancer
GENETIC: Biomolecular profiling
Recruitment and collection of real-world clinical data from ovarian cancer patients, Prospective recruitment and collection of clinical data from 500 ovarian cancer patients. Fraction of patients from which the collection of clinical data including patient age, tumor stage, histological diagnoses have been collected., 5 years|Successful collection and translational analysis of biospecimens, Fraction of the recruited patients, from which tumor, ascites, and/or peripheral blood samples that have been successfully collected and subjected to molecular profiling., 5 years
Discovery of candidate prognostic and predictive biomarkers, Number of clinical and/or molecular features which of statistically significantly correlate to patient treatment outcomes (response to chemotherapy by RECIST1.1, Progression Free survival, Overall Survival)., 5 years
