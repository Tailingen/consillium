68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer
This is a single-center, multi-arm, open-label, phase III trial in up to 500 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer.

Participants will receive regular standard of clinical care. The only study-specific procedures will the administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11 followed by a PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) scan. Participants will be followed for two hours after the infusion for identification of any immediate adverse events (AE), and will be contacted by telephone after 7 to 14 days to enquire about any delayed AEs.

PET/CT images, CT-alone images and bone scans will be read by separate readers who will not be blinded to all other clinical and imaging information. The standard of truth will be a consensus of the readers based on all available clinical, imaging, and histopathological information available for up to 6 months after the PET/CT scan.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT
Sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT compared to that of CT alone and bone scan in two different cohorts of prostrate cancer patients., PET/CT images, CT-alone images and bone scans will be read by separate readers who will not be blinded to all other clinical and imaging information. A target lesion list will be created, finalized and entered into the research study file. Reviewer will assign each patient an overall likelihood of prostate cancer score, equal to the highest score of any target lesion on the PET/CT scan. Following the entry of final PET/CT, CT-only and bone scan target lesion lists and overall likelihood scores into the study file, all the experienced readers will become un-blinded and adjudicate by consensus in conjunction with referring physicians all lesions identified by each on their respective datasets and will assign a final consensus to each lesion. Each target lesion identified by each reader will be followed clinically, radiologically and histopathologically over a minimum period of 6 months and the final consensus can be modified based on this follow-up., 6 months
The secondary endpoint is the number of adverse events, both immediate and delayed., Immediate and delayed adverse events will be captured for every patient and will be analysed at the end of study., baseline (i.e. Imaging visit) and at the end of study visit (day 7 to day 14)
