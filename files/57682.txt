Phase I/II Trial to Investigate BI 836858 in Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Phase I: To investigate maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, exploratory biomarker and efficacy of BI 836858 monotherapy in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with symptomatic anemia. Phase II: To investigate safety and efficacy of BI 836858 plus Best Supportive Care compared to Best Supportive Care alone in low or intermediate-1 risk MDS patients with symptomatic anemia.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
PROCEDURE: Best Supportive Care|DRUG: BI 836858
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase I), The MTD is defined as the highest dose of BI 836858 with less than 25% risk of the true dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate being above 33% during the MTD evaluation period. MTD determination will be based on a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control.

For any dose-escalation cohort, at least 3 patients (pts) will be required. However, in the case that only 2 pts are evaluable and neither has experienced a DLT within the first cycle (2 administrations - 28 days), then dose-escalation can occur based on these 2 pts. After all pts in a cohort have either experienced a DLT or have been observed for at least one cycle (2 administrations - 28 days) without experiencing a DLT, the Bayesian model will be updated with the newly accumulated data.

The MTD may be considered reached if either the posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval (16%-33%) is above 50%, or at least 12 pts have been treated at MTD, including the two expansion cohorts., From the first administration of BI 836858 to start of the third administration of BI 836858, excluding the day of the third administration of BI 836858, up to 28 days|Number of Patients With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) (Phase I), Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT):

* Grade (G) ≥ 3 (CTCAE 4.0), non disease-related, non-hematologic adverse events (AE), except:

  * Neutrophils (NP) \<500 /microliters (μL) at T start, febrile neutropenia with NP \<500 /μL or infection with NP \<500 /μL will not constitute a DLT if they can be recovered with appropriate T within 14 d
* Inability to deliver study drug full dose according to the assigned dose level within cycle 1 due to drug-related AEs
* Absence of hematological recovery as following:

  * NPs: G 4 (if G 0/1 at baseline (BL)) OR \<100 /μL and decrease of \>75% from BL (if G ≥2 at BL) for \>7 d
