Disitamab Vedotin Combined With Tislelizumab for Her2 Overexpressing High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma Which is Not Completely Resectable
This is a phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of Disitamab Vedotin when given in combination with Tislelizumab as treatment for patients with Her2 overexpressing high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR NMIBC) which is not completely resectable. Patients will receive treatment with Disitamab Vedotin in combination with tislelizumab every 3 weeks for 4 treatment cycles over 12 weeks followed by transurethral resection biopsy.
