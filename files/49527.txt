Peritoneum and Anterior Rectus Sheath Suturing and Ileostomy
In the era of laparoscopy, ileostomy via specimen extraction site has been proposed as a novel approach for temporary ostomy creation to prevent anastomotic leak after laparoscopic low anterior rectal resection. Whether suturing the layer of the peritoneum and anterior rectus sheath affects the safety of this novel approach has not been investigated.
Ileostomy - Stoma|Rectal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Ileostomy with a support rod instead of the layer of peritoneum and anterior rectus sheath suturing|PROCEDURE: Ileostomy with the layer of the peritoneum and anterior rectus sheath suturing
