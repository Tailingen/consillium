Safety and Efficacy Study of Antiviral Local Application to Treat High Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Lesions (CIN2/3)
The purpose of this phase-II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an aqueous gel containing an antiviral, administered directly on cervix exhibiting high grade squamous or glandular intraepithelial lesion (CIN 2 and 3) in comparison with a placebo treatment.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasia|Cervix Intraepithelial Neoplasia
DRUG: C1
Efficacy at week 12: change of histological and cytological parameters (success or not), Efficacy will be measured by histological and cytological criteria at week 12 (disappearance of CIN 2+) in correlation with viral status (positive or negative) before and after treatment., 12 weeks|Efficacy at week 28: recurrence rate, The recurrence rate will be assessed at week 28, by the same histological and cytological criteria in correlation with the viral status (positive or negative) before and after treatment., 28 weeks|Tolerance and Safety (AE reporting, changes of gynecological and biological parameters), Safety will be measured by record of adverse events, changes in clinical biology test results; local tolerance will be measured by patient questioning and gynecological examination of vagina and cervix., during 30 weeks
Virological status (infection), The viral load and genotypes of HPVhr will be determined before treatment, during follow-up and at the end of the study, by using a quantitative analysis., during 30 weeks|Changes in lesion (colposcopic changes), Colposcopic description of lesion will be done before, during and after treatment of the lesion, during follow up and at the end of the study., during 30 weeks
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infections induce cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of cervix. To reduce incidence of invasive tumor associated with high grade CIN lesions, the standard treatment is the conisation of cervix (surgical act). A local treatment with antiviral would preserve the cervix of young subjects and reduce obstetrical morbidity induced by the conisation.

This clinical study is aimed at:

* to evaluate the efficacy of a gel with antiviral directly applied on the cervix exhibiting high grade CIN lesions (CIN2/3): conisation is still indicated?
* to evaluate the safety and tolerance after local application.
