A Study of TSR-022 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (AMBER)
This is a first-in-human study evaluating the anti-T cell immunoglobulin and mucin containing protein-3 (TIM-3) antibody TSR-022. The study will be conducted in 2 parts with Part 1 consisting of dose escalation and Part 2 dose expansion. Part 1 will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TSR-022 and Part 2 will evaluate the antitumor activity of TSR-022 in combination with TSR-042 or docetaxel and as monotherapy.
