Assess Vitamin D Levels in Those With & Without Thyroid Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate Vitamin D levels in thyroid cancer patients with active disease compared with thyroid cancer patients in remission and patients with thyroid nodules.
Thyroid Cancer
Number of Persons That Are Vitamin D Deficient in the Thyroid Nodule, Thyroid Cancer in Remission, and the Active Thyroid Cancer Groups., We evaluated serum calcium,creatinine,albumin,and 25-hydroxyvitaminD(25-OH-D)in 42 thyroid nodule, 45 thyroid cancer in remission, \& 24 active thyroid cancer patients. We also determined the number and percent of participants in each group that had vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25-OH-D \< 30 ng/ml., Within 12 months of enrollment in thyroid cancer collaborative registry (TCCR) database
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine related malignancy, increasing in incidence in recent years. There are relatively few, well known factors, both genetic and environmental, which predispose to the development of thyroid cancer. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with other cancers, but the association between vitamin D and thyroid cancer is unknown. We plan to do a case control, pilot study to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer in remission, and active thyroid cancer.
