Dose-Escalation Study Of SB-485232 Administered As Daily Subcutaneous Injections In Adults With Solid Tumors
This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of SB-485232. Subjects will receive SB-485232 administered as subcutaneous injections daily for 14 days. Dose escalation (enrollment into the next cohort) cannot occur until all three subjects have completed the previous cohort; 5 doses will be tested. An additional dosing regimen has been added to evaluate higher doses given twice weekly for 7 weeks. Therefore, the full evaluation period for each patient will extend out to approximately eleven weeks after the first day of SB-485232 dosing.
