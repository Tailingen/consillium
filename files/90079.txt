A Phase I Study of Oral Ixabepilone in Subjects With Advanced Cancer
This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral ixabepilone administered for 5 successive days every 21 days in participants with advanced cancer. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone in the body will be studied. In addition, this study will assess preliminary evidence of the effect of food and famotidine on the pharmacokinetics of oral ixabepilone.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Ixabepilone, MTD is based on Cycle 1 data only and defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants with no more than 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (or fewer than one third of participants if more than 6 receive treatment) with at least 2 participants experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level. DLT=an event, such as neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; Gr 3 or 4 nausea or diarrhea; Gr 3 fatigue or asthenia; transient arthralgia or recalcitrant myalgia; and prolonged recovery from a toxicity, that occurs during the first course of treatment., Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1)|Number of Participants With DLTs by Worst Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade, Adverse events (AEs) graded by CTC version 3. Grade (Gr) 1=mild; Gr 2=moderate; Gr 3=severe; Gr 4=life threatening; Gr 5=Death related to AE. DLT is defined as an event related to ixabepilone that occurs during the first course of treatment. Includes neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; Gr 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despite adequate medical intervention and prophylaxis; Gr 3 fatigue or asthenia; transient arthralgia or myalgia unresponsive to medical intervention; any Gr 3 nonhematologic toxicity; and prolonged recovery from a toxicity., Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1), continuously
