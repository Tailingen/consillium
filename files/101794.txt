Everolimus in Castrated Resistant Prostate Cancer(CRPC)Patients With PI3K-AKT-mTOR Signaling Pathway Deficiency
Investigators seek a new therapeutic strategy for castrated resistant prostate cancer(CRPC) patients with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway deficiency by next generation sequencing(NGS).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Placebo
PFS, Progression free survival of All the Evaluable Participants.Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0).(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., 36 months|OS, Overall Survival of the Participants, 36months
ORR, Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response(CR) or partial response(PR)., 36 months|DCR, Disease control is defined as the proportion of patients who had a best response rating of complete response, partial response, or stable disease, and lasted at least 4 weeks., 36 months
The prognosis of castrated resistant prostate cancer(CRPC) is very poor.Now,there is not an ideal therapeutic strategy.Further clarifying its mechanism and finding more effective therapeutic targets on this basis are the clinical problems to be solved urgently. More and more studies have confirmed that the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in the development of castration resistance to prostate cancer.By next generation sequencing of 115 patients with CRPC, investigators found that 22% of the patients had mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling related genes.Investigators found that 50% of the patients could benefit from the mTOR inhibitors.But the specific clinical significance and molecular mechanism are urgently needed to be elucidated. This project is based on the hypothesis that Everolimus can target CRPC patients with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways deficiency.So,investigators intend to peform a prospective, randomized, controlled,multicenter clinical study to find potential therapeutic targets and treatment strategies for CRPC patients.
