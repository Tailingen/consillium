WI231696: Bosutinib, Palbocicilib and Fulvestrant for HR+HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer Refractory to a CDK4/6 Inhibitor
This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I trial. It is designed with a conservative dose escalation plan to ensure patient's safety and with a strong translational component to inform if target inhibition is achieved. With concerns regarding safety, based on extensive available pharmacokinetic data and clinical efficacy experience, bosutinib will be given 5-days in a row followed by 2 days rest in a weekly basis, instead of daily.

The protocol will enroll patients per 3+3 escalation design. The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) observation period is 28 days. At the end of DLT observation period of each cohort of 3 patients, decision will be made regarding further escalation or de-escalation according to this plan. Once the MTD of the combination is reached, the safety data will be analyzed. There will be no dose reductions during DLT observation period. Dose reduction within patients (individually) is allowed after the 4-week DLT observation period. Treatment in this phase I trial will be administered until there is disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Toxicity of bosutinib when used in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with advanced HR+MBC who are refractory to AI and CDK4/6 inhibitors, Toxicity of adverse events will be measured via the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.03), 1 year|Incidence of adverse events of bosutinib when used in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with advanced HR+MBC who are refractory to AI and CDK4/6 inhibitors, Incidence of adverse events will be measured via the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.03), 1 year|Grade of adverse events of bosutinib when used in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with advanced HR+MBC who are refractory to AI and CDK4/6 inhibitors, Grade of adverse events will be measured via the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.03), 1 year|Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTD) of palbociclib and bosutinib when used in combination with fulvestrant in patients with advanced HR+MBC who are refractory to AI and CDK4/6 inhibitors, This is a 3+3 escalation phase I study. Three patients will be enrolled at each dose cohort and an evaluation of dose escalation will take place after 3 patients have completed 28 days of therapy. If none of the 3 patients has a dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will be treated at the next dose level as per the dose escalation schema. At each dose level, if one patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more patients experience dose-limiting toxicity in a single cohort (either 2/3 patients, or 2/6 patients in an expanded cohort), the MTD will have been exceeded and dose escalation will stop., 28 days of therapy|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of palbociclib and bosutinib when used in combination with fulvestrant in patients with advanced HR+MBC who are refractory to AI and CDK4/6 inhibitors, Once the MTD of the combination is reached, the safety data will be analyzed. Dose reduction within patients (individually) is allowed after the 4-week DLT observation period. This phase I trial will inform the RP2D (recommended phase 2 doses of the drugs on the combination)., 1 year
