Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Topotecan and Pazopanib in Children With Recurrent/Refractory Solid Tumours
This is a phase I, dose escalation study where topotecan will be administered at lower doses given more frequently on a prolonged schedule (low dose metronomic; LDM), in combination with pazopanib administered in a specific dose range. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be evaluated for LDM topotecan in combination with pazopanib in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumours. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies will be conducted to further define the exposure to and activity of LDM topotecan in combination with pazopanib.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Topotecan and Pazopanib
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of low dose metronomic (LDM)Topotecan, MTD is dependent on the number of subjects who experience a DLT at a given dose level, Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be identified during the first cycle of therapy (28 days)|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LDM Topotecan, The RP2D will be defined as the highest dose, at or below the MTD, at which the median number of cycles tolerated by subjects is â‰¥ 3., Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be identified during the first cycle of therapy (28 days)
Anti-tumour activity of LDM Topotecan in combination with Pazopanib, To preliminarily define the anti-tumour activity of LDM Topotecan in combination with pazopanib in pediatric solid tumours within the confines of a phase 1 study, and more specifically in cohorts of children with i) neuroblastoma and ii) rhabdomyosarcoma, 24 months|Pharmacokinetics of LDM Topotecan and Pazopanib, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of LDM Topotecan and Pazopanib, as well as any drug-drug interactions, 24 months|Anti-angiogenic activity of LDM Topotecan and Pazopanib, To assess the anti-angiogenic activity of this regimen by evaluating changes in plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAF)., 24 months
