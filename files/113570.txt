Personalized Dendritic Cell Vaccine Pilot for High Risk TNBC After Neoadjuvant Therapy
This is a pilot protocol to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of a personalized breast cancer vaccine based utilizing whole exome sequencing data of a patient's residual breast tumor following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis|BIOLOGICAL: Dendritic Cell (DC) Vaccine
Percentage of patients enrolled who successfully undergo at least one vaccination., Successful production and administration of DC1 priming vaccination sequence in greater than 60% of patients enrolled., Up to 3 Years
Number of participants who achieve Immunogenicity after administration of vaccine, Immunogenicity will be determined by ELISpot and reactive T-Cell Receptor (TCR) expansion.

ELISPot is an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. It is a highly sensitive immunoassay that measures the frequency of cytokine-secreting cells at the single-cell level., Up to 3 Years|Disease Free Survival (DFS), Disease Free Survival will be measured as the length of time after treatment to cancer recurrence or death from any cause., Up to 3 Years
This is a pilot protocol to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of a personalized breast cancer vaccine based utilizing whole exome sequencing data of a patient's residual breast tumor following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
