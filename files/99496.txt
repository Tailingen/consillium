CLL11: A Study of Obinutuzumab (RO5072759 [GA101]) With Chlorambucil in Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Stage 2)
This open-label, randomized, 3-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of (obinutuzumab) RO5072759 in combination with chlorambucil as compared to rituximab plus chlorambucil or chlorambucil alone in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients will be randomized 2:2:1 to receive a maximum of six 28-day cycles of either RO5072759 (1000 mg intravenous (iv) infusion, on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2-6) plus chlorambucil (0.5 mg/kg orally, days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-6), or rituximab (iv infusion day 1, 375 mg/m\^2 cycle 1, 500 mg/m\^2 cycles 2-6) plus chlorambucil, or chlorambucil alone. Anticipated time on study treatment is \>6 months and follow-up for disease-progression and safety will be at least 5 years. In the US, this trial is sponsored/managed by Genentech.

Final scores are transformed such that they range from 0 - 100, whereby higher scores indicate greater functioning, greater quality of life, or a greater degree of symptoms, with changes of 5 - 10 points considered to be of minimally important difference to participants.
