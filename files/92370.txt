Study of First-line Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Advanced Melanoma in the United Kingdom
The purpose of this study is to describe the first-line therapy landscape for patients with advanced melanoma and to describe clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization in a subset of treatment-naïve patients who initiated nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy.
