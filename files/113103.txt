SWITCH Clinical Trial for Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Have Failed an Initial TNF-blocking Drug.
The principal aim of this study is to fill a clear knowledge gap and provide guidance for rheumatologists and reassurance to the patient group on a management challenge faced daily in rheumatology practice. Specifically, it aims to provide robust evidence on the optimal management of patients with established RA that have failed an anti-TNF therapy (the first of the biological therapies to be introduced); in particular, the investigators wish to address whether the currently licensed but non NICE-approved treatment options, TNF-blocking drug or abatacept, are equivalent to the NICE-approved treatment, rituximab. If so, the intention is to broaden treatment options and target these specific therapies to disease sub-groups.
