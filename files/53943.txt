The Prospective Clinical Study of Precision PRaG Therapy in Elderly Patients With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors (PRaG9.0)
This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II investigator-initiated trial of hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with PD-L1 inhibitor sequential GM-CSF and thymopentin for treatment of elderly patients with advanced solid tumors, when the HER-2 positive patients are treated with extra antibody-drug conjugate.
