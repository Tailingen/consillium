Cancer Genome Study Using Samples From Patients Treated on Clinical Trial SHR1020-SHR-1210-II-OS
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with advanced osteosarcoma refractory to chemotherapy in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to osteosarcma treatment combining anti-angiogenesis tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-PD-1 antibody.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the cancer genome using tumor samples from patients with advanced stage osteosarcoma treated on clinical trial SHR1020-SHR-1210-II-OS.

OBJECTIVES:

To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on clinically annotated high-quality tumor specimens from patients with advanced stage osteosarcoma.

OUTLINE: This is a single-center study.

Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical site and analyzed by transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation. Clinical information associated with each specimen donor is also collected.
