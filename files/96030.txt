Total Neoadjuvant 6 Cycles of Chemotherapy Versus 3 Cycles in Partial Responder Patients Diagnosed With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage III and IV ovarian cancer is given in 3-4 cycles with patients who R0 surgical resection is less likely to occur, in this study will assess total neoadjuvant chemotherapy 6 cycles then interval debulking surgery (experimental arm) versus 4 cycles then interval debulking surgery (control arm) in patients who achieve partial response or stationary disease by imaging after 3- 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, investigators'' primary end points will be event free survival, safety and tolerability and time to relapse, our secondary end points will be overall survival and surgical morbidity and mortality
Stage III and IV Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin)
event free survival, the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient remains free of certain complications or events that the treatment was intended to prevent or delay.

it will be measured after 24 months, 36 months and 50 months from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, it will be measured after 24 months, 36 months and 50 months from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery
