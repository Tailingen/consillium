Optimal Initiation of Helicobacter Pylori Eradication After Endoscopic Resection for Gastric Neoplasm
After endoscopic resection (ER) of gastric tumors, eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is advised to reduce metachronous recurrence. However, few studies have addressed factors influencing H. pylori eradication rates in the aftermath of ER, and none have focused on the optimal timing of therapy to eradicate H. pylori post-ER.Therefore, the investigators will conduct to evaluate whether differences in timing of eradication therapy after ER of gastric tumors.
H.Pylori Eradication Rate
OTHER: eradication timing
H. pylori eradication rate according to timing of therapeutic regimen after endoscopic resection, The success of H. pylori eradication was determined using a urea breath test conducted, The success of H. pylori eradication was determined using a urea breath test conducted 13 weeks Â± 5 days after ESD
Uur previous retrospective study unveiled that administering eradication treatment within 2 weeks post-ESD during the active reparative phase of ESD-induced ulcers yielded a markedly higher success rate compared to treatment post-8 weeks during the scarring phase of ESD-induced ulcers.Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, prospective study to ascertain whether the optimal timing of eradication post-ESD could influence the eradication success rate.
