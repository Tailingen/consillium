Phase 2 Trial of Neoadjuvant Weekly Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Nonrandomized, open label, single arm, Simon's two stage MinMax design trial of neoadjuvant weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel, followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in patients with operable Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, Defined as the absence of residual invasive carcinoma in the resected breast specimen and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (i.e., ypT0/Tis, ypN0 per the American joint Committee on Cancer staging system) in all subjects completing at least 1 cycle of study treatment (modified intent-to-treat population), 30 months
Pathologic complete response rate in subjects completing protocol therapy., Pathologic complete response rate Defined as the absence of residual invasive carcinoma in the resected breast specimen and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (i.e., ypT0/Tis, ypN0 per the American joint Committee on Cancer staging system) will be determined in the sub-group of subjects completing at least 75% of planned treatment cycles., 30 months|Residual Cancer Burden, The Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) class will be estimated from routine pathologic sections of the resected primary breast tumor and the regional lymph nodes after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. RCB class 0 represents pCR, and class I represents minimal residual invasive disease. Class II and III represent significant residual disease. We will report the rate of achieving RCB class 0/1 vs. II/III., 30 months|Event-free survival (EFS), Time from enrollment to any of the following: failure to undergo potentially curative surgery; onset of local, regional, or distant invasive recurrence of breast cancer following curative surgery; second primary invasive cancer in the breast or in another organ; or death from any cause., 30 months|Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), Time from enrollment to any of the following: development of invasive cancer in the ipsilateral breast or regional nodes, contralateral breast or regional nodes, distant metastases, or death from any cause, 30 months|Distant disease-free survival (DDFS), Time from enrollment to documentation of distant metastases or death from any cause, 30 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from enrollment to death from any cause, 30 months|Clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Defined as progressive disease, stable disease, partial response and complete response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria in the modified intent-to-treat population and participants completing at least 75% of protocol therapy, 30 months|Breast conservation rate, The percentage of women undergoing adequate partial mastectomy as determined by treating physicians and achieving negative pathological surgical margins (no ink on tumor)., 30 months|Treatment tolerability, Number of cycles delayed, deleted or requiring dose reduction; number of participants who fail to complete all planned courses of protocol therapy; number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 30 months|Quality of life Measurement, Change in score on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 quality of life survey. This 30-item survey uses a Likert scale with total scores ranging from 30-126, with increasing scores indicating worse quality of life. We will compare mean baseline scores to scores at the end of protocol therapy, and 3 and 12 months after completing all protocol therapy., 30 months
This is a single arm, Phase 2, open label, Simon's two stage MinMax design trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of weekly carboplatin in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in subjects with previously untreated triple negative breast cancers who are candidates for potentially curative surgery.

Subjects will receive carboplatin (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 2 mg/mL/min) + paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) Carboplantin plus Paclitaxel (CbP) followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). All subjects will receive CbP on Day 1 of 12 weekly cycles (Visits CbP1 - CbP12) via infusion during Chemotherapy Segment 1 as indicated in the Study Schema. Dose interruptions and dose modifications are allowed based upon tolerability and may extend Chemotherapy Segment 1 duration to a maximum of 16 weeks. Beginning with Chemotherapy Segment 2 all subjects will receive doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) on Day 1 of four 14-day cycles (Visits AC1 - AC4). For subjects who experience toxicities due to carboplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide, the appropriate dose modifications or dosing delays should be managed according to Section 11.2. Dose modifications may result in the total duration of therapy being greater than the planned 24 weeks. The objective of this study is to determine efficacy and tolerability of low dose, weekly carboplatin in combination with weekly paclitaxel followed by standard doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.
