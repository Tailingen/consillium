Registry on Hypomethylating Agents in Myeloid Neoplasms
This registry is set up to collect real-world experience in the management of patients with myeloid neoplasms, in particularly in patients with MDS, CMML or AML, treated with hypomethylating agents in Austria and potentially other participating countries. This registry will collect data in a retrospective as well as in a prospective manner at various sites. The aim is to gain valuable insights on both efficacy and toxicity of these drugs in a routine clinical setting in patients with various comorbidities.
