Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Multiple Myeloma After a Donor Stem Cell Transplant
This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent multiple myeloma after a donor stem cell transplant. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.
Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Stage I Multiple Myeloma|Stage II Multiple Myeloma|Stage III Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: lenalidomide
Response Rate, Defined as the Number of Patients Achieving Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Minor Response (MR), CR: No Monoclonal Protein (MP) in the blood AND no serum/urine MP by Immunofixation (IF \< 0) AND \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirate.

VGPR: More than 90% decrease of MP and urine M protein \< 100 mg/d OR serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)/urine protein electrophoresis(UPEP) negative but serum immunofixation (IFs) or IFu urine immunofixation (IFu) ) still positive.

PR: Over 50% decrease of serum MP AND \> 90% reduction in 24h urinary light chain excretion or M proteinuria \< 200mg/d MR: Between 25 and 49% decrease of MP in the blood AND 50-89% reduction in 24h urinary light chain excretion (monoclonal proteinuria\>200 mg/d), Up to 9 years
Adverse Events, Graded According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0, Grade 1-2 adverse events occurring in \>10% of participants. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in one or more participants., Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment|Number of Patients Requiring Dose Interruption, Dose Reduction or Discontinuance of Lenalidomide, Dose interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of lenalidomide due to toxicity, GVHD or disease progression, Up to 9 years|Number of Patients Who Experience Improvement in GVHD on Lenalidomide, Defined as the Reduction in Severity of GVHD as Defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria, Up to 9 years|TTP, Time to Progression (TTP): Time from start of therapy to meeting the definition of Progressive Disease (PD).

PD: 25% increase compared to the lowest value of:

* Serum MP (absolute increase at least â‰¥ 0.5 g/dl)
* Or: Urine MP (absolute increase at least \> 200 mg/24h)
* Or: for patients without measurable MP, Serum Free Light Chain test: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase at least \>100 mg/L), Up to 9 years|Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival, At 1 and 2 years after starting treatment with lenalidomide
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate response of relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma to lenalidomide after allogeneic stem cell transplant.

II. Proportion of patients achieving a complete, partial or minor response.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate toxicity and tolerability of lenalidomide in this setting.

II. For patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), evaluate the response to lenalidomide.

III. Evaluate time to progression (TTP).

IV. Evaluate overall survival (OS).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years or longer in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.
