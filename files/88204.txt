The Effects of NVX-108 as a Radiation Sensitizer in Glioblastoma
This clinical trial is testing the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of NVX-108 administered via intravenous infusion in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy.

NVX-108 is being developed to increase the amount of oxygen delivered to tumors which is hoped to increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy.
