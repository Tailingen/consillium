This is the first-in-human trial with TGRX-326 which aims to evaluate the safety profile and preliminary efficacy profile in patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of TGRX-326, including determination of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and other safety measures of the investigational drug, such as adverse events and abnormal clinical outcomes. Preliminary efficacy profiles of TGRX-326 is also evaluated according to RECIST Version 1.1. The safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles, along with pharmacokinetic analysis, will be assessed together to determine the optimal dose for expansion.
