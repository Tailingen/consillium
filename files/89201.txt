Icotinib Combined With WBRT For NSCLC Patients With Brain Metastases and EGFR Mutation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Icotinib at different dose levels in combination with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases and EGFR mutation.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Brain Metastases
DRUG: icotinib|RADIATION: Whole brain radiotherapy
Safety and tolerability, All cause adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), 6-12 months
Neurological progression-free survival, All cause neurological progress or mortality, 3-6 month|Progression-free survival, All cause progress or mortality, 3-6 months|Overall survival, All cause mortality, 6-12 months|Response rate, 3-6 month|Quality of life measured by FACT-L/LCS 4.0, 1 year|Neurocognitive effects, Evaluated according to Mini-Mental Status Examination, 3-6 months
The long-term control of brain metastases becomes a clinical challenge. Whole brain radiotherapy, the standard treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases, can only bring a modest survival improvement around 3-6 months. EGFR-TKIs like icotinib with its proven activity in non-small cell lung cancer may provide clinical benefits in such patients.
