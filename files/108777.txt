Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study of MRX-2843 in Adolescents and Adults with Relapsed/Refractory AML, ALL, or MPAL
This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in adolescents and adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia. Patients will receive continuous oral MRX-2843 in 28 day cycles at predefined dose cohorts.

DRUG: MRX-2843
Percentage of subjects with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Baseline to the end of Cycle 1 (up to 28 days)|Percentage of subjects with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5, Baseline up to 14 days after last dose of study treatment (up to approximately 8 months)
Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in mg of MRX-2843, Baseline to end of Cycle 1 (up to 28 days)|AUC0-t: area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|AUC0-inf: area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|AUC0-τ: area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to tau, where tau is the dosing interval, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Cmax: maximum observed plasma concentration, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Tmax: time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|λz: terminal phase elimination rate constant, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|t1/2: apparent terminal elimination half-life, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|CL/F: apparent total body clearance, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Vz/F: apparent volume of distribution of the terminal phase, Day 1 and Day 23 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in up to 50 adolescent or adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia. Patients will receive a single dose of MRX-2843 followed by continuous oral MRX-2843 in 28 day cycles at predefined dose cohorts.

A dose expansion arm of approximately 12 patients (with 6 patients being FLT3 ITD+ and 6 patients being Mer+/FLT3 WT) will be accrued to further evaluate patients at the RP2D.
