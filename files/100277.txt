HMPL-813 in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma
This is an open-label study, to evaluated epitinib, which is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI), to treat glioblastoma patients with EGFR gene amplification. As epitinib could cross blood-brain barrier (BBB), inhibition of EGFR may provide a novel mechanism in treating glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: epitinib succinate
objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period, 6 months
Epitinib could cross BBB and show its efficacy in brain metastasis tumors. Patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma; standard treatment failed or no standard treatment as well as EGFR gene amplication are eligible. Patients will receive epitinib 120mg or 160mg epitinib daily. Epitinib is orally administered qd until patients reach intolerance or progression of disease. Tumor assessment takes place every 4 weeks. Simon two stage design was used, estimated making sample size of 35 cases.
