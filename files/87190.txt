Immunophenotype of PBMC to Early Predict Response to Immunotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study is aimed to test the performance of a simple, easy, reproducible cytofluorimetric assay to complement imaging studies for:

* predicting response to immune-therapeutic regimens in HCC in the early phase of treatment,
* to rule out pseudo-progression,
* to early predict the escape from effectiveness of treatment.
Liver Cancer, Adult
DRUG: Immunochemotherapy combined with antiangiogenic
To find predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in HCC, Sensitivity and specificity of CD8+, PD1+, PD-L1+, CTLA4+, LAG3+, TIGIT+, CD8+PD1+, CD8+PDL1+ peripheral lymphocytes and granulocytes for tumor response prediction according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, at 3 month
To compare the transcriptomic signatures of PBMC of responders and non-responders, Tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, At 3 months
* To assess the accuracy of biomarkers from an immunophenotypic test (CD8+, PD1+, PD-L1+, CTLA4+, LAG3+, CD8+PD1+, CD8+PDL1+ peripheral lymphocyte populations and circulating granulocytes) in predicting the response to immuno-therapy in patients affected by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
* To compare the transcriptomic signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of responders and non-responders (assessed at the first imaging study).

RNAseq data will be validated by RT-PCR in independent prospective cohorts.
