A Study to Explore Correlation Between Symptoms and Signs of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and Risk of Over-response to Ovarian Stimulation
This is a Phase IV, prospective, observational, single arm, multicenter trial to identify the population at high risk of overstimulation associated with signs and symptoms of PCOS and examines the utility of 12.5 international units (IU) increment of Gonal-f® new pen for individualized controlled ovarian stimulation (iCOS).
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Gonal-f®|DRUG: Long GnRH agonist|DRUG: GnRH antagonist
Number of subjects with polycystic ovary, Baseline|Serum Testosterone levels, Baseline|Number of subjects with history of menstrual disorders, Baseline|Number of subjects with hirsutism, Baseline|Number of oocytes retrieved, Baseline up to 2-7 days until end of stimulation cycle (approximately 28 days)
Total Dose of Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (r-FSH), Baseline up to 1 month|Daily Dose of Recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (r-FSH), Baseline up to 1 month|Number of Metaphase II (M II) oocyte retrieved, Baseline up to 2-7 days until end of stimulation cycle (approximately 28 days)|Biochemical pregnancy rate, Biochemical pregnancy was defined as a positive pregnancy test (serum beta-hCG test) of the post-treatment assessment period, 4 to 6 Weeks after Embryo transfer (Up to 4 months)|Clinical pregnancy rate, Clinical pregnancy was defined as existence of at least one ultrasonography confirmed gestational sac in the uterus, with or without heartbeat., 4 to 6 Weeks after Embryo transfer (Up to 4 months)|Implantation Rate, Implantation rate was measured as the number of gestational sacs observed, divided by the number of embryos transferred multiplied by 100., 4 to 6 Weeks after Embryo transfer (Up to 4 months)|Number of Subjects With Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS), OHSS is a syndrome which can manifest with enlarged ovaries, advanced ascites with increased vascular permeability, pleural fluid accumulation, haemoconcentration, and increased blood clotting., Baseline up to 13 month|Number of Cycles Cancelled Due to Risk of Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS), OHSS is a syndrome which can manifest with enlarged ovaries, advanced ascites with increased vascular permeability, pleural fluid accumulation, haemoconcentration, and increased blood clotting., Baseline up to 13 month
