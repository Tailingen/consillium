A Phase I Study on Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Injection (GC101 TIL) for the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
20-60 participants are expected to be enrolled for the Phase I clinical trial which is further divided into two parts: a "3+3" dose escalation study and an expanded enrollment study.

The Phase I clinical trial is expected to be finished in 36 months. To be specific, the dose escalation study plans to include patients with advanced malignant solid tumors with clear pathological diagnosis, including melanoma, cervical cancer, head and neck squamous cell tumors, non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, etc.; while the expanded enrollment study plans to include those with melanoma, cervical cancer, and head and neck squamous cell tumors.
