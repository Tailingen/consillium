Efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in Preventing Radiotherapy-Induced Oral Mucositis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients.
A prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel clinical trial will be conducted at Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Center at Mansoura University Hospital to assess the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of radiotherapy induced oral mucositis in Head and Neck cancer patients.
Oral Mucositis (Ulcerative) Due to Radiation
DRUG: N-Acetyl-Cysteine with Institutional standard care|DRUG: Institutional standard care
Incidence of oral mucositis with grade ≥ 2 assessed weekly by World Health Organization scale for Oral Mucositis., Difference between the two arms regarding incidence of grade ≥ 2 according to World Health Organization scale for Oral Mucositis., 8 weeks
Time to develop oral mucositis with grade ≥ 2., Difference between the two arms regarding time to develop oral mucositis with grade ≥ 2 according to WHO scale for oral mucositis.

World Health Organization scale for oral mucositis

* Grade 0: no oral mucositis
* Grade 1: erythema and soreness
* Grade 2: ulcers, able to eat solids
* Grade 3: ulcers, requires liquid diet
* Grade 4: ulcers, alimentation not possible (due to mucositis)., 8 weeks|Duration of oral mucositis with grade ≥ 2., Difference between the two arms regarding duration of oral mucositis with grade ≥ 2 according to WHO scale for oral mucositis., 8 weeks|Pain assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS)., The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, used to record patients' pain progression. The most simple VAS is a straight horizontal line of fixed length usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (pain) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best).

we will allocate this scale in comparing pain severity between the two arms., 8 weeks|Functional oral intake scale, TUBE DEPENDENT (levels 1-3)

1. No oral intake
2. Tube dependent with minimal/inconsistent oral intake 3 Tube supplements with consistent oral intake

TOTAL ORAL INTAKE (levels 4-7) 4. Total oral intake of a single consistency 5. Total oral intake of multiple consistencies requiring special preparation 6. Total oral intake with no special preparation, but must avoid specific foods or liquid items 7. Total oral intake with no restrictions, 8 weeks|Patient's quality of life assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy in Head and Neck Cancer (FACT-H&N) version 4, A questionnaire filled by head and neck cancer patient to assess the quality of life.

H\&N1 I am able to eat the foods that I like H\&N2 My mouth is dry H\&N3 I have trouble breathing H\&N4 My voice has its usual quality and strength H\&N5 I am able to eat as much food as I want H\&N6 I am unhappy with how my face and neck look H\&N7 I can swallow naturally and easily H\&N8 I smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products H\&N9 I drink alcohol (e.g. beer, wine, etc.) H\&N10 I am able to communicate with others H\&N11 I can eat solid foods H\&N12 I have pain in my mouth, throat or neck
