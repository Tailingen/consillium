Phase II Study DCVAC/OvCa Added to First Line Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Newly Diagnosed Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether DCVAC/OvCa added to chemotherapy (carboplatin plus paclitaxel as first line chemotherapy) may result in prolongation of progression free survival (PFS).
