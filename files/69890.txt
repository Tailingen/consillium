A Study in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
LY2603618 is a selective inhibitor of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). It was being developed as a chemotherapeutic-enhancing agent in the treatment of cancer. Phase 1 studies have shown the feasibility of combining LY2603618 with either gemcitabine or pemetrexed. The objective of this study was to find the dose of LY2603618 that can be safely combined with standard doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin and to test if this triplet offered a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with Stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line of palliative treatment.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: LY2603618
Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival Time, Progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of documented objective progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For participants who were not known to have had objective PD as of the data inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessments. For participants who took any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy prior to progression, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the start date of any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy. PFS time was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates., Randomization up to first date of PD or death from any cause (up to 6 months after the last participant entered treatment)|Phase 1: Recommended Phase 2 Dose of LY2603618, The recommended Phase 2 dose for LY2603618 when administered approximately 24 hours after pemetrexed and cisplatin was based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and achievement of predefined LY2603618 plasma systemic exposures targets (area under the LY2603618 plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity \[AUC(0-∞)\] \>21,000 nanogram\*hour/milliliter \[ng\*h/mL\] and maximum LY2603618 plasma concentration \[Cmax\] \>2000 nanograms/milliliter \[ng/mL\])., Time of first dose to last dose
Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) time is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the data cut-off date, OS time was censored at the last contact date the participant was known to be alive prior to the data cut-off date. OS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates., Randomization to the date of death from any cause through the time of study discontinuation (approximately 12 months after last participant was randomized)|Phase 2: Overall Tumor Response Rate: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Confirmed Best Response of Completed Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), Overall response rate is the best response of CR or PR as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, v1.1) guidelines. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions, and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm). PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., Randomization until date of disease progression (up to 6 months after the last participant was randomized)|Phase 2: Change in Tumor Size, Change in tumor size was based on tumor measurements collected according to RECIST, v1.1 guidelines. Tumor size is the sum of the tumor measurements (longest diameters) of target lesions at each tumor evaluation. Change in tumor size was defined as the change in log tumor size from baseline evaluation to the evaluation at the end of Cycle 2., Baseline, end of Cycle 2|Phase 1: Pharmacokinetic: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) (LY2603618), Cmax is reported for each LY2603618 dose level on Cycle 1 /Day 2 and Cycle 2 /Day 2.

The number of pharmacokinetic observations (n) used in the analysis is presented., Cycle 1/Day 2 - predose, immediately prior to the end of the LY2603618 infusion, and 2-6, 24-48, and 72-96 hours postdose|Phase 2: Change From Baseline to Long-term Follow up in Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), Health-related quality of life and participant symptoms were assessed using the LCSS (patient scale). However, improper implementation of questionnaires at the site level reduced the sponsor's ability to accurately evaluate the impacted data. Therefore, the LCSS data should be interpreted with caution.

The LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire. Six questions are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain), and 3 summation items describe total symptomatic distress, activity status, and overall quality of life. Participant responses were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) with 100-milliliter (mm) lines. Scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome). The Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) was calculated as the mean of 6 symptom-specific questions from the LCSS. The total LCSS score was calculated as the mean of 9 questions from the LCSS., Randomization to the end of study (approximately 12 months after the last participant entered treatment)|Phase 1: Document Any Antitumor Activity Per Radiological Scans and/or Tumor Markers, Overall response rate is presented. Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best response of CR or PR as classified by the investigators according to RECIST, v1.1 criteria. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions, and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., Baseline through end of Phase 1|Phase 2: Proportion of Participants Receiving Maintenance Therapy, Cycle 5|Phase 2: Clinical Benefit Rate: Percentage of Participant Who Achieved a Response of Stable Disease (SD), Partial Response (PR), or Complete Response (CR), Clinical benefit rate is the best response CR, PR, or SD as classified by the investigators according to the RECIST, v1.1 guidelines. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions, and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. Clinical benefit rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR, PR, or SD divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., Randomization until date of disease progression or death (up to 6 months after the last participant was randomized)
Deaths, Deaths that occurred during the study are presented. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Randomization through 12 months after the last participant was randomized
