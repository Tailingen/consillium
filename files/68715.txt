Altered Chemotherapy Sequencing During Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With Stage II or III Rectal Adenocarcinoma
The primary objective of the pilot portion of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of an extended treatment break period in patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as well as use of systemic therapy during this break.
Stage II Rectal Cancer|Stage III Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|RADIATION: radiation|PROCEDURE: total mesorectal excision
The primary study endpoint for the phase I portion of this study is to assess surgical complications through the Clavien grading system., The adverse events will be followed prospectively from the date of surgery for 90 days. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as \> grade 3 anastomotic stricture or leak, infection (including pelvic abscess or wound infection), small bowel obstruction, or fistualization. Any other post-operative complication thought related directly to the surgical intervention that is a grade 3 or higher Clavien complication will also be considered dose-limiting toxicity., 90 days
The primary endpoint of the phase II portion of the study is complete pathologic response., 9 to 11 weeks after the completion of the initial chemoradiotherapy., 9 to 11 weeks
The proposed protocol aims to continue tumor-directed therapy during the typical "break period" in an effort to improve on both local tumor response as well as distant disease control. First, the duration from completion of chemoradiotherapy would increase from 6-8 weeks to 9-11 weeks. As noted above, this may allow for further cell death with resultant pathologic downstaging. Secondly, the protocol calls for continued systemic therapy during the 9-11 week period, thus allowing continuation of therapies directed towards both the primary as well as distant sites of disease. The primary aim of this pilot study would be to establish the feasibility of this intensified neoadjuvant approach, especially with respect to tolerability of the subsequent pelvic surgery. A subsequent phase II portion will evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach.
