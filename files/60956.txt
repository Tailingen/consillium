A Trial of GW572016, Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin for Metastatic Pancreaticobiliary Cancer Schema
A Phase I Trial of GW572016, Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin for Metastatic Pancreaticobiliary Cancer Schema
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: cohort 1|DRUG: cohort 2|DRUG: cohort 3|DRUG: cohort 4
Toxicity (Number of Patients Who Experiened DLTs), To determine the safety and tolerability of GW572016 when administered with gemcitabine and the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced pancreaticobiliary cancers. Numbers below are DLTs, until death, approximately 2 years
Number of Patients Who Experienced a Partial Response, To assess clinical activity of GW572016 with gemcitabine and with the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced pancreaticobiliary cancers., every two months until progression
The primary objective of this phase I study is to determine the safety, tolerability and optimal tolerated regimen of GW572016 when combined with gemcitabine and with the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level to assess toxicity. To better assess the safety at the final dose level in both Stage I and Stage II, the number of patients in the cohort at the Maximum Tolerated Dose for both Stages will be expanded to 10. Therefore approximately 34-37 patients will be treated on this study.

Trial finished and no further data will be collected.
