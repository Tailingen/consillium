Exploring Biological Linkage Between Circadian Disruption and Cancer Progression
The purpose of this study is to explore the possible association between the circadian disruption and cancer progression.
Breast Neoplasms
Progression-free survival, The data progression-free survival will be done by reviewing patients' medical record., 3 years (and more) after recruitment
Circadian disruption, Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Munich Chronotype Questionnaire will be used during assessment., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Objective sleep cycle measures, The assessment will be performed by using actigraph and sleep diary., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Physiological measures, The measures include blood pressure, body temperature, skin conductance, breathing pattern, and Electroencephalography., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Sleep quality measures, The measurements will be performed using Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Insomnia Severity Index., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Quality of Life measure, The measurement will be performed using M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Cancer related Fatigue, Fatigue severity scale will be used during the assessment., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Distress related measure, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used during the assessment., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Posttraumatic Stress-related symptom measure, Impact of Event Scale-revised will be used to categorize and quantify Posttraumatic stress-related symptom in cancer patients., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Menopausal symptom measure, Menopause Rating Scale will be used during the assessment., Baseline, after 1 month, after 6 month, after 12 month|Personality measure, Temperament and Character Inventory will be used to examine the personality factor in each participant., Baseline|Genetic polymorphism, Variable Number Tandem Repeat and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism of circadian-rhythm related genes will be examined., Baseline|Epigenetic Change, The methylation specific Polymerase Chain Reaction technique will be used to explore methylation patterns in circadian clock gene or in a global gene level., Baseline|Cortisol level, Salivary cortisol level will be measured multiple times at baseline., Baseline|Melatonin, Salivary or Urine melatonin level will be measured., Baseline|Inflammatory markers, The various inflammation markers will be measured from blood sample., Baseline|Overall survival, The data progression-free survival will be done by reviewing patients' medical record., 3 years (and more) after recruitment
The biological markers that are assumed to bridge this association are measured and analyzed.
