A Study of MabThera/Rituxan (Rituximab) in Patients With Relapsed Centroblastic Centrocytic Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera/Rituxan in patients with relapsed low-grade centroblastic centrocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients will receive once-weekly intravenous MabThera/Rituxan for 4 weeks; responding patients will be treated a second time in case of relapse (defined as progression after complete or partial response). The anticipated time on study treatment is \<3 months.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: rituximab [MabThera/Rituxan]
Percentage of Participants With a Complete Remission (CR) or Partial Remission (PR), Percentage of participants with a CR, PR at the end of the first cycle of treatment (Week 4). CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all objective disease findings, including enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly for at least 4 weeks, and a normalization of blood counts with granulocytes \>1.500/ microliter (µL), hemoglobin (Hb) \>12 grams per deciliter (g/dL), and platelets \>100,000/µL. PR was defined as a less than (\<) 50% regression of all measurable and evaluable lymphoma manifestations (sum of the products of the 2 largest diameters vertical to each other) for at least 4 weeks without the appearance of new manifestations, and normalization of blood counts., Treatment start until progression of disease or last available follow-up. The median length of follow-up was 6.6 months (range: 0-97.8 months)
Number of Participants With a Clinical Response, Clinical response was defined as the best response after the first 4 weeks of treatment cycle by the following categories: CR, PR, minor response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all objective disease findings, including enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly for at least 4 weeks, and a normalization of blood counts with granulocytes \>1,500/μL, Hb \>12 g/dL, and platelets \>100,000/μL. PR was defined as \<50% regression of all measurable and evaluable lymphoma manifestations (sum of the products of the 2 largest diameters vertical to each other) for at least 4 weeks without the appearance of new manifestations, and normalization of blood counts. MR was defined as tumor regression ≥25% and \<50%. SD was defined as tumor regression \<25%, no new manifestations, and progression ≤25%. PD was defined as no new lymphoma associated symptoms or an increase in the size of manifestations by more than 25%., Treatment start until progression of disease or last available follow-up. The median length of follow-up was 6.6 months (range: 0-97.8 months)|Time to Best Response, The median time, in months, from start of the treatment (first application) until best response (PR or CR)., Treatment start until progression of disease or last available follow-up. The median length of follow-up was 6.6 months (range: 0-97.8 months)|Duration of Remission, Median time, in months, between the documentation of CR or PR and PD in clinical responders., Treatment start until progression of disease or last available follow-up. The median length of follow-up was 6.6 months (range: 0-97.8 months)|Time to Progression, The median time, in months, from the start of treatment (first application) until detection of PD., Treatment start until progression of disease or last available follow-up. The median length of follow-up was 6.6 months (range: 0-97.8 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time, in months, between enrollment into the study and death, due to any cause. Participants who were not reported as having died at the time of the analysis were censored using the date they were last known to be alive., Enrollment into study until end of follow-up or death. The median length of follow-up was 6.6 months (range: 0-97.8 months)|Number of Participants With a Clinical Response to Re-Treatment, Clinical response was defined as the best response after the second 4 weeks of treatment cycle by the following categories: CR, PR, MR, SD, and PD. CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all objective disease findings, including enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly for at least 4 weeks, and a normalization of blood counts with granulocytes \>1,500/μL, Hb \>12 g/dL, and platelets \>100,000/μL. PR was defined as \<50% regression of all measurable and evaluable lymphoma manifestations (sum of the products of the 2 largest diameters vertical to each other) for at least 4 weeks without the appearance of new manifestations, and normalization of blood counts. MR was defined as tumor regression ≥25% and \<50%. SD was defined as tumor regression \<25%, no new manifestations, and progression ≤25%. PD was defined as no new lymphoma associated symptoms or an increase in the size of manifestations by more than 25%., First application in the second treatment cycle until progression of disease. The median length of follow-up was 4.6 months (range: 0.5-20.6 months).
