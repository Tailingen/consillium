Screening TO Prevent ColoRectal Cancer (STOP CRC) Among At-Risk Chinese and Korean American Primary Care Patients
The objective of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a multi-level culturally-sensitive decision support intervention on colorectal cancer screening adherence among 400 Chinese and Korean American primary care patients.

This study culturally adapts existing evidence-based decision support navigation intervention and tests its efficacy among 200 Chinese and Korean American men and 200 Chinese and Korean American women aged 50 to 75 eligible for colorectal cancer screening. Participants are recruited from primary care physician clinics. The study is designed to compare colorectal cancer screening outcomes between the decision support navigation intervention and the advanced control. Those randomized to the advanced control group only receives an informational booklet, a stool blood test kit and a reminder by mail. Those randomized to the decision support navigation intervention group receives everything the advanced control group receives as well as decision support and navigation contacts. Investigators in the study develop an individualized screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling Program, share the plan with the participants' primary care physicians, and have primary care physicians to encourage the colorectal cancer screening to participants. Using outcomes data collected by survey and medical record review, this study: (1) determines overall colorectal cancer screening adherence in the culturally adapted decision support navigation intervention vs. the advanced control; (2) measures change in colorectal cancer screening decision stage in the culturally adapted decision support navigation intervention vs. the advanced control; and (3) assesses colorectal cancer screening test-specific (stool blood test vs. colonoscopy) adherence in the culturally adapted decision support navigation intervention vs. the advanced control. Additionally, investigators in the study evaluate intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using interview data.
