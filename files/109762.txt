Evaluation of an Oral Care Programme for Head and Neck Cancer Patients
This study will evaluate the effect of an intensified oral care programme on prevalence, severity and duration of mucositis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer in the head and neck region.

Patients in the control group get professional oral care once a week.

PROCEDURE: Oral care programme
Oral mucositis, Reduced incidence of clinical mucositis assessed using Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (9 areas in the mouth are examined and signs of ulceration are scored; 0=no lesion,1= lesion \<1cm2, 2=lesion 1-3 cm2, 3=lesion \> 3 cm2 as well as erythema, which is scored as follows: 0=no erythema, 1= mild erythema and 2=severe erythema. Total score for ulceration can vary from 0-27 and for erythema from 0-18.

This study will evaluate the effect of an oral care programme on prevalence, severity and duration of mucositis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer in the head and neck region. The oral care programme consists of professional oral care and swabbing of the mucosal membranes with a saline/bicarbonate solution once a week. The patients are instructed to rinse with a saline/bicarbonate solution 5 times per day. They are given an oral care diary to help them keep track of their daily oral hygiene measures and rinses. Repeated oral hygiene instructions are given if needed.

Patients in the control group get professional oral care once a week.
