Phase II Study of 177Lu-DOTATATE Radionuclide in Adults With Progressive or High-risk Meningioma
This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy of Lutathera (177Lu-DOTATATE) administered intravenously every 8 weeks for a total of 4 doses in patients with progressive WHO I-III or residual high-risk Ga-DOTATATE PET-MRI positive meningioma. Ga-DOTATATE PET-MRI scans will be obtained prior to initiation of Lutathera treatment and 6 months after the initiation of Lutathera treatment. The latter will be performed within the 14 days prior to the last dose of Lutathera treatment.
Meningioma
DRUG: Lutathera
Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6), proportion of subjects who achieve a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 6 months from start of Lutathera treatment. Radiographic treatment response will be assessed by measuring the bidirectional tumor diameters on contrast-enhanced MRI in patients who received at least one dose of Lutathera compared to baseline measurements at time of study enrollment, 6 Months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), defined as the best response \[Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + stable disease (SD)\] recorded from the start of the study until the end of study in patients who received at least one dose of Lutathera., 12 months|Overall Survival at 12 months (OS-12), proportion of subjects who are alive at 12 months from start of Lutathera treatment. Survival data will be captured by clinical follow-up every 8 weeks during treatment with Lutathera and by follow-up phone calls every 12 weeks for up to 2 years after completion of treatment with Lutathera., 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the number of days from the treatment start date to the date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause., 2 Years Post Treatment|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the number of days from the treatment start date to the date of death due to any cause., 2 Years Post Treatment
