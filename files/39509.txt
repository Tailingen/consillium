ShearWaveâ„¢ Elastography of Breast Lesions in Chinese Patients
We aim to determine if adding ShearWave Elastography to a standard ultrasound breast exam can improve the characterization (classification) of breast lesions.
Breast Neoplasms
Increase in specificity of breast ultrasound imaging when considering stiffness measurements, Within 18 months of the study start date
Change of sensitivity and negative predictive value of breast ultrasound imaging when considering stiffness measurements, Within 18 months of the study start date|Increase in positive predictive value for biopsy of breast ultrasound when considering stiffness measurements, within 18 months of the study start date
Chinese women are known to have denser breasts than women in Western countries. Mammography cannot find abnormalities easily in denser breasts, while breast ultrasound is not affected by density. Adding elastography, a stiffness measurement, to a breast ultrasound exam should improve the diagnosis of a lesion.
