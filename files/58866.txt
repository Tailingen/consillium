Primary Percutaneous Stenting Above the Ampulla Versus Endoscopic Drainage for Unresectable Malignant Hilar Biliary Obstruction
The goal of this clinical randomized controlled trial is to perform primary percutaneous stenting (PPS) in patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction (MHBO). The main question it aims to answer is:

To compare the efficacy of PPS above the ampulla to standard endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) in patients with a MHBO who are ineligible for surgical resection.

Researchers will compare PPS with EBD to see if major complications within 90 days after randomisation occur.

Participants will undergo either primary percutaneous stenting or endoscopic biliary drainage, depending on randomization.

PROCEDURE: Primary percutaneous stenting (PPS)|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic biliary drainage
Major complications within 90 days after randomisation, The primary objective is to compare major complications within 90 days after randomization of PPS and EBD in patients with MHBO who are ineligible for surgical resection. Major complications are defined as any complication leading to prolonged hospital stay of more than 72 hours, readmission to hospital, invasive reintervention, or death., 90 days after randomization
