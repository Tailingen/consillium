Evaluation of Pancreatic Duct Stenting in Patients With Pancreatic Pseudocysts.
The disruption of the pancreatic duct seems to be a major cause pseudocyst formation and persistence in patients suffering from acute/chronic pancreatitis. No prospective randomized studies have been conducted on the influence of pancreatic duct stenting for the patients' benefits and recurrence rates. The aim fo this study is therefore to evaluate prospectively in a randomized, controlled fashion in patients wit pancreatic pseudocysts, wether pancreatic duct stenting of a disrupted pancreatic duct is beneficial in terms of quicker clinical recovery and avoidance of recurrence of pancreatic pseudocysts.
Chronic Acute Pancreatitis
