Study to Evaluate Loncastuximab Tesirine With Rituximab Versus Immunochemotherapy in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402) combined with rituximab compared to standard immunochemotherapy.
