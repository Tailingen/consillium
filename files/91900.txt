INO-5401 and INO-9012 Delivered by Electroporation (EP) in Combination With Cemiplimab (REGN2810) in Newly-Diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM)
Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of INO-5401 and INO-9012 in combination with cemiplimab (REGN2810), with radiation and chemotherapy, in subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM).

This is a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of INO-5401 and INO-9012 in combination with cemiplimab in subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). INO-5401 and INO-9012 will be delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by electroporation (EP) in combination with cemiplimab and chemoradiation and radiation. There will be 2 cohorts in this trial. Cohort A will be participants with a tumor with an unmethylated O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter. Cohort B will be participants with a tumor with a MGMT methylated promoter or who have indeterminate MGMT status. Both cohorts will receive INO-5401 and INO-9012 and cemiplimab at the same doses and on the same dosing schedule, and both cohorts will receive radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), if clinically indicated.
