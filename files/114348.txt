PEEK Versus Metallic Attachment-retained Obturators
Patients' satisfaction evaluation and radiographic evaluation of the terminal abutments of attachment- retained maxillary obturators with metal framework versus milled PEEK framework in the management of maxillectomy cases.
Maxillary Neoplasms
OTHER: PEEK attachment retained obturator|OTHER: metalic attachment retained obturator|OTHER: conventional obturator
patient satisfaction 1(change" is being assessed), The Obturator Functioning Scale ( minimum value is "1"and maximum value is "5", 1 week to 6 months|patient satisfaction 2 (change" is being assessed), The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck 35 ( minimum value is "1"and maximum value is "5", 1 week to 6 months
Radiographic evaluation (change" is being assessed), evaluation of terminal abutment, base line,6 months, 9 months,12 months
Eighteen participants were randomly divided into three parallel groups (n=6). Participants of PEEK group received attachment-retained obturators with milled PEEK framework, metal group received an attachment-retained obturator with metallic framework and conventional group received conventional clasp-retained obturators with metallic framework (Control group). Evaluation included radiographic evaluation and patients' satisfaction where two scales were followed in this study, including "The Obturator Functioning Scale" and "The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck 35" using one way ANOVA test.
