Dose limiting toxicity, Defined using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0 or American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria for cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome., From the time of BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 1) through 28 days after BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 28/Week 4)|MTD, Defined as the dose that maximizes the probability of targeted toxicity among doses that satisfy the escalation with overdose control criterion., From the time of BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 1) through 28 days after BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 28/Week 4)|RP2D, The RP2D may be the same as the MTD, a previously tested dose, or an intermediate/alternative dose below the MTD that is yet unexplored. Alternatively, the RP2D may be selected on the basis of observed safety and activity in dose escalation before the MTD is reached., From the time of BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 1) through 28 days after BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 28/Week 4)|Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), Type, frequency, and severity of TEAEs; clinically significant abnormal safety laboratory findings; and vital signs. TEAEs and laboratory findings according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0 and ASTCT criteria., From the time of BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 1) through Week 24

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be used to evaluate immune cell surface markers along with GPC3 CAR for characterization of BOXR1030 T cells in blood., From the time of BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 1) until the end of the study, assessed up to approximately 15 years|Levels of inflammatory markers, Inflammatory markers will include, e.g., ferritin, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and triglycerides., From the time of BOXR1030 administration (Study Day 1) until the end of the study, assessed up to approximately 15 years
This is a FIH, Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study to assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D of BOXR1030 administration after LD chemotherapy in subjects with GPC3+ advanced solid tumors. After signing informed consent and completing all screening assessments, eligible subjects will be enrolled and undergo leukapheresis to obtain T cells for BOXR1030 manufacturing. Subjects will receive a 3-day LD chemotherapy regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, administered according to institutional standard practice for these drugs, including inpatient administration as appropriate. Subjects must be hospitalized for BOXR1030 administration and will remain hospitalized for 10 days after the infusion. For 28 days after BOXR1030 administration, all subjects must stay within a distance that requires no more than 2 hours of travel to the study site.

During the Post-treatment Evaluation Period (within 6 months after BOXR1030 administration), study visits will occur daily for the first week, twice in the second week, and then once weekly at Weeks 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24. Safety (targeted physical examination, adverse event \[AE\] assessment, and clinical laboratory tests) will be evaluated and samples will be collected for endpoint analyses. For 28 days after BOXR1030 administration, subjects will be required to monitor their temperature and complete neurological evaluation via the immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy assessment tool every day (to be administered by site staff during clinical visits and by a caregiver at home on non-clinic days). At regular intervals, antitumor activity will be assessed per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria.

After 6 months of follow-up from BOXR1030 administration, subjects will enter the Long-term Follow-up Period for a total duration of 15 years after BOXR1030 dosing. Study visits are scheduled at Months 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, and 24, every 6 months thereafter until Year 5, and then annually through Year 15. Long-term follow-up assessments will focus on long-term safety and disease status. Subjects whose disease does not progress before Week 24 will enter the Long-term Follow-up at Month 7. Survival status will be checked at these visits.
