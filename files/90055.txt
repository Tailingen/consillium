A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Activity of AGX101 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
AGX101 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy for tumor-forming cancers. The purpose of this study is to learn about AGX101 effects and safety at various dose levels in an all-comers advanced solid cancer patient population. AGX101will be administered intravenously.

Dosing of AGX101 will be repeated once every 3, 6 or 9 weeks. Participants may continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Subjects will attend an end of treatment visit and will receive two safety follow-up telephone contacts up to 90 days following the last dose of study drug.

DRUG: AGX101
Acceptable maximum tolerated dose for participants, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of AGX101 will be characterized, 21 days following the first dose of AGX101 (Day 1 through Day 21)|Number of participants with adverse events, Evaluation of the incidence, severity, and duration of adverse events, Screening through end of treatment, approximately 6 months and up to 3 years
Terminal elimination half life (PK), Determination of the terminal elimination half-life (tÂ½), 22 days following the first dose of AGX101 (Day 1 through Day 22)|AUC (PK), Determination of the AUC in 1 dosing interval, 22 days following the first dose of AGX101 (Day 1 through Day 22)|Cmax (PK), Determination of the Cmax concentration over a dosing interval, systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss), and accumulation ratio from first dose to steady-state, 22 days following the first dose of AGX101 (Day 1 through Day 22)|Number of Participants with Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) to AGX101, Incidence and titers of ADA will be measured, Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years|Efficacy as measured by Proportion of Participants with Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to RECIST v1.1 Evaluated by the Investigator, Determination the objective response rate (ORR), Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years|Efficacy as measured by Duration of Response (DoR) Assessed by Investigator, Determination of the duration of response (DoR), Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years|Efficacy as measured by Disease Control Rate (DCR), Determination of the disease control rate (DCR), Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years|Efficacy as measured by Proportion of Participants with Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1 Evaluated by the Investigator, Determine progression-free survival (PFS)/PFS assessed per immune-related response evaluation criteria (iPFS)., Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years|Efficacy as measured by Duration of Treatment, Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Approximately 6 months and up to 3 years
