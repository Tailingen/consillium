Hypofractionated Stereotactic Boost in Prostate Cancer
hypofractionated stereotactic boost radiation (prostate) after normofractionated radiotherapy (prostate + seminal vesicles).
Cancer
RADIATION: First part of treatment : Conformal irradiation|PROCEDURE: Fiducials placement|RADIATION: Second part : hypofractionated stereotactic boost
Change from baseline in rectal functions, * Assessment of rectal toxicity according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 scale.
* Acute toxicities are defined as all toxicities occurring within 6 months after the start of radiotherapy, late toxicities are those that occur beyond this period., Every 3 months after boost irradiation during 1 year and then every 6 months during 2 years|Change from baseline in urinary function., * Assessment of urinary toxicity according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 scale.
* Acute toxicities are defined as all toxicities occurring within 6 months after the start of radiotherapy, late toxicities are those that occur beyond this period., Every 3 months after boost irradiation during 1 year and then every 6 months during 2 years
Local control of prostate cancer, Local control is defined as:

* Non progressive PSA according to Phoenix criteria
* Non progressive clinical examination (DRE)
* No pathological findings on MRI, 3 years|Global and metastase-free survival, Time measurement between the inclusion and the date of death/metastatic progression, Up to 5 years after treatment|PSA kinetics, Comparison of the PSA dosage before, at the end of treatment then every 3 months. The PSA dosage evolution will be correlate with the local control treatment., Between radiotherapy and boost, and after treatment : every 3 months|Sexual toxicity, According to IIEF5 questionnaire ( International Index of Erectile Function ), Up to 5 years after treatment|Technical criteria : Fiducial placement (yes/no), During the time of treatment|Urinary discomfort, According to IPSS questionnaire ( International Prostate Symptom Score), Up to 5 years after treatment|Technical criteria : Cumulative dosimetry (1 time/ 2 times), During the time of treatment|Technical criteria : boost schedule (yes/no), During the time of treatment|Technical criteria : duration of boost, Time between patient's entry and exit of the radiotherapy treatment room, During the treatment
The aim of this study is to assess the safety of hypofractionated stereotactic boost radiation (prostate) after normofractionated radiotherapy (prostate + seminal vesicles).
