Urothelium Tissue Engineering Using Biopsies From Transurethral Resection of Prostate
Different clinical conditions can require urinary bladder augmentation or replacement. Tissue engineered bladder has been clinically evaluated but is not recommended due to diverse side effects. Thus, there is a real interest for the development of regenerative approach with innovative scaffolds and cell transplantation.

The investigators propose the use of urothelial cells obtained by Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate or bladder (TURP) to obtain a tissue engineered urothelium in association with different scaffolds.
