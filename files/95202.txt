Camrelizumab Combined With CRT for Treatment of Patients With Local Recurrence of Esophageal Cancer
China is a country with a large incidence of esophageal cancer. The prevalence and mortality rate of esophageal cancer in China ranks fifth in the world. However, due to China's huge population base, new patients with esophageal cancer and deaths account for about 55% of the world. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab Combined With Concurrent Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for Treatment of Patients With Local Recurrence of Esophageal Cancer.

Progression-free survival，PFS, Time from randomization to patient's tumor progression or death, 9 months
Overall survival，OS, The time from the beginning of randomization to death due to any cause., 1 year|Objective Response Rate, ORR, The proportion of patients whose tumor shrinks to a certain amount and remains for a certain period of time, 1 year
This is an open clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with Concurrent Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent esophageal cancer.

Objective to study patients with local recurrence of esophageal cancer after radical treatment.
