CD19 CAR-T Cells for Patients With Relapse and Refractory CD19+ B-ALL.
The purpose of this study is to infusion CD19 CAR-T cells to the patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ B cell leukemia, to assess the safety and feasibility of this strategy. The CAR enables the T cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through the recognition of CD19, a protein expressed of the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD19+ leukemia.
B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR-T
safety as assessed by the occurence of study related adverse events, number of participants with adverse events, 30 days|anti-tumor responses of CD19 CAR-T cells, 1 year
Persistence of the CD19 CAR+ T cells, determine duration of in vivo survival of CD19 CAR-T cells, 1 year|Number of participants who have T cells ablated with cetuximab, The efficacy of cetuximab to ablate the T cells will be measured by loss of detection of T cells and any associated toxicities as well as facilitating B cell recovery., 1 year
Upon meeting the eligibility requirements and enrolling on study, Subjects will be collected large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for the generation of the CD19 CAR-T cells. The T cells are isolated from the PBMC, transduced with a lentivirus to express the CD19 CAR as well as a truncated EGFR that has no signaling capacity (noted EGFRt) and expanded in vitro and then administered to subjects.

Subjects will have blood tests to assess safety and efficacy, and persistence of the CD19 CAR-T cells on week 4 after their last infusion. Following the 6 months of intensive follow-up, subjects will be evaluated every 10 weeks for 1 year with a physical examination, blood tests, bone marrow aspirate, MRD and persistence of CD19 CAR-T.

Some subjects will receive cetuximab for ablation of the genetically modified T cells. Criteria to receive cetuximab include acute toxicities that are life threatening.
