A Study on the Efficacy of Immunotherapy, the Occurrence and Severity of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in High-altitude Areas
As a major disease with high incidence and mortality rate, lung cancer seriously threatens the health of our people and causes a huge burden of disease. In recent years, with the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), great progress has been made in the treatment of lung cancer, which has brought significant survival benefits to patients. Although ICI has greatly improved the prognosis of lung cancer patients, due to the complexity of the mechanism of action of ICI and the heterogeneity within the tumor, the benefit population of treatment is relatively limited, and some patients are still at risk of primary drug resistance and tumor hyperprogression.In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in the efficacy and adverse reactions of immunotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer at high and low altitudes, and to find out the relevant factors from multiple omics such as imaging, pathology, and genetics, so as to solve the problem of immunotherapy resistance
