Study to Image the Esophagus Using the OFDI Capsule
The main purpose of this research is to test the feasibility and tolerability of the tethered capsule Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI)
Barrett's Esophagus|Eosinophilic Esophagitis
DEVICE: OFDI Capsule
Feasibility of OFDI Imaging in Subjects Swallowing the OFDI Capsule, Number of subjects from whom the quality OFDI imaging was obtained, Images will be acquired during the OFDI imaging session which should take an average of 5 minutes
A total of 56 subjects with Barrett's Esophagus, EoE and healthy volunteers will be asked to swallow the OFDI capsule while being unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether that allows the capsule operator to navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsion called peristalsis as well as to bring it back up to pulled out of the mouth when the procedure is done.

As the capsule progresses down the esophagus, multiple, two dimensional, microscopic cross- sectional images of the esophagus are acquired.
