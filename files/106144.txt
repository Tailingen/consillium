Safety and Bioactivity of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Combination Prior to Liver Resection in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The PRIME-HCC trial will assess the effects of combination treatment with nivolumab (OPDIVO) and ipilimumab (YERVOY) pre-operatively in hepatocellular carcinoma patients for whom liver resection is planned. The trial will be conducted at a small number of National Health Service hospitals in the UK. Participants will receive two doses of nivolumab and a single dose of ipilimumab in the weeks before their planned surgery.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Delay to surgery, Number of patients with an unplanned delay to surgery to Day 89 or later, Up to Day 89|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events [Safety and Tolerability], Safety and tolerability of the nivolumab and ipilimumab combination based on NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria from the day of first nivolumab and ipilimumab administration to 126 days later, Up to Day 127
Objective response rate, Objective response rate on pre-resection imaging 42 days after the day of first nivolumab and ipilimumab administration using RECIST v1.1 criteria, Up to Day 43|Pathologic response rate, Pathologic response rate on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected specimen, Up to Day 88 or up to liver resection, whichever came first
This is a single-arm, open-label study to be conducted in 32 patients at a small number of UK hospitals. The study is in 2 parts: Part 1 will confirm, in a small number of patients, that the treatment regimen is safe and doesn't result in unacceptable delay to liver resection. Part 2 will expand the number of patients studied, and provide the opportunity to assess survival over about 2 years after liver resection. The decision to proceed to Part 2 will be taken with advice from an independent, expert committee.

Patients with early-stage HCC will first undergo screening procedures during a 28-day time window between giving consent and starting drug treatment. Screening procedures will include:

* Medical interview and physical exam
* ECG
* Tumour biopsy
* Tumour imaging by MRI
* Tumour imaging by CT
* Blood and urine samples
* Stool sample (optional)

Patients meeting the protocol-specified criteria will be enrolled and on Day 1 will have the following:

* Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)
* Blood and urine samples
* Intravenous dose of ipilimumab ('YERVOY') 1 milligram per kilogram body weight
* Intravenous dose of nivolumab ('OPDIVO') 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight

On Day 22 the participants will have the following:

* Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)
* Blood and urine samples
* Intravenous dose of nivolumab ('OPDIVO') 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight

On Day 43 the participants will have the following:

* Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)
* ECG
* Tumour imaging by MRI
* Blood and urine samples
* Stool sample (optional)

Patients who remain eligible for liver resection will likely undergo surgery within a few days of the Day 43 visit.

On Day 127 the participants will have the following:

* Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)
* Tumour imaging by MRI
* Blood and urine samples

Every 4 months thereafter until 2 years later, or until starting another anti-cancer treatment, participants will have tumour imaging by MRI.
