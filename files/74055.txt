Effect of Genetic Polymorphism on Capecitabine-Induced Toxicity in Egyptian Cancer Patients
The goal of this observational study is to study the effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CES1 gene (rs2244613) on capecitabine-induced toxicity in Egyptian cancer patients. This study will help in understanding the interindividual variability in the CES1 gene and the effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism in this gene (rs2244613) on capecitabine-induced toxicity in participants already taking capecitabine-based chemotherapy as part of their regular medical care.
Colorectal Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine-based chemotherapy
Occurrence of gastrointestinal toxicity, Occurrence and severity of capecitabine-induced gastrointestinal toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0) in relation to the variation in patients' genotype of rs2244613 in the CES1 gene., Six months|Occurrence of hand-foot syndrome, Occurrence and severity of capecitabine-induced Hand-foot syndrome will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0) in relation to the variation in patients' genotype of rs2244613 in the CES1 gene., Six months
Occurrence of hematological toxicity, Occurrence and severity of capecitabine-induced hematological toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0) in relation to the variation in patients' genotype of rs2244613 in the CES1 gene., Six months|Occurrence of hepatic toxicity, Occurrence and severity of capecitabine-induced hyperbilirubinemia will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0) in relation to the variation in patients' genotype of rs2244613 in the CES1 gene., Six months
