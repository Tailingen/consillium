A Dose Optimisation Study of ASLAN003 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
ASLAN003-003 is a multi-center, Phase IIA study to evalute the efficacy of ASLAN003 in AML patients who are ineligible for standard treatment with an expansion cohort in relapsed/refractory patients, and to determine the appropriate dose of ASLAN003 in combination with azacitidine in older (more than or equal to 60 years) AML patients who have exhausted any approved and available treatment options.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: ASLAN003
Overall Complete Remission Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), defined in accordance with the IWG Response Criteria in AML from day 29. Treatment failure is defined as not achieving any response 4 months after study treatment. IWG Response Criteria in AML defines CR or CRi as:

1. Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts \<5 percent; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red cell transfusions
2. CR with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL)) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 x 109/L (100,000/µL)), 4 months after study treatment|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of Participants with Adverse Events reported through 28 days post last study medication administration, Through 28 days post last study medication administration|Safety Assessments, Safety Assessments - Clinical laboratory test: Hematology and Chemistry, Through 28 days post last study medication administration
Relapse Free Survival, Defined as the time the criteria for remission (CR or CRi) are first met until there is evidence of patient relapse, regardless of whether the patient is still taking study drug. Relapse is defined as:

* The reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or \> 5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause;
* The appearance of new dysplastic changes;
* The reappearance of or development of cytologically proven extrameduallary disease;
* The reappearance of a cytogenetic or molecular abnormality., From 12 weeks post end of treatment (EOT) until the date of first documented relapse or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects with an AML IWG best response of CR, CRi or PR. IWG Response Criteria in AML defines CR, CRi or PR as:

1. Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts \<5 percent; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red cell transfusions
2. CR with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL)) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 x 109/L (100,000/µL))
3. Partial remission (PR): All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5 to 25 percent; and decrease of pre-treatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50 percent, 4 months after study treatment|% Change From Baseline in BM Blasts at Day 29, Percent Change from Baseline in BM Blasts at Day 29, Baseline and day 29
ASLAN003-003 is a multi-center, Phase IIA study to determine the optimum dose of ASLAN003 based on the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of varying doses of ASLAN003 (100 mg QD, 200 mg QD, 100 mg BID, and possibly 200 mg BID) administered to AML subjects daily for a continuous 28-day treatment cycle until disease relapse, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

The study has 2 parts and plans to enroll a total of 44 to 56 patients with 18 to 24 patients in Part 1 and 26 to 32 patients in Part 2 (comprising Parts 2A and 2B). The Overall Complete Remission Rate will be evaluated in AML patients not eligible for standard treatment (Part 1) and in relapsed and refractory AML patients (Part 2A) using the optimum dose of ASLAN003 established in Part 1 of the study. In Part 2B of the study, the appropriate dose of ASLAN003 in combination with azacitidine in older (more than or equal to 60 years) AML patients who have exhausted any approved and available treatment options will be determined.
