GDC-0449 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme That Can Be Removed by Surgery
This randomized phase II trial is studying how well GDC-0449 works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme that can be removed by surgery. GDC-0449 may be effective in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

DRUG: vismodegib|PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
6 Months Progression-free Survival (PFS), Estimated using Kaplan Meier curves. six months calculated from date of treatment onset post-operatively. MRI scan at 6 months must be free of progression Progressive disease Progressive neurological abnormalities not explained by other causes or greater than 25% increase in size of tumor or if new lesion., 6 months
Overall Survival Time, The overall failure rate will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals. A median time of survival will be estimated using standard methods.. Start date based on onset of treatment., 3 years|Best Tumor Response Assessed by the Modified Macdonald Radiographic Response Criteria, The Macdonald criteria, roughly similarly to other systems, divides response into 4 types of response based on imaging (MRI) and clinical features

1: complete response; 2: partial response; 3:stable disease; 4:progression

Complete response imaging features: disappearance of all enhancing disease (measurable and non-measurable) sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions clinical features; no corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved

Partial response imaging features: 50% or more decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks: no new lesions clinical features: stable or reduced corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved

Stable disease imaging features: does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression clinical features: clinically stable

Progression imaging features: 25% of more increase in enhancing lesions; any new lesions clinical features: clinical deterioration, evaluated every 8 weeks - 1 year|Toxicity Incidence Grade 3 or 4 According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0, NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 4 possible, probable or definitely related events Grade 3 - severe Grade 4 - life threatening, 30 days from last dose of drug treatment - 1.5 years|Incidence of CD133+ Neurospheres by Arm, number of tumor-derived CD133 neurospheres undergoing proliferation and self-renewal, 12 hours post-vismodegib administration|Changes in Sonic Hedgehog Pathway Activation, determined by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Gli-1, Gli-2, PATCH (PTCH-1b), Pre-tumor resection and post tumor resection (12 hours)|Determine Drug Effect (Pharmacokinetics) in Plasma for Arm 1, samples collected pre tumor resection (day of surgery) and post-tumor resection (day of surgery, Day of surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) measured from start of treatment following surgery.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Toxicity. (Clinical) II. Overall survival. (Clinical) III. Tumor response. Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR): MacDonald criteria). (Clinical)

Correlative Studies

* Determination of in vivo drug effect in recurrent Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM). (Correlative studies)
* Determination of in vitro drug effect on CD133+ glioma-derived neurospheres. (Correlative studies)
* Determination of Sonic Hedgehog pathway activation in primary vs. recurrent GBM. (Correlative studies)

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Correlate clinical outcome (6 mo PFS) with biologic correlates (1-3) above.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

Arm I: Patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 once daily for 7 days before surgery.

Arm II: Patients do not receive treatment before surgery. Beginning within 28 days after surgical resection, all patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue samples are collected for correlative laboratory studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
