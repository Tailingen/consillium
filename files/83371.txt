Observational Study of Biomarker During Liver Surgery
The investigators would like to study whether Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays a cytoprotective role in liver ischemia/reperfusion, and ultimately to develop therapeutic strategies to improve hepatic function of patients with liver diseases.
Liver Cancer|Hepatobiliary Tract Adenomas and Carcinomas
PROCEDURE: Hepatocellular carcinoma
Biochemical analysis of sirtuin1 from liver tissues during liver surgery, 30 minutes during liver surgery
If asked to participate in this research study, it is because a liver resection/liver transplantation surgery has been scheduled. During the procedure a small section will be collected for additional testing of Sirtuin 1. In addition, information concerning the liver disease, laboratory and pathology results after surgery will be collected by the investigators.
