Weekly Gemcitabine and Trastuzumab in the Treatment of Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Due to its remarkable activity as salvage treatment in women with metastatic breast cancer as well as the additive activity observed for gemcitabine administered in combination with trastuzumab, the clinical activity of the combination of gemcitabine administered with trastuzumab represents an exciting and ideal combination to further evaluate in Her 2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer patients.
