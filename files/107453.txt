Salivary Gland Carcinoma|Metastatic Cancer|Recurrent Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab
non-progression rate, The proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) or a stable disease (SD) as per RECIST 1.1 after 6 months of treatment., 6 months
progression free survival (PFS), the time from the date of first Nivolumab administration until the date of event defined as the first progression according to RECIST 1.1, or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), the time from the date of first Nivolumab administration until the date of event, assessed up to 84 months.|Overall survival, the time from the date of first dose until the date of death due to any cause, the time from the date of first dose until the date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 84 months.|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number and percentage of patients with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., the time from the date of first dose until the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, assessed up to 84 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, incidence of all adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths and laboratory abnormalities, the time from the date of first dose until the end of treatment, assessed up to 84 months.|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., the time from the date of first dose until the end of treatment, assessed up to 84 months.|Quality of Life Questionnaire - Head & Neck Cancer Module (QLQ-H&N35), This EORTC head \& neck cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The head \& neck cancer module is a 35-item questionnaire designed for use among a wide range of patients with head \& neck cancer, varying in disease stage and treatment modality. It includes 7 multi-item scales that assess pain (4 items), swallowing (4 items), senses (2 items), speech (3 items), social eating (4 items), social contact (5 items), and sexuality (2 items). There are also 11 single items. Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems., The time from the date of first dose until the end of treatment, assessed up to 84 months.|Biomarkers (central PD-L1 assessment, PD-L2, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs)), Correlations between expression of molecular targets and efficacy, after 2 months of treatment and at the end of treatment, assessed up to 12 months.|Growth Tumor rate, The growth tumor rate will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria before and under treatment for all eligible patients., At each disease evaluation from baseline to last imagery, assessed up to 84 months.
METHODOLOGY:

The present study is a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, phase II study in patients who are suffering from recurrent and/or metastatic Salivary Glands Carcinoma, who have progressed during the 6 months period before entering the study and who are eligible for nivolumab monotherapy.

All eligible patients will receive nivolumab treatment for a maximum of 12 cycles of treatment. 92 eligible patients will be dosed with nivolumab intravenously over 60 minutes (Â± 5 minutes) at 3 mg/kg every two weeks.

Each 28-day dosing period will constitute a cycle.
