Assessing An Oral Janus Kinase Inhibitor, AZD4205 as Monotherapy in Patients Who Have PTCL (JACKPOT8)
This is a multinational, non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor efficacy of AZD4205 as monotherapy in patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), who have relapsed from or are refractory/intolerant to standard systemic treatment.

Phase 1 part:

Around 20\~40 patients will be subsequently enrolled into 2 different dose ascending cohorts. Additional 10\~20 patients may be enrolled to further explore a selected dose defined by dose escalation cohorts.

Phase 2 part:

After the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined, a phase 2 single-arm open-label pivotal study will be conducted to assess anti-tumor efficacy and safety of AZD4205 at RP2D in patients with refractory or relapsed PTCL.
