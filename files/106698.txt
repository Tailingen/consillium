A Study of HS-20106 to Treat Anemia Due to Very Low, Low, or Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of HS-20106 on anemia in patients with very low, low or intermediate risk MDS.

Anemia is considered to be one of the most prevalent cytopenias in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and PK of HS-20106 on anemia in Chinese patients with very low, low or intermediate risk MDS. Eligible subjects will be treated with HS-20106. Patients should be treated for at least 24 weeks in the core treatment period to assess their response to treatment.
