The Effects of Hemodilution Methods in Patients Undergoing Primary Debulking Gynaecological Surgery
Primary cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer is an ideal setting to evaluate endothelial function under ANH and AHH, as the procedure is associated with moderately high blood loss. As the technique has not yet been described in this setting, investigators designed a pilot study to evaluate ANH and AHH in patients planned to undergo primary cytoreduction during perioperative period, with the intent of proceeding to a randomized trial if results were favorable.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Blood sample (5 ml) was obtained from the veinï¼ŒEndothelin-1 (ET-1) was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Merck \& Co Inc, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions., three periods: before hemodilution, immediate postoperative period, and 24 hours later
von Willebrand factor (VWF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and thrombomodulin (TM) levels, von Willebrand factor (VWF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and thrombomodulin (TM) levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Merck \& Co Inc, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions., three periods: before hemodilution, immediate postoperative period, and 24 hours later
Using a computer-generated random number table, patients were randomized to three groups: Control Group(n=30), ANH Group(n=30) and AHH Group(n=30). Patients underwent standard preoperative preparation for cytoreductive surgery according to institutional standards.All patients who underwent a standard anesthesia protocol and similar surgical procedures were considered for the analysis. For this purpose, investigators only included patients who underwent the following interventions: radical hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, one or more bowel resection, peritonectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy and extended periaortic lymphadenectomy. The patient would be ruled out of the experiment when the participant was accompanied with any kind of serious complications such as wakening delay and drug allergy.
