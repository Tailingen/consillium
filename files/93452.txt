Prime-Boost Dose Scheduling Trial for Human GM-CSF Gene Transduced Irradiated Prostate Allogeneic Cancer Cell Vaccines (Allogeneic Prostate GVAX®)
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of priming vaccinations, and subsequent boosting vaccinations with Human GM-CSF Gene Transduced Irradiated Prostate Allogeneic Cancer Cell Vaccines (Allogeneic Prostate GVAX®). Clinical observations and laboratory measurements will be monitored to evaluate safety and toxicity. Additionally, the antitumor effects of Allogeneic Prostate GVAX® on serum PSA levels will be evaluated and antitumor responses will be quantitated.
