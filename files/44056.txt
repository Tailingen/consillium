LOD vs Gn in Anovulatory PCOs Resistant to First Line Agents
PCOS is a complex disease that is diagnosed by the presence of two of the following three: oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries by ultrasound . PCOS affects 4% to 21% of females in reproductive age . Although subfertility is abundant in women with PCOS, a majority of these women will achieve pregnancy naturally or by treatment.

Different treatment modalities are present for ovulation induction. Life style modifications including weight loss are encouraged for those who are overweight or obese. Pharmacological induction of ovulation represent the first line therapy for induction of ovulation. Options include aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole), Clomiphene Citrate (CC) or Metformin, alone or in combinations.

For second line treatment either Gonadotropins (Gn) or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS) are the recommended options .

the objective of the trial is to study the effectiveness and safetey of surgical induction of ovulation strategy and compare it to medical induction strategy with Gonadotropins

PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic ovarian drilling|DRUG: Recombinant FSH (rFSH)
Live Birth, defined as the number of births resulted in live babies after the age of viability (24th week of pregnancy), within 12 months after of end treatment strategy

Systematic reviews done comparing LOD to Gn found no differences in live birth, clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. However, there was significant decrease in OHSS and multiple pregnancies with LOD . Giving these advantages together with being cheap, the surgical strategy may be a more favorable choice as second line treatment of anovulation . Also several randomised controlled trial (RCTs) reported normalization of ovarian reserve parameters after LOD, making it a long-lasting option compared to the one-cycle effect of medical treatment the objective of the trial is to study the effectiveness and safetey of surgical induction of ovulation strategy and compare it to medical induction strategy with Gonadotropins
