Anti-BCMA or/and Anti-CD19 CART Cells Treatment of Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CART cells in treating patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that have not respond to chemotherapy and autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on mutiple maloma cells, has emerged as a very selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherpy for MM. Targeting postulated CD19 positive myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells is a novel approach to MM therapy.
Multiple Myeloma in Relapse
BIOLOGICAL: Treatment
No Dose-limiting toxicity, No Dose-limiting toxicity, up to 5 mouths after T cell infusion
This is multi-center, phase I trial that studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CART cells in treating patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that have not respond to chemotherapy and autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on mutiple maloma cells , has emerged as a very selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherpy for MM. Targeting postulated CD19+ myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells is a novel approach to MM therapy.
