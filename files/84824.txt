BCMA CAR-T for Dynamic High-risk Multiple Myeloma
This is a single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA CAR-T in dynamic high-risk patients with multiple myeloma
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-BCMA-CAR-T
Safety and Tolerability, The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 2 year|MRD-negative rate, achieving MRD-negative, as determined by NGS/NGF after consolidation treatment, within 3 months after BCMA CAR-T infusion|Persistent MRD-negative rate, Persistent MRD-negative rate more than 12 months, Up to 2 year
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of first documented PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 year|Complete response rate (CRR), CR or better is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a CR response or Stringent Complete Response (sCR) response accoording to the IMWG criteria, within 3 month after the CAR-T cell transfusion
The study is a prospective, single-arm, single-centre, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA CAR-T in dynamic high-risk patients with multiple myeloma. Patients received BCMA CAR-T cells infusion after standard FC lymphoma deletion therapy.
