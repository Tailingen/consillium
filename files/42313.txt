Severity of Pruritus, The primary endpoint is the severity of pruritus as measured on the visual analogue scale. A score of 100 indicated the worst pruritus imaginable, while 0 indicated no pruritus., one week
Quality of Life, The secondary endpoint is the quality of life as measured on the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI).

For a series of 10 questions the responses are scored: Very much, scored 3; A lot, scored 2; A little, scored 1; Not at all, scored 0; Not relevant, scored 0; and Question unanswered, scored 0. The scores are summed and the larger the score the greater the effect of the dermatological disease impact on quality of life.

Maximum response for all ten questions 30, minimum 0., one week
