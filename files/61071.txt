[Lu-177]Ludotadipep in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer(CRPC): Investigation of Drug and Application_2
100 mCi of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep, the dose determined in the phase 1 clinical trial (FC705-1), was administered repeatedly up to 6 times at intervals of 8 weeks (±2 weeks) to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in order to assess the safety and efficacy.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer, mCRPC
DRUG: [177Lu]Ludotadipep
Prostate-Specific Antigen Response Rate (PSA-RR), Defined as the proportion of participants with a PSA reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline, up to 48 weeks (Response Rate from Baseline to EOT(End of Treatment))
Prostate-Specific Antigen Response Rate (PSA-RR), The prostate-specific antigen response rate (PSA-RR) is assessed after the administration of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep, Between 4 and 6 weeks after treatment|Changes in the Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) of [18F]PSMA PET/CT, The tumor response is assessed by comparing the changes in the Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) of \[18F\]PSMA PET/CT after administration of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep compared to pre-administration, up to 48 weeks (up to 6 doses at 8-weekly intervals [± 1 week], with 6 week follow-up after each dose (Screening up to 28 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate (ORR) is assessed after administration of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep, up to 48 weeks (up to 6 doses at 8-weekly intervals [± 1 week], with 6 week follow-up after each dose (Screening up to 28 days)|The Best Objective Response Rate (BORR), The best objective response rate (BORR) is assessed after administration of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep, up to 48 weeks (up to 6 doses at 8-weekly intervals [± 1 week], with 6 week follow-up after each dose (Screening up to 28 days)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The imaging-based progression-free survival (PFS) is assessed after administration of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep, up to 48 weeks (up to 6 doses at 8-weekly intervals [± 1 week], with 6 week follow-up after each dose (Screening up to 28 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate (ORR) is assessed while using PCWG3 modified RECIST V1.1 after administration of \[177Lu\]Ludotadipep, up to 48 weeks (up to 6 doses at 8-weekly intervals [± 1 week], with 6 week follow-up after each dose (Screening up to 28 days)|Pain response rate, ≥2 point reduction in Present Pain Intensity Scale (PPI) score from baseline with no increase in analgesic score; and/or ≥50% decrease in analgesic score with no increase in PPI using the McGill Questionnaire, up to 48 weeks (up to 6 doses at 8-weekly intervals [± 1 week], with 6 week follow-up after each dose (Screening up to 28 days)
