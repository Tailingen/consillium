A Study of CTX-712 in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
The goal of this phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, singe arm dose escalation and expansion study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of CTX-712 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS).

The phase 1 part of the study consists of sequential standard 3 + 3 dose escalation, where patients will receive ascending doses of CTX-712 to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further clinical development. This is followed by a confirmatory phase 1 expansion cohort where an additional approximately 10 patients will be treated with CTX-712 at the RP2D to gain further confidence in the selected dose level. After RP2D is determined, Drug-Drug-Interaction cohorts will be started.

The phase 2 part of the study will commence after the RP2D has been identified and confirmed and will evaluate therapeutic activity in R/R AML or R/R HR-MDS, in addition to confirmation of the safety profile.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: CTX-712
Phase 1: Frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to CTX-712., Adverse events are collected from time of informed consent through 28 days after last dose of CTX-712.|Phase 1: The maximum tolerated dose MTD., MTD is the dose producing \<33% of dose-limiting toxicities., Dose-limiting toxicities are collected during the first treatment cycle (28 days).|Phase 2: Complete remission rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve complete remission., Measured from date of first dose to 28 days after last dose of CTX-712.
Phase 1 and 2: Objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a response., For AML: CR, CRi, PR, MLFS. For MDS: CR, PR, mCR, HI., Measured from date of first dose to 28 days after last dose of CTX-712.|Phase 1 and 2: Duration of response., Measure from documentation of tumor response to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months.|Phase 1 and 2: Progression-free survival., Measured from the date of initiating study treatment to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months.|Phase 1 and 2: Overall survival., Measured from the date of initiating study treatment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.|Phase 1 and 2: Proportion of patients who transition to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)., Measured from the date of the last administration of CTX-712 until HSCT, or one year from the date of the start of administration of CTX-712.|Phase 1: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of CTX-712. Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacokinetic evaluation performed in treatment Cycle 1 (cycle duration is 28 days).|Phase 1: Concentration before dose at steady state (Ctrough) of CTX-712. Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacokinetic evaluation performed in treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 4 (cycle duration is 28 days).|Phase 1: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of CTX-712. Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacokinetic evaluation performed in treatment Cycle 1 (cycle duration is 28 days).|Phase 1: Volume of distribution (Vd) of CTX-712. Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacokinetic evaluation performed in treatment Cycle 1 (cycle duration is 28 days).|Phase 1: Elimination half-life of plasma concentration of CTX-712 at terminal phase (T1/2). Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacokinetic evaluation performed in treatment Cycle 1 (cycle duration is 28 days).|Phase 1: Clearance (CL) of CTX-712. Plasma samples for PK analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacokinetic evaluation performed in treatment Cycle 1 (cycle duration is 28 days).|Phase 1: Measurement of the change in RNA splicing by CTX-712 in peripheral blood samples as pharmacodynamic markers. Peripheral blood samples for PD analyses will be collected at predetermined time points and analyzed., Pharmacodynamic evaluation performed in treatment Cycle 1 (cycle duration is 28 days).
