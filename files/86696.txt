A Study of PEP02 in Combination With 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin (LV) in Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial is a multi-center, open-label, phase I, dose escalation study of PEP02 (liposomal encapsulated irinotecan) in combination with 5-FU and LV in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: PEP02|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: LV
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0, 3 weeks
objective tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.0, 6 weeks
In this study, the initial starting dose of PEP02 is 60 mg/m2, and was escalated by increments of 20 mg/m2 between dose levels. 5-FU and LV was given as 24-hour infusion via an implanted central venous catheter, with dose fixed at 2000 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2, respectively. PEP02 was administered on Day 1; 5-FU/LV was started after the end of PEP02 infusion on Day 1 and also on Day 8. Treatment repeated every 3 weeks and it was regarded as one cycle of treatment.
