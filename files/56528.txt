Surgical Positioning of the Arm During Thoracic Surgery -Effect on Shoulder Pain After Surgery?
Up to 85% experience shoulder pain after thoracic surgery, especially on the same side as surgery are performed. Referred phrenic nerve pain is probably one cause of ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP), and positioning of the arm during surgery another. Studies indicates that ISP can be caused by the positioning of the patient during surgery due to muscle -and ligament strain. Can a change in the surgical positioning (less press and stretch) of the ipsilateral arm effect the shoulder pain after thoracic surgery?
