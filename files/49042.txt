Anlotinib Plus Chemotherapy for Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Anlotibib (AL3818) is a kind of innovative medicines approved by State Food and Drug Administration（SFDA:2011L00661） which was researched by Jiangsu Chia-tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2、VEGFR3、PDGFRβ and c-Kit. It has the obvious resistance to new angiogenesis. The trial is to explore Anlotinib for the effectiveness and safety of advanced non-small cell lung cancer who failed first lines of chemotherapy
