A Study of Atezolizumab (an Engineered Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 [PDL1] Antibody) to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase I, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administered as single agent to participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematologic malignancies. The study will be conducted in two cohorts: Dose-escalation cohort and Expansion cohort.
