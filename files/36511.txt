MRD Guided De-intensification of Bendamustine/Rituximab for Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a phase II pilot, single arm, open label study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of MRD adapted duration of BR for untreated or R/R iNHL.
Lymphoma|Indolent Non-hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab
PFS Evaluation, To evaluate the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) for patients treated with Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR) with measurable residual disease directed (MRD) duration of therapy., 2 years|Statistical PFS, The proportion (p) of patients who are progression-free and are alive at 2 years from the initiation of treatment using Lugano Criteria., 2 years
Secondary Outcome Measure, Assess additional clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS),, 2 years|Measurable Residual Disease Evaluation, To determine the rate of MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity at end of treatment and at 2 years post-treatment, 2 years|Adverse Event assessment, Assess adverse effects of treatment, 2 years|Overall Survival Assessment, OS, defined as time from initiation of study treatment until death, or the end of follow-up, whichever occurs first. Patients who are still alive at the end of follow-up will be considered censored., 2 years|Measurable Residual Disease Negativity, To evaluate MRD negativity rate at the end of treatment and at 2 years post-treatment., 2 years|Rate of 3+ adverse events, The rate of grade 3+ adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0.The rate of grade 3+ adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 2 years
Exploratory Outcome Measures, Assess and compare measurable residual disease (MRD) sensitivity of both circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC), both being obtained at baseline, after each cycle, and during follow up, 2 years|Measurable Residual Disease (MRD), Assess MRD level, both ctDNA and circulating tumor cell (CTC) testing, after each cycle of Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR) and correlate with Progression Free Survival (PFS), 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) for Measurable Residual Disease (MRD), To evaluate PFS for patients with low level detectable MRD (10\^-4 to 10\^-6) after 3 cycles of Bendamustine and Rituximab, 2 years|Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) to guide indolent lymphoma treatment evaluation, Evaluate feasibility of using MRD to guide treatment for indolent lymphoma, 2 years|Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) failure rate, Determine MRD test baseline failure rate from ctDNA and Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) testing, 2 years|Infection occruance, Assess occurrence of infection of any grade, 2 years|Secondary malignancy occurrence, Assess occurrence of secondary malignancy, 2 years|Ntural Killer and T cell reconstitution, Assess the rate of NK (natural kiler) cell and T cell subset reconstitution after Bendamustine and Rituximab; distinguish if there is difference between shorter/longer treatment regimens, 2 years|Quality Life Assessment, Assess differences in quality of life based on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-Lym) questionnaire between patients who received varying lengths of treatment., 2 years|Baseline Proliferative Rate, Correlation of baseline proliferative rate, 2 years
This is a phase II pilot, single arm, open label study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of MRD adapted duration of BR for untreated or R/R iNHL.

All patients with untreated or R/R (not previously treated with Bendamustine) iNHL (Follicular Lymphoma (Grade 1-3a2), Marginal Zone Lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma) are candidates for this trial. Patients requiring treatment per treating physician's discretion are eligible for the trial.

Patients who recently started on and received two cycles of Bendamustine at 90 mg/m2 dose with Ritxumab 375 mg/m2 are also eligible for this trial. For these patients, C2D1 BR should be no more than 14 days prior to the time of study enrollment (i.e. enrollment no later than C2D14). Patients who have received two cycles of 90mg/m2 Bendamustine dose with Rituximab 375 mg/m2 can enter the study and initiate cycle 3 once pre-screening and screening procedures have been completed.
