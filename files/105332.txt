Liver Cancer Disparities in American Indian and Alaska Native Persons
We are performing a pilot and feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of HCC screening by US + AFP every 6 months (n=100), the current standard-of-care, versus aMRI + AFP every 6 months (n=100) for 12 months (i.e. at time 0, 6 and 12 months) among AI/AN patients with cirrhosis or HBV.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Cirrhosis, Liver|Hepatitis B
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ultrasound or abbreviated MRI
Compliance with screening protocol, Compliance with conducting all three screening tests, 12 months|Feasibility of screening protocol, Proportion of screening tests conducted that employed the appropriate screening protocol and used appropriate documentation of findings with the LI-RADS system, 12 months
We are performing a pilot and feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of HCC screening by US + AFP every 6 months (n=100), the current standard-of-care, versus aMRI + AFP every 6 months (n=100) for 12 months (i.e. at time 0, 6 and 12 months) among AI/AN patients with cirrhosis or HBV.

We will compare the aMRI vs. the US arm with respect to the following outcomes:

1. Compliance/feasibility of conducting all three screening tests (0, 6 and 12 months) - Primary Outcome
2. Proportion of screening tests conducted that employed the appropriate screening protocol and used appropriate documentation of findings with the LI-RADS system - Primary Outcome
3. Proportion diagnosed with HCC and stage at diagnosis - Secondary Outcome
