Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast Recurrence (SCAN-B-rec)
Prospective multicenter observational study to assess molecular drivers of metastatic breast cancer and disease evolution upon therapeutic pressure.

The main aim is to develop and validate prognostic, predictive and pathogenic markers in clinically well-characterized population-based material of breast cancer tumors and the corresponding normal tissue.These data will be used to characterize recurrent breast cancer on a molecular level, study tumor evolution, develop biomarkers of response/resistance to targeted therapy in the metastatic setting, enroll patients on targeted treatment clinical studies and to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to therapy.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Biopsies, blood
