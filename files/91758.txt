A Study of E7386 in Combination With Other Anticancer Drug(s) in Participants With Solid Tumor
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7386 in combination with other anticancer drug(s), and to determine the optimal dose of E7386 in combination with lenvatinib in endometrial carcinoma (EC) (for EC Dose Optimization Part only).
Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Liver Neoplasms|Colorectal Neoplasms|Endometrial Neoplasms
DRUG: E7386|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Dose Escalation Part: Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be defined as any of the events that are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to therapy with the study medication. Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE 5.0)., Cycle 0 (Cycle 0 length=6 or 7 days) up to Cycle 1 (Cycle 1 length=28 days)|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiating post anti-cancer treatment (up to approximately 60 months)|Dose Optimization Part: Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 by Investigator Assessment at Week 24, The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR). The ORR will be assessed by investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for dose optimization part., At Week 24
Dose Escalation Part: Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for E7386, Day 1 to Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Lenvatinib, Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for E7386, Day 1 to Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Lenvatinib, Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: AUC: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve for E7386, Day 1 to Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: AUC: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve for Lenvatinib, Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: CL/F: Apparent Total Body Clearance for E7386, Day 1 to Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: CL/F: Apparent Total Body Clearance for Lenvatinib, Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: Vz/F: Apparent Volume of Distribution for E7386, Day 1 to Day 8|Dose Escalation Part: Vz/F: Apparent Volume of Distribution for Lenvatinib, Day 8|Percentage of Participants with Best Overall Response (BOR), BOR is defined as confirmed CR, confirmed PR, stable disease (SD), PD, and not evaluable (NE). The BOR will be assessed by investigator based on Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) for HCC subparts in dose escalation part and based on RECIST version 1.1 for ST subparts in dose escalation part, and for HCC subpart, CRC subpart, EC subpart in dose expansion part., From first dose of study drug until progression of disease (PD), development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 60 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a BOR of CR or PR. The ORR will be assessed by investigator based on mRECIST for HCC subparts in dose escalation part and based on RECIST version 1.1 for ST-subparts in dose escalation part, and for HCC subpart, CRC subpart, EC subpart in dose expansion part., From first dose of study drug until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 60 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a BOR of CR, PR, or SD. The DCR will be assessed by investigator based on mRECIST for HCC subparts in dose escalation part and based on RECIST version 1.1 for ST-subparts in dose escalation part, and for HCC subpart, CRC subpart, EC subpart in dose expansion part., From first dose of study drug until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 60 months)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with a BOR of CR, PR, or durable SD. The CBR will be assessed by investigator based on mRECIST for HCC subparts in dose escalation part and based on RECIST version 1.1 for ST-subparts in dose escalation part, and for HCC subpart, CRC subpart, EC subpart in dose expansion part., From first dose of study drug until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant requests to discontinue, withdrawal of consent or study termination (up to approximately 60 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of the first documentation of confirmed PD or death, whichever occurs first., From first dose of study drug until PD, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 60 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to death due to any cause. OS will be calculated for all subparts in dose expansion part, dose optimization part, and HCC subparts in dose escalation part only., From first dose of study drug until death from any cause (up to approximately 60 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of PR or CR to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., From first dose of study drug until PD, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 60 months)
The Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion parts of the study have completed enrollment. The Dose Optimization part of the study is enrolling participants with endometrial carcinoma (EC) only.
