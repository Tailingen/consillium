Role of Surgery in Treatment of Recurrent Brian Glioma:Prognostic Factors and Outcome
role of surgery in treatment of recurrent brain glioma prognostic factors and outcome measures Role of surgery : In patients with Grade I gliomas, such as pilocytic astrocytomas, resection is potentially curative.

For more diffuse invasive gliomas (Grade II or higher), initial management typically includes maximal safe resection when possible.

Increasing evidence supports an association between extent of resection and prolonged progression-free and overall survival for patients with diffuse gliomas of all types and grades Many studies reported that more that 90%of patients with glioma showed recurrence at the orginal tumor location.

Review the outcomes of re-operation in treatment of recurrent brain gliomas To determine the prognostic factors which can predict which patient would benefit from multiple surgery .

Trail to Improve the outcome of these patients and decrease rate of complications

karnofsky performance status, A standard way of measuring the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks. The Karnofsky Performance Status scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the patient is better able to carry out daily activities. Karnofsky Performance Status may be used to determine a patient's prognosis, to measure changes in a patient's ability to function, or to decide if a patient could be included in a clinical trial. Also called KPS., 1year
