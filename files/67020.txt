Stereotactic Radiosurgery Versus Radiofrequency Ablation for Primary Liver Cancer
A phase II clinical trial of stereotactic radiosurgery versus radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of inoperable primary liver cancer in specific sites
Primary Liver Cancer
PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)|PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation therapy
PFS, Until the end of the study, about 2 years
Overall survival rate, Until the end of the study, about 2 years|Local control rate, Until the end of the study, about 2 years|Intrahepatic control rate, Until the end of the study, about 2 years|Extrahepatic control rate, Until the end of the study, about 2 years
This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled Phase II clinical trial aimed at recruiting patients with primary liver cancer who are deemed inoperable after surgical evaluation, with tumor lesions located near major blood vessels, the diaphragm, the liver capsule, or the porta hepatis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation as treatment options for such patients. It must be determined by the investigator whether stereotactic radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation is the preferred treatment for these patients. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment groups: stereotactic radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation. The study is expected to enroll 65 patients in each group.
