Studying Biomarkers in Blood Samples From Patients With Invasive Cervical Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in blood samples from patients with invasive cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer
GENETIC: proteomic profiling|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Generation of a serum proteomic profile using banked pre-treatment serum specimens that may have potential utility for cervical cancer prognosis (overall survival and progression-free survival [PFS])
Generation of a serum proteomic profile using banked post-treatment serum specimens that may have potential utility for cervical cancer prognosis (overall survival and PFS)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To develop a serum proteomic profile for cervical cancer using banked pre-treatment serum specimens from patients with invasive cervical cancer and to determine if this serum proteomic profile has possible utility in cervical cancer prognosis.

Secondary

* To develop a serum proteomic profile for cervical cancer using banked post-treatment serum specimens from these patients and to determine if this serum proteomic profile has possible utility in cervical cancer prognosis.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Banked serum specimens are used to generate proteomic profiles.
