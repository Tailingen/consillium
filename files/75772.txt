Immunotherapy Adjuvant Trial in Patients With Stage I-III Merkel Cell Carcinoma
The I-MAT trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of adjuvant Avelumab in patients with stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma aiming to explore the efficacy of avelumab as adjuvant immunotherapy.

Recurrence-free survival (RFS), Recurrence-free survival (RFS) as the primary endpoint, is anticipated to be analysed over an average planned follow-up of 3.5 years. An analysis of RFS at the 24 month time point of follow-up will also be conducted as it is anticipated that the minimum follow-up for participants will be 24 months and the sample size rationale utilises RFS rates at 24 months in historical controls. RFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation until the first date of any signs or symptoms of recurrence of tumour., 24 Months
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months. Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the date of death due to any cause., 24 Months|Disease-specific survival (DSS), Disease-specific survival at 24 months from treatment initiation. Disease-specific survival is the percentage of participants who have not died from Merkel Cell Carcinoma, 24 Months|Rate of loco-regional failure free survival (LRFFS), Rate of loco-regional failure free survival (LRFFS) is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the first recurrence of the loco-regional tumour., 24 Months|Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), DMFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the first evidence of distant metastatic disease., 24 Months|Treatment toxicity and tolerability as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0, Rate of treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Safety will be measured by serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs assessed as per NCI CTCAE v5.0, including immune-related adverse events., 24 Months|Patient-reported quality of life (QoL) as assessed by FACT-M questionnaire, FACT-M form (version 4) will be utilised. This will include patient-reported questions relating to physical wellbeing, social/family wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, functional wellbeing and additional patient concerns which are measured from 0-4 (Not at all - Very Much)., 24 Months
Rate of Merkel cell polyomavirus positivity in stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma, To identify Merkel cell polyomavirus MCPyV virus status. To correlate viral aetiology-rate of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) positivity in pathology specimens in stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma with outcome from adjuvant treatment., 24 Months|Correlating whole exome sequencing (WES) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression with immunotherapy response and outcomes in early stage MCC, To evaluate the relationship between somatic mutations in cancer genes or the total mutation burden of the cancer with immunotherapy response and outcome following adjuvant therapy., 24 Months|Correlating immune infiltrates by multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) with survival endpoints, To address whether immune infiltrates and PD-L1 expression are associated with survival., 24 Months|Utility of circulating biomarkers in predicting recurrence in early stage MCC, To identify predictive biomarkers for response and resistance to immunotherapy in patients with stage I-III MCC using archival tissue and peripheral blood., 24 Months
The I-MAT trial is a phase II, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial for patients with stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Participants on the trial will receive either avelumab or placebo for 6 months. The primary aim of the I-MAT trial is to develop an effective, well-tolerated adjuvant immunotherapy regimen for patients with stage I-III MCC, post a range of definitive loco-regional treatment options.
