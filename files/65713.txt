LC Bead Embolization Agent With Doxorubicin in the Treatment Liver Metastasis From Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine if LC beads loaded with Doxorubicin are a safe and effective treatment for melanoma that has spread to the liver.
Stage IV Melanoma
DEVICE: LC beads loaded with Doxorubicin
Incidence of Adverse Events, Adverse events were collected from all 20 subjects., Date of surgery through 2 years post procedure or until patient death
Percentage of Tumor Response, Progression is determined using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Progressive disease is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since start of treatment OR appearance of one or more new lesions greater then 1cm in size. Percentage of tumor response will be assessed up to 1 year post treatment., Percentage of tumor response assessed up to 1 year post treatment.
In this study, trans-arterial chemoembolization will be used to deliver LC beads loaded with Doxorubicin directly into liver tumors resulting from malignant melanoma.
