Circulating Tumor Cells in Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to identify circulating tumor cells in patients with solid tumors. Quantify and characterize these cells, collect patient information in regards to the patient's cancer. Develop a database and a sample repository where future analysis could be done.

Documentation of the Quality of CTCs from Patients with Solid Tumors, Enumeration of participants' circulating solid tumor cells, Through study completion, an average of 5 years|Documentation of the Characterization of CTCs from Patients with Solid Tumors, Characterization of participants' circulating solid tumor cells, Through study completion, an average of 5 years
The primary purpose of this correlative study is to create a prospective database documenting the quantity and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in solid tumor patients as identified by a various laboratory techniques and analyses. The investigators are developing this resource to provide data to achieve the following objectives: 1) correlate CTCs with known prognostic factors, 2) correlate CTCs with burden of disease, 3) evaluate the ability of CTCs to be used in the surveillance of disease recurrence, and 4) evaluate CTCs ability to be used as a biomarker for treatment response.
