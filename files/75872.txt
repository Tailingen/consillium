Preop fSRS for Resectable Brain Metastases
The purpose of the study is to determine whether treatment with pre-operative hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery will improve time to local failure (TTLF) compared to the current standard of care.

RADIATION: Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Time from Start of fSRS until Progression, Time from start of hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery until first occurrence of local progression of disease, or death. If none of these events occur, patients will be censored on date of last contact., up to 12 months
Time from Start of fSRS until First Development of Leptomeningeal Disease or Death, Time from start of hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery until first development of leptomeningeal disease, or death. If this event does not occur, patients will be censored on date of last contact., up to 12 months
Local Control Rate, Local control rate is defined as the freedom from local progression, at 6 months|Local Control Rate, Local control rate is defined as the freedom from local progression, at 12 months|Rate of Leptomeningeal Disease (LMD), Rate of LMD is defined as the percentage of participants that progressed to leptomeningeal disease, at 6 months|Rate of Leptomeningeal Disease (LMD), Rate of LMD is defined as the percentage of participants that progressed to leptomeningeal disease, at 12 months|Rate of distant brain recurrence (DBR), Rate of distant brain recurrence defined as the percentage of participants that experienced distant brain recurrence, at 6 months|Rate of distant brain recurrence (DBR), Rate of distant brain recurrence defined as the percentage of participants that experienced distant brain recurrence, at 12 months
