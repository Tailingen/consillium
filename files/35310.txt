Bioequivalence And Food Effect Study Of Bosutinib In Healthy Subjects
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the clinical tablet formulation (100 mg x 5) to the clinical capsule formulation (100 mg x 5) in healthy subjects under fed condition (Cohort 1) and to investigate the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib after administration of the proposed commercial tablet formulation (100 mg x 4) in healthy subjects (Cohort 2).
