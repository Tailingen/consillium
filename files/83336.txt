Ketogenic Diet Adjunctive to Salvage Chemotherapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma:a Pilot Study
Recently, ketogenic diet has been recognized a useful treatment strategy for glioblastoma in vitro.

Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketogenic adjuvant to salvage chemotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Ketogenic diet|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Standard diet
Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Effects, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse effects while on ketogenic diet., one year
The Chemosensitivity of Tumor, MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be used to measure changes in brain tumor size (cm\^2)., one year|Overall Survival, Participants were followed until reported death, one year|Ketosis, Urine and blood ketosis (mmol/L) were measured, one year|Quality of Life, quality of life measured by the Karnofsky Performance Scale, one year
Diet change by limiting carbohydrates and increasing the proportion of fatty acids and proteins can lead to ketogenic metabolism and might limit energy production in tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth.

In a pilot of recurrent glioblastoma, ketogenic diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as interventional group and standard diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as control group.

The study examines whether a ketogenic diet adjunctive to salvage chemotherapy can be applied to the patients and may inhibit tumor growth and influence the quality of life of the patients.
