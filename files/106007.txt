Outcomes of Triaged Family Care in Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers and to evaluate two doses of a family-based program of care versus control.

The purpose of this study is to:

1. determine if family dyads randomly assigned to either a brief or extensive family-based program of care have better proximal and distal outcomes from both a clinical and economic perspective than dyads randomly assigned to usual care
2. determine if the brief or extensive program of care has a differential effect on patient and caregiver outcomes depending on the patient's baseline risk for distress status (high versus low).

A longitudinal, randomized clinical trial is being used for patients with advanced lung, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer and their caregivers.
