Camrelizumab Combined With CD30 CAR-T in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory CD30+ Lymphoma
The is a phase II, single-arm, open-label clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with CD30 CAR-T in the treatment of r/r CD30+ lymphoma. Plan to recruit 30 subjects with r/r CD30+ lymphomaã€‚
Lymphoma|Relapse/Recurrence
BIOLOGICAL: CD30 CAR-T|DRUG: Camrelizumab
overall response rate, including complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), up to 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To evaluate the safety of camrelizumab combined with CD30 CAR-T in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD30+ lymphoma., up to 90 days
overall survival (OS), The time from the day of enrollment to death due to any cause. If it is unclear whether the subject has died, OS refers to the duration from the day of enrollment to the date of the last follow-up., 24 months|Duration of remission (DOR), Defined as the time between the initial appearance of complete or partial remission for a subject in objective remission to the appearance of disease recurrence or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The time from the start of the trial to the day of PD or to death due to any reason. If the subject's disease status is unclear, PFS refers to the duration from the day of enrollment to the date of the last follow-up., 24 months|Time to Remission (TTR)., The time from the first day of medication to the first assessment of PR or CR, whichever comes first. Only applicable to subjects with CR or PR., 12 months
The copy number of CD30 CAR-T cells, The copy number of CD30 CAR-T cells amplified (copies/mcgDNA) in peripheral blood after administration;, 12 months
This study intends to combine CD30 CAR-T (provided by Wuhan Bio-Raid Biotechnology Co., Ltd) and Camrelizumab (provided by Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) to treat r/r CD30+ lymphoma, to observe the safety and effectiveness of the combined treatment, and to study the effect of PD-1 antibody on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CAR-T. Obtain a better treatment plan and provide a new strategy for the treatment of clinically r/r CD30+ lymphoma.
