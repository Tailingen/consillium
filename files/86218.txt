Phase II Study of SBRT as Treatment for Oligometastases in Prostate Cancer
This study aims to probe the effect of SBRT as a treatment oligometastases of prostate cancer, regardless of basal treatment received, and I know the response, biochemical control, the progression-free survival as well as their impact on quality of life.

Primary Objective: Local and symptomatic oligometastases Control of prostate cancer treated by SBRT.

Secondary Objectives: Analyzing biochemical progression rates, progression-free survival, chemotherapy-free survival and overall survival. Analyze toxicities and quality of life of patients before and after treatment
Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Oligometastases
Number of patients without disease progression of prostate cancer treated by SBRT, Number of patients without disease progression of local and symptomatic oligometastases of prostate cancer treated by SBRT expressed as total number and percentage, 5 years
Overall Survival measured with Kaplan-Meier method, the time to death will be defined as the time between the date when the patient is treated with SBRT and the date of death, or the last follow-up visit., patients will be followed up an average of 5 years|Number of patients with an adverse events., Analyze toxicities in every patient during the first 3 months after the treatment with SBRT. Every significant Adverse Event will be graded as CTC-AE v.4.03. For Pain related adverse events, visual analogic scale (VAS) will be used., 3 months after the SBRT treatment|Free disease progression survival measured with Kaplan-Meier method, the time to disease progression will be defined as the time between the date when the patient is treated with SBRT and the date of biochemical (PSA increased upper to 2 ng/mL) o radiological progression or the last follow-up visit., the patients will be followed up an expected average of 5 years|Quality of life questionnaire FACT-P, The Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy-Prostate Questionnaire (FACT-P) will be performed at baseline and 3 months after the SBRT treatment., baseline and 3rd month after the SBRT treatment.
