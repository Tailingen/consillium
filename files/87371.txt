An Immuno-therapy Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness, Safety and Tolerability of Nivolumab or Nivolumab in Combination With Other Agents in Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer
The first part of the study is the Dose Escalation Phase designed to establish the safety of nivolumab at different dose levels for each of the three cohorts (uninfected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subjects, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected HCC subjects, and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected subjects).

The second part of the study is the Expansion Phase designed to generate additional clinical data at specified doses for each of the 3 cohorts. A third cohort has been added in this study to compare the efficacy of nivolumab and sorafenib in the treatment of Advanced HCC. A fourth cohort will generate data on the safety and efficacy of the combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the treatment of Advanced HCC. In the fifth cohort, additional clinical data will be generated for Child-Pugh B subjects. A Cabozantinib Combination Cohort has been added to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib and nivolumab with ipilimumab in combination with cabozantinib.
