Efficacy of Ear Acupuncture in Preventing Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Cancer Patients
Chemotherapy is a cancer therapy performed on advanced cancer with quite good success, but this therapy has quite a lot of side effects. Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting or commonly known as CINV, is a condition of nausea and vomiting experienced by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with a prevalence of around 80% of all patients undergoing chemotherapy, and 40% has the potential to become severe. This study aims to determine the efficacy of a new acupuncture modality, namely the press needle, in preventing CINV symptoms in pediatric patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.
