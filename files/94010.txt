Molecular Characterization of Primary Mucosal Melanoma
Primary mucosal melanomas (MPM) are rarer than cutaneous melanomas, but also more severe. They are usually refractory to conventional approaches, regularly excluded from major therapeutic programs and not sensitive to new targeted therapies orphans. " The identification of therapeutic targets and accessibility to existing, developing or future targeted therapies improves the survival of patients with MPM.

The principal goal is to describe, using a large panel of genes, the prevalence of major mutations in a cohort of MPMs based on the population of a French region.
