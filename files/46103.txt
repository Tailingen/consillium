A Phase I Study of Anlotinib on Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics
Anlotibib (ALTN) is a kind of innovative medicines approved by State Food and Drug Administration（SFDA） which was researched by Jiangsu Chia-tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

ALTN is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. It has the obvious resistance to new angiogenesis.
