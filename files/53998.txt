A First-in-human Study of IBI343 in Subjects With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1a/b, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human, dose escalation, expansion and extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and DLTs to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and preliminary efficacy of IBI343 (study drug) in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.
Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: IBI343
