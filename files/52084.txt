The ACC Preclinical Research Platform for Precision Oncology
The ACC Preclinical Research Platform for Precision Oncology is a retrospective and prospective observational study focused on the implementation and validation of the application of PDCM (Patient Derived Cancer Models) generated from tissues or cells of patients with neoplastic disease, as a tool to improve molecular and biological knowledge of tumours and to test the efficacy and sensitivity of pharmacological treatments.
Solid Tumor|Hematologic Neoplasms
number of PDCM (patient derived cancer models), PDCM will be generated from tissues and cells, 12 months|number of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) e RNA-seq performed, WES and RNA seq will be performed on tissues and blood, 12 months
number of PDCM shared within the network, PDCM will be generated from tissues and cells and shared within the network, 12 months
This is a retrospective and prospective observational study, focused on the implementation and validation of the application of PDCM, generated from tissue or cells of patients, including paediatric patients, with solid and haematological malignancies, as a tool to improve molecular and biological knowledge of tumours and to test the efficacy and sensitivity of pharmacological treatments.

An up-to-date database of all PDCMs available at the participating italian hospitals will be generated and enriched with new models generated during the course of the project. The sharing of models and procedures between the different hospitals will facilitate their molecular and phenotypic characterisation, also in parallel with the tumours of origin, as well as their validation as tools for testing the efficacy of drugs for precision medicine. By establishing common workflows and standards and performing cross-validation experiments it is planned to build a network of reference centres as a resource for drug screening on 2D and 3D models.
