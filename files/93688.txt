Effectiveness and Safety of Yisaipu Combined With Tripterygium Wilfordii for Active RA
In this 24-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of subcutaneously injected Yisaipu, a Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Fusion Protein, combined with oral Tripterygium Wilfordii for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.

* from 1 to 2: disability moderate to severe,
* from 2 to 3: severe to very severe disability.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of YISAIPU plus Tripterygium wilfordii (T2w) for the treatment of RA patients. YISAIPU is a recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor fusion protein, and tripterygium wilfordii is a chloroform/methanol extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.

Objectives:

1. To compare the efficacy of YISAIPU plus T2w versus MTX monotherapy for the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA.
2. To evaluate the safety of YISAIPU plus T2w in patients with RA for 24 weeks.

Design:

This is a randomized, 24-week, double-blind, parallel group study, and 506 patients with active RA will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following four parallel treatment arms:

1. Methotrexate monotherapy
2. T2w monotherapy
3. YISAIPU plus methotrexate
4. YISAIPU plus T2w

Escape:

On week 13, all participants with inadequate response, defined as a \<30% improvement of swollen and tender joint counts from baseline, will switch to YISAIPU plus T2w treatment throughout the study.

Endpoints :

1. ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates at 12 and 24 weeks.
2. DAS 28 (CRP) and DAS 28 (ESR) at 12 and 24 weeks.
3. EULAR response rates at 12 and 24 weeks.
4. Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) at 12 and 24 weeks.
5. Patient assessment of arthritis pain at 12 and 24 weeks.
6. Patient and physician global assessment of arthritis at 12 and 24 weeks.
