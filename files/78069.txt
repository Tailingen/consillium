Optimized Dual CD33/CLL1 CAR T Cells in Subjects With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm Phase 1 Study to evaluate safety and tolerability of optimized Dual CD33/CLL1 CAR T Cells in subjects with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Maximum of twenty subjects will be enrolled. After the collection of PBMC and about 5 days before infusion, lymphodepletion chemotherapy (fludarabine at 30 mg/m\^2/day and cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m\^2/day) will be administrated for 3 days.

Then this study will be using BOIN1/2 approach from starting dose 1: 1×10\^6 (±20%) to dose 2: 5×10\^6 (±20%). If the manufactured cells were not sufficient to meet the preassigned standard dose criteria, patients are given infusion at a low dose of 5×10\^5 (±20%) /kg.
