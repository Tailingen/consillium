A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HLX07 Combination Therapy in Patients With Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is conducted in patients with advanced metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This study includes a single arm: the patients will receive HLX07 combination therapy with HLX10 and chemotherapy (carboplatin+etoposide) as first-line treatment. All of eligible patients will receive study drug treatment until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of informed consent (whichever occurs first, HLX10 treatment up to 2 years).
