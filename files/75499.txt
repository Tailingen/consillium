A Study Of Avelumab In Patients With Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer (JAVELIN Bladder 100)
The main purpose of this study is to compare maintenance treatment with avelumab plus best supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone, to determine if avelumab has an effect on survival in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that did not worsen during or following completion of first-line chemotherapy.
Urothelial Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Avelumab|OTHER: Best Supportive Care|BIOLOGICAL: Following the planned interim analysis for this study: Avelumab
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to discontinuation from the study, death or date of censoring, whichever occurred first (for a maximum duration of 41 months)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), BICR assessed PFS: Duration from randomization until disease progression (PD) or death. PD as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was smallest on study). In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. Appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier. PFS data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants with no event (PD or death), who started new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event or with an event after 2 or more missing tumor assessments., From randomization to date of progression of disease, discontinuation from the study, death or date of censoring, whichever occurred first (for a maximum duration of 41 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator, Investigator assessed PFS: Duration from randomization to first documentation of PD or death, whichever occurred first.
