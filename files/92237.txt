A Clinical Trial of the Safety and Anti-Tumor Activity of AB-201 in Subjects With Advanced HER2+ Solid Tumors
This clinical trial will enroll subjects with HER2+ solid tumors and is conducted in two phases. The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability of AB-201 in subjects with advanced HER2+ solid tumors. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of AB-201.

Subjects will receive up to 3 doses of AB-201, followed by scheduled assessments of overall health and tumor response.
