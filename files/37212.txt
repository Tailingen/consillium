A Study of Daratumumab Plus Lenalidomide Versus Lenalidomide Alone as Maintenance Treatment in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Who Are Minimal Residual Disease Positive After Frontline Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to evaluate conversion rate to minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity following the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide relative to lenalidomide alone, when administered as maintenance treatment to anti-cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) treatment naive participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are MRD positive as determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) at screening, following high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Percentage of Participants Who Had Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Conversion From Baseline to 12 Months After Start of Maintenance Treatment as Determined by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), Percentage of participants who achieved MRD negative (MRD conversion) status from baseline to 12 months after maintenance treatment was defined as percentage of participants who were MRD positive at baseline (randomization) and achieved MRD negative status (at 10\^-5) during the time period from randomization to 12 months plus 2 months window, but prior to progressive disease (PD) and subsequent anti-myeloma therapy., From randomization up to 12 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From randomization to either disease progression or death (up to 7.1 years)|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Overall MRD (at 10^-5) Negativity Conversion From Baseline to End of Study Treatment Period, From randomization up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment or disease progression or initiation of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (up to 3 years)|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Durable (Greater Than or Equal to [>=] 12 Months) MRD Negative Status (10^-5), From randomization up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment or disease progression or initiation of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (up to 3 years)|Response Rates by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 Criteria, From randomization up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment or disease progression or initiation of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (up to 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), From randomization up to 7.1 years|Duration of Complete Response (CR), From date of initial documentation of CR or sCR up to first documented disease progression or death due to disease progression whichever occurs first (up to 7.1 years)|Health-related Quality of Life: Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), From baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) up to 7.1 years|Health-related Quality of Life: Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Questionnaire-5-level (EQ-5D-5L), From baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) up to 7.1 years|Health-related Quality of Life: Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires-Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20), From baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1) up to 7.1 years|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 30 days after the last study treatment or day prior to start of subsequent antimyeloma therapy (up to 7.1 years)
