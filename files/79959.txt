Magnetic Tracer in the Sentinel Node Procedure in Breast Cancer: the Non-radioactive Alternative for Radio-isotopes
Rationale:

In breast cancer, a sentinel node procedure is performed to investigate whether malignant cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This is an important part of determining the stage of breast cancer and the final treatment plan.

A disadvantage of the sentinel node procedure is that it is performed using radioactive tracing with concomitant radiation exposure for the patients and involved health care personnel. In addition, the use of radioactive tracing puts high demands on the logistics in the operation theatre: the capacity of patients that can be treated in one day is limited and the radio-active tracing leads to many time-consuming precautionary measures.

A radiation free alternative would therefore have multiple advantages. Not only with respect to radiation exposure for the patients and health care workers, but also by reducing the waiting time for operation for the patients as it will make the planning of patients for surgery more efficient.

Recently, a radiation free tracer for the sentinel node procedure has become available (Magtrace). This tracer has been tested in small-case studies and is currently used as standard care in several hospitals around the world.

Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Magtrace in the sentinel node procedure in breast cancer in the Breast Care Centre in Zuyderland Medical Centre; with the ultimate goal to make the sentinel node procedure a radiation free process.

Study design:

A prospective cohort of forty patients with breast cancer and an indication for a sentinel node procedure will be injected with both Technetium (radioisotope) and Magtrace (magnetic). All patients in this study will receive both tracers.

Study population:

Patients of 18 years or older with breast cancer and an indication for a sentinel node procedure will be included. These patients will be recruited by their breast surgeon in the outpatient department of the Breast Care Centre in Zuyderland Medical Centre.

Intervention (if applicable):

Sentinel node procedure using a magnetic tracer next to Technetium.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

The concordance in detection of sentinel nodes by Magtrace and the Technetium tracer, measured by the sensitivity and specificity of Magtrace in detecting sentinel nodes with Technetium tracer as gold standard.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

The goal of this project is evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of Magtrace in the sentinel node procedure. To establish that Magtrace is a non-inferior and a non-radioactive alternative for Technetium with respect to reliability in detecting metastases. The ultimate goal is to make the sentinel node procedure a radiation free process.
