Vascular Anomaly Pathology and Genomics Biopsy Study
The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of core biopsy of vascular anomalies for clinical pathology and clinical genomics studies.
Vascular Malformations|Vascular Anomaly|Hemangioma|Arteriovenous Malformations|Venous Malformation|Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome|Lymphatic Malformation
PROCEDURE: Percutaneous Vascular Anomaly/Malformation Biopsy
Adequacy of core biopsy of vascular anomalies for clinical genomics studies, DNA and RNA will be extracted from the biopsy specimens, undergo qualitative/quantitative quality control assessment and be analyzed by whole genome sequencing (DNA) and RNA sequence analysis (RNA-seq) to determine the adequacy of vascular anomaly biopsy for vascular anomaly genomics characterization., 18 months|Adequacy of core biopsy of vascular anomalies for clinical pathology evaluation, Tissue from the vascular anomaly biopsies will undergo histopathology and immunohistochemical staining to determine the adequacy of vascular anomaly core biopsy for clinical pathology characterization., 18 months
Safety of vascular anomaly core biopsy, Number of participants with biopsy-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 30 days
Vascular anomalies or vascular malformations often are treated with minimally invasive sclerotherapy, embolization or ablation based on clinical and imaging features without acquisition of tissue. Over the last two decades there have been significant advancements in the understanding of the genetic basis for various vascular anomalies/malformations, which may guide use of therapies for individualized treatment.

As such, given the emergence of novel medications for treatment of vascular anomalies/malformations based on genetic information, acquisition of tissue for pathology and genomic characterization will be increasingly important as treatment of vascular anomalies/vascular malformations moves toward individualized medicine approach.
