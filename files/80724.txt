Two-Part, Open-Label, Multi-Center, Phase 1/2 Study of BIW-8962 as Monotherapy in Subjects With Lung Cancer
This Phase 1/2 study is designed to assess the following: safety and tolerability of BIW-8962, Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in Phase 1 in subjects with advanced/recurrent lung cancers or mesothelioma and preliminary efficacy in Phase 2 in subjects with advanced/recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Phase 1 Portion : Non Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC), Small Cell Lung Cancer(SCLC), Mesothelioma|Phase 2 Portion : Small Cell Lung Cancer(SCLC)
DRUG: BIW-8962
Phase 1 - To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD), Phase 1 -Adverse Event collection and assessment will be done for all potentially treated subjects to assess the safety, tolerability, and determine the DLTs, maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., First 3-week cycle of treatment|Phase 2 - To assess the objective response rate(Partial Response and Complete Response), Phase 2 - Tumor response and progression will be evaluated every 6 weeks using RECIST v 1.1. Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) will be confirmed 4 weeks after first detection of response., Until Progressive Disease (PD) determined
Phase 1 - To evaluate preliminary efficacy, Phase 1 - Tumor response progression will be evaluated using RECIST V1.1 for the assessment of efficacy, Until Progressive Disease (PD) determined|Phase 1 - To determine the q3w pharmacokinetic profile of BIW-8962, Phase 1 - Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as Maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), minimum concentration(Cmin), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (t1/2), clearance (CL), and etc., are assessed., Pre-dose, and Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 15 in Cycle 1 and 3, Pre-dose in Cycle 2, 4, 5,and up to Cycle 6|Phase 2 - To assess safety and tolerance, Phase 2 - All safety information will be collected and then evaluated., Every 3 weeks, until 45days after the last dose or within 7 days prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment
This Phase 1/2 study is designed to assess the following: safety and tolerability of BIW-8962, Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in Phase 1 in subjects with advanced/recurrent lung cancers or mesothelioma and preliminary efficacy in Phase 2 in subjects with advanced/recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer.
