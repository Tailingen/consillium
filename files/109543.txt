Phase Ib Trial of LEE011 With Everolimus (RAD001) and Exemestane in the Treatment of Hormone Receptor Positive HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
Dose Escalation part of the study: To estimate the MTD(s) and/ or RP2D of LEE011 in combination with everolimus + exemestane, and LEE011 in combination with exemestane, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of the combinations of everolimus + exemestane + LEE011 and LEE011 + exemestane in patients with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer

Dose Expansion part of the study: To characterize the safety and tolerability of the triplet combination of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane in patients na√Øve or refractory to CDK4/6 inhibitor based therapy, and the safety and tolerability of the doublet combination of LEE011 + exemestane in patients refractory to CDK4/6 inhibitor based therapy (except patients treated with prior LEE011 are not allowed in Group 3).

DRUG: ribociclib (LEE011)|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Everolimus (RAD001)
Dose Escalation: Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as treatment-related toxicity (classified according Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4) occurring during the first 28 treatment days and meeting specific protocol-predefined criteria., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Dose Expansion: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse events were collected for approximately 4.5 years for dose expansion including the 30 days safety follow-up period., Approximately 4.5 years after FPFV
Dose Escalation: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse events were collected for approximately 6.5 years for dose escalation including the 30 days safety follow-up period., Approximately 6.5 years after FPFV|Dose Escalation and Expansion: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete response or partial response., Approximately 6.5 years for Dose Escalation and 4.5 years for Dose Espansion after FPFV|Dose Escalation and Expansion: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete Response or Partial Response or Stable Disease., Approximately 6.5 years for Dose Escalation and 4.5 years for Dose expansion after FPFV|Dose Escalation and Expansion: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is the Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease lasting 24 weeks or longer, Approximately 6.5 years for Dose Escalation and 4.5 years for Dose Espansion after FPFV|Dose Expansion: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is calculated as the time from the date of first documented response (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) to the first documented date of progression or death due to underlying cancer. The DOR is not applicable as none of the patients in the expansion treatment groups (triplet treatment naive, triplet treatment refractory and doublet treatment refractory) had a CR or PR, Approximately 4.5 years for dose expansion after FPFV|Dose Expansion: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment., Approximately 4.5 years after FPFV|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: AUC0-24h at Day 1 of Cycle 1, AUC0-24h is the area under the drug concentration-time curve during a dosing interval (mass x time x volume-1)., 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 1 Day 1|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: AUC0-24h at at Day 15 of Cycle 1, AUC0-24h is the area under the drug concentration-time curve during a dosing interval (mass x time x volume-1)., 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 1 Day 15|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: Cmax at Day 1 of Cycle 1, Cmax is the maximum observed drug concentration after drug administration (mass x volume-1)., 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 1 Day 1|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: Cmax at Day 15 of Cycle 1, Cmax is the maximum observed drug concentration after drug administration (mass x volume-1)., 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 1 Day 15|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: Tmax at Day 1 of Cycle 1, Tmax is the time to reach maximum plasma/blood/serum drug concentration (time)., 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 1 Day 1|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: Tmax at Day 15 of Cycle 1, Tmax is the time to reach maximum plasma/blood/serum drug concentration (time)., 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 15 Day 1|Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: Racc at Day 15 of Cycle 1, Racc is the accumulation ratio calculated as AUCtau,ss / AUCtau,sd, 6 Cycles of treatment (28 day cycles): Cycle 15 Day 1
The primary purpose of the phase Ib part of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane in patients with ER+ Her2- advanced breast cancer. This part of the study will also assess safety, tolerability, and PK of the LEE011 + exemestane, LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane combinations.

The Dose Expansion part of the study will evaluate the triple combination of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane and the double combination of LEE011 + exemestane for safety and tolerability.
