Stereotactical Photodynamic Therapy With 5-aminolevulinic Acid (GliolanÂ®) in Recurrent Glioblastoma
In this multicenter, randomized, non-blinded trial the efficacy and safety of stereotactical photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid will be investigated in 106 patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma Multiforme, Adult
DRUG: Stereotactic biopsy followed by stereotactical photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid|PROCEDURE: Stereotactic biopsy
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) measured as time from the day of randomization until diagnosis of progressive disease as determined by MRI according to RANO criteria (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria) or death from any cause, through study completion (at least 1.5 years and a maximum of 5 years) or until progression or death
6-month PFS rate, Progression free survival (PFS) measured as time from the day of randomization until diagnosis of progressive disease as determined by MRI according to RANO criteria or death from any cause, for each patient up to 6 months after randomization or until progression has occurred|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) measured as time from the day of randomization until death, through study completion (at least 1.5 years and a maximum of 5 years) or until death|Progression free time, Progression free time as time from the day of randomization until progressive disease (death is regarded as censored), through study completion (at least 1.5 years and a maximum of 5 years) or until progression|12-month OS rate, Overall survival (OS) measured as time from the day of randomization until death, for each patient up to 12 months after randomization or until death|Absolute changes from baseline in contrast medium volume uptake from the MRI performed 48 hours after randomization on, and during any MRI performed thereafter to monitor for disease progression, Baseline, 26 - 48 hours after stereotactic procedure, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months, 1.5 years after randomization or at disease progression, and then every 3 months until end of entire study (up to 5 years) or progression|48h response rate on MRI (Complete Remission, Partial Remission, Stable Disease) after treatment with iPDT (interstitial photodynamic therapy), Response is assessed according to the RANO criteria, 26 - 48 hours after stereotactic procedure in patients treated with interstitial photodynamic therapy (iPDT)|If a PET (positron emission tomography) was performed less than 2 weeks apart from an MRI: Consistency of both procedures with regard to the region of interest (ROI), Baseline, 26 - 48 hours after stereotactic procedure, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months, 1.5 years after randomization or at disease progression and then every 3 months until end of entire study (up to 5 years) or progression|Change in KPS (Karnofsky Performance Score), Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 100. A higher value means a better outcome., Baseline, 26 -48 hours after stereotactic procedure, upon discharge or 7 days after stereotactic procedure, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months until 1.5 years after randomization or disease progression|Change in NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 42. A higher value means a worse outcome., Baseline, 26 -48 hours after stereotactic procedure, upon discharge or 7 days after stereotactic procedure, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months until 1.5 years after randomization or disease progression|Change in MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 30. A higher value means a better outcome., Baseline, 26 -48 hours after stereotactic procedure, upon discharge or 7 days after stereotactic procedure, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months until 1.5 years after randomization or disease progression|Brain edema as assessed by MRI within 26 to 48 h after stereotactic surgery, 26 to 48 hours after stereotactic intervention|Frequency of Adverse Events, over the entire study period of each patient (at least 1.5 years and a maximum of 5 years)|Change in the EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire) score during study participation, Baseline, at discharge or 7 days after intervention, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months, 1.5 years after randomization or at disease progression and then every 3 months until end of entire study (up to 5 years) or progression|Change in the EORTC QLQ-BN20 module (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Brain Cancer Module) score during study participation, Baseline, at discharge or 7 days after intervention, 1 month after randomization and then every 2 months, 1.5 years after randomization or at disease progression and then every 3 months until end of entire study (up to 5 years) or progression
