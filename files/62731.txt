Ileal Reservoir Length and Functional Outcome in Ileal Pouch-anal Anastomosis: An Assessor-blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial
The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare outcome after construction of an ileal (J-shaped) reservoir of 10 versus 15 centimeters in primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery.
Ulcerative Colitis|Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
PROCEDURE: 10 cm pouch|PROCEDURE: 15 cm pouch
Pouch dysfunction score, Ranges from 0 to 7.5, where a low score indicates good bowel function will little to no impact on quality of life, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after surgery
Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Consists of 10 questions with a total score range from 10 (poor health-related quality of life) to 70 (good health-related quality of life), 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after surgery|Short-form (SF)-36, Consists of questions relating to 8 domains of life with a total score ranging from 0-100, with lower numbers indicating worse health status, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after surgery|Postoperative complications using the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), The CCI is a continuous scale, where each postoperative complication as defined by Clavien-Dindo is assigned a weigth based on its severity. A total summarized score taking all complications into account is thus generated., 90 days after surgery|Pouch failure, Hazard ratio of pouch failure defined as an intended permanent ileostomy with or without pouch excision, 1, 3 and 5 years after surgery
The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare functional outcome in terms of bowel function correlated with quality of life for patients who undergo primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery with an ileal (J-shaped) reservoir length of either 10 cm or 15 cm.

Secondary aims include health-related quality of life measures and postoperative complications.
