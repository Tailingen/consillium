A Study to Investigate Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Tolebrutinib in Participants With Multiple Sclerosis.
This is a Phase 3 extension, global, multicenter study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of tolebrutinib in adult participants (aged ≥18 years) with RMS, PPMS, or NRSPMS who were previously enrolled in the Phase 2b LTS (LTS16004) or 1 of the 4 Phase 3 tolebrutinib pivotal trials (GEMINI 1 \[EFC16033\], GEMINI 2 \[EFC16034\], HERCULES \[EFC16645\], or PERSEUS \[EFC16035\]).

Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and AEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation, From baseline until the End of study approximately 3 years per participant|Number of Participants with Potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs), Potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) determined by laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), or vital signs and safety findings on MRI during the study period., From baseline until the End of study approximately 3 years per participant
Time to onset of 6-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW for RMS) or confirmed disability progression (CDP for PPMS and NRSPMS) for participants from pivotal studies, Time to onset is defined as a sustained increase from baseline EDSS (pivotal trial) of:

* RMS: ≥1.5 points when the baseline score is 0, ≥1.0 point when the baseline score is 0.5 to ≤5.5 or ≥0.5 point when the baseline score is \>5.5
* PPMS: ≥1.0 point when the baseline score is ≤5.5 or ≥0.5 point when the baseline score is \>5.5
* NRSPMS: ≥1.0 point when the baseline score is ≤5.0 or ≥0.5 point when the baseline score is \>5.0, From baseline until the End of study approximately 3 years per participant|Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) for RMS only, ARR during the OL treatment period assessed by confirmed protocol-defined relapses, From baseline until the End of study approximately 3 years per participant|Number of new and/or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions per year, From baseline until the End of study approximately 3 years per participant|Change from baseline in total volume of T2-hyperintense lesions, From baseline until the End of study approximately 3 years per participant|ToleDYNAMIC substudy Change from baseline in biomarkers, From baseline until 12 months per participant
Participants with relapsing MS from the Phase 2b LTS16004 parent study will continue open-label (OL) tolebrutinib.

All participants from the Phase 3 parent studies (EFC16033, EFC16034, EFC16645, and EFC16035) will learn which treatment they received in the parent study:

* If from one of the Phase 3 relapsing MS studies and on teriflunomide, an accelerated elimination procedure or a 3-month washout period is required prior to starting OL tolebrutinib. If on teriflunomide, and benefiting and recommended by the Investigator, the participant may opt to continue teriflunomide outside of the LTS17043 study, if clinically appropriate. If on tolebrutinib, the participant will continue tolebrutinib.
* All participants from one of the Phase 3 progressive MS studies will start OL tolebrutinib.
* If a participant already started OL tolebrutinib in the Phase 3 parent study this will be continued.
* RMS participants who are not eligible for OL tolebrutinib per Health Authority and/or ethics committee decisions on the study conduct (ie, partial hold on initiation of tolebrutinib) will continue their parent study treatment assignment as per their randomization from the parent study.

The treatment duration per participant will be approximately 3 years of OL tolebrutinib.
