If a participant did not have an event of disease progression and had not died on or prior to the cutoff for PFS analysis, the participant's data was censored at the date of their last disease assessment or randomization date provided participant did not have any post-baseline disease assessment.

Disease assessments were performed using computed tomography according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.

Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm taking as reference the smallest lesion size recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after), or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From randomization up to the date the 126th PFS event was reached; Median time on follow-up was 7.3, 7.1, and 8.9 months in each treatment group respectively.
Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. If a participant did not die on or prior to the cut-off for OS analysis, the participant's data were censored at the date of their last known alive date, which is defined as the last date of the last survival follow-up visit, the start date of the last AE, the start date or end date of the last dose of any study drugs, the last lab and vital sign collection date, or the last disease assessment date, whichever occurred last., From randomization until the end of study; median time on follow-up was 10.0, 8.6, and 11.7 months in each treatment group respectively.|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with objective response (confirmed) as assessed by the investigator using RECIST version 1.1. Objective response includes both complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response must be confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment at least 28 days apart. Participants with no post-baseline confirmed response were counted as non-responders.

CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. No new lesions.

PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, and no new lesions., Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 30 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression; median time on follow-up was 7.3, 7.1, and 8.9 months in each group respectively.|Phase 1: Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The intensity of each adverse event (AE) was assessed utilizing the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0, and according to the following: Grade 1 (Mild): AE is transient and easily tolerated by the participant; Grade 2 (Moderate): AE causes the participant discomfort and interrupts the participant's usual activities; Grade 3/4 (Severe): The adverse event causes considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening; Grade 5: Death.

Serious adverse events were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity., From first dose of any study drug to 30 days after the last dose; the median duration of treatment with veliparib across all groups in Phase 1 was 127.5 days.
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation/Phase 2 randomized double-blind study of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and etoposide and maintenance veliparib monotherapy.

Participants in Phase 1 will be sequentially assigned to ascending dose levels of veliparib in combination with standard carboplatin/etoposide regimen for up to four 21-day cycles based on the observed toxicities. The study design for Phase 1 will follow a traditional "3 + 3" dose-escalation protocol.

Once the veliparib recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) and schedule is determined, enrollment into Phase 2 will begin. Participants from the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study are not eligible for enrollment into the Phase 2 portion. Participants in Phase 2 will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to carboplatin, etoposide, placebo followed by placebo maintenance (Arm C), or carboplatin, etoposide, veliparib followed by either veliparib (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) maintenance. Randomization for Phase 2 will be stratified by baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (\> upper limit of normal \[ULN\] vs. ≤ ULN), and gender.
