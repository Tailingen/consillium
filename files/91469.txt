An Observational Study to Register the Incidence of Breast Cancer and Current Clinical Care Patterns in Kenya
This observational study, conducted by the Kenya Society for Hematology and Oncology, will develop a Breast Cancer and Care Registry (BRECC) for Kenya. Data on demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics, treatment and clinical outcome will be collected from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Breast cancer patients will be recruited into this registry cohort and followed up for a period of not less than five years.
