An Open-Label Phase 1/2 Study of Itacitinib in Combination With Osimertinib in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of itacitinib in combination with osimertinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Itacitinib|DRUG: Osimertinib
Phase 1: Frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events (AEs), From screening through 30-35 days after end of treatment, approximately 2 years.|Phase 1: Number of subjects with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Day 1 through Day 28|Phase 2: Objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1, ORR defined as the percentage of subjects who have a confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Screening and 8-week intervals throughout the study, approximately 2 years.
Phase 1 and Phase 2: Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of itacitinib and osimertinib when administered in combination, Measured at protocol-defined study visits from Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 28.|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of Itacitinib and osimertinib when administered in combination, Measured at protocol-defined study visits from Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 28.|Phase 2: Depth of response (DpR) based on RECIST v1.1, Defined as the percentage of maximal tumor shrinkage observed at the lowest point (nadir) compared with baseline., Screening and 8-week intervals throughout the study, approximately 2 years.|Phase 2: Progression-free survival (PFS), Interval from the first day of study treatment until disease progression or death due to any cause, approximately 3 years.|Phase 2: Overall survival (OS), Interval from the first day of study treatment until death due to any cause, approximately 3 years.|Phase 2: Frequency, severity, and duration of AEs, From screening through 30-35 days after end of treatment, approximately 2 years.
