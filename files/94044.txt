Apatinib Combine With EGFR-TKI for Advanced EGFR-TKI-resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including gefitinib demonstrate excellent effect on the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. However, patients who are initially sensitive to the drugs eventually become resistance. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor and reduces the angiogenesis of tumor efficiently. In this study, the investigators aim to explore the efficacy and reasonable dosage of apatinib combining with EGFR-TKI in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI resistance.
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate Tablets|DRUG: EGFR-TKIs (Erlotinib, Gefitinib and Osimertinib)
Optimal Dosage, Optimal dosage of Apatinib which combine with EGFR-TKIs, 9 months|Progression free survival, PFS is evaluated in 24 months since the treatment begin, 24 months
Overall survival, Overall survival is evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began, 24 months|Side effects, Side effects evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, 24 months
Primary Outcome Measure: efficacy and reasonable dosage of the combination of apatinib and EGFR-TKI in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI resistance.

Secondary Outcome Measures: Progression free survival, overall survival, Side effects.
