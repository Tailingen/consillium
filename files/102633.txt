Study of Pembrolizumab Given Prior to Surgery and in Combination With Radiotherapy Given Post-surgery for Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (MK-3475-689)
This is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label study of pembrolizumab (Pembro) given prior to surgery and pembrolizumab in combination with standard of care radiotherapy (with or without cisplatin), as post-surgical therapy in treatment naïve participants with newly diagnosed Stage III/IVA, resectable, locoregionally advanced, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC). Efficacy outcomes will be stratified by programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) status. The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab given before surgery and after surgery in combination with radiotherapy (with or without cisplatin) improves event-free survival compared to radiotherapy (with or without cisplatin) given after surgery alone.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab 200 mg|RADIATION: Radiotherapy 60 Gray|RADIATION: Radiotherapy 66 Gray|RADIATION: Radiotherapy 70 Gray|DRUG: Cisplatin 100 mg/m^2
Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is the time from the date of randomization to the date of first record of any of the following events: radiographic disease progression; local or distant progression or recurrence as assessed with imaging or biopsy as indicated; or death due to any cause. Radiographic disease progression during neoadjuvant phase that precludes surgery will be considered an event; a secondary malignancy will not be considered an event., Up to ~80 months
Major Pathological Response (mPR), The percentage of participants with a major pathological response (mPR) as assessed by the Central Pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. mPR is defined as ≤10% invasive squamous cell carcinoma within the resected primary tumor specimen and all the sampled regional lymph nodes., Up to ~64 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~92 months|Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Pathological complete response (pCR) is measured as the percentage of participants with a pathological complete response as assessed by the central pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. pCR is defined as having no residual invasive squamous cell carcinoma within the resected primary tumor specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes., Up to ~64 months|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale (GHS/QoL), Change from baseline in the combined score of global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) items 29 and 30. Participant responses to questions regarding overall health/QoL will be scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very poor to 7=Excellent) with a higher score indicating better overall health status., Prior to the first dose of study therapy (Baseline) and at the time of last follow-up (up to ~92 months)|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Physical Functioning Scales, Change from baseline in the combined score of physical functioning scale using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) items 1 through 5. Participant responses to questions regarding their physical functioning will be scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much) with a higher score indicating worse physical functioning., Prior to the first dose of study therapy (Baseline) and at the time of last follow-up (up to ~92 months)|Change from Baseline in Swallowing, Speech, and Pain Symptoms, Change from baseline in the combined score of swallowing, speech, and pain symptoms using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-H\&N35) items 31-38, 46, and 53-54. Participant responses to questions regarding problems with swallowing, speech and pain in the mouth will be scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much) with a higher score indicating more problems., Prior to the first dose of study therapy (Baseline) and at the time of last follow-up (up to ~92 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing An Adverse Event (AEs), Percentage of participants experiencing any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy, From time of first dose of study treatment until the end of follow-up (up to ~92 months)|Percentage of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to AEs, Percentage of participants discontinuing study drug due to an AE, From time of first dose of study treatment until the end of treatment (up to 12 months)
