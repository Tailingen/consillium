Addition of SNS-301 to Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment in Metastatic/Recurrent SCCHN
To evaluate safety, immunogenicity and anti-tumor responses of intradermally delivered SNS-301 added to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) patients.

DRUG: SNS-301|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants With Adverse Events of SNS-301 in Addition to Pembrolizumab, Number of adverse events including adverse events of special interest as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 12 weeks|Objective Response Rate by RECIST and iRECIST, Objective response rate based on best objective response during the study. Objective tumor response definitions included: Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study., 12 weeks|Duration of Response by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Duration of response calculated from date of first response to date of progression. Objective tumor response definitions included: Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study., 12 weeks|Disease Control Rate by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Disease control rate calculated as the proportion of patients with stable disease or better. Objective tumor response definitions included: Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study., 12 weeks|Progression Free Survival by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Progression free survival calculated from the date of start of treatment to date of progression. Objective tumor response definitions included: Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study., 12 weeks|Overall Survival, Overall survival calculated from date of treatment to date of death., 36 months
Antigen-specific Response, Measure levels at pretreatment, changes during treatment and at progression or end of study, 12 weeks|TCR Sequencing, Determine TCR diversity pretreatment, changes during treatment and at progression or end of study, 12 weeks|Immune Gene Transcript Profiling, Determine gene signature pretreatment, during treatment and at progression, 12 weeks|Profiling of Pro-inflammatory/Immunosuppressive Molecules, Measure levels at pretreatment, changes during treatment and at progression or end of study, 12 weeks
Immune Related Expression, Determine immune expression pretreatment, changes during treatment and at progression, 12 weeks|Tumor Specific Oncoproteins, Determine expression pretreatment, during treatment and at progression, 12 weeks|ASPH Expression, Determine pretreatment expression, changes during treatment and at progression, 12 weeks|Cytokine/Chemokine Profiling, Determine cytokine/chemokine profile pretreatment, changes during treatment and at progression, 12 weeks|ctDNA, Determine ctDNA profile pretreatment, changes during treatment and at progression, 12 weeks
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary clinical efficacy of SNS-301 delivered intradermally in addition to pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent SCCHN. The trial population consists of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent SCCHN who are currently receiving checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy (Cohort A) or are na√Øve to CPI therapy (Cohort B). Patients who are currently receiving CPI therapy must have a best response of stable disease (SD) or first evidence of progressive disease (PD) after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with a CPI. Patients receiving a CPI other than pembrolizumab will be switched over to pembrolizumab at the time of entering this study. Patients receiving pembrolizumab in the first line setting must be PD-L1 positive.
