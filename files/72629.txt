Sample Collection Study in Patients With Suspected Melanoma Utilizing DermTech's Non-invasive Adhesive Patch Biopsy Kits
A multi-center sample collection study in patients presenting with pigmented lesion(s) suspicious for melanoma. All suspicious lesions should meet at least one of the "ABCDE" criteria.
Melanoma (Skin)|Pigmented Skin|Nevus
Up to 1000 samples will be compared for gene expression analysis results compared to biopsy findings., gene expression associated with melanoma vs non-melanoma compared to surgical biopsy, Samples will be extracted and analyzed once up to 1000 samples have been collected and compared to surgical biopsy reports. Analysis results are expected in 2021|Up to 1000 samples will be compared to biopsy results for DNA mutations, Dna mutations associated with more aggressive forms of melanoma, Samples will be extracted and analyzed once up to 1000 samples have been collected and compared to surgical reports and DNA mutation analysis. Analysis results are expected in 2021
A multi-center sample collection study in patients presenting with pigmented lesion(s) suspicious for melanoma. All suspicious lesions should meet at least one of the "ABCDE" (asymmetry, border, color, diameter, evolving) criteria. Patients will be consented for the study and screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once the patient is determined to be acceptable for the study they will be assigned a unique patient number and tissue collection will begin. Tissue from the lesion will be collected using DermTech's non-invasive adhesive patch kit according to the instructions for use followed by surgical biopsy. Digital dermoscopy of the lesion is preferred but not required.
