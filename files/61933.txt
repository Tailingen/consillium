Surgery Plus Target-reduction Chemoradiotherapy vs Regular Chemoradiotherapy for Newly Diagnosed Resectable Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Through a prospective clinical trial, we intend to combine surgery, induction chemotherapy, target-reduction intensity-modulated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy as an experimental treatment for patients with newly diagnosed resectable nasopharyngeal carcinoma to illuminate whether combined surgery could bring patients better local-regional control and lower adverse reactions.
