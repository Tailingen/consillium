Approximately 80 patients were planned to be enrolled into the study, 20 patients with GBM, 20 patients with BC that had metastasized to the brain, 20 with GEA and 20 with PDAC.

The study included an imaging characterization part and an expansion part. In the imaging characterization part, approximately 24 patients were planned to be enrolled, 6 with r/r GBM, 6 with BC that had metastasized to the brain, 6 with GEA and 6 with PDAC. Due to the early termination of the study, the expansion part was not started.

Both parts of the study (imaging characterization and expansion) included a dosimetry sub-group in which the distribution, pharmacokinetics (PK), radiation dosimetry and absorbed doses in tissue and tumor were to be assessed. However, no patients were enrolled in the dosimetry sub-group.

All patients enrolled in the study received a single dose of \[68Ga\]-FF58 and underwent \[68Ga\]-FF58 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging at different timepoints on Day 1 as well as conventional imaging (high resolution computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).

The estimated study duration for each individual patient was approximately 44 days (including screening period of 28 days and 14 days of follow-up (FU)).
