DC Combined With ICIs in the Treatment of Advanced Lung Cancer Resistant to ICIs
This is a single-center, single-arm, prospective clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of Neo-DCVac combined with ICIs in the treatment of advanced lung cancer resistant to ICIs.

Synergistic anti-tumor mechanism., The immune response of subjects was assessed by peripheral blood cell flow cytometry within 2 weeks after the initial immunotherapy and every 3 months during the immunomaintenance treatment., 2 years
The study screened patients with PD-1 immunochemotherapy in the first-line treatment regimen, and extracted tumor tissues from patients after PD-1 resistance for neoantigen prediction. During neoantigen screening and vaccine preparation, patients received a second-line regimen (docetaxel) as bridging therapy. After completion of bridging therapy and the patient 's vaccine preparation was successful, the patient started receiving the vaccine combined with ICIs. The completion of 5 vaccine injections was followed by an immunization course. Efficacy was assessed 2 weeks after the end of an immunization course, and if effective (tumor response evaluated as SD/PR/CR), the next cycle of immunotherapy was continued, with subsequent treatments administered every 3 weeks until disease progression or severe intolerance occurred or the patient requested withdrawal, whichever came first.
