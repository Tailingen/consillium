The Effect of Ganglion Sphenopalatine Block (GSP-block) Versus Placebo on Postdural Puncture Headache
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the ganglion sphenopalatine block (GSP block) on postdural puncture headache.
Postdural Puncture Headache|Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block
PROCEDURE: Ganglion sphenopalatine block with local anesthetic|PROCEDURE: Ganglion sphenopalatine block with placebo
Hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the postdural headache in standing position., Pain intensity will be measured as worst experienced pain after the patient has been standing for 30 seconds or the worst experienced pain while attempting to stand if the rating has to be interrupted., 30 minutes after block
Pain rating (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) in standing position, Pain intensity measured as worst experienced pain after the patient has been standing for 30 seconds or the worst experienced pain while attempting to stand if the rating has to be interrupted., 1 hour after block and 1 week after block|Number of patients with pain rating below 30mm in standing position (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS), Pain intensity measured as worst experienced pain after the patient has been standing for 30 seconds or the worst experienced pain while attempting to stand if the rating has to be interrupted., 30 minutes after block|Number of patients needing "rescue GSP-block", During study period until completion of 1 week follow up|Number of patients needing a epidural blood patch, During study period until completion of 1 week follow up|Pain rating (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) in supine position, 30 minutes after block, 1 hour after block and 1 week after block
Adult patients with postdural puncture headache will be enrolled in the study. The patients will be randomised to receive a ganglion sphenopalatine block (GSP-block) with either local anesthetic (lidocaine + ropivacaine) or placebo (isotone NaCl).

Primary outcome is hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the postdural headache in standing position 30 minutes after block.

If the patients in the timeframe of 1 hour to 1 week after block does not achieve remission (VAS \<30mm while standing) they will be offered a "rescue GSP-block" defined as a new GSP-block with "open-label" local anesthetic and if continued lack of remission at least 1 hour thereafter then an epidural blood patch will be offered.
