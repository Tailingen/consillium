Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Combined With Toripalimab and Surufatinib in the Treatment of Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
Based on the preclinical rationale for combining surufatinib with immunotherapy, and the clinical efficacy observed with surufatinib in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), the investigators hypothesize that incorporating surufatinib into the ADRIATIC regimen could further enhance survival in LS-SCLC. To evaluate this approach, the investigators plan to conduct a single-arm Phase II study to explore the safety and efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with toripalimab and surufatinib in treating LS-SCLC.

This single-arm Phase II study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with toripalimab and surufatinib in treating LS-SCLC. In this single-arm, Phase II study, patients are planned to receive four cycles of etoposide combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin, along with toripalimab and surufatinib. During chemotherapy, patients will undergo concurrent radiotherapy. Following chemoradiotherapy, consolidation treatment with toripalimab and surufatinib will be administered. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended prior to the consolidation therapy.
