Palliative Lattice Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
Standard palliative radiotherapy regimens may provide limited durability of response in large tumors. Thus, there is a clinical need for a new approach. The Lattice SBRT approach will deliver 20 Gy in 5 fractions with partial volume simultaneous integrated boosts to 66.7 Gy. This is hypothesized to improve symptom response, local control, and better prime the tumor microenvironment for immune response compared with standard palliative radiotherapy doses. It is also hypothesized that this will be associated with less toxicity than the traditional homogenous SBRT plan delivered to a large tumor. Blood will be collected before and after Lattice SBRT for evaluation of the peripheral blood immune microenvironment.
