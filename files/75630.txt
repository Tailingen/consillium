STIMULUS MDS-US : Sabatolimab Added to HMA in Higher Risk MDS
Main objective of this study is to describe and evaluate safety and efficacy of MBG453 (sabatolimab) in combination with FDA approved HMAs of investigator's choice (IV Decitabine or Azacitidine /SC Azacitidine /Oral Decitabine (cedazuridine combination (INQOVI))
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
DRUG: MBG453|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: INQOVI (oral decitabine)
Number of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, Adverse events will be assessed at each visit. Any clinically significant laboratory value or vital sign determined by the investigator to meet the definition of an adverse event will be reported., Baseline up to approximately 12 months plus 30 - 150 day safety follow up dependent on HMA
Complete remission (CR) rate according to International Working Group (IWG) for MDS (2006) * as per investigator assessment by 12 months., Complete remission with MBG453 (sabatolimab) in combination with HMAs (IV/SC/Oral) in participants with intermediate, high, or very high risk MDS by 12 months, Baseline, by 12 months|Progression free survival in participants with intermediate, high or very high risk MDS, Defined as time from enrollment to disease progression (including transformation to leukemia per WHO 2016 classification), relapse from CR according to IWG-MDS or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as per investigator assessment by 12 months post LPFT, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 12 months|Overall Survival, Time from enrollment to death due to any cause, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 24 months|Leukemia-free survival, Time from enrollment to \> 20% blasts in bone marrow/peripheral blood (per WHO 2016 classification) or death due to any cause, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 12 months|Percentage of participants with complete response, marrow complete response and/or partial response, Percentage of complete response, marrow complete response, and/or partial response according to IWG-MDS response criteria as per investigator assessment, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 24 months|Duration of complete remission, Time from the date of the first documented CR to the date of first documented relapse from CR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 12 months|Time to complete remission, Time from first treatment to the first documented complete remission, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 12 months|Percentage of participants with improvement in RBC/platelets transfusion independence, Transfusion independence is defined as less than 3 units of transfusion within any 8 consecutive weeks on study, Baseline, every 12 weeks up to approximately 12 months
This is a single-arm, non- randomized, open label, phase II multi-center study of intravenous MBG453 (sabatolimab) added to FDA approved Hypomethylating agents of investigator's choice (IV/SC/ Oral) in adult participants with intermediate, high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as per IPSS-R criteria.

There are three separate periods of this study:

1. Screening period (signing of written informed consent through Day 1);
2. Core phase for 12 months;
3. Extension phase for efficacy and/or survival status (up to 12 months after core phase)
4. Post treatment safety follow-up monitoring for adverse events (AEs) for 30 days following the last dose of azacitidine or decitabine or INQOVI (oral decitabine), or 150 days following the last dose of MBG453 (sabatolimab), whichever is later).
