Clinical Trial to Evaluate BO-112 in Patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
This is a multicenter, phase 2b, open-label, non-randomized, clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of intra-lesional BO-112 in patients with resectable primary low and high risk basal cell carcinoma.

* primary endpoint is complete visual and pathological response \[at surgery\] on patient level assessed by central review
* secondary endpoints are

  1. Occurrence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation or death on patient level.
  2. Pathological response \[at surgery\] on patient level assessed by the investigator and central review, respectively, and visual response \[during the study and at surgery\] on patient level assessed by the investigator and central review, respectively.
  3. Recurrence \[at 12 and 24 months\] after surgery on patient level assessed by the investigator.
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: BO-112
Number of Participants with Complete Visual and Pathological Response, Complete visual and pathological response of all treated BCC lesions on participant level assessed by central review, at 24 weeks
Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE 5.0, Occurrence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation or death on participant level., through study completion, average 7 months|Extent of Pathological Response, Pathological response on participant level assessed by the investigator and central review, respectively, using a 4-point scale

1. Pathologic Complete Response (pCR): No Residual Viable Tumor (RVT)
2. Major Pathologic Response (MPR)/ "near-pCR": \<= 10% RVT
3. Pathologic Partial Response (pPR): 10% \< RVT \<= 50% "
4. Pathologic Non-Response" (pNR): \>50% RVT, at 24 weeks|Change of Visual Lesion Appearance, Visual response \[during the study and at surgery\] on participant level assessed by the investigator and central review, respectively., at baseline and at 24 weeks|Number of Participants with BCC Recurrence, Recurrence after surgery on participant level assessed by the investigator, at 12 and 24 months after surgery
