Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Bladder Cancer: A Secondary Biomarker Analysis of SWOG 8710
The purpose of this study is to perform a secondary analysis of SWOG 8710 to assess NLRs value as a biomarker. Specifically, the investigators test two hypotheses: 1) that baseline NLR is correlated with overall survival after curative treatment for BC and 2) that baseline NLR is correlated with the survival benefit of NAC. The study will look at the data from participants of the SWOG 8710 study.
