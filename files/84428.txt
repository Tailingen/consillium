DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Evaluation of BIT-Motion software
Pathologic diagnosis, MRI scans evaluated with BIT-Motion software will be compared to definitive pathologic diagnosis, One month
The goal of this study is to answer the question: what is the ability of the BIT-Motion (Breast Imaging Tensor-Motion) software to detect and discriminate between benign and malignant breast lesions that are identified on mammogram (MG) and ultrasound (US) examinations. Women over the age of 18 who have a breast lesion that is seen on MG or US will be eligible to enroll. Participation in this study will involve one non-invasive non-contrast MRI scan of the breasts.
