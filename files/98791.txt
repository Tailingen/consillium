Tool for the Detection of Oncogeriatric Fragility in Patients Aged ≥75 Years Undergoing Oncological Treatment.(D-FOG)
Many cancers are diagnosed after 75 years. Treatment in chemotherapy begins without evidence of geriatric risk factors. A new tool for screening for geriatric fragilities is used, a self-administered questionnaire carried out by the patient before each chemotherapy cure. The objective is to secure the quality of patient care and to detect the appearance and / or aggravation of geriatric fragilities.

Evaluation of the feasibility of a new geriatric fragility screening tool (D-FOG) in patients aged ≥ 75 years during oncological treatment., Feasibility of D-FOG for patients : number of D-FOGs filled in, regularity of the D-FOG self-questionnaire by the patient, number of criteria entered by D-FOG, criterion analysis of D-FOG, 3 months
Evaluation of the feasibility of a new geriatric fragility screening tool (D-FOG) in patients aged ≥ 75 years during oncological treatment:

* Number of D-FOGs filled in: comparison with the number of patients included in the study and the number of visits of each patient.
* Regularity of the D-FOG self-questionnaire by the patient: comparison with the number of visits of the patient for a chemotherapy cure (HDJ or HDS).
* Number of criteria entered by D-FOG: comparison with the total number of criteria to be filled in
* Criterion analysis of D-FOG
