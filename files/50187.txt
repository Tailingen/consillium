A First-in-Human Study of HLA-Partially to Fully Matched Allogenic Cryopreserved Deceased Donor Bone Marrow Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantation with bone marrow from a deceased donor in patients with acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, and certain lymphomas. Patients will either receive myeloablative conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning regimen prior to the transplant. Patients will be followed for 56 days for safety endpoints and remain in follow-up for one year.

Neutrophil Engraftment, Neutrophil engraftment is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of greater than or equal to 500/µL for 3 consecutive measurements on 3 different days by Day 28., Day 28|Serious Adverse Events, Occurrence of any event classified as SAE. The time of occurrence of each serious adverse event will be recorded., Day 56|CTCAE Grade 3/4 Adverse Events (AEs), Occurrence of any event classified as grade 3/4 AE attributed to Ossium HPC, Marrow per the CTCAE v5.0 guidelines. The time of the occurrence of each event will be recorded., Day 56|CTCAE Grade 3/4 Adverse Events (AEs) attributed to infusion of Ossium HPC, Marrow, Occurrence of any event classified as grade 3 or higher attributed to Ossium HPC, Marrow infusion per the CTCAE v5.0 guidelines. The time of the occurrence will be recorded., Day 28|Death, The time of death will be recorded for each expired patient., Day 56
Cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment, Neutrophil engraftment in defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of greater than or equal to 500/µL for 3 consecutive measurements on different days by Day 28., Day 28|Cumulative incidences of platelet recovery, Platelet recovery is defined as platelets greater than or equal to 20,000/µL for 3 consecutive days in the absence of transfusion for 7 consecutive days by Day 56., Day 56|Cumulative incidence of disease relapses, The cumulative incidence of relapse is measured from the date of transplant (Day 0) until the date of relapse or progression; patients not known to have relapsed are censored on the date they were last examined; patients who died without relapse are counted as a competing cause of failure., Day 365|Transplant-related mortality (TRM), TRM is defined as death without evidence of disease progression or recurrence., Day 100 and Day 365|Cumulative incidences of acute (aGVHD) Graft Versus Host Disease, aGVHD is defined as any skin, gastrointestinal or liver abnormalities fulfilling the criteria of grades II-IV or grades III-IV., Day 100, Day 180, and Day 365|Cumulative incidences of chronic (cGVHD) Graft Versus Host Disease, cGVHD is defined per National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria and includes organ involvement and severity, and overall global composite score (mild/moderate/severe)., Day 100, Day 180, and Day 365|Incidence of clinically-significant infections, A clinically significant infection is defined as any microbiologic or radiographic infection for which antimicrobial therapy was administered., Day 100 and Day 365
