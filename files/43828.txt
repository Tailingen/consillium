Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells Captured by c-MET (CTC-MET)
This pilot study will aim to determine whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be captured using the novel cMET based ferrofluid. The primary objective of this pilot study will be to describe the numbers of c-MET expressing cells that can be detected by the c-MET CTC capture technique. These data will be separated by disease site. The investigator will also describe the detection rates of both the c-MET CTC capture and the EpCAM CTC capture techniques in each patient, also separated by disease site.

DEVICE: Mesenchymal-marker based ferrofluid (c-MET)|DEVICE: Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) ferrofluid
Feasibility, Feasibility as measured by successfully detecting at least one CTC in at least 2 out of 10 subjects within each disease site., day 1
Difference in the median number of CTCs, The difference in the median number of CTCs detected by each of the capture methods (novel and standard) will be calculated., day 1|Association of the number of detectable CTCs with baseline clinical and pathologic disease characteristics., Within each method, the patient will be used as the unit of observation to describe the association of number of detectable CTC cells with the following baseline characteristics: TNM staging, site of metastases (e.g., bone, liver, lymph nodes), Gleason sum (for PC), PSA (for PC), the number of prior hormone therapies (in PC), CEA (for colorectal cancer), the use of previous EGFR inhibitors and KRAS mutation status (for colorectal cancer), HER2 status and prior HER2 treatments (for gastric cancer), CA 19-9 (for pancreatic cancer), and number of prior chemotherapies., day 1|Kinetics of CTCs over time during treatment with c-MET targeted therapies, Change is CTCs in patients with MET amplified tumors undergoing treatment with c-MET targeted therapies will be calculated., 8 weeks
