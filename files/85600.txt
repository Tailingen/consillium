Trail Evaluating Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subactue toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT)
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Time interval from the start of CIRT to 4 months after the completion of CIRT
Overall survival of all patients, From the diagnosis of local recurrence of NPC, a median of 2 years|Progression-free survival of all patients, From the completion of CIRT, a median of 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose starting from 55GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to potentially 65GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subactue toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion of CIRT. Time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is used for the phase I dose escalating part of the trial and approximately 25 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II part of the trial will be a single phase single arm study.
