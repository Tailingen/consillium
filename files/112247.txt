Durvalumab Alone or in Combination With Novel Agents in Subjects With NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical activity of durvalumab alone vs durvalumab in combination with novel agents. The overall study goal is early identification of novel durvalumab combinations that are more active than durvalumab alone in the treatment of patients with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed after cCRT.
Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Unresectable
DRUG: Durvalumab + Oleclumab|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Durvalumab + Monalizumab

Only participants who have achieved OR (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) will be evaluated for DoR, Up to approximately 54 months (through the database cutoff date of 18-Jul-2023).|Disease Control (DC) as a Measure of Efficacy of Durvalumab Alone vs Durvalumab in Combination With Novel Agents, Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD (maintained for ≥ 16 weeks) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 54 months (through the database cutoff date of 18-Jul-2023).|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as a Measure of Efficacy of Durvalumab Alone vs Durvalumab in Combination With Novel Agents, PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the first documentation of disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 54 months (through the database cutoff date of 18-Jul-2023).|Progression-Free Survival 12 Month Landmark Rate (PFS-12) as a Measure of Efficacy of Durvalumab Alone vs Durvalumab in Combination With Novel Agents, PFS-12 was defined as the percentage of participants who were alive and progression free at 12 months after randomization., PFS rate at 12 months after randomization.|Overall Survival (OS) as a Measure of Efficacy of Durvalumab Alone vs Durvalumab in Combination With Novel Agents, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., From time of randomization until death due to any cause. Assessed through the database cutoff date of 18-Jul-2023).|Pharmacokinetics of Durvalumab Alone and in Combination With Novel Agents, Geometric mean serum concentrations of durvalumab (μg/mL) were reported for each time point where data warrant, as appropriate., From randomization up to 15 months after first treatment: Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at end of infusion, Cycle 2 Day 1 pre-dose (1 month), Cycle 7 Day 1 pre-dose (6 months), Cycle 11 Day 1 pre-dose (10 months) and 15 months post Cycle 1 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics of Novel Agents in Combination With Durvalumab, Geometric mean serum concentrations of oleclumab (μg/mL) and monalizumab (μg/mL) were reported for each time point where data warrant, as appropriate., From randomization up to 15 months after first treatment: Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at end of infusion, Cycle 2 Day 1 pre-dose (1 month), Cycle 7 Day 1 pre-dose (6 months), Cycle 11 Day 1 pre-dose (10 months) and 15 months post Cycle 1 Day 1|Presence of Detectable Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Response to Durvalumab Alone and in Combination With Novel Agents, ADA prevalence was defined as the percentage of participants with positive ADA result at any time, baseline or post-baseline. ADA positive post-baseline only was also referred to as treatment-induced ADA positive. Treatment-boosted ADA was defined as baseline positive ADA titer that was boosted to a 4-fold or higher following drug administration. Persistently positive was defined as positive at ≥2 post-baseline assessments (with ≥16 weeks between first and last positive) or positive at last post-baseline assessment. Transiently positive was defined as having at least 1 post-baseline ADA positive assessment and not fulfilling the conditions of persistently positive.

ADA incidence (treatment-emergent ADA positive) was defined as the sum of treatment-induced ADA and treatment-boosted ADA., From randomization up to 15 months after first treatment: Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, Cycle 2 Day 1 pre-dose (1 month), Cycle 7 Day 1 pre-dose (6 months), Cycle 11 Day 1 pre-dose (10 months) and 15 months post Cycle 1 Day 1|Presence of Detectable Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Response to Novel Agents in Combination With Durvalumab, ADA prevalence was defined as the percentage of participants with positive ADA result at any time, baseline or post-baseline. ADA positive post-baseline only was also referred to as treatment-induced ADA positive. Treatment-boosted ADA was defined as baseline positive ADA titer that was boosted to a 4-fold or higher following drug administration. Persistently positive was defined as positive at ≥2 post-baseline assessments (with ≥16 weeks between first and last positive) or positive at last post-baseline assessment. Transiently positive was defined as having at least 1 post-baseline ADA positive assessment and not fulfilling the conditions of persistently positive.

ADA incidence (treatment-emergent ADA positive) was defined as the sum of treatment-induced ADA and treatment-boosted ADA., From randomization up to 15 months after first treatment: Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, Cycle 2 Day 1 pre-dose (1 month), Cycle 7 Day 1 pre-dose (6 months), Cycle 11 Day 1 pre-dose (10 months) and 15 months post Cycle 1 Day 1
