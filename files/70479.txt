A Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Rituxan and B-Glucan PGG in Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This research study is evaluating a drug combination called Imprime PGG and Rituximab as a possible treatment for relapsed/refractory indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).
Relapsed/Refractory Indolent B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
DRUG: Imprime PGG|DRUG: Rituximab
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is percentage of participants with complete (CR) and partial (PR) responses as best response during treatment.

CR:

* Nodal Masses:

  1. For FDG-avid or PET positive prior to therapy; mass of any size permitted if PET negative
  2. For variably FDG-avid or PET negative; regression to normal size on CT.
* Liver/Spleen:

No palpable nodules

-Bone Marrow Infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy; if indeterminate by morphology, immunohistochemistry should be negative.

PR:

* Nodal Masses:

  * 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size of other nodes.

    1. FDG-avid or PET positive prior to therapy; one or more PET positive at previously involved site.
    2. Variably FDG-avid or PET negative; regression on CT.
* Liver/Spleen:

  * 50% decrease in SPD of nodules; no increase in size of liver or spleen.
* Bone Marrow:

Irrelevant if positive prior to therapy; cell type should be specified., Response assessed at week 14 of study calendar (10 weeks after the 4-week treatment regimen).
Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and are alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. Response is measure using the International Harmonization Project for Lymphoma criteria Cheson 2007, using CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis., Patients were followed for a median (range) of 13.6 months (3-25).|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response DR is defined as the time from the date of first response (complete or partial) after treatment to the date of disease progression or death for any cause. Patients who are alive without progression are censored at the date the patient is last know to be progression-free., Patients were followed for a median (range) of 13.6 months (3-25).|Imprime PGG-bound Neutrophils Status by Response, Imprime PGG-bound neutrophils analyzed using established methods (peripheral blood samples and post-treatment tumor samples to quantify the binding of Imprime PGG to neutrophils) by treatment response, best response., Up to 14 weeks with a median (range of) 13 weeks (12-14).
After the screening procedures confirms eligibility:

Study Drugs: The participant will receive both Imprime PGG and rituximab weekly, for four weeks.

Clinical Exams: At the participant's weekly visit there will be have a physical exam and general health and specific questions about any problems they might be having and any medications the participant may be taking.

Scans (or Imaging tests):The Investigator will measure the participant's tumor 10 weeks after Week 4 of treatment by CT scan. Additional scans will be performed at 6 months and 12 months following the end of treatment.
