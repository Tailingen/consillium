TPF Induction Chemotherapy vs PF Adjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in the Treatment of Locally Advanced NPC
Through randomized controlled phase III multicenter clinical trials, TPF induction chemotherapy vs. PF regimen adjuvant chemotherapy concurrently Radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: the efficacy, toxicity and quality of life, and further improvement Survival rate and improve the quality of life.
Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: TPF+CCRT|DRUG: CCRT+PF
Progress-free survival(PFS), Progress-free survival(year) is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site or death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years
Overall survival(OS), The OS(year) was defined as the duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years|Locoregional failure-free survival(LRFS), The LRFS(year) is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), The DMFS(year) is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Overall response rate, Tumour response(CR/PR/SD/PD) was classified according to RECIST v1.1, 12 weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy|Incidence of acute and late toxicity, Incidence of acute toxicity（Grade1/2/3/4） is calculated for each adverse event respectively and severity is evaluated on basis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria. Late radiation toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme, 3 years
