High-Risk Metachronous Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Trial
The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of using the standard of care treatment, hormonal therapy + Stereotactic Ablative Radiation (SABR) to the metastatic lesions, compared to standard of care and addition of 6-months of niraparib/abiraterone acetate combination pills and prednisone for participants with recurrent metastatic prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Oligometastatic Disease
DRUG: niraparib/abiraterone acetate|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR)|DRUG: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) evaluation at the 18-month progression of both treatment arms, PSA evaluation of progression at 18-month PSA , defined as PSA \> 0.2 ng/mL in patients initially treated with radical prostatectomy and greater than nadir + 2 ng/mL for patients initially treated with definitive radiation, with testosterone \>100 ng/dl of men who have oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk mutations (TP53, BRCA1/2, PALB2, ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, FANCA, RAD51B, RAD54L, MUTYH) treated with ADT + SABR MDT (6-mos) versus ADT + SABR MDT + niraparib/abiraterone acetate and prednisone (6-mos)., 18 months
Treatment-related adverse events of both treatment arms, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events from ADT+ SABR MDT (6-mos) vs ADT + SABR MDT + niraparib/abiraterone acetate and prednisone (6-mos) in patients with metachronous oligometastatic CSPC disease., 4 years|Local control at 18 months after ADT+ SABR MDT (6-mos) vs ADT + SABR MDT + niraparib/abiraterone acetate and prednisone (6-mos) in patients with metachronous oligometastatic Castrate Specific Prostate Cancer (CSPC) disease., Local control will be evaluated through clinical assessment and periodic imaging., 18 months|Time to locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, radiographic progression-free survival and duration of response after randomization, Progression will be assessed for time to locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, radiographic progression-free survival and duration of response after randomization., 4 years|Quality-of-life measured through EPIC tool following completion of ADT+ SABR MDT (6-mos) vs ADT + SABR MDT + niraparib/abiraterone acetate and prednisone (6-mos)., EPIC quality of life tool will be used to assess quality of life following treatment. Averages will be taken for each section in the survey (Urinary Function, Bowel Function, Sexual Function, and Hormonal function)., 4 years
In this trial all participants will be randomized to one of the two groups. You will be randomly assigned (by chance, like the flip of a coin) to one of the two groups: 1: Standard of care treatment (hormonal therapy + SABR to the metastatic lesions) or 2: Standard of care treatment + 6-months of niraparib/abiraterone acetate combination pills and prednisone. Participants in both groups will receive rectal swabs and various blood tests to assess circulating tumor cells, genomic sequencing, and tumor markers. Both groups will also participate in quality-of-life surveys
