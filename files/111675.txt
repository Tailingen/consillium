Study in Beta-thalassaemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of SLN124
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SLN124 for the treatment of non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) β-thalassaemia and low risk myelodysplastic syndrome.
Non-transfusion-dependent Thalassemia|Low Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: SLN124 is a GalNAc conjugated double stranded fully modified siRNA. Sodium chloride 0.9% w/v is used as Placebo
# of participants with all AEs as assessed by CTCAE V4.0 included injection site reaction, will be measured from baseline to post dose follow up, Up to two months|12 lead electrocardiogram parameters included PR, QTcF and QTcB will be measured from baseline to post dose follow up, Up to two months|clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis, liver function tests (included ALT, AST, GGT) will be measured from baseline to post dose follow up, Up to two months|height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and temperature will be measured from baseline to post dose follow up, Up to two months
Biomarkers will be measured from baseline to post dose follow up, serum hepcidin level (ng/ml), ferritin level (ug/L), Transferrin saturation (%), iron level (umol/L), haemoglobin and reticulocyte count will be analysed by central laboratory., Up to two months|Pharmacokinetic of SLN124 in plasma from baseline to post dose follow up, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) will be analysed by central laboratory., Up to two months|Pharmacokinetic of SLN124 in plasma from baseline to post dose follow up, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be analysed by central laboratory., Up to two months
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SLN124 for the treatment of non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) β-thalassaemia and low risk myelodysplastic syndrome.
