Safety/Efficacy of Intravenous Zoledronic Acid When Added to Standard Therapies in Patients With Breast Cancer and Metastatic Bone Lesions
Zoledronic acid selectively binds to bone and protects it from being metastasized by tumor cells. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid when added to standard therapies in breast cancer patients with metastatic bone lesions.
