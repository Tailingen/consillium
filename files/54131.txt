Ribavirin for Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic (R/M) Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Related Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to find out the effects, both good and bad, that a drug called ribavirin has on the patient and the cancer.

Ribavirin has also been studied in clinical trials for patients with various types of cancer. These studies demonstrated that ribavirin can be safely given at higher doses than the dosing that is used as part of the treatment of hepatitis C.

Ribavirin is known to target a protein called "4E" that turns on a central part which causes the cell to grow, called the ribosome. HPV-related cancers often have abnormally high levels of 4E. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if ribavirin may be a useful treatment for patients with advanced cancers that are related to HPV by blocking the activity of 4E.

DRUG: Ribavirin
Radiographic Responses, Determined by RECIST 1.1 Criteria, will be tabulated by adding partial responses and complete responses (CR + PR). The regimen would be considered worthy of further study if radiographic responses are observed in at least 2 of 12 subjects., 1 year
Number of Participants Evaluated for Toxicity, will be tabulated using NCI CTCAE version 4,, 1 year
