Randomized Phase II Trial of Doxil With or Without Dexamethasone for Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to assess disease response to Doxil in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without dexamethasone pre-treatment.

Study Design:

We will perform an open labeled, parallel, randomized phase II study using a two-stage design to determine if there is sufficient anti-tumor activity in either arm to warrant further study. Assumptions made in this study: an unacceptable overall response rate is \</= 10% \& we will pursue further study if the overall response rate is \>/= 30%. Fifteen patients will be randomized in the first phase (to both Arm 1 and Arm 2). No further patients will be accrued if \<2/15 responses are noted in a given arm. Ten additional patients will be enrolled if \>/= 2/15 responses are observed. If there are \>/= 5/25 responses then further studies will be pursued with that regimen. We will determine the overall incidence \& severity of toxicities in both arms.

Treatment:

Arm 1: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV (in the vein) on day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 2: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV (in the vein) on day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 1 only: Dexamethasone: Dose: 12 mg twice a day by mouth on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of each 28 day cycle.

Number of Cycles for both Arm 1 \& 2: until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: doxorubicin
Percentage of subjects with CR or PR, evaluated after 2 courses then every other course
Hematologic toxicity, evaluated @ baseline & 3/wk during treatment or until recovery|Percentage of subjects with >/= Grade 3 hematopoietic & non-hematopoietic toxicities, labs evaluated @ baseline & 3/wk during treatment or until recovery; toxicity evaluated through treatment or until resolved|Clinical non-hematologic & hematologic toxicity, continuous throughout study|QOL, baseline then every other cycle|Fraction delivered vs. intended Doxil, each dose|Cytokines, evaluated days 1, 5, 8 every other cycle|Survival, evaluated through study
Primary Objectives:

To assess the anti-tumor activity of Doxil by assessing response rates in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without dexamethasone pre-treatment.

Secondary Objectives:

To assess and estimate in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with Doxil with or without pre-treatment dexamethasone: 1) overall survival 2) toxicity, 3) quality of life parameters, 4) dose intensity administered in both treatment groups.

Study Design:

We will perform an open labeled, parallel, randomized phase II study using a two-stage design to determine if there is sufficient anti-tumor activity in either arm to warrant further study. Assumptions made in this study: an unacceptable overall response rate is \</= 10% and we will pursue further study if the overall response rate is \>/= 30%. The overall response rate for this study will be based on the total number of responses observed defined as: complete responses + partial responses (both by RECIST)+biochemical responses (in patients with no measurable target lesions a \>/= 50% decrease in PSA for \>/= 4 weeks). Fifteen patients will be randomized in the first phase (to both Arm 1 and Arm 2). No further patients will be accrued if \<2/15 responses are noted in a given arm. Ten additional patients will be enrolled if \>/= 2/15 responses are observed. If there are \>/= 5/25 responses then further studies will be pursued with that regimen. We will determine the overall incidence and severity of toxicities in both arms.

Treatment:

Arm 1: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV. Frequency: day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 2: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV. Frequency: day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 1 only: Dexamethasone: Dose: 12 mg bid po. Frequency: days 1,2,3,4,5 of each 28 day cycle.

Number of Cycles for both Arm 1 and 2: until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.
