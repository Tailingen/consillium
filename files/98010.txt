Therapeutic Effect of Ethanol-gelfoam Mixture for the Treatment of Arterioportal Shunts (APS) in Patients With HCC
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a key palliative treatment for patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Arterioportal shunts (APS) can aggravate portal hypertension and the shunts let lipiodol flow to normal liver tissue and result in poor Lipiodol deposition in the tumor, causing liver ischemia.

Occlusion of APS is a vital and initial step for the following embolization of tumor. Ethanol-gelfoam mixture(EGM) and gelfoam only both can occlude APS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EGM in treatment of APS in the procedure of TACE, and to analyze the prognostic factors for survival in this kind of patients.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
PROCEDURE: TACE|DRUG: EGM|DRUG: PVA
overall survival, Defined as time (in days) from time of TACE non-eligibility to death due to any cause, and will be evaluated every 8 weeks in the protocol treatment, and every one year in the follow-up period, respectively. Patients lost to follow-up or alive at the end of the study will be censored at the last date known to be alive., 3 years|APS improvement, Changes of Arterioportal Shunts Treated with PVA or EGM, 2 month
Time To Progression, Time from randomization to radiological progression. Definition of progression is based on the mRECIST criteria. Deaths during follow-up without evidence of radiological progression are censored., every 8 weeks, upto 3 years from date of randomization|progression free survival, Time from randomization to either radiological progression or death. Patients alive and free of progression at the end of follow-up are censored., every 8 weeks, upto 3 years from date of randomization|Response Rate, Definition of response is based on the mRECIST criteria., every 8 weeks, upto 3 years from date of randomization
