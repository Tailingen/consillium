A Study of Fractionated 90Y-hPAM4 Plus Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer Patients Receiving at Least 2 Prior Therapies.
90Y-hPAM4 is administered weekly for 3 weeks combined with 4 weekly doses of gemcitabine to assess. This is a dose escalation study of 90Y-hPAM4 to assess which dose is safe and effective as 3rd line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients are then followed weekly for 12 weeks and afterwards for up to 1 year.

DRUG: 90Y-hPAM4|DRUG: 90Y-hPAM4|DRUG: 90Y-hPAM4 + gemcitabine
Safety (change in hematology and chemistry laboratory values from baseline), Acute safety will be assessed weekly for the 1st 12 weeks, and then for up to 1 year after completion of study drug treatment. Safety will be assessed by comparing baseline hematology and chemistry laboratory values with the values obtained weekly after treatment. Safety will also be assessed by the adverse events that are reported., 1 year
Dosage determination, This study is also being done to determine an acceptable 90Y-hPAM4 dose in this patient population. It is anticipated that enrollment will occur over 2 years., 2 years|Efficacy, Efficacy will be assessed for at least 1 year after treatment with study drug. CT scans will be used to determine treatment response., 1 year
