Pilot Study With CY, Pembrolizumab, GVAX, and IMC-CS4 (LY3022855) in Patients With Borderline Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether combining cyclophosphamide (CY), pembrolizumab, GVAX and IMC-CS4 is effective and safe in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

Number of Patients With a Treatment-related Immunologic Effect, Treatment-related immunologic effect is defined as an 80% or greater increase in the number of CD8+ T cells (and at least 1.8 times the baseline median absolute deviation) in surgically resected tumor tissue in comparison to the baseline biopsy in subjects that received at least 1 dose of neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy and underwent a R0, R1, or R2 surgical resection., 8 weeks|Safety of the Combination of GVAX Pancreas Vaccine (With CY), Pembrolizumab, and a Macrophage Targeting Agent (CSF1R Inhibitor IMC-CS4) in Patients With Resectable or Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer (BRPC) Prior to and Following Surgery, Number of subjects that experienced a grade 3 or higher study drug related adverse event, 25 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of follow-up (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 44 months|Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as time from fist dose of study drug to the date of progression or death. Subjects were censored at the date of last scan if alive at the time of analyses or if the subject's date of death was greater than 3 months after last scan. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 37 months|Immune-related Objective Response Rate (irORR), Immune-related Objective Response Rate (irORR) is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (irCR) or partial response (irPR) based on immune related response criteria (irRC) following the study immunotherapy prior to surgical resection. Per irRC criteria, Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (irPR) is a decrease in tumor burden by 50% or greater., Up to 10 weeks from baseline irRC read|Surgical Resectability Rate, Surgical resectability after neoadjuvant therapy as determined by the number of patients able to undergo surgical resection., 8 weeks|Pathologic Response Rate, Pathologic response as determined by surgical margins status at the time of surgery and response to neoadjuvant treatment per surgical specimen assessment (participants with \<10% residual viable tumor is reported)., 8 weeks
This was a single center, open label, pilot study to evaluate the safety and intratumoral immune response of neoadjuvant/adjuvant triplet immunotherapy: CY/GVAX, Pembrolizumab, and IMC-CS4 in patients with resectable or borderline resectable Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Patients received the combination of CY/GVAX with pembrolizumab and IMC-CS4 following completion of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with or without radiation). Immunotherapy agents were given prior to and after surgical resection.

Patients receive neoadjuvant immunotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and pembrolizumab on day 1, IMC-CS4 on days 1, 8, and 15, and GVAX on day 2 of Cycles 1 and 2 (3 weeks/cycle). Patients will then undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy 2-3 weeks later, followed by standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of the primary oncologist. Patients may then receive 4 cycles (3 weeks/cycle) of adjuvant immunotherapy (same regimen as Cycles 1 and 2). Disease free patients may receive an additional 12 booster cycles (3 weeks/cycle) of immunotherapy consisting of pembrolizumab on day 1 of all 12 booster cycles, as well as cyclophosphamide on day 1 and GVAX on day 2 of the 6th and 12th booster cycle.
