Metformin in Assisted Reproduction-MET-AR-study
Aim of study: To investigate whether four months of metformin treatment before IVF (in-vitro-fertilisation) or ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic-sperm-injection) might increase clinical pregnancy rate in normal-weight (body mass index \[BMI\] below 28 kg/m3) in PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) women.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Metformin / Placebo treatment for 4 months
To investigate whether four months of Metformin treatment before IVF (in-vitro-fertilisation) or ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) will increase clinical pregnancy rate in normal weight PCOS-women, Vaginal ultrasound in pregnancy week 7
Spontaneous pregnancy rates during the pretreatment period, Spontaneous abortion rates (I or II trim.abortions), Live birth rates,, Vaginal ultrasound in pregnancy week 7|Number of oocytes collected, Embryo quality, Number of days of gonadotrophin treatment, Dose of gonadotrophin, total per cycle and daily, s-estradiol on day of hCG-administration, Occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), All data evaluated at study end, from september 2009 onwards
PCOS is an hormonal disease including hyperandrogenism, oligo-or anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries by ultrasound. PCOS women often suffer insulin resistance or even diabetes risk as well as a full blown metabolic disease.

These women often suffer infertility due to their lack of regular ovulations. Metformin is a well known anti-diabetic drug, and in some PCOS women metformin might decrease the hyperandrogenism, improve insulin resistance and give more regular ovulations. Thereby increase chance of pregnancy. Our hypothesis is that metformin will increase clinical pregnancy rates both spontaneously and following IVF/ICSI.
