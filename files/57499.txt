Movement Analysis in Musculoskeletal Oncology: a Pilot Study
Noninterventional, prospective, multicenter pilot study of patients with primary and secondary musculoskeletal tumors designed to investigate functional outcomes after therapy using both subjective and quantitative motion detection techniques
Motion Analysis in Musculoskeletal Oncology
DEVICE: Motion Analysis in Musculoskeletal Oncology
Quality of life, To investigate any differences found using the two methods (quantitative/movement analysis technique versus "subjective"/qualitative technique) in changes in walking/motor characteristics in post-treatment versus pre-treatment.

Patients will be monitored via a system of wearable sensors (OPAL 15) which send signals to a computer - station receiving. The system is equipped with 15 small, wireless devices and non-invasive, which contain the following sensors:

i) triaxial accelerometer for measuring linear accelerations of the body segment; ii) triaxial gyroscope for measuring angular speeds; iii) triaxial magnetometer, essential for estimating the orientation of the segment in space corporeal. The system synchronously acquires data from each device and sends it via telemetry to one control unit that collects them and saves them in the local database of the computer used for the acquisition., Baseline
