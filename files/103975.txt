Optimizing the Announcement of Advanced or Metastatic Prostate Cancer Using Animated Videos (CartDiag PROSTATE)
In hospitals, the standard prostate cancer announcement system is based on oral and written information. To improve this system, we have developed animated videos that retrace the patient's care path.

This is an exploratory, controlled, before-and-after, multicenter study designed to assess the effect of a standard announcement system reinforced by animated videos on patients' level of understanding of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Patients' perception of information will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 questionnaire.
