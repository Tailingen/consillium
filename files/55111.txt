Safety and Efficacy of Ga68 Αvβ3 IAC PET/CT for Diagnosis and Clinical Management in Angiogenic Breast Cancer Patients
This is a phase I/IIa, open label, multicenter interventional study of Gallium-68 radiolabeled PEG-αvβ3-Integrin Adhesion Complex antagonist conjugate (Ga-68-PEG-Αvβ3-IAC) Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) imaging, intended for diagnosis, and clinical management of patients with angiogenic breast cancer.
Angiogenic Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ga-68-PEG-Αvβ3-IAC
Specific Aims 1:To evaluate the safety, toxicity profile and tolerability of Ga-68-PEG-αvβ3-IAC in patients diagnosed with angiogenic breast cancer., Assess drug safety and tolerability measuring Incidence of adverse events. NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, where: Grade 1, mild; Grade 2, moderate; Grade 3, severe; Grade 4, life-threatening, 6 Months|Specific Aims 2:To evaluate biodistribution and dosimetry of Ga-68-PEG-αvβ3-IAC, Assess drug safety and tolerability measuring incidence of abnormal vital signs. Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure., 6 Months|Specific Aims 3: To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Ga-68-PEG-αvβ3-IAC examination, Assess drug safety and tolerability measuring incidence of abnormal physical examination findings. Physical examination will be summarized for each body system such as head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems., 6 Months
Specific Aim 1: To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Ga-68-PEG-αvβ3-IAC, Assess drug uptake using median and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV)., 6 Months
This is a prospective non blinded trial, Phase I/IIa, multicenter, study in a total of up to 25 subjects with angiogenic therapy indication for breast cancer. All patients with confirmed diagnoses will undergo \[18F\]Fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT (6-12 mCi) and Ga-68-PEG-αvβ3 IAC PET/CT 2-5 mCi to evaluate safety, biodistribution, and response to treatment in angiogenic breast cancer patients.
