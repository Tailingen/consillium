Feasibility Study of MET-4: Evaluating Fecal Microbiome Effects in Immunotherapy Patients
This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and engraftment (cumulative relative abundance) of MET-4 strains when given in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). There will be a safety cohort (group A) of 5 subjects which will receive MET-4 in addition to standard of care (SOC) ICI. After the safety cohort, 40 patients will be enrolled in group B which will be randomized to MET4 with SOC ICI vs. control group with SOC ICI only. Group C will enroll 20 patients who have already started on SOC ICI and have had first unconfirmed progression of disease and expected to continue with standard ICI treatment. These patients will be randomized to continue receiving standard ICI alone, or SOC ICI with MET4.

Human associated microorganisms (the microbiota) inhabit virtually all surfaces of the human body. The gut is densely colonized by the microbiota which aids in the digestion. Animal and human observational and experimental evidence show a link between gut microbiota and the activation, regulation and function of the immune system. Pre-clinical studies in mouse models have linked the gut microbiota to efficacy of anticancer therapies. Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutics (MET) is a new treatment approach developed as an alternative to fecal transplantation. MET consists of a defined mixture of pure live cultures of intestinal bacteria isolated from a stool sample of a healthy donor.
