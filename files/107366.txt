A Trial of SHR-1802 in Patients With Failure of Standard Treatment for Advanced Malignant Tumours
This is the first study to test SHR-1802 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see if SHR-1802 is safe and tolerable for patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic malignancies that are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.
