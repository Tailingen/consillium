Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: â‰¥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 6 months.|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause during the course of the study., Up to 24 months|Number of Subjects with treatment-related adverse events (AEs), Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., Up to 24 months|Failure mode, Observe and collect the reasons for the treatment failure of the subjects during the study, Up to 24 months
In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant tumor that threatens the health of our residents. We designed a multi-center, randomized controlled, phase II clinical study of camrelizumab with or without radiotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab with or without radiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.
