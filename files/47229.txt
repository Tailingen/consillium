Real-World Clinical Outcomes in Adult Patients Who Initiate Systemic Treatment for Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma
Primary Objective:

To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in adult patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (r/r FL) grade 1-3a who are treated with currently available therapies in the real-world setting according to Lugano classification (Cheson, 2014) of malignant lymphoma and as assessed by independent central review.

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate the following outcomes in adult patients with r/r FL grade 1-3a who are treated with currently available systemic therapies in the real-world setting:

1. Objective response rate (ORR) according to the Lugano classification and as assessed by treating physician evaluation
2. Complete response (CR) rate according to the Lugano classification and as assessed by:

   * Independent central review, and
   * Treating physician evaluation
3. Progression-free survival (PFS) according to the Lugano classification and as assessed by:

   * Independent central review, and
   * Treating physician evaluation
4. Overall survival (OS)
5. Duration of response (DOR) according to the Lugano classification and as assessed by:

   * Independent central review, and
   * Treating physician evaluation
6. Disease control rate (DCR) according to the Lugano classification and as assessed by:

   * Independent central review, and
   * Treating physician evaluation
7. Time to next treatment (TTNT)
8. Histological transformation (HT)
