A Phase 1 Clinical Study of NXP900 in Subjects with Advanced Cancers
The purpose of this dose escalation study is to evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses and dose schedules of NXP900.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: NXP900
Number of patients with treatment related adverse events and/or clinical laboratory abnormalities, Day 28|Number of patients who experience Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) as defined in the protocol, Day 28
Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of NXP900, First dose through Day 29|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of NXP900, First dose through Day 29|Time to peak concentration (Tmax) of NXP900, First dose through Day 29|Half-life (T1/2) of NXP900, First dose through Day 29|Apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) of NXP900, First dose through Day 29|Apparent plasma clearance at steady state (Clss/F) of NXP900, First dose through Day 29
This is a dose escalation study of NXP900 administered to patients with advanced cancers. The study will propose dose and dose schedules for future studies.
