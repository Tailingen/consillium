A Study of Eribulin in Combination With Oral Irinotecan for Adolescent and Young Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors
This IND-exempt Phase I trial will establish the recommended Phase II (RP2D) dose of eribulin in combination with fixed doses of oral irinotecan in adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Eribulin will be administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, while irinotecan will be administered orally on days 1-5.

Patients will be assigned an eribulin dose level at the time of enrollment using a 3+3 Phase I design, and there will be no intrapatient dose escalation. Once the RP2D has been established, there will be up to 10 patients enrolled in a dose expansion cohort. In absence of disease progression or toxicity, subjects may receive up to 17 cycles of therapy.

The recommended Phase II dose of eribulin when used in combination with oral irinotecan, To estimate the recommended phase II dose of eribulin in combination with fixed-dose oral irinotecan in adolescents and young adults with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. A 3+3 trial design will be utilized. Accrual will continued based on DLT evaluation until the RP2D is established and at least 6 patients have been treated at this dose., Within 2 years
The number of patients with adverse events (according to CTCAE V.4) in patients receiving the combination of eribulin and irinotecan, The intensity of AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE V.4 on a 5-point scale, Within 2 years|The best overall response based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, To estimate the anti-tumor effects of the eribulin and irinotecan drug combination using RECIST 1.1 criteria, Within 2 years|The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve of eribulin in adolescent and young adult patients receiving oral irinotecan, Pharmacokinetic measurements will be performed on days 1 and 8 of the first cycle, 2 years|The peak plasma clearance, Cmax, of eribulin in adolescent and young adult patients receiving oral irinotecan, Pharmacokinetic measurements will be performed on Days 1 and 8 of the first cycle, 2 years|The half-life of eribulin in adolescent and young adults patients receiving oral irinotecan, Pharmacokinetic measurements will be performed on Days 1 and 8 of the first cycle, 2 years
