Evaluation of Fracture Fixation With Energy and Cement in Tumors of the Spine
The objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the SPACE 360 Delivery System using SPACE CpsXL Bone Cement compared to standard vertebroplasty in the treatment of pathological fractures of the spine caused by metastatic tumors of the spine, myeloma, or lymphoma. Up to a total of three levels per patient may be included or five levels for multiple myeloma. The control group will be standard vertebroplasty.
Spinal Fractures
DEVICE: SPACE CpsXL Bone Cement and SPACE 360 Delivery System|DEVICE: standard vertebroplasty
The primary endpoint is cement leakage as determined radiographically (CT). will be cement leakage measured by CT., 3 years
Secondary endpoints are reduction of pain (VAS) and quality of life measurements (Oswestry disability index)., 3 years
