TPO Combined With TPORA for Solid Tumors Effectiveness of cTit Above Degree II
In this study, real-world data related to the study drug will be prospectively collected, and 150 patients are proposed to be observed for disease characteristics and treatment patterns of oncology treatment-related thrombocytopenia. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on their platelet ratio: platelet count ≥50×109/L, \<75×109/L and platelet count \<50×109/L. This study was divided into 3 treatment groups (1:1:1): group A (secondary control), group B (secondary dichotomy), and group C (tertiary dichotomy). For platelet counts ≥50×109/L and \<75×109/L, they were randomized into groups A and B. Group A was treated with basal therapy including drugs such as interleukin-11, Ricocin, and Epsilon, while group B was treated with rhTPO and Hetropoxa, and was medicated until the PLT was ≥75×109/L. Patients with platelet counts \<50×109/L were enrolled in group C. All of them were treated with rhTPO and hypertrombopa and were medicated to a PLT ≥75 × 109/L. Basal therapy respected the investigator's choice of administration. Information about patients will be collected prospectively in this study, which will collect information about two tumor treatment cycles and pro-plateletogenic drug therapy during them for all included patients. The data to be collected will include the patients' tumor treatment cycle N(each cycle is 14 days or 21 days) and N+1 during two consecutive cycles of chemotherapy: baseline characteristics of the patients, the dose, frequency and duration of administration of each study drug, the name, dose, frequency and duration of combinations of medications related to the study drugs, the relevant laboratory tests and imaging examinations, and the records of adverse events prior to, during, and after the treatment with each study drug.

This research will gather real-world data on an investigational drug in a prospective manner, aiming to monitor 150 patients to explore the characteristics and treatment approaches of thrombocytopenia associated with tumor therapy. Participants will be divided into two categories based on their platelet levels: those with platelet counts ≥ 50×10\^9/L and \< 75×10\^9/L, and those with platelet counts \< 50×10\^9/L. The study design includes three treatment arms (in a 1:1:1 ratio): Arm A (secondary control), Arm B (secondary combination), and Arm C (tertiary combination).

Patients with platelet counts between 50×10\^9/L and 75×10\^9/L will be randomly allocated to either Arm A or Arm B. In Arm A, participants will receive standard care, which may include medications such as interleukin-11, leucogen, and yixuesheng. Meanwhile, individuals in Arm B will be administered recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) and eltrombopag until their platelet count reaches or exceeds 75×10\^9/L.

For patients in Arm C, who have platelet counts below 50×10\^9/L, all will receive treatment with rhTPO and eltrombopag until their platelet count reaches at least 75×10\^9/L. The choice of standard care medications will be made at the discretion of the investigators.

This study will prospectively gather relevant patient information. Data collection will occur over two tumor treatment cycles and during the administration of thrombopoietin-promoting drugs for all participants. Specifically, the following data will be collected for each patient across two consecutive chemotherapy cycles (Cycle N and Cycle N+1):

* Patient baseline characteristics
* Dosage, frequency, and duration of administration for each study drug
* Details of concomitant medications related to the study drugs, including names, dosages, frequencies, and durations of administration
* Laboratory test results and imaging examination findings before, during, and after treatment with each study drug
* Records of any adverse events

The aim is to comprehensively document these aspects to ensure thorough analysis and evaluation.
