ALTUS: Performance of a Multi- Target Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Test in Subjects With Increased Risk
The primary objective is to assess overall sensitivity and specificity of Oncoguard™ Liver for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) detection in a surveillance population.

DEVICE: Study CT/MRI Imaging|DEVICE: Standard of Care CT/MRI Imaging|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Oncoguard™ Liver Test
To demonstrate that Oncoguard™ Liver early-stage HCC sensitivity is non-inferior to that of ultrasound within a 5% margin, A maximum of 30 days from study or standard-of-care CT or MRI exam.|To demonstrate that Oncoguard™ Liver HCC specificity exceeds 82%, A maximum of 30 days from study or standard-of-care CT or MRI exam.
To determine a point estimate and 95% confidence interval for Oncoguard™ Liver overall HCC sensitivity, A maximum of 30 days from study or standard-of-care CT or MRI exam.
The study will include participants aged 18 years and older who are at increased risk for HCC, including individuals with liver cirrhosis or non-cirrhotic individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection.
