Longitudinal Analysis of Mental Disorders, Psychosocial Distress and Care Needs of Patients and Their Relatives
The primary objectives of this prospective observational multicenter study LUPE are to assess the prevalence of mental disorders according to the DSM-5 (objective need for psycho-oncological support), psychosocial distress, psycho-oncological care needs and utilization of psycho-oncological support services (subjective need for support) of cancer patients and their relatives during the first months of cancer survivorship stratified by biopsychosocial factors including socioeconomic status. The investigators further aim to identify moderating and mediating as well as associated factors for psychological distress and supportive care needs.

LUPE will include 2000 adult patients with solid tumor entities and one relative per patient at 4 measurement points from time of diagnosis to follow-up (+18 months) (t1: after diagnosis, t2: 6 month later, t3: 6 month later, t4: 6 month later).

The investigators aim to generate a quota sample according to socioeconomic status (SES) that is representative of the German overall population.

All participants will receive validated self-report questionnaires. Cancer patients will be interviewed using the standardized clinical interview SCID-5.
