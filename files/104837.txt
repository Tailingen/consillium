Effects of Dexmedetomidine During IRE Procedures for Solid Tumours
The purpose of the study is to evaluate effects of dexmedetomidine on anaesthesia during IRE procedures for solid tumours
Cancer of Liver|Cancer of Pancreas
DRUG: Dexmedetomidine
Patient Satisfaction With Anaesthesia Technique, Rating of how satisfied the patient was with their sedation on a scale of 1-5 with 1 being very dissatisfied and 5 being extreme, At the discharge from post-anaesthesia care room (up to 4 hours after the procedure)
Evaluation of anaesthetic consumption, During anaesthesia|Vital signs: blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, breathing rate, During procedure and up to 4 hours stay at the post-anesthesia care unit|Postoperative analgesic requirements, During the first 24 hours after procedure|Maximal pain intensity, The 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to assess periprocedural pain. Scale of 0-10, with 0:no pain and 10: pain as bad as it could be, During stay at the post-anesthesia care unit (up to 4 hr) and during the first 24 hours after procedure|Description of patient characteristics, Primary disease, concomitant diseases, medications, allergies, During one week before preoperative visit at anaesthesia clinic
Pulsed electric current can be used to produce irreversible electroporation (IRE) of cell membranes with resulting cell death. This process has been shown to ablate tumors in animal and human studies. A pulsating direct current of 20 to 50 A and 500 to 3000 V is delivered into metastatic or primary tumors in the liver, kidney, or lung via needle electrodes inserted under computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound guidance. Patients usually require general anesthesia with muscle relaxant. Currently, circa 30 procedures have been done at our institution with good or excellent results. However, several patients have had severe pain postoperatively.

Dexmedetomidine is an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic effects, and it has more selective α2-adrenergic effect than clonidine. We will evaluate perioperative dexmedetomidine 0.4 µg/kg/hr infusion effects on hemodynamics, anesthetic consumption, and recovery profiles during anesthesia for IRE of solid organs tumours.
