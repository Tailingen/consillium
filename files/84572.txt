Study of Adding Cetuximab to Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Advanced and/or Recurrent Cervical Cancer
This study aims to assess the activity of a combination of cetuximab (weekly) with carboplatin + paclitaxel (every three weeks) comparing it to chemotherapy alone in terms of event-free survival (EFS).

The poor long-term results in the standard treatment of chemotherapy for cervical cancer make research into new, more beneficial treatment strategies necessary. Cetuximab is a new type of drug that blocks the epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EFGR), and has shown significant activity in other cancers (colon, head and neck) where expression of EGFR is high. Cervical cancer cells express EGFR in a very high proportion of cases, especially in recurrent or resistant disease. This study evaluates the activity of the addition of cetuximab to full doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel.
