A Study of Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Upper Urinary Urothelial Carcinoma With Lymphovascular Invasion
This project is to explore the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on total tumor survival time, progression-free survival time, and recurrence-free survival time in patients with pTanyN0M0 upper urinary urothelial carcinoma with lymphatic vascular invasion (LVI) through a prospective case-control study.
