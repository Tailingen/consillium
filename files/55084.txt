This is a single-arm, prospective, multicenter phase-II trial for elderly patients with aNHL failing 1st-line treatment with immunochemotherapy containing rituximab and anthracycline, who are not eligible for either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, defined as age \> 65 years, or \> 60 years old with HCT-CI score \>2. This trial evaluates the CMR rate 12 weeks after tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) infusion, the incidence and severity of adverse events, progression-free survival, and overall survival after one and two years after tisagenlecleucel (CTL019).
