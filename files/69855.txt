A Phase 2, Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study of AMG 386 in Combination With FOLFIRI in Subjects With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma
This clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of AMG 386 and FOLFIRI with FOLFIRI alone in second line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

To estimate the treatment effect as measured by progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with AMG 386 + FOLFIRI relative to subjects treated with FOLFIRI + placebo., The time frame will be event driven and will occur when 100 subjects have experienced a PFS event (radiographic disease progression or death).
To evaluate other measures of efficacy or clinical response including objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) in subjects treated with AMG 386 + FOLFIRI relative to subjects treated with FOLFIRI + placebo, Treatment phase or until disease progression|To evaluate progression free survival and measures of efficacy by KRAS status, Treatment phase|To evaluate patient reported outcomes (PROs), relative dose intensity, incidence of anti AMG 386 antibody formation, pharmacokinetics of AMG 386 (Cmax and AUC) and safety (incidence of AEs and significant laboratory changes), Throughout study
This clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of AMG 386 and FOLFIRI with FOLFIRI alone in second line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
