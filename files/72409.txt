Safety and Efficacy of Folfox4 + Weekly Cetuximab vs Folfox 4+Biweekly Cetuximab by Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
To assess the efficacy of FOLFOX4 in combination with cetuximab, weekly and FOLFOX4 in combination with cetuximab, biweekly.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOX4 (Oxaliplatin), Cetuximab
The primary endpoint of the trial is: • Objective response (CR/PR), as assessed by RECIST criteria, Objective response (partial or complete) will be assessed using RECIST criteria. The objective response rate (defined as the rate of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) will be estimated and associated exact two-sided 95% confidence limit (Clopper-Pearson) will be calculated. In addition to the estimates within each treatment group odds ratios and associated 95% CI will be calculated using the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel procedure., The objective response rate - defined as the rate of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)
• Progression Free Survival (PFS) • Overall survival • Safety/Adverse events Safety, Secondary objectives are the estimation of differences in PFS and overall survival., he rate of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)
This multicenter randomized phase II study will enroll approximately 150 patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Patients are randomized in Arm A(FOLFOX4 in combination with weekly Cetuximab) or Arm B (FOLFOX4 in combination with biweekly Cetuximab). Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. The investigator will assess response to treatment every 8 weeks based on the imaging.

Following permanent treatment cessation, patients will be followed-up for survival.
