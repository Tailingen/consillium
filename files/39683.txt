Alpelisib and Capecitabine in Patients With PIK3CA Mutant mCRC Patients
The investigator assesses the efficacy and safety of alpelisib and capecitabine in patients with PIK3CA mutant metastatic colorectal cancer who failed two prior standard chemotherapies.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|PIK3CA Gene Mutation
DRUG: Alpelisib plus Capecitabine combination
Maximal tolerable dose, Maxiaml Tolerable Dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose of combination Maximal tolerable dose and random phase 2 dose confirmation in Alpelisib with Capecitabine in phase 1b, up to 6 month|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival with RP2D dose, up to 3 years
Dose limiting toxicity, Dose limiting toxicity, Up to 6 month|Objective response rate, Objective response rate (by RECIST v1.1), up to 3 years|Overall survival, Overall survival, up to 4 years|Time to response, Time to response, up to 3 years|Duration of response, Duration of response, up to 3 years
Phase lb To determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase ll dose (RP2D) of alpelisib in combination with capecitabine regardless of PIK3CA mutation of any solid tumors

Phase ll To investigate the progression-free survival (PFS)

Conduct the exploratory biomarker analysis for efficacy and resistance of alpelisib plus capecitabine combination (using collected clinical samples)
