A Study of Ramucirumab (LY3009806) in Participants With Advanced Liver Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to determine if the advised dose of ramucirumab is safe to be taken with chemotherapy treatment in participants with advanced liver tumors.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
BIOLOGICAL: Ramucirumab|DRUG: FOLFOX4
Number of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Event(s) (SAEs) Considered by the Investigator to be Related to Study Drug Administration, A summary of other non-serious Adverse Events (AEs), and all Serious Adverse Events (SAE's), regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Baseline through study completion (Up To 8 Months)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab, Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: 0,1.0,1.5,2.0,3.0,5.0,24.0,48.0,168.0,336.0 hours|PK:Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC[0-âˆž]) of Ramucirumab, Area under the concentration-time curve., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: 0,1.0,1.5,2.0,3.0,5.0,24.0,48.0,168.0,336.0 hours|Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Baseline through 6.1 Months|Percentage of Participants With Best Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate [ORR]), Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version\[v\] 1.1) criteria.CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all target and non-target lymph nodes were non-pathological or normal in size \[\<10 millimeter (mm) short axis\]. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease(PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including the baseline sum if that is the smallest).In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.

Percentage of participants with CR or PR= (number of participants whose best overall response was CR or PR)/(number of participants treated)\*100., Response to Disease Progression or Death (Up To 7 Months)
The main purpose of this study is to determine if the advised dose of ramucirumab is safe to be taken with chemotherapy treatment in participants with advanced liver tumors.
