Avastin Plus Chemotherapy vs. Avastin Plus Chemotherapy Guided by Cancer Stem Cell Test in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this randomized clinical study is to confirm the utility of chemosensitivity (ChemoID) tumor testing on cancer stem cells as a predictor of clinical response in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, regardless of platinum sensitivity.

Population studied will be female participants experiencing a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd recurrence of any stage epithelial ovarian cancer.
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ChemoID assay|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who receive standard of care treatment (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from the provided list) versus Bevacizumab plus ChemoID drug response assay-directed chemotherapy., 36 months
Median Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent EOC who receive standard of care treatment (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from the provided list) versus Bevacizumab plus ChemoID drug response assay-directed chemotherapy., 36 months|Objective Tumor Response, ORR: partial or complete response by RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), 36 months|HRQOL, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), 36 months
This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine if recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients treated with Bevacizumab plus drugs predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated with standard-of-care control therapy (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician).

Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by 1st, 2nd, or 3rd relapse of EOC regardless of platinum sensitivity (both platinum sensitive and resistant) will have a tumor biopsy or a cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug response testing with multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.

Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from the provided list), or to a study arm of Bevacizumab plus FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.

A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata based on relapse number, platinum sensitivity, and study site to ensure balance within these cells.
