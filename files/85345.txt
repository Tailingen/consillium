A Study in Leukemia Patients With Karonudib
The primary objective of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of Karonudib for the treatment of hematological malignancies.

Secondary objectives are to determine a recommended RP2D and schedule for further development of Karonudib, to determine the pharmacokinetics of Karonudib, to look for evidence of treatment efficacy. Overall survival will also be recorded.
