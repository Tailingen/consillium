Collection of Biological Data With Potential Prognostic Relevance in Patients With MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES
The present study is designed to determine the mutational status of markers (TET2 and PLCb2, cytogenetic aberrations) together with methylation status of the above genes using bone marrow and matched buccal cell samples from MDS patients who necessitate to start a treatment (i.e. EPO, Lenalidomide, Azacytidine). All patients included in the study will be followed for at least 2 years.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Analyze the incidence of TET2 gene mutations and Validation of the prognostic potential of TET2 mutations and MPLA screening, Analyze the incidence of TET2 gene mutations in a series of MDS patients and describe the clinical status of patients carrying mutations

Validation of the prognostic potential of TET2 mutations and MPLA screening on:

* Response rate to treatment with Epo, Lenalidomide and Azacitidine
* Progression Free Survival (PFS ), 2 years
Validation of the prognostic potential of TET2 mutations, Validation of the prognostic potential of Tet2 mutations on:

* Overall Survival;
* Validation of MLPA analyisis in the identification of cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS patients as a complementary screening tool;
* Validation of the prognostic relevance of MLPA analysis, 2 years
