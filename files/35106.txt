Prophylactic Radiotherapy Optimization for Enhanced Thyroid Function Protection in NPC
This study is a multicenter, non-inferiority, open-label, randomized controlled Phase III clinical trial. It aims to compare the efficacy of modified delineation radiotherapy (experimental group) versus standard delineation radiotherapy (control group) in the prophylactic irradiation of neck lymphatic drainage areas III/IVa in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The study evaluates the incidence of primary hypothyroidism, quality of life, and adverse events between the two groups.

Regional Recurrence-free Survival, Regional Recurrence-Free Survival (RRFS) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of lymph node failure in the cervical lymphatic drainage area or the last follow-up date., 3 years
Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up date., 3 years|Disease-free Survival, Disease-Free Survival (DFS) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of tumor recurrence or death from any cause., 3 years|Hypothyroidism-Free Survival, Hypothyroidism-free survival is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of the first occurrence of hypothyroidism or the last follow-up date., 3 years|Clinical Hypothyroidism-Free Survival, Clinical hypothyroidism-free survival is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of the first occurrence of clinical hypothyroidism or the last follow-up date., 3 years|Global Health Status, The quality of life of patients in the two groups will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30)., 1year, 2 year and 3 years
