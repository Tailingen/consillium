Placebo Controlled Study of VS-6063 in Subjects With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of defactinib (VS-6063) in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who have not progressed (confirmed partial response or stable disease) following ≥ 4 cycles of treatment with pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin. Prior to entry and randomization to the study, each subject must have tumor Merlin status(high or low) established by immunohistochemistry performed at a central laboratory. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral VS-6063 400 mg twice per day, or matched placebo. Randomization will be stratified by tumor Merlin status (high versus low). Progression will be assessed both locally and by central review using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1. Subjects will continue to receive treatment until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria are met. Following documentation of nonfatal disease progression, all subjects will be followed for overall survival by telephone contact every 2 months until end of life or the close of the study.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
DRUG: defactinib (VS-6063)|DRUG: Placebo
Compare the overall survival (OS) in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma receiving defactinib (VS-6063) or placebo, The median duration of OS will be estimated based on the 50th percentile of the Kaplan-Meier distribution, From randomization to end of life, an expected average of 12 months|Compare the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma receiving defactinib (VS-6063) or placebo, PFS will be calculated based on the stratified log-rank test, and will use Kaplan-Meier estimation methods for estimation of summary statistics, From date of randomization to earliest documented date of progression, an expected average of 4 months
To assess Quality of Life (QoL) in subjects treated with defactinib (VS-6063) or placebo using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale modified for mesothelioma (LCSS-Meso), QoL will be assessed using the LCSS-Meso. The LCSS-Meso total score will be analyzed through a comparison of median area under the curve (AUC) between the 2 treatment groups using a Wilcoxon test., Every 3-4 weeks from baseline through end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months|To determine the objective response rate (ORR) in subjects receiving defactinib (VS-6063) or placebo., ORR is measured as the best overall response assessed by central review using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1., Every 6-8 weeks from baseline through end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months
Determine the time to new lesion in subjects receiving defactinib (VS-6063) or placebo, Time to new lesion will be calculated from the date of randomization to the time of CT scan documenting a new lesion or date of other unambiguous indicator of new lesion development., Every 6-8 weeks from baseline until end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months|Evaluate the relationship of defactinib (VS-6063) pharmacokinetics (PK) and outcome, PK parameters, including but not limited to plasma concentration, AUC (Area Under Curve) 0-t, Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2, compared with outcome, Time points at Week 4, Week 7, Week 10 and Week 13|Evaluate the population pharmacokinetics of defactinib (VS-6063) in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma, PK parameters, including but not limited to plasma concentration, AUC (Area Under Curve) 0-t, Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2, Time points at Week 4, Week 7, Week 10 and Week 13|Evaluate the safety and tolerability of defactinib (VS-6063) in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma, Adverse events and their frequency, duration and severity, physical examination, laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG change monitoring as determined based on CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) 4.03, From start of treatment to end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months|To collect EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) for health economics purposes, Every 3-4 weeks from baseline through end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months
