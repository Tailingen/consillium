Phase 1 Study of F182112 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This trial is a Multiple center, Open-label, dose escalation Phase â…  clinical study. The purpose is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of F182112 when infused intravenously (IV) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of F182112 when infused IV.
