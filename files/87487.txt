Latitude - Lateral Lymph Node Attitude Study
Patients with advanced rectal cancer can sometimes have suspected tumour affected lymph nodes outside the standard operating field. These patients often receive preoperative treatment before surgery. There is a lack of consensus on what to do if there is remaining suspicion of tumour affected lymph nodes after the preoperative treatment. Removal of the lymph nodes using a broader surgical field with dissection of the lateral side-wall is often suggested, but the oncologic outcome is uncertain, and so is the patient reported outcome in terms of side effects.

This study aims to study the surgical treatment of tumour affected lateral lymph nodes to understand what lymph nodes require removal, and what effect that will have on oncologic outcome and the patient's function and QoL.

Patients with advanced rectal cancer will receive standard care, if lateral lymph nodes exist after neoadjuvant treatment they will be operated accordingly. The focus will be to compare two groups (with and without lateral lymph node clearance) regarding function, QoL and oncologic outcome.

We will also aim to identify features on MRI to improve diagnostic ability.
