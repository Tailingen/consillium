Assessment of Physical Activity During Therapy With Regorafenib for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to quantitatively assess the average amount of physical activity that patients are capable to perform while receiving regorafenib for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The assessment of this reference value, measured by CE (Conformité Européene)-certified pedometer and international physical activity questionnaire, will allow an estimation on the feasible amount of physical activity for patients in this therapeutic setting.

This study is available for patients who are included in the global non-interventional study CORRELATE (Safety and efficacy of regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer patients; NCT01843400) in Austria.
