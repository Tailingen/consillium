A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of ADCT-901 in Participants With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objectives of this study are to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to characterize the safety and the tolerability of ADCT-901.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: ADCT-901
Safety and Tolerability as Assessed by Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product.
