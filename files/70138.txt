This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab and capecitabine maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after first-line gemcitabine/cisplatin combined with toripalimab. Patients received a standard dose of toripalimab combined with gemcitabine/cisplatin every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4-6 cycles. Efficacy was assessed after 4-6 courses of chemotherapy, and patients with PR/CR were enrolled in the clinical trial for maintenance therapy. During maintenance therapy, capecitabine and toripalimab were used as maintenance therapy every 3 weeks until toxicity was unacceptable, disease progression, consent withdrawal, or withdrawal was determined by the investigator, or a maximum of 2 years of treatment had been reached.
