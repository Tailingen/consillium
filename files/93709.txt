HMA+DLI vs DLI Preemptive Therapy Based on MRD for AL Undergoing Allo-HSCT
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute leukemia, but relapse is the most common problem affecting long-term survivors of allo-HSCT. Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or combination therapy. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of hypomethylating agents (HMA) + DLI and DLI preemptive therapy based on minimal residual disease in acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: HMA+DLI|BIOLOGICAL: DLI
Relapse, Relapse was defined by reappearance of blasts in the peripheral blood, recurrence of BM blasts \>5%, or development of extramedullary disease infiltrates at any site, 2 years
Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS was defined as the time from transplantation to relapse or death in remission, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from transplantation to death from all causes, 2 years|Transplant-related mortality (TRM), TRM was defined as death from any cause except relapse, 2 years|Incidence of acute GVHD, Acute GVHD was graded according to standard criteria, 100 days|Incidence of chronic GVHD, Chronic GVHD was assessed in patients alive after day 100, 2 years
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute leukemia, but relapse is the most common problem affecting long-term survivors of allo-HSCT. Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or combination therapy. One method of solving relapse is to intervene before hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal residual disease (MRD) . DLI is an effective post-transplantation therapy based on MRD for relapse. Whether combination of hypomethylating agents (HMA) and DLI could improve outcomes remains unclear. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of HMA+DLI and DLI preemptive therapy based on minimal residual disease in acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
