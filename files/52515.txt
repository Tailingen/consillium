The first-in-human (FIH) study of XMT-2056 is a Phase 1, open-label study of XMT-2056 in previously treated patients with advanced/recurrent solid tumors expressing HER2. The XMT-2056 monotherapy trial will consist of dose escalation (DES) and expansion (EXP) parts.

DES will be the dose-finding portion of the study to assess the safety and tolerability of XMT-2056 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). The RP2D will be determined based on the totality of the clinical data, including safety and preliminary anti-tumor effect, PK, and relevant biomarker data.
