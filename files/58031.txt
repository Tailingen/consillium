Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment Protocol Moscow-Berlin 2019 Pilot
THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY is to optimize the therapy of patients with primary B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) by including monoclonal bispecific antibodies in post-induction treatment with simultaneous reduction of chemotherapy.

QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:

* to determine the efficacy and feasibility of chemotherapy and immunotherapy combination in comparison with standard PCT in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL;
* to determine the safety and toxicity of chemotherapy and immunotherapy combination in comparison with standard PCT in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL;
* to determine the possibility of chemotherapy reducing when immunotherapy is included in the treatment regimen without loss of effectiveness;
* to determine the possibility of reducing the maintenance therapy duration to 1 year when immunotherapy is included in the treatment regimen without loss of effectiveness.
