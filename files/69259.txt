A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Platinum and Gemcitabine as First Line Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (PIPER)
This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab plus platinum and gemcitabine (PG) in subjects with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). Evaluable 63 subjects with R/M HNSCC will be enrolled for examination of the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, up to 35 cycles) in combination with platinum (either cisplatin at 35 mg/m2 IV using a split-dose regimen on Day 1 and Day 8 or carboplatin at AUC 5 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, up to 6 cycles) and gemcitabine at 1250 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle, for up to 6 cycles as first-line treatment. This study will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well as their prescribed timelines and associated visit windows, are outlined in the protocol.
Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To determine Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 to treatment of pembrolizumab plus platinum and gemcitabine in recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients., 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), 1) To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS) to combination treatment of pembrolizumab plus platinum and gemcitabine in R/M HNSCC patients, 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events (Safety and tolerability), To evaluate the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5., 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), 2) To estimate Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 to combination treatment of pembrolizumab plus platinum and gemcitabine in R/M HNSCC patients, 24 months|Response duration (DOR), 3) To estimate response duration (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 to combination treatment of pembrolizumab plus platinum and gemcitabine in R/M HNSCC patients, 24 months|ORR and OS correlation, To evaluate the ORR and OS in correlation with PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS), 24 months
Genetic variation, To explore correlation between genetic variation and clinical response of patients., 24 months|Microbiome profiling, To conduct on-treatment microbiome profiling and determine the correlation with clinical response, 24 months|Circulatory immune cells correlations, To explore the changes in circulatory immune cells throughout the treatment period of patients, 24 months
This is an open label, single arm, Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab plus platinum and gemcitabine (PG) in subjects with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. Evaluable 63 subjects with R/M HNSCC will be enrolled for examination of the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab with PG as first line treatment.

The purpose of the study is to determine Pembrolizumab in combination with platinum and gemcitabine chemotherapies would be comparable with or better than the combination of pembrolizumab with platinum plus 5-FU chemotherapies, in terms of objective response rate(ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety as first-line treatment in R/M HNSCC.

All subjects will be given pembrolizumab (200 mg IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, up to 35 cycles) in combination with platinum (either cisplatin at 35 mg/m2 IV using a split dose regimen on Day 1 and Day 8 or carboplatin at AUC 5 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, up to 6 cycles) and gemcitabine at 1250 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle, for up to 6 cycles. Disease status will be followed by imaging studies at 6 weekly intervals (±7 days) during the first year, and every 9 weeks (±7 days) after the first year, until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death or end of study. RECIST 1.1 will be used as the primary efficacy endpoint of response rate. Safety will be monitored according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE Version 5.0.

Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well as their prescribed times and associated visit windows, are outlined in the protocol under section Schedule of Activities (SoA).
