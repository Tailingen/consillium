Phase 0/1 Study of 212Pb-NG001 in mCRPC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the imaging feasibility and safety of 212Pb-NG001.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 212Pb-NG001
Feasibility of SPECT/CT gamma camera imaging for uptake of 212Pb-NG001, To qualitatively determine whether 212Pb-NG001 can be used to produce images of sufficient clarity and sensitivity by SPECT/CT to confirm 212Pb-NG001 uptake and biodistribution., Up to 28 days
Safety and tolerability, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 28 days|Body clearance, To study body clearance of 212Pb-NG001 by gamma camera imaging and by sample and probe measurements., Up to 2 days|Therapeutic effect on prostate cancer as indicated by decreasing serum PSA and/or ALP, To explore any signals of therapeutic effects on the laboratory parameters: prostate specific antigen (PSA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Up to 28 days
This is a single site, open label, non-randomized, non-controlled intervention study with an initial microdosing run-in part (phase 0), followed by a conventional dose-escalation phase 1 part.
