A Study of BGB-B3227 Alone and in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter dose escalation and expansion study of BGB-B3227, a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-B3227 as a monotherapy or in combination with tislelizumab with or without chemotherapy in participants with selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will also identify recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDFE\[s\]) of BGB-B3227 administered alone and in combination with tislelizumab.
