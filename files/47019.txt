In this study, the proportion of MRD-negative subjects was detected by flow cytometry. Sensitivity is defined as: collecting 100,000 nucleated cells in a bone marrow sample, of which the number of leukemia cells is less than 10 (i.e., MRD level \<10 -4 ). Response with MRD detection at low-level (CRMRD-LL) is included in this category of CR, CRh or CRi with MRD-negative.

It is calculated from the start of cell infusion until treatment failure, relapse or death (various reasons). Subjects without the above events will be counted until the last follow-up examination date. For patients who did not achieve CR/CRh/ CRi , EFS was calculated from the start of cell infusion until disease progression or death. The first event shall prevail., 1month, 2 months, 3months, 6months ,9months,12months after CAR-T infusion|• Overall survival (OS);, used to evaluate all subjects. The time from cell infusion to death from any cause was calculated., 1month, 2 months, 3months, 6months ,9months,12months after CAR-T infusion|• Duration of response (DOR);, refers to the time from the first evaluation of CR, CRh, CRi , MLFS or PR to the first evaluation of disease recurrence or progression or death from any cause., 1month, 2 months, 3months, 6months ,9months,12months after CAR-T infusion|• Expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells (CAR copy number and CAR - T cell number), CAR copy number and CAR - T cell number, Days 4, 7, 10, 14 ,21,28 and months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 after Fast Dual CAR-T infusion|• The proportion of subjects with RCL detected in peripheral blood and the insertion site of CAR-T cell lentivirus within 15 years after the infusion of CLL1 and CD38 dual-target CAR-T injection., • The proportion of subjects with RCL detected in peripheral blood and the insertion site of CAR-T cell lentivirus within 15 years after the infusion of CLL1 and CD38 dual-target CAR-T injection., within 15 years after the infusion of CLL1 and CD38 dual CAR-T injection|• CR with partial hematologic recovery rate (CRhR);, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved CR with partial hematologic recovery., 1month, 2 months, 3months, 6months ,9months,12months after CAR-T infusion|• CR with incomplete hematologic recovery rate (CRiR);, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery, 1month, 2 months, 3months, 6months ,9months,12months after CAR-T infusion|• Morphologic leukemia-free state rate (MLFSR);, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved Morphologic leukemia-free state, 1month, 2 months, 3months, 6months ,9months,12months after CAR-T infusion
