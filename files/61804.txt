The Effect of Art Therapy on Physical and Psychological Symptoms of Breast Cancer Survivors
Art Therapy is a health profession in which art making is utilized as a means of expression and communication within a therapeutic and supportive relationship \[1\]. Art therapy has been shown to reduce psychological (anxiety, negative mood) and physical (pain, fatigue) symptoms which accompany many breast cancer patients and survivors \[2-7\]. Qualitative studies provide an initial understanding of the mechanisms through which art therapy facilitates symptom reduction \[8\]. Breast cancer patients have reported that art therapy provided them with access to emotional material otherwise inaccessible \[9\]. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of art making within a therapeutic framework on emotional awareness and acceptance.
