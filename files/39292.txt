MK-3475 and Gemcitabine in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a study for patients with previously-treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will evaluate the safety of adding an investigational drug, MK-3475 to standard treatment with gemcitabine. The study will also try to identify the best dose of MK-3475 to give in combination with gemcitabine.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: MK-3475|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Frequency of Toxicities (determine any changes in signs or symptoms that may represent drug toxicity), Patients are seen in clinic 12 times over 126 days to determine any changes in signs or symptoms that may represent drug toxicity., 126 Days (six 21-day cycles)
Progression Free Survival, Patients will have CT scans after every two cycles for up to 2 years to assess changes in tumor sizes., 2 years|Overall Survival, Patients will be contacted every 12 weeks following end of treatment to determine survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first., Every 12 weeks (up to 2 years)|Disease Response, Patients will have CT scans to assess changes in tumor sizes., up to 2 years
This study is an open-label, non-randomized phase I study, followed by open-label non-randomized phase II study. The first cohort of patients will receive 200 milligrams (mg) of MK-3475 by intravenous infusion over a 21-day period called a cycle along with Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 given on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Patients will be seen in the study clinic 12 times over 126 days for an evaluation of signs and symptoms that may represent drug toxicity. Patients may continue to receive MK-3475 (without gemcitabine) for up to 2 years.
