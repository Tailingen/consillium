C11-Acetate PET/CT in Multiple Myeloma: Added Value to F18-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT
Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography using carbon-11 acetate (ACT PET/CT) may help detect lesions before treatment and evaluate response following therapy in patients with from multiple myeloma (MM). This study aimed to prospectively assess the clinical utility of ACT PET/CT in MM as compared to the commonly used F18-fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG).
Multiple Myeloma
OTHER: ACT PET/CT
Pretreatment lesion detection, Reference standards: bone marrow examination and whole-body dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, Within 2 weeks before initiation of therapy
Post-induction response assessment, Reference standard: clinical response based on International Uniform Criteria and bone marrow examination if any, Approximately 4 months after initiation of therapy depending on the regimen|Post-ASCT response assessment, Reference standard: clinical response based on International Uniform Criteria and bone marrow examination if any, Approximately 3 months after ASCT
Progression free survival, Based on clinical follow-up (M-protein or FLC assay, bone marrow examination or imaging findings), With 2 years of follow-up time
