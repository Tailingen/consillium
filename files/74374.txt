Study of the Level of a Protein Which Could Predict the Development of a Fungal Infection in Patients With Acute Leukemia
The aim of this study is to investigate levels of a protein, mannose binding lectin, in patients with acute leukemia who develop or not an invasive fungal infection.
Acute Leukemia|Invasive Fungal Infection
BIOLOGICAL: blood sample
serum level of Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) in patients with acute leukemia, 1st day of the period of aplasia
Serum levels of MBL during an episode of aplasia for both groups of patients studied, Every day except Saturday and Sunday for roughly 3 weeks
