Detection of Lung Cancer by Plasma Lipids
There are no reliable blood-based tests currently available for early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. We try to establish a highly accurate method for detecting early-stage lung cancer by combining machine learning with untargeted and targeted metabolomics .
Early-Stage Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Plasma lipids
Plasma Lipids, A detection model based on 9 lipids were developed, including 3 lysophosphatidylcholines, 5 phosphatidylcholines, and a triglyceride. The 9 lipids were detected by targeted metabolomics by mass spectrometry., All samples were detected together after participants recruitment and sample collection. All samples were detected within 18 months from sample collection.
All plasma lipids were first detected by untargeted metabolomics methods and 9 feature lipids of early-stage lung cancer were selected by support vector machine algorithm. Then, a targeted metabolomics method was developed to detect the 9 lipids quantitatively based on multiple reaction monitoring mode. Finally, a detection model was established based on the 9 lipids.
