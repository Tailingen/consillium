Anastrozole and Letrozole After Surgery for the Treatment of Stage I-III Breast Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well anastrozole and letrozole after surgery work in treating patients with stage I-III breast cancer. Drugs, such as anastrozole and letrozole, may stop the growth of tumor cells by decreasing the amount of estrogen made by the body. Giving anastrozole and letrozole after surgery may prevent breast cancer from coming back (recurrence).

DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Letrozole
Percentage of Participants With Adequate Estrogen Suppression After 8 Weeks of Adjuvant Anastrozole 10 mg Daily, Percentage of women who have adequate E1 and E2 suppression (E1 \< 1.3 pg/ml and/or E2 \< 0.5) after 8-10 weeks of adjuvant anastrozole 10 mg daily having had inadequate E1 and E2 (E1 \>= 1.3 pg/ml and E2 \>= 0.5) after 8-10 weeks of adjuvant anastrozole 1 mg daily., 24 weeks
Number of Participants Experiencing a Grade 3 or Greater Adverse Event, Patients will be assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Patients were to receive anastrozole 1 mg daily for 8 weeks (ANA1). After 8 weeks of ANA1, patients with E1 \< 1.3 pg/ml and/or E2 \< 0.5 pg/ml completed study and patients with E1 \>= 1.3 pg/ml and E2 \>= 0.5 pg/ml were to switch to anastrozole 10 mg daily (ANA10) for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of ANA10, patients were to switch to letrozole 2.5 mg daily for 8 weeks. E1 and E2 levels were measured after this 8 week period. Patients were then go off study, 24 weeks|Percent Change in Estrone (E1) and Estradiol (E2) Concentrations, Descriptive statistics will be used. The median percent change in E1 and E2 concentrations from pre-AI levels will be presented., 24 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To estimate the proportion of women who have adequate estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) suppression after 8-10 weeks of adjuvant anastrozole 10 mg once daily (ANA10) having had inadequate E1 and E2 suppression after 8-10 weeks of standard dose anastrozole 1 mg once daily (ANA1).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the proportion of women with elevated E1 and E2 levels after 8-10 weeks of adjuvant ANA1.

II. To estimate the proportion of women with elevated E1 and E2 levels after 8-10 weeks of adjuvant ANA1 whose E1 and E2 levels remain elevated after 8-10 weeks of adjuvant ANA10.

III. To examine the toxicity profile of ANA1 over the 8-10 weeks of treatment, ANA10 over the 8-10 weeks of treatment, and letrozole over the 8-10 weeks of treatment.

IV. To examine concentrations of anastrozole at both the ANA1 and ANA10 dose levels.

V. To examine E1 and E2 concentrations, as well as letrozole drug levels, in patients receiving letrozole (following ANA10).

VI. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for examination of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-set(s) determined in the ongoing Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) Project 4.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

I. To examine association between clinical variables such as age, age at menopause, body mass index (BMI), receipt of chemotherapy, chemotherapy regimen, and dose on E1 and E2 levels after 8-10 weeks of ANA10.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive anastrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 56-70 days (8-10 weeks). Patients with E1 \>= 1.3 pg/ml and E2 \>= 0.5 pg/ml continue to receive anastrozole PO QD for another 56-70 days (8-10 weeks). Patients then receive letrozole PO QD for 8-10 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
