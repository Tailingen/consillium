Study of Immunotherapy in Combination With Chemotherapy in HER2-negative Inflammatory Breast Cancer
This phase II multicentre randomized open-label study will assess the safety and efficacy of Pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in inflammatory breast cancer. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Tissue and blood samples will be collected pre- and post-treatment for translational research.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and highly aggressive subtype of locally advanced breast cancer representing approximately 5% of all breast cancers that requires immediate aggressive treatment. Significant progress has been made in recent years using a combination of treatments, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy.

Accumulating data indicate a prognostic and/or predictive impact for immune-response variables in BC. Recent data, suggest that PD-L1 is overexpressed in a significant number of BC, notably in IBC and may have significant prognostic or predictive value. Furthermore it may be targeted to restore or boost functional antitumor immunity. Pembrolizumab, a PD-1-directed monoclonal antibody is already registered and has an out-standing activity in advanced melanoma and NSCLC patients, with promising results in several other tumor types, including triple-negative BC, and a favorable profile of tolerance.

Thus, potential benefits of pembrolizumab in combination with a conventional cytotoxic backbone may be considered as high in HER2-negative IBC.

The aim of the study is to assess the pathological complete response rate following neoadjuvant EC-paclitaxel chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab and to assess if neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline-based induction in combination with pembrolizumab exposes IBC patients to significant toxicity. rates.
