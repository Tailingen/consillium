A Dose Escalation Study of SDX-7320 in Patients With Advanced Refractory or Late-Stage Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation to assess the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous administered SDX-7320 in patients with advanced refractory or late-stage solid tumors.

DRUG: SDX-7320
Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of SDX-7320 to find the recommended Phase II dose, Up to 30 days after last subject enrolled
Anti-tumor activity, RECIST v1.1, From the screening visit though the end of the last cycle on treatment, an expected average of 16 weeks
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of active moiety SDX7539, Cycle 1, 3, and 6 Day 1: predose, 3, 6, 24, 48, 96 hours; Cycle 2, 4, and 5: predose|Area under the plasma concentration curve from zero to infinity AUC (0-inf) active moiety SDX7539, Cycle 1, 3, and 6 Day 1: predose, 3, 6, 24, 48, 96 hours; Cycle 2, 4, and 5: predose
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneously administered SDX-7320 in patients with advanced refractory or late-stage solid tumors.

Once the MTD has been determined up to 12 patients will be treated at this dose level, to further characterize treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
