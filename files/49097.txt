A Phase 1/2a Study of LON002 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
This clinical trial will assess whether a medicine called artemether, currently used at a lower dose to treat malaria, could also be useful in treating cancer. For this trial, the medicine is given in a new way, as a spray under the tongue. This delivery has several advantages, including better absorption into the body and it may be easier for people to take. It will be prescribed to consenting patients with advanced solid tumours, every day for 4 months, either once or twice a day. (For this study 'advanced tumour' will mean there are no other effective standard therapy options available to the patient).

The dose will be decided in Phase 1 of the study by initially testing 3 different doses of the medicine in up to 21 different cancer patients, to make sure it is not too toxic or causes any side effects.

After this, the highest safe dose identified in the first phase will be tested in up to 66 cancer patients in Phase 2 of the study, to see if the medicine is able to reduce the size of their tumour or slow down its growth.
