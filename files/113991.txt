Study of the Interest of Pursuing or Not the Chemotherapy for Patients With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer
Phase II study, randomized, open-label, multicentric, willing to establish the benefit of pursuing chemotherapy beyond 6 weeks for non progressive patients. The study will proceed in two successive phases :

* non randomized phase in which all patients will undergo chemotherapy
* second phase in which only non progressive patients are going to be randomized ("discontinuation design"). Patients that will show progression in their disease during the first 6 weeks will be released of the study
Esophageal Cancer, Squamous Cell
DRUG: pursuit of chemotherapy
Estimate the overall survival for patients suffering from Esophageal cancer, Non-progressive disease at and after 6 weeks of treatment until progression, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 8 months after the beginning of the treatment
Estimate efficiency in term of overall survival, of pursuing chemotherapy, beyond 6 weeks of treatment compared to a group that interrupted the treatment at 6 weeks, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 8 months after the beginning of the treatment|Estimate the efficiency in term of progression-free of pursuing chemotherapy, beyond 6 weeks of treatment, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, up to 8 months after the beginning of the treatment|Estimate the rate of non progressive patients, after the 6 firsts weeks of treatment, From date of inclusion until the date of the end the 6 firsts weeks of treatment|Estimate the overall survival of the whole study population, beyond the inclusion, From date of inclusion until the date of death from any cause, up to 8 months after the beginning of the treatment|Measure the toxicity of chemotherapy, during the initial treatment phase compared to the 2 treatment arms after randomization, from baseline up to 12 months|Estimate the consequences of pursuing chemotherapy, beyond 6 weeks of treatment in term of time until degradation of life quality and in term of overall benefits, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, up to 8 months after the beginning of the treatment
Initial phase: this part of the trial consist of 3 cycles of LV5FU2 (Bolus 5-FU 400mg/m² - 5-FU continuously during 46h: 3000 mg/m², calcium levofolinate 200 mg/m²) - paclitaxel (100 mg/m² at day 1) every 14 days. After 6 weeks,the phase will end with a check-up (clinical exam, tumor evaluation and biological test). Then, if the disease is non-progressive, the patient will proceed to the randomized phase.

Randomized phase:

* Arm A : pursuit of chemotherapy and best supportive care
* Arm B : interruption of chemotherapy and best supportive care
