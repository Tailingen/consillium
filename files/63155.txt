Micrometastases in Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer, Post-neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This study aims to investigate the significance of minimal residual axillary disease following NAC, with a particular focus on micrometastases (ypNmi), in comparison to pathologic lymph node-negative (ypN0) or macrometastases (ypN+). The investigators will further explore the prognostic implications of SLNmi for the prediction of axillary LN status and survival outcomes.

PROCEDURE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection
Recurrence-free survival, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, any cause of death, the interval from breast cancer diagnosis to the initial recurrence or death upto 5 years
