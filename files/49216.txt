Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Nab-paclitaxel in Women With HER2-negative High-risk Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide (AC) or Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide (EC) or Fluorouracil,Epirubicin,Cyclophosphamide (FEC)compared with neoadjuvant weekly solvent-based paclitaxel followed by AC or EC or FEC in terms of rate of pathological complete remissions at surgery.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Abraxane|DRUG: Paclitaxel
pathologic Complete Response (pCR), To compare the rate of pathologic Complete Response (pCR, absence of invasive disease in breast and nodes (ypT0/ypTis, ypN0)) for abraxane (AbraxaneÂ®, abraxane) vs paclitaxel., At the time of surgery: 40 months after the randomization of the first patient
clinical Overall Response (cOR), To compare the rate of clinical overall response (cOR) after the first 4 cycles of abraxane vs paclitaxel and to compare the rate of cOR after the entire preoperative chemotherapy (i.e. before surgery) in the study arms of abraxane vs paclitaxel, At the time of surgery: 40 months after the randomization of the first patient|Event Free Survival (EFS), To compare the Event Free Survival (EFS, i.e. disease progression while on primary therapy or disease recurrence after surgery) in the study arms of abraxane vs paclitaxel, 5 years after the first patient in and 10 years after randomization of last patient in|Distant Event Free Survival (DEFS), The distant event free survival (DEFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first date of distant metastasis while on primary therapy or distant recurrence after surgery or death due to any cause. Patients who terminate the study without evidence of any of the above events will be censored at the date of their last follow-up tumor assessment, 5 years after the first patient in and 10 years after randomization of last patient in|Local Event Free Survival, The local event free survival (LEFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first date of local progression while on primary therapy or local recurrence after surgery. Rules for censoring and methods of analysis will be the same as defined for EFS, 5 years after the first patient in and 10 years after randomization of last patient in|Regional Event Free Survival, The regional event free survival (REFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first date of regional progression while on primary therapy or regional recurrence after surgery. Rules for censoring and methods of analysis will be the same as defined for EFS., 5 years after the first patient in and 10 years after randomization of last patient in|Overall Survival (OS), The overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Patients alive at the end of study will be censored at their last contact date., 13 years from the date of first patient in|Safety and Tolerability, Patients will be assessed for adverse events by clinical examination, questioning for symptoms of toxicity, laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG and LVEF.

Neurological toxicity and other toxicities will be assessed throughout the study according the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) Version 4.0., Each participant will be followed for the duration of treatment period, approximately 9 months
In this study, eligible and consenting patients will be randomized to receive either 4 cycles of weekly abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) followed by 4 cycles of an anthracycline-containing regimen or 4 cycles of weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of an anthracycline-containing regimen.The anthracycline regimen (AC, EC or FEC) will be chosen by the investigator at the participating sites.

Before randomization patients will be stratified according to Disease stage \[operable (tumor stage: T2N0-1; T3N0) and locally advanced (T3N1;T4, any N2-3)\] and Tumor subtype \[luminal B intermediate (HER2 negative, ER or PGR positive, Ki67 from 14% to 20%) vs luminal B high (HER2 negative, ER or PGR positive, Ki67 \>20%) vs triple negative tumors (HER2 negative, ER negative and PgR negative, Ki67 any value)\]. Tumor subtype will be confirmed at two selected referral laboratories.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be followed by definite surgery and irradiation as per international and local guidelines.

During neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy as detailed in the protocol.

After definite surgery patients will be followed for approximately 10 years according to local procedures
