Study Comparing EC-T Verses PCb in the Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Non-triple Negative Breast Cancer
This study is a randomized, single center, phase III clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (EC\*4-T\*4) verses 6 cycles of weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin (PCb\*6) in the adjuvant chemotherapy of non-triple negative breast cancer patients. The study is divided in to 2 branches: PANSY-1 and PANSY-2. PANSY-1 is a study of hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative patients with ≥4 positive lymph node, while PANSY-2 is a study of HER2-positive patients with ≥1 positive lymph node.

PANSY-1 will be comparing the efficacy and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (EC-T) verses six cycles of paclitaxel combined with carboplatin (PCb).

PANSY-2 will be comparing the efficacy and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel with trastuzumab (EC-TH) verses six cycles of paclitaxel combined with carboplatin and trastuzumab (PCbH); both followed by 1 year adjuvant trastuzumab.

After pertuzumab became legally available in China, participants of PANSY-2 may choose to receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab dual targeted therapy, thus comparing the efficacy and safety of four cycles of epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (EC-THP) verses six cycles of paclitaxel combined with carboplatin, trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PCbHP); both followed by 1 year adjuvant trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

With the inclusion of pertuzumab in China's medical insurance in January 2020, study protocols were revised to include dual targeted therapy for HER2-positive participants.
