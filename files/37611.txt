Efficacy of Letrozole Versus Clomiphene Citrate on Ovulation Induction in Patients With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
We aimed this study to determine and compare frequency of induction of ovulation in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome treated with Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate as published literature shows variations.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Letrozole
Induction of ovulation was assessed by Transvaginal scan (TVS), Induction of ovulation was assessed by TVS. If follicle of \>2cm is found on 12 days TVS and smaller/collapsed on 16 days TVS, ovulation induction was labeled, 12 to 16 days.
Discrepancy between ovulation induction rate and pregnancy rate is related to anti-estrogenic effects on cervical mucus and endometrium and long acting gonadotrophins are more effective than clomiphene citrate. This study was aimed at comparing frequency of induction of ovulation in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome treated with Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate.
