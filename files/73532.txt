A Study of TAK-676 With Pembrolizumab After Radiation Therapy to Treat a Number of Cancers
In this study, adults with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) will be treated with TAK-676 and pembrolizumab following radiotherapy. The main aims of this study are to check if people are improving after treatment with TAK-676, getting side effects from these combined treatments, and how much TAK-676 people with these cancers can receive without getting unacceptable side effects from it.

Participants will receive radiotherapy, then at least 40 hours later will receive pembrolizumab followed by TAK-676 slowly through a vein (infusion). Participants will receive an infusion of pembrolizumab at the same dose every 3 weeks. Different small groups of participants will receive lower to higher doses of TAK-676 on specific days of a 21-day cycle. This study will be happening at sites in North America.

Number of Participants Reporting one or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Based on TEAEs Severity, AE: any untoward medical occurrence in participants administered with pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAE: any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug is considered treatment emergent. Severity grade is defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0.

The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-676. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of TAK-676 with pembrolizumab following radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC, TNBC or SCCHN that has progressed on checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) and will estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this combination.

The study will enroll approximately 65 participants. Participants will be assigned to dose escalating cohorts based on Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design. The starting dose of TAK-676 will be 0.2 mg and the subsequent dosing will be initiated based on the available safety and tolerability data from the previous cohort.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. There will be many clinic visits. The number of visits will depend on the number of cycles of treatment. Participants will attend an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. They might continue to have check-ups every 12 weeks if they left the study for a reason apart from their cancer getting worse.
