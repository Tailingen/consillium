This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of NT-112 in HLA-C\*08:02 subjects with unresectable, advanced, and/or metastatic NSCLC, colorectal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, endometrial cancer, or any other solid tumor histology that is positive for the KRAS G21D mutation.
