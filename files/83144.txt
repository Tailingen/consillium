Interim analysis, z-statistic will be calculated from the proportional difference between the combined treatment groups (all reminders) vs. control, At 50% (n = 1327) of estimated sample size
This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of two different reminder modalities in improving adherence to annual CRC screening.

Veterans eligible for enrollment into the trial will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation using permuted block randomization (with random block sizes of 3 and 6) to the following interventions:

1. Control arm: No reminder

   a. Intervention Type: No intervention
2. Arm 2: Automated phone reminder

   a. Intervention Type: Standard reminder via phone (audiocare)
3. Arm 3: Text reminder a. Intervention Type: Standard reminder via text (VEText)

Randomization will be stratified within arms by prior screening status (prior screener vs. never screener)
