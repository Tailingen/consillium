A RCT of Low MBO Drainage Strategies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EUS-BD compared with ERCP-BD in low biliary obstruction caused by periampullary cancer, pancreatic cancer or low bile duct cancer. This is a single center, prospective, randomized-controlled study. The primary endpoint of this study is stent patency time, and secondary endpoints include technical success rate, clinical success rate, operation time, operation related complications rate, reintervention rate, stent patency rate at 6 months, and 1-year postoperative survival rate.
