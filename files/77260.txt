A Double-blind Study Evaluating IPI-504 and Docetaxel in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of IPI-504 in combination with docetaxel to placebo in combination with docetaxel on life expectancy in patients with Non Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC). Docetaxel is an approved chemotherapy for NSCLC. An additional goal of the study is to determine the effect of IPI-504, in combination with docetaxel, verses placebo in, combination with docetaxel, on the growth of cancer
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: IPI 504 plus Docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo plus Docetaxel
Overall Survival, To determine the overall survival rate of patients administered IPI-504 plus docetaxel vs. placebo plus docetaxel, Up to three years from last patient study visit
Progression Free Survival, To determine the progression free survival rate from randomization to progression or death whichever occurs first, of all patients and in a subpopulation of patients administered IPI-504 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel, Up to three years from last patient study visit|Overall Response Rate, To determine partial response or complete response occurring at any point post-treatment, Up to three years from last patient study visit|Time to Progression, To identify the amount of time from randomization to progression, of all patients and in a subpopulation of patients administered IPI-504 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel, Up to three years from last patient study visit
This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC designed to compare IPI-504 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel. All patients will have at least a 15 pack year smoking history. Tumor samples will be assessed by a central pathology reviewer to confirm pathology that is documented at baseline; this review need not occur in advance of randomization.
