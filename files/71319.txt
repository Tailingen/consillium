A Study of LY2090314 and Chemotherapy in Participants With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Purpose of this phase I/II study is to test how well LY2090314 works in combination with different chemotherapies in treating participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: LY2090314|DRUG: FOLFOX|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Change From Baseline to 4 Hours Post-Treatment on Day 0 in Glycogen Synthase Phosphorylation, Change in the phosphorylation level of glycogen synthase, a glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitor, from baseline to 4 hours post-treatment on day 0 using tumor tissue and blood specimens., Baseline, 4 Hours Post-Treatment on Day 0
Overall Survival (OS), Baseline to Date of Death Due to any Cause Up to 21 Months|Percentage of Participants Who Survived at 6 Months, Baseline to Date of Death to any cause Up to 6 Months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was as the time from enrollment to the earliest documented evidence of disease progression or death,whatever comes first., Baseline to Disease Progression Up to 18 Months|Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Overall Response Rate (ORR)], Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all target and non-target lymph nodes were non-pathological or normal in size \[\<10 millimeter (mm) short axis\]. PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR calculated as: (sum of the number of participants with PRs and CRs) divided by (number of evaluable participants) multiplied by 100.

A CR or PR noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart., Baseline Up to 6 Months
Purpose of this phase I/II study is to test how well LY2090314 works in combination with different chemotherapies in treating participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
