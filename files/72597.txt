A Phase I Study of YY-20394 in Patients With B Cell Hematologic Malignancies
Protocol YY-20394-001 is a phase I open-label, first in human, dose escalation study to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of YY-20394 in patients with relapse or refractory B cell malignant hematological tumor.
B-cell Lymphoma Recurrent|B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: YY-20394
Dose limited toxicities evaluated with NCI-CTC AE v4.0, Incidence of dose limited toxicities and associated dose of YY-20394, within 28 days after the first dose|Adverse events evaluated by NCI CTCAE v4.0, Incidence of adverse events and associated dose of YY-20394, from the first dose to within 30 days after the last dose
Plasma concentration of YY-20394, This composite endpoint will measure the plasma concentration of YY-20394., within 56 days after the first dose|Objective response rate, the proportion of subjects who have a Complete Response or Partial Response, within 30 days after the last dose|Disease control rate, the proportion of subjects who have a Complete Response or Partial Response, within 30 days after the last dose
This is a two-part study comprised of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part.

In the dose escalation part single patient cohorts will be dosed until a single related toxicity of Grade â‰¥ 3 or a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is observed. If this occurs, the study will switch to a conventional oncology 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add an additional 3 patients if toxicity is observed) and escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached and a recommended Phase II (RP2D) dose is determined. Once the MTD is established a separate dose expansion part will enroll up total additional 12 patients at the RP2D.

In this clinical trial, YY-20394 is given orally once daily. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. YY-20394 was given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study. The protocol was initiated with a single-patient cohort, treated with oral YY-20394 20 mg once daily (QD). Subsequent cohorts used a 3+3 design and evaluated doses of 40-320mg QD. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Efficacy was assessed according to IWG-NHL and CLL consensus response criteria.
