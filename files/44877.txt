Trial of Exemestane +/- MM-121 in Postmenopausal Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Estrogen Receptor Positive and/or Progesterone Receptor Positive Her2 Negative Breast Cancer
To determine whether the combination MM-121 + Exemestane in ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer patients is more effective than Exemestane alone
Her2 Negative Breast Cancer Patients
DRUG: MM-121|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Exemestane
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To determine whether MM-121 + exemestane was more effective than placebo + exemestane in prolonging progression-free survival. PFS was a time to event measure, and progression of disease is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), "as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions". Progression free survival was defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to the date of death or progression. If neither death nor progression was observed during the study, PFS data was censored at the last non-progressive disease valid tumor assessment unless the patient was discontinued due to symptomatic deterioration. If this occurred, the patient was counted as having progressive disease (PD)., Time from first dose to date of progression, the longest time frame of 79.1 weeks
Overall Survival, To determine whether MM-121 + exemestane is more effective than placebo + exemestane in prolonging overall survival. This was a time-to-event analysis of time from first dose to date of death., Time from first dose to date of death, over approximately 2 years
The study is a double-blind, randomized Phase 2 trial of Exemestane +/- MM-121. The trial is designed to demonstrate whether MM-121 + Exemestane is more effective than Exemestane alone in ER+ and/or PR+ and Her2 negative breast cancer patients that have failed first-line anti-estrogen therapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting and patients that have progressed during (or within 6 months of completing) adjuvant treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI)and/or tamoxifen. Patients will be treated until radiologic or clinical progression of their disease is documented. Local radiologist and/or PI assessment is accepted.
