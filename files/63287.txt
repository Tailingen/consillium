A Dose Finding Study of XRP6258 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

- To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of XRP6258 when given as a weekly 1-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion for the first 4 consecutive weeks of each 5-week treatment cycle (Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 of each 5-week treatment cycle).

Secondary Objectives :

* To define the safety profile of the drug
* To establish the recommended dose and time interval for future Phase II trials
* To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of XRP6258 in man
* To assess the absolute oral bioavailability of XRP6258 at the i.v. recommended dose (following Protocol Amendment No. 2)
* To look for evidence of antitumor activity
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Cabazitaxel (XRP6258)
Dose-limiting toxicity, Up to 35 months|Maximum tolerated dose, Up to 35 months
Number of patients with adverse events, Up to 35 months|Antitumor activity, Measured by X-ray, ultrasound and/or scans, Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters including Cmax, AUC(0-t), AUC, t, t1/2Î»z (h), Vss, CL, accumulation ratio, Tmax metabolite ratio and F (bioavailability), Up to 35 months
The duration of the study will include the following periods:

* Pretreatment: 28 to 7 days before first infusion
* Treatment: Weekly for the first four consecutive weeks during 5-week treatment cycle
* Post-treatment: 3 - 4 weeks after last infusion.

Treatment may be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
