Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and Management for Canadian Elders With Cancer
A multicentre two-group parallel single-blind (outcome assessor) randomized controlled trial (RCT). A cost effectiveness study alongside a clinical trial using a payer and societal perspective to study the cost-effectiveness of geriatric assessment and management compared to usual care will be conducted.

Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual oncology care. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment and management in addition to their usual oncology care. The intervention will take 6 months to be completed. Total study follow-up will be 12 months for each participant.
