HSV-tk + Valacyclovir + SBRT + Chemotherapy for Recurrent GBM
Study to assess the safety and efficacy of HSV-tk (gene therapy), valacyclovir, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
Glioblastoma Multiforme|Astrocytoma, Grade III
DRUG: ADV/HSV-tk (gene therapy)
Survival in months from Study drug administration (Day 0), The overall survival in months of recurrent GBM patients drug administration up to five years, Up to 60 months as measured in months.
Progression Free Survival assessments will be done every 6-8 weeks for 1st year thereafter every 12-14 weeks until disease progression or death, Patients will have MRI or CT every 6-8 weeks for the first year post surgery. Thereafter patient will have MRI or CT every 12-14 weeks until completion of the protocol study specific treatment. Progression free survival will be assessed by RANO response criteria., Up to 60 months as measured in months
This is a prospective phase I-II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk + valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. This study is comprised of patients who have failed standard of care treatment (maximal safe resection followed by chemoradiation).

Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and imaging studies as well as by histological examination wherever a re-operation is clinically indicated. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood counts and liver functions tests. Toxicity will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores. Patients will also be followed to assess median time to progression and median survival.
