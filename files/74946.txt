A Study of ICP-022 in the Treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
The phase II clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ICP-022.

Safety, tolerability evaluation, and anti-tumor effects of ICP-022 in Chinese patients with R/R WM will be evaluated in approximately 44 subjects. Pharmacokinetics of ICP-022 will be evaluated in approximately 20 subjects.
