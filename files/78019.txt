Safety and Efficacy of Human Myeloid Progenitor Cells (CLT-008) During Chemotherapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to explore the safety and efficacy of CLT-008 as an extra supportive care measure after induction chemotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

The prolonged period of severe neutropenia caused by induction chemotherapy for the treatment of AML is associated with a nearly universal risk of febrile neutropenia. Standard supportive care strategies include administration of prophylactic anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents, but serious breakthrough bacterial and fungal infections still occur. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim, NeupogenÂ®) has been shown to shorten the duration of severe neutropenia, fever, antibiotic use and hospitalization following induction chemotherapy for AML. CLT-008, a human allogeneic myeloid progenitor cell product, is intended to provide the cellular target for G-CSF to produce neutrophils during the period of chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression when the patient's own progenitor cells may be limited in responding to G-CSF. It is hypothesized that the production of allogeneic neutrophils from CLT-008 will be sufficient to mitigate the infection-related consequences of induction chemotherapy for AML.
