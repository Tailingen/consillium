Durvalumab Plus Lenvatinib as First-line Treatment for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a phase II, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Durvalumab plus Lenvatinib as first-line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Durvalumab plus Lenvatinib
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients who had tumor response evaluated as CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 during study., up o one year
Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients who had tumor response evaluated as CR or PR or SD according to RECIST v1.1 during study., up to one year|Duration of response (DOR), The duration from the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment of PD or death of any cause., up to one year|Progression-free survival (PFS), The duration from the date of initial treatment to the date of disease progression (defined by RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause., up to one year|Overall survival (OS), The duration from the date of initial treatment to the date of death due to any cause., up to two years|Adverse events (AEs), Any adverse events (including type, frequency and severity ) related with treatment drugs according to CTCAE v5.0., up to two years
This single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Durvalumab plus Lenvatinib as first-line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1. Safety evaluation will be taken according to CTCAE v5.0. Disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are secondary endpoints. Multi-omics analysis will be performed to identify potential biomarkers for treatment response.
