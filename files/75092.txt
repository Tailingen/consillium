Sertraline Compared With Hypericum Perforatum (St.John's Wort) in Treating Depression
RATIONALE: Antidepressants such as sertraline and the herb hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) may be effective in treating mild to moderate depression. It is not yet known which treatment is more effective in improving depression in patients who have cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well sertraline works compared to St. John's wort in treating mild to moderate depression in patients with solid tumors.
Depression|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: Zoloft 50 mg|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: St. John's Wort 600 mg
Depression severity as measured by Hamilton Depression rating scale., To compare the change in depression severity in cancer patients with mild to moderate depression on sertraline and St. John's wort., 4 months
Somnolence, nausea, and insomnia as assessed by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale will also be used to assess somnolence., 4 months|Fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale., 4 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the change in depression severity in cancer patients with mild to moderate depression treated with sertraline vs Hypericum perforatum.
* Compare the severity of somnolence, nausea, and insomnia in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the impact of these regimens on fatigue in these patients.
* Correlate hyperforin concentrations with change in depression severity in patients treated with Hypericum perforatum.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to level of depression (mild vs moderate), concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and TNM stage (I, II, or III vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral sertraline daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral Hypericum perforatum daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Measurements of depression, somnolence, nausea, insomnia, fatigue, and hyperforin concentration are assessed at baseline, and at 1, 2, and 4 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.
