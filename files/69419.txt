A Study of SHC014748M in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHC014748M in patients with relapsed or refractory relapsed or refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma.
Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: SHC014748M treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR), up to 12 months
Disease Control Rate(DCR), up to 12 months|Progression-Free Survival(PFS), up to 12 months|Time to Response(TTR), up to 12 months|Duration of Response(DOR), up to 12 months|Mean Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) Scale., The FACT-Lym questionnaire is a validated instrument for assessing the impact of lymphoma on health related quality of life(HRQL) and contains 42 questions covering HRQL and common lymphoma symptoms and treatment side-effects. It begins with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), which contains 27 questions covering four core subscales: Physical Wellbeing (7 items), Social/Family Wellbeing (7), Emotional Wellbeing (6), and Functional Wellbeing (7). The FACT-Lym also includes an Additional Concerns subscale (15 questions) used to assess non-Hodgkins lymphoma(NHL) related symptoms and concerns. All questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4). Higher scores are associated with a better quality of life., up to 12 months|Safety and Tolerability of SHC014748M Assessed as the Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) or Abnormalities in Vital Signs, Laboratory Tests, or Electrocardiograms., up to 12 months
This is a phase II, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of SHC014748M, an oral inhibitor of PI3K delta, in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma.
