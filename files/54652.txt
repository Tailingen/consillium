A Study of PD-1 Inhibitors Combined With Fruquintinib and Chemotherapy in First-line Treatment of HER2-negative Advanced G/GEJ Cancer
This is an open-label, single-arm, single-center clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy of fuquinitinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors and first-line chemotherapy in the treatment of inoperable HER2-negative advanced GC/GEJC.

Eligible enrolled patients received 6 cycles of combined treatment with fuquinitinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy (XELOX/SOX) regimen. Maintenance treatment was fuquinitinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor and Teghio/capecitabine until disease progression or toxicity became intolerable. The longest duration of PD-1 inhibitor treatment is 24 months.
