Phase 1 Study of AUTX-703 in Relapsed/Refractory AML and MDS
This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and dose optimization study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of AUTX-703 administered orally in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies.

DRUG: AUTX-703
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), To assess the safety and tolerability of AUTX-703 by evaluating the incidence and severity of AEs, DLTs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation., From the first dose through 28 days after the last dose of study drug.
To Identify the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of AUTX-703, To determine the RP2D of AUTX-703 based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity data., From the first dose through 28 days after the last dose of study drug.|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve from Time Zero to Infinity (AUCinf), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUClast), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|Elimination Half-Life (tÂ½), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|Apparent Clearance (CL/F), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vd/F), From the first dose through the first treatment cycle (28 days)|To characterize the PD of AUTX-703, To evaluate changes in KAT2A and KAT2B levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow as markers of pharmacodynamic response, From the first dose through 28 days after the last dose of study drug|AML: Complete remission (CR) rate, Up to 18 months|AML: CR + CRh rate, Up to 18 months|AML: Duration of CR, Up to 18 months|AML: Duration of CR + CRh, Up to 18 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Up to 24 months|AML: Duration of response (DOR), Up to 18 months|AML: Transfusion independence (TI) rate, Up to 18 months|AML: Event free survival (EFS), Up to 24 months|AML: Overall survival (OS), Up to 24 months|MDS: Complete remission (CR) rate, Up to 18 months|MDS: PR rate, Up to 18 months|MDS: CR+PR rate, Up to 18 months|MDS: Duration of CR, Up to 18 months|MDS: Duration of PR, Up to 18 months|MDS: Duration of CR+PR, Up to 18 months|MDS: Event free survival (EFS), Up to 24 months|MDS: Overall survival (OS), Up to 24 months
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of AUTX-703, an orally bioavailable lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A) and lysine acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B) degrader, in participants with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The study consists of two parts: Part A (Dose Escalation) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and Part B (Dose Optimization) to further evaluate safety, PK, PD and efficacy at selected dosages.
