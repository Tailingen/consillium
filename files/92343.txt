A Study of ADCLEC.syn1 in People With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of ADCLEC.syn1 CAR T cells in people with relapsed or refractory AML. The researchers will try to find the highest dose of ADCLEC.syn1 CAR T cells that causes few or mild side effects in participants. Once the researchers find this dose, it will test it in a new group of participants to see if it is effective in treating their relapsed/refractory AML.

maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Dose escalation of ADCLEC.syn1 CAR T cells will follow Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design to inform dose-escalation decisions and potential maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3., 2 years
