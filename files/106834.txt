Comparative Study of Adjuvant Therapy for Postoperative Cervical Gastric-type Adenocarcinoma
Background: Gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (G-EAC) is a new classification of cervical mucinous carcinoma. G-EAC is a unique human papillomavirus unrelated adenocarcinoma that can be distinguished from typical endocervical adenocarcinoma (UEA). In China, adjuvant therapy for cervical cancer after surgery includes not only radiotherapy (RT) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), but also chemotherapy in many cases. However, no previous prospective study has analyzed the adjuvant therapy of G-EAC. This study is the first randomized phase III trial, which aims to recommend better adjuvant treatment options for G-EAC patients at high risk of recurrence in China, in order to better optimize and personalize patient care and improve recurrence-free survival and overall survival.

Methods: This trial is a prospective, multicenter study led by the Department of Radiotherapy, Affiliated Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Zhejiang University. Recruitment will begin in February 2025, and it is expected that 238 patients with postoperative cervical gastric adenocarcinoma with high risk of recurrence will be recruited from 16 clinical centers in China. Patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The experimental group will receive paclitaxel combined with platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy and short-term adjuvant chemotherapy, and the control group will receive the current standard treatment regimen, i.e., platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy, without adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is the 2-year progression-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are disease treatment failure pattern, overall survival rate, acute/chronic toxicity incidence, and quality of life assessment.
