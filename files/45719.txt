This is an interventional, open-label, integrated Phase 1 \& 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability, radiation dosing regimen and anti-tumour activity of Lutetium (177Lu) rhPSMA-10.1 (IMP) in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The study will consist of 2 parts: a non-randomised Phase 1 part, with safety, dose-finding, and dosimetry components, and a randomised Phase 2 part, with efficacy and safety assessments, and testing dosing regimens selected following analysis of the safety and dosimetry data in Phase 1. Both phases will include subjects with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive mCRPC, which has progressed following prior therapy. Phase 1 will include a post-chemotherapy mCRPC cohort of subjects who have experienced disease progression on or after at least 1 novel androgen axis drug (NAAD) (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide) and at least 1 course (but no more than 2 courses) of taxane-based chemotherapy. Phase 2 will include subjects who have experienced disease progression on or after at least 1 NAAD (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide) but have not received previous taxane-based chemotherapy for the treatment of mCRPC.
