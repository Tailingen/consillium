Treatment Protocol of the NHL-BFM and the NOPHO Study Groups for Mature Aggressive B-cell Lymphoma and Leukemia in Children and Adolescents
The trial B-NHL 2013 is a collaborative prospective, multi-national, multi-center, randomized trial with participating centers of the NHL-BFM group (Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Germany) and the Scandinavian NOPHO group (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden). The aim of the trial is to evaluate the role of rituximab in the treatment of mature aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia (B-NHL and B-AL) in children and adolescents.

The following primary study questions are going to be analyzed:

* the effectiveness (event-free survival) in pediatric patients with very limited mature B-NHL (R1 and R2 stage I and II) of substituting anthracyclines by the rituximab window without compromising survival rates.
* the effectiveness (event-free survival) in pediatric patients with limited mature B-NHL (R2 stage III) randomly assigned to receive the rituximab window plus standard chemotherapy or standard chemotherapy without the rituximab window.
* the effectiveness (event-free survival) and the immune reconstitution (recovery of CD19+ B-cells, IR) in pediatric patients with advanced mature B-NHL/B-AL (R3 and R4 incl. R4 CNS+) treated with BFM-type chemotherapy and randomly assigned schedules of one versus seven doses rituximab.

Secondary study questions will address

* additional parameters for immune reconstitution, lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulin levels, vaccination titers and infection rates
* kinetics of immune reconstitution after treatment
* adverse event and severe adverse event profile
* inter-individual variability of rituximab response
* role of different mechanisms of action of rituximab in advanced B-NHL/B-AL

Event-free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as time from start of treatment/randomization up to event or to date of last contact for patients without event.

Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from start of treatment/randomization up to death of any cause or to date of last contact for patients alive., through study completion, maximal seven years|Relapse-free survival (RFS), RFS is defined as time from start of treatment/randomization up to event or to date of last contact for patients without event. The following occurrences are defined as an event: non-response, progressive disease, or relapse., through study completion, maximal seven years|Response rate (RR), Complete response, partial remission, objective effect, stable disease or progressive disease, after rituximab window on day 5, after prephase (patients with rituximab window on day 10, patients without rituximab window on day 6) and after second course (on an average 5 to 6 weeks after start of treatment)|Adverse event rate, Rate of patients with acute toxicity defined as grade III/IV/V AE, from the first day of protocol defined treatment until two years after start of protocol defined treatment|Rate of patients achieving normal immunoglobulin level 12 months after start of treatment, 12 months after start of treatment|Time interval to normal immunoglobulin level, through study completion, maximal seven years|Time interval from start of treatment to normal CD19 positive B-cells in the peripheral blood., through study completion, maximal seven years|Rate of patients with normal lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood 12 months after start of treatment, 12 months after start of treatment|Interval to normal lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood., through study completion, maximal seven years|Rate of infections (defined by CTCAE V4) in the time interval from start of treatment until 24 months after start of treatment, 24 months after start of treatment|Rate of infections (defined by CTCAE V4) in the time interval from start of treatment until immune reconstitution (achievement of age adjusted normal B-cell counts), through study completion, maximal seven years|Rate of patients with sufficient titers after vaccination one year after start of treatment, 1 year after start of treatment|Immune reconstitution rate (only in R1/R2 patients), Immune reconstitution rate is defined as percentage of patients achieving age adjusted normal B-cell counts (CD19 positive subpopulations) 12 months after start of treatment., 12 months after start of treatment
Risk group stratification:

R1/R2 stage I+II:

* R1: resection status: complete
* R2: resection status: incomplete, stage I and II

R2 III:

- R 2: resection status: incomplete, stage III and LDH \< 2 x ULN (according to local reference value for adults)

R3/R4:

* R3: resection status: incomplete, stage III and LDH ≥ 2 x ULN but \< 4 x ULN or stage IV/B-AL and LDH \< 4 x ULN and CNS negative
* R4: resection status: incomplete, Stage III and LDH ≥ 4 x ULN or stage IV/B-AL and LDH ≥ 4 x ULN and CNS negative
* R4 CNS +: stage IV/B-AL and CNS positive

For patients with very limited disease (R1/R2 stage I/II), the addition of rituximab might allow the omission of anthracyclines without jeopardizing survival rates but reducing acute and long term toxicities. In this treatment arm, it is tested whether the event-free survival is similar to that of the historical control when all patients receive one dose of rituximab as monotherapeutic agent in the rituximab window R five days prior to the start of standard chemotherapy as a substitute for anthracyclines.

For patients with limited disease (R2 stage III) it is tested whether the event-free survival can be improved by adding rituximab to the standard chemotherapy. Two different treatment regimens will be evaluated in a randomized design: Patients in the standard arm will receive the standard chemotherapy. Patients of the rituximab plus arm will receive one dose of rituximab as monotherapeutic agent in the rituximab window R five days prior to the start of standard chemotherapy.

For patients with advanced disease (R3/R4) it is tested whether the event-free survival can be improved by adding rituximab to the standard chemotherapy. Two different rituximab regimens will be evaluated in a randomized design: Patients in the standard arm will receive one dose of rituximab as monotherapeutic agent in the rituximab window R five days prior to the start of standard chemotherapy. Patients of the rituximab plus arm will receive the rituximab window and additional six doses of rituximab added to the first four courses of chemotherapy. In addition the immune reconstitution will be analyzed comparing the effect of the two regimens of rituximab added to standard chemotherapy.
