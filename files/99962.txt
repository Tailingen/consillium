Efficacy and Safety of SCT200 in Patients With Advanced Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody（SCT200）in patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer treated after failure of Two chemotherapy regimens (including Platinum-based drugs).
Advanced Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SCT200
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 during trial treatment., 1 year
Progress Free Survival ( PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of SCT200 until the date of first documentation of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first,according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), The achievement of any a stable response（SD）, partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., 1 year|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from the date when a patient first meets the criteria for CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1, until the date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first., 1 year|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first dose of SCT200 until the date of death from any cause., 1 year|AE, AE are assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4.03., 1 year|Evaluation of immunogenicity, Serum SCT200 antibody levels were measured before and after administration., 1 year|exploratory analysis, To explore the possible correlation between EGFR and/or related gene expression and disease prognosis and therapeutic efficacy, 1 year
This open label multicenter phase Ib study is designed to evaluate Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Squamous non-small cell Lung cancer treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody SCT200.
