A Study Using Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA Testing to Detect HPV-Related Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC)
The researchers think that a blood test (NavDx®) may be able to identify cancer early by looking for circulating DNA from Human Papillomavirus/HPV. Circulating DNA are small pieces of genes that are released into the bloodstream. The purpose of this study is to find out whether using this blood test to test for HPV DNA will help detect HPV-related Oropharyngeal Cancer/OPC.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: NavDx
Proportion of participants found to have HPV-related OPC, : The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of screening by estimating the yield (proportion of subjects found to have HPV-related OPC out of all subjects screened)., Up to 5 years
