Loncastuximab Tesirine and Rituximab Following Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) in Patients With Primary and Secondary Central Nervous System Lymphomas (Lonca-R After SRS in CNSL)
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn if drugs loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab (lonca-R) after stereotactic radiosurgery are safe and effective for treatment of central nervous system lymphomas.
Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab (Lonca-R)
A safe and tolerable dose of lonca-R following SRS in patients with CNS lymphoma who have relapsed disease or are untreated and not candidates for HDMTX-based therapy., Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD): MTD is defined as the highest dose under consideration that has an estimated DLT probability below 25% based upon the Bayesian optimal interval design. The MTD will be decided based on the BOIN decision rules set for phase 1a portion of the study., 5 years
To assess overall response rate (ORR) following cycle 6 of lonca-R, To evaluate the preliminary efficacy (ORR) of lonca-R following SRS in patients with CNS lymphoma who have relapsed disease or are untreated and not candidates for HDMTX-based therapy., 6 months|To assess complete response (CR) rate following cycle 6 of lonca-R., To evaluate the preliminary efficacy (complete response rate) of lonca-R following SRS in patients with CNS lymphoma who have relapsed disease or are untreated and not candidates for HDMTX-based therapy., 6 months|The frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) characterized by type, severity (as defined by the NIH CTCAE, version 5.0), seriousness, duration, and relationship to study treatment., To determine the safety and tolerability of lonca-R following SRS in patients with CNS lymphoma who have relapsed disease or are untreated and not candidates for HDMTX-based therapy., 5 years
