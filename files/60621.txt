Mithramycin for Children and Adults With Solid Tumors or Ewing Sarcoma
Background:

- Mithramycin is a drug that was first tested as a cancer therapy in the 1960s. It acted against some forms of cancer, but was never accepted as a treatment. Research suggests that it may be useful against some solid tumors, particularly Ewing sarcoma. Researchers want to see if mithramycin can be used to treat solid tumors in children and adults. It will be tested in different groups of people, including those with a type of Ewing sarcoma that contains a chemical called Ewings sarcoma - friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (EWS-FLI1).

Objectives:

- To see if mithramycin is safe and effective against solid tumors and Ewing sarcoma in children and adults.

Eligibility:

* Children and young adults between 1 and 17 years of age with solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.
* Adults at least 18 years of age with EWS-FLI1 Ewing sarcoma that has not responded to standard treatment.
* Children and young adults between 1 and 17 years of age with EWS-FLI1 Ewing sarcoma that has not responded to standard treatment.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor tissue samples will be used to monitor the cancer before treatment. Individuals with solid brain tumors will not be eligible.
* Participants will receive mithramycin every day for 7 days, followed by 14 days without treatment. Each 28-day round of treatment is called a cycle.
* Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.
* Participants will continue to take the drug for as long as the side effects are not severe and the tumor responds to treatment.

BACKGROUND:

* Mithramycin, an anti-tumor antibiotic, underwent broad clinical evaluation in solid tumors and leukemias in the 1960s and demonstrated activity in some leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. In particular, mithramycin was found to have activity against testicular cancers and was briefly used in the clinic for this tumor prior to the development of the currently used treatment regimen.
* The Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) is the second most common malignant bone tumor of childhood. There has been very little improvement in overall patient survival in past years, particularly for patients with high risk metastatic or relapsed disease. Therefore, there is a need for effective novel agents for the treatment of this disease.
* Multiple studies have shown that suppressing the expression of EWS-FLI1 effectively limits the tumorigenicity of ESFT cells. Laboratory studies have shown that mithramycin effectively suppresses the activity of EWS-FLI1 both in vitro and in vivo.

OBJECTIVES (PRIMARY):

* Phase I portion of this study is to: determine the tolerability, toxicity, and the recommended phase II dose of mithramycin in children and adolescents with refractory extracranial solid tumors.
* Phase II portion of this trial is to: determine the objective response rate (complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Ewing sarcoma to mithramycin in children and adults using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria when administered at 17.5 microgram/kg over 6 hours once daily for 7 days to be repeated every 28 days until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
* Phase II portion of this trial to: evaluate if mithramycin inhibits NR0B1 in tumor tissue and determine changes in gene expression signature pre-treatment and at steady state on day +4 of treatment in patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with Ewing sarcoma and EWS/FLI1 fusion transcript with disease amenable to percutaneous biopsy.

ELIGIBILITY:

* Phase I Portion: children (greater than or equal to 12 months) and adolescents (less than or equal to 17 years) with recurrent or refractory extracranial solid tumors.
* Phase II Portion in adults: adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age at enrollment) with recurrent or refractory measurable extracranial Ewing sarcoma and the EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript.
* Phase II Portion in children and adolescents: Once the adult dose is deemed safe, children

(greater than or equal to 12 months) and adolescents (less than or equal to 17 years) with recurrent or refractory measurable

extracranial Ewing sarcoma and the EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript will begin enrollment to the Phase II portion.

* Participants must meet safety laboratory criteria and prior therapy limitations.

DESIGN:

Phase I Portion: Mithramycin will be administered in escalating doses to children and adolescents intravenously over 6 hours once daily for 7 days to be repeated every 28 days until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The cohort at the recommended dose or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be expanded up to 12 patients, and attempts will be made to enroll 6 patients that are greater than or equal to 12 years of age and 6 patients that are \< 12 years of age to gain experience with a broad age range of patients. A maximum of 18 evaluable patients will be enrolled on the phase I portion.

* Phase II Portion: Using a Simon two stage design, mithramycin will be administered intravenously at 17.5 microgram/kg over 6 hours once daily for 7 days to be repeated every

  28 days until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression to children and adults with Ewing sarcoma with EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript. Up to 24 evaluable patients will be enrolled on the phase II portion.
* The Phase I and Phase II portions of the protocol will enroll patients simultaneously.
