Palbociclib and Cetuximab Versus Cetuximab Monotherapy for Patients With CDKN2A-altered, HPV-unrelated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Who Experienced Disease Progression on a PD-1/L1 Inhibitor
This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial will determine if palbociclib and cetuximab (Arm 1) improves overall survival (OS) in comparison to cetuximab monotherapy (Arm 2) in patients with CDKN2A-altered, HPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who experienced disease progression on a PD-1/L1 inhibitor (given as monotherapy or in combination with other therapy).
HPV-unrelated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Cetuximab
Overall survival (OS), -Defined as the time from the date of treatment to the date of death, censored at the last follow-up otherwise., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 15 months)
Overall response rate (ORR) - (complete response + partial response), * Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 weeks)|Duration of response (DoR), -The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 weeks)|Progression-free survival (PFS), * Defined as the days from the date of treatment start to progression or death. The alive patients without progression are censored at the last follow-up.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 15 months)|Frequency of adverse events, -Will be measured by CTCAE v. 5.0, From start of treatment through 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 16 weeks)|Dose delivery as measured by percent of full doses given over time, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 weeks)|Correlate CCND1 and PIK3CA alterations with efficacy endpoints, Tailored Next Generation Sequencing Report (performed before trial enrollment) will be collected to tabulate additional somatic genomic alterations to be used to correlate with efficacy endpoints., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 15 months)|Changes in genomic alterations of tumor, At baseline and at time of progression (estimated to be 15 months)
