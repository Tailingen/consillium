Trial of Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4) in Combination With Rituximab or Rituximab + Chemotherapy in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The primary objectives of this study are:

* To investigate the safety and tolerability, and to define the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2DS) for magrolimab in combination with rituximab and for magrolimab in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx).
* To evaluate the efficacy of magrolimab in combination with rituximab in participants with indolent lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to evaluate the efficacy of magrolimab in combination with R-GemOx in autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) ineligible DLBCL participants.

DRUG: Magrolimab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Allopurinol
Phase 1b: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Antibody Treatment Combination, DLTs refer to toxicities experienced during the first 28 days of study treatment that have been judged to be clinically significant and related to study treatment in participant in Phase 1b. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or greater AE that was assessed as related to either magrolimab and/or rituximab that occurred during the 4-week DLT observation period. Any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that was, in the opinion of the Clinical Trial Steering Committee, of potential clinical significance such that further dosing exposed participants to unacceptable risk, was considered a DLT., Up to 28 days|Phase 1b: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Chemotherapy Treatment Combination, DLTs refer to toxicities experienced during the first 28 days of study treatment that have been judged to be clinically significant and related to study treatment in participant in Phase 1b.
