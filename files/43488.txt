Voriconazole and Caspofungin Acetate in Treating Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With Weakened Immune Systems
RATIONALE: Voriconazole and caspofungin acetate may control invasive fungal infections in patients who have weakened immune systems.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving voriconazole together with caspofungin acetate works in treating invasive fungal infections in patients with weakened immune systems.
Infection|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: caspofungin acetate|DRUG: voriconazole
Number of Participants With a Complete or Partial Response Rate to the Combination of Voriconazole and Caspofungin at 12 Weeks., Patients will be followed through day 84 (12 weeks), regardless of continuation of study drugs. Complete response: Resolution of all clinical signs and symptoms and more than 90 percent of the lesions due to invasive fungus that were visible by radiology. Partial response: Clinical improvement and greater than 50 percent improvement in the lesions due to invasive fungus that were visible by radiology., 12 weeks after starting treatment
Survival at 12 Weeks, Defined as the number of evaluable subjects alive at 12 weeks (84 days) following registration., up to 12 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the 12-week complete and partial response rate in immunocompromised patients with invasive fungal infections treated with voriconazole and caspofungin acetate.

Secondary

* Determine the 12-week survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive voriconazole orally or IV over 1 hour twice daily and caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-84. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
