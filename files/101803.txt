OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the quality of survival of patients in the UK and other European countries enrolled in previous International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) 2 or 3 phase III trials for treatment of pediatric primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET).
* Compare the quality of survival between children allocated to different treatments in these trials.

Secondary

* Determine the framework that will allow similar information to be collected across all participating countries in the PNET 4 trial that opened in autumn 2002.
