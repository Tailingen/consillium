Multiple myeloma is the second most frequent hematologic malignancy, which incidence augmented between 1995 and 2018, with an annual mean variation of +0.6% to 1.1%. Although treatment improved in the last years, the patients' prognostic is associated with cytogenetic abnormalities.

Oncological supportive care provides patients with a global perspective, in addition to specific medical treatment adapted to pathology and patient profile. It contributes to the improvement of quality of life of patients, throughout their care pathway regarding physical, psychological and social aspects, according to their specific needs as well as their caregivers'.
