A Proof-of-concept Clinical Trial Assessing the Safety of the Coordinated Undermining of Survival Paths by 9 Repurposed Drugs Combined With Metronomic Temozolomide (CUSP9v3 Treatment Protocol) for Recurrent Glioblastoma
A proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety of the coordinated undermining of survival paths by 9 repurposed drugs combined with metronomic temozolomide (CUSP9v3 treatment protocol) for recurrent glioblastoma
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Aprepitant|DRUG: Minocycline|DRUG: Disulfiram|DRUG: Celecoxib|DRUG: Sertraline|DRUG: Captopril|DRUG: Itraconazole|DRUG: Ritonavir|DRUG: Auranofin
Endpoint for phase Ib is the number of patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicity defined as:, * either any unmanageable grade 3-4 toxicity at the end of the second treatment cycle
* or inability to receive at least 7 of the 10 drugs, all of them being given at â‰¥50% of the target doses at the end of the second treatment cycle
* Modifications in terms of doses and/or number of drugs are accepted at any time during treatment., Week 12|Endpoint for phase IIa of the trial is objective stable disease or a better tumor response (i.e., partial response, complete response), as assessed by non-contrast and contrast-enhanced standard cranial MRI interpreted using RANO criteria after 6 treatment cycles in comparison to the baseline MRI., Week 12
Overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier estimates, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression-free survival according to Kaplan-Meier estimates, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Best tumor response according to the Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, through study completion, an average of 1 year
A proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety of the coordinated undermining of survival paths by 9 repurposed drugs (aprepitant, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib, disulfiram, itraconazole, minocycline, ritonavir and sertraline) combined with metronomic temozolomide (CUSP9v3 treatment protocol) for recurrent glioblastoma. This is a phase I study for subjects of 18 years and older with glioblastoma that has relapsed after radiation and chemotherapy, as confirmed by histology and MRI.

A total of 10 patients will be treated with the CUSP9v3 treatment protocol. This is a monocentric trial: all patients will be treated at Ulm University Hospital.
