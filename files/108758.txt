Fluid Biopsy for the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer
This trial collects and studies blood samples via fluid biopsy for the diagnosis of lung cancer. Studying blood samples in the laboratory may help doctors develop a blood test for lung cancer in the future and provide a better way to screen patients for lung cancer.
Lung Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|PROCEDURE: Liquid Biopsy|OTHER: Medical Chart Review
Clinical diagnosis of lung cancer, Descriptive statistics including sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value will be tabulated., Within 90 days of tissue biopsy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the fluid biopsy in establishing a diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the accuracy of determination of the histologic subtype of bronchogenic lung cancer.

II. To determine the relative contribution of cell based high definition circulating tumor cell assay (HD-CTC) and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and plasma based circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) assays in determination of diagnosis and histologic subtype.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of blood samples on day 1 for analysis via high definition (HD)-single cell analysis (SCA) fluid biopsy. Medical charts of patients are reviewed at 3 months post-biopsy or computed tomography (CT) screening.

After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
