HPV Infection and Vaginal Microecology in Immunosuppressed Women
This study intends to establish a screening cohort for HPV infection and related tumors in areas with high incidence of HIV infection, explore the screening of cervical cancer and anal cancer and the prognosis management model of precancerous lesions in HIV-infected women, and provide a scientific basis for the formulation of malignant tumor screening policies for this population in my country. In addition, this study intends to characterize the cervical, vaginal, and intestinal microecological characteristics of women with different HIV/HPV infection status, so as to explore the impact of cervical, vaginal, and intestinal microecological characteristics on persistent HPV infection or CIN/cancer progression.
