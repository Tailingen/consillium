Lenvatinib After Progression on Atezolizumab-bevacizumab in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Although atezolizumab-bevacizumab has been positioned as the standard first-line therapy in unresectable heptocellular carcinoma, eventually most patients progressed on this regimen. Despite of multiple drugs are approved for the management of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, only a few trials have been conducted to investigate their efficacy in the second-line setting after the progression on atezolizumab-bevacizumab. Lenvatinib is approved first-line multikinase inhibitor in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but has not yet been investigated as second-line therapy in prospective study. In this single arm phase 2 study, the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib will be investigated for patients who progressed on first-line atezolizumab-bevacizumab.
