The Incidence of Gallstones After Gastric Cancer Surgery
Through previous clinical observations and literature, we found that the incidence of gallstones in patients after gastric cancer radical resection was significantly higher than that in the normal population (4%). However, its pathogenesis has not been clarified. We compare the risk of gallbladder stones after four different radical gastric cancer surgical methods, in order to provide prevention and treatment strategies for people with gallstones after gastric cancer.
Gallstones|Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Resection
Number of gallstone patients, Four different gastric cancer patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The number of patients with gallbladder stones revealed by B-ultrasound, 3 years
Number of malignant metastasis, Number of malignant metastases after radical gastrectomy in surgery methods of gastric cancer patients, 3 years|Number of short-term deaths, Number of short-term deaths after radical gastrectomy in surgery methods of gastric cancer patients, 3 months|Number of physical regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, The number of physical regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and other events that affect quality of life in four surgery methods of gastric cancer patients, 3 years
A large number of clinical studies have found that the incidence of gallstones in patients with radical gastric cancer is higher than that in the normal population. However, its pathogenesis has not been clarified, and there is still controversy about the prophylactic removal of gallbladder in patients with gastric cancer. The investigator's previous study found that there was no statistical difference in the incidence of gallstones after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG), laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) and laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG). A common feature of the three surgical methods is that the vagus nerve were more or less cut during the operation. Therefore, we plan to further collect gastric cancer patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery in order to answer whether the vagus nerve cut during surgery will increase the incidence of gallstones.
