Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Sequentially Combined with Sintilimab in Resectable EGFR-Mutant NSCLC
This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center Phase II trial, aiming to investigate efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy sequentially combined with sintilimab in resectable EGFR-mutant stage II-IIIB non-squamous NSCLC patients
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: Sintilimab
major pathological response (MPR), MPR is defined as â‰¤10% residual viable tumor cells in the lung and lymph nodes, to be evaluated within 2 weeks post-surgery., Evaluated within 2 weeks post-surgery.
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), pCR is defined as the absence of residual tumor in both the lung and lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy, Evaluated within 2 weeks post-surgery.|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the start of neoadjuvant therapy to the occurrence of any disease progression that precludes surgery, post-surgical disease progression or recurrence, disease progression without surgery, or death from any cause. It is measured from the start of neoadjuvant therapy to the first recorded date of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first)., up to 3 years after enrollment
Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy in NSCLC patients without driver gene mutations, while their effectiveness in patients with driver gene mutations remains controversial. This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center Phase II trial targeting eligible subjects with resectable EGFR-mutated stage II-IIIB non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab combined with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy.

Eligible subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and have signed the informed consent will receive sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy, with a treatment cycle of 3 weeks. A tumor assessment will be conducted before the start of the third cycle of treatment, and surgery will be performed within 3-6 weeks after the last cycle of neoadjuvant therapy, with a tumor assessment conducted 7 days prior to surgery. After completing local treatment (surgery), researchers will offer optional adjuvant therapy to patients, including EGFR-TKI. Concurrently, dynamic blood samples will be collected before neoadjuvant therapy and after each treatment cycle for exploratory analysis, with the evaluation of MPR and pCR based on circulating tumor DNA minimal residual disease (ctDNA-MRD).
