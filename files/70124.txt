A Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of ABSK043 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a Phase 1, Open-Label Study of ABSK043 to Assess Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumor.

Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed. Investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) effects and Investigate the metabolites of oral ABSK043

surface PD-L1 expression, Programmed death-ligand 1, Time Frame:at the end of Cycle 1 Day15 (each cycle is 28 days)|metabolites of ABSK043, any major active metabolites, Time Frame: at the end of Cycle 1 Day15 (each cycle is 28 days)|soluble PD-L1,, Programmed death-ligand 1, Time Frame:at the end of Cycle 1 Day15 (each cycle is 28 days)
The study will start with a dose escalation part of single-agent ABSK043 administered in repeated 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid for safety and tolerability. The expansion part of oral ABSK043 at recommended dose of expansion (RDE) will be followed for further evaluating safety and tolerability among selected tumor types. Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed.
