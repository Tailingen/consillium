A Pilot Clinical Study to Evaluate the Feasibility of Using the SPC Test
Precision medicine approaches emphasize the importance of reliable prognostic tools for guiding individualized therapy decisions. In this study, we evaluated the clinical feasibility of the Single Patient Classifier (SPC) test, a new clinical-grade prognostic assay, in stage II-III gastric cancer patients.

A prospective multicenter study was conducted, involving 237 patients who underwent gastrectomy between September 2019 and August 2020 across nine hospitals. The SPC test was employed to stratify patients into risk groups, and its feasibility and performance were evaluated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of the cases in which the test results were timely delivered before selecting postoperative treatment. Furthermore, 3-year disease-free survivals of risk groups were analyzed.
