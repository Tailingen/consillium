Precision Medicine in the Prostate Cancer Care Pathway
This study aims to evaluate the use of a prostate cancer specific predisposition genetic panel test in men with / at high risk of prostate cancer. The genetic test will analyse men's DNA samples for the presence of mutations in rare genes as well as common genetic variation to provide men with information about their risk of prostate cancer. This study will evaluate the clinical impact of the test on risk assessment and clinical management in terms of screening and treatment.
Prostate Cancer|Genetic Predisposition
GENETIC: Prostate cancer risk gene panel
Prevalence of genetic variation in affected men, To determine the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) specific genetic variation in men with: (a)young onset PrCa; (b) metastatic PrCa; (c) men with PrCa and a family history of PrCa compared with controls., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Prevalence of genetic variation in unaffected men, To determine the prevalence of prostate cancer specific genetic variation in unaffected men with a strong family history of prostate cancer compared with controls., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Prostate Cancer genetic variation on clinical outcome, To determine how prostate cancer specific genetic variation influences clinical outcome in 'high-risk' vs 'low risk' groups., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
