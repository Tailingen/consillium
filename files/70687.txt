Secondary Prevention of VTE in Patients With Cancer and Catheter-Related Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis
This trial seeks to evaluate a management strategy after the acute treatment duration (≥ 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation) for patients with cancer and catheter-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The aim of the STREAM-Line Trial is to demonstrate that the STREAM-Line management strategy is safe after the acute treatment duration (≥ 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation) in patients with cancer and catheter-related upper extremity DVT. Upon enrollment and during follow-up, patients will be managed with a prophylactic dose of apixaban (2.5 mg orally twice daily) as long as either a central venous catheter (CVC) or active cancer is present (STREAM-Line management strategy). Apixaban will be stopped at the time of CVC removal and when cancer is in remission. Day 90±14 and Day 180+14 follow-up visit procedures will be done by phone call or in person.
