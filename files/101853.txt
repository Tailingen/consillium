A multicenter, single-arm, prospective, open-label study to detect the efficacy and safety of flumatinib by measuring rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months in CML-CP patients with Ph+ in China. Approximately 200 Patients will be recruited consecutively from the study sites during the enrollment period and will be given flumatinib 600 mg QD. The duration of patient participation will be 24 months.
