Safety and Activity Study of HER2-Targeted Dual Switch CAR-T Cells (BPX-603) in Subjects With HER2-Positive Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of HER2-specific dual-switch CAR-T cells, BPX-603, administered with rimiducid to subjects with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors which are HER2 amplified/overexpressed.

Proportion of subjects experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities at increasing doses of BPX-603, Dose limiting toxicities are defined as BPX-603-related adverse events., 35 days from time of BPX-603 infusion|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE), Identify the optimal dose of BPX-603 for Phase 2., through Phase 1 completion, up to 2 years
Persistence of HER2-CAR T cells (cell counts), The persistence over time of BPX-603 CAR T cells in the peripheral blood as determined by flow cytometry (% CAR+ cells)., measured over time from baseline through study completion, up to 5 years|Expansion of HER2-CAR T cells (vector copy number), The expansion over time of BPX-603 CAR T cells in the peripheral blood as determined by qPCR (copies/ug gDNA)., measured over time from baseline through study completion, up to 5 years|Antitumor activity of BPX-603, Overall response rate, through study completion, up to 5 years
* Phase 1: Cell dose escalation to identify the maximum dose of BPX-603 administered without or with rimiducid. The first subject in each dose cohort will receive BPX-603 alone (without rimiducid) in order to assess safety of the CAR-T monotherapy.
* Phase 2: Indication-specific dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (including BPX-603 persistence and response to temsirolimus as applicable), and clinical activity at the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) identified in Phase 1 in various HER2+ solid tumors.
* During Phase 1 or 2, temsirolimus (single IV dose at 25 mg) may be administered following BPX-603 infusion in response to treatment-emergent toxicity in order to activate the iRC9 safety switch.
