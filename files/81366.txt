A Study Evaluating Sotorasib Platinum Doublet Combination Versus Pembrolizumab Platinum Doublet Combination as a Front-Line Therapy in Participants With Stage IV or Advanced Stage IIIB/C Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (CodeBreaK 202)
The primary objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in participants who receive sotorasib with platinum doublet chemotherapy versus participants who receive pembrolizumab with platinum doublet chemotherapy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Sotorasib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the first documentation of radiologic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)., From Baseline up to end of study (EOS) (approximately 5.5 years)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response is defined as the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1, per BICR., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Change in Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Dyspnea Domain Score, From Baseline to Week 12|Change in Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) Symptoms of Dyspnea Subscale, From Baseline to Week 12|Change in QLQ-LC13 Symptoms of Cough Subscale, From Baseline to Week 12|Change in QLQ-LC13 Symptoms of Chest Pain Subscale, From Baseline to Week 12|Change in Physical Function as Measured by QLQ-C30, From Baseline to Week 12|Change in Global Health Status as Measured by QLQ-C30, From Baseline to Week 12|Progression-free Survival 2 (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to progression per investigator after initiation of new anticancer therapy or treatment beyond progression (ie, second progression) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Change in QLQ-LC13 Subscale Scores, From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Change in QLQ-C30 Subscale Scores, From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Time to Deterioration in QLC-LC13 Subscale Scores, From Baseline to Week 12|Time to Deterioration in QLC-C30 Subscale Scores, From Baseline to Week 12|Change in Summary Scores and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Scores, Measured by EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L)., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective response until the first documentation of disease progression per BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Time to Response, Defined as the time from randomization to first evidence of PR or CR per BICR., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Disease Control, Defined as CR plus PR plus stable disease based on RECIST v1.1 per BICR., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|PFS, Based on investigator tumor assessments per RECIST v1.1., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Objective Response, Based on investigator tumor assessments per RECIST v1.1., From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Signs, From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Clinical Laboratory Tests, From Baseline up to EOS (approximately 5.5 years)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Sotorasib, Pre-dose Day 1 up to Day 64|Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of Sotorasib, Pre-dose Day 1 up to Day 64|Area Under The Curve (AUC) of Sotorasib, Pre-dose Day 1 up to Day 64
The primary objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in participants who receive sotorasib with platinum doublet chemotherapy versus participants who receive pembrolizumab with platinum doublet chemotherapy.
