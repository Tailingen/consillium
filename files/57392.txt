NutriCare Plus a Medically Tailored Meal Intervention Among Patients With Lung Cancer
The NutriCare study aims to develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of an innovative intervention strategy (medically tailored meals plus nutrition counseling) to integrate nutrition into the standard of care for oncology to improve outcomes of vulnerable patients with lung cancer. The NutriCare study evaluates the efficacy of the intervention on optimizing nutritional status, reducing treatment-related toxicities, and improving the quality of life of patients with lung cancer who are economically disadvantaged, uninsured, racial and ethnic minorities, elderly, and/or rural residents from four major medical centers in diverse regions of the United States (U.S.). There will be two cohorts for NutriCare with cohort 1 recruiting 150 patients completing an 8-month intervention and cohort 2 recruiting 120 patients completing a 6-month intervention.
