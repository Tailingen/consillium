If disease progression after new anti-myeloma therapy cannot be measured, a PFS event is defined as the date of discontinuation of new anti-myeloma therapy, or death from any cause, whichever is earlier, Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA dictionary)., Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Hematology Parameters, Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of hematology parameters., Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Clinical Chemistry, Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters., Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Urine Dipstick, Urine samples will be collected for the urine dipstick analysis., Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Abnormal Ocular Findings on Ophthalmic Examination, Up to 255 weeks|Plasma Concentrations of Belantamab Mafodotin (Total Antibody), Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of belantamab mafodotin., Up to 255 weeks|Plasma Concentrations of Belantamab Mafodotin (ADC), Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of belantamab mafodotin., Up to 255 weeks|Plasma Concentrations of Monomethyl Auristatin-F With a Cysteine Linker (Cys-mcMMAF), Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of belantamab mafodotin., Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) Against Belantamab Mafodotin, Serum samples will be collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays. All samples will be tested in screening assay, and positive samples will be further characterized for antibody titers., Up to 255 weeks|Titers of ADAs Against Belantamab Mafodotin, Serum samples will be collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays. All samples will be further tested in screening assay, and positive samples will be further characterized for antibody titers., Up to 255 weeks|Number of Participants With Maximum Post-baseline Change From Baseline in Individual Items of Patient-reported Outcome Version of the Common Term Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measure that was developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicities in patients in cancer clinical trials; it characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence or absence of symptomatic toxicities. Responses can range from 0 ("never," "none," "not at all," or "absent") to 4 ("almost constantly," "very severe," or "very much"), with a higher score indicating a higher frequency, severity, or interference of adverse events., Up to 255 weeks|Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item Core Module (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30-items with single and multi-item scales. These included five functional scales (physical functioning \[PF\], role functioning \[RF\], cognitive functioning \[CF\], emotional functioning \[EF\] and social functioning \[SF\]), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting \[N/V\]), a global health status (GHS)/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhoea, insomnia, dyspnoea, appetite loss \[AL\] and financial difficulties \[FD\]). Response options are 1 to 4. Scores are averaged and transformed to 0 to 100, a high score for functional scales/ GHS/QoL represent better functioning ability or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales/ single items represent significant symptomatology. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value., Up to 255 weeks|Change From Baseline in HRQoL as Measured by EORTC IL52, The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 20-item Multiple Myeloma module (QLQMY20) is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. For the EORTC IL52, disease symptoms domain of the QLQ-MY20 will be used for bone aches or pain, back pain, hip pain, arm or shoulder pain, chest pain, and pain increasing with activity. The individual component scores in the disease symptom domain are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 to100. A high score for disease symptoms represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Up to 255 weeks
