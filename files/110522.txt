Fluorouracil Plus UCN-01 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Refractory Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. UCN-01 may increase the effectiveness of a chemotherapy drug by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus UCN-01 in treating patients who have advanced or refractory solid tumors.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: 7-hydroxystaurosporine|DRUG: fluorouracil
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and toxicity profile of fluorouracil with UCN-01 in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.
* Assess the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen and correlate with observed toxicities in these patients.
* Obtain preliminary data on the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of fluorouracil.

Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients receive an initial dose of UCN-01 IV over 72 hours beginning on day 2 during course 1 and then maintenance UCN-01 IV over 36 hours beginning on day 2 during subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-48 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 14 months.
