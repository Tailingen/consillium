Training of Arms to Reduce Pain With Peripheral Venous Catheter
Female patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer often experience pain and discomfort when a peripheral venous catheter is inserted.

This randomized, controlled trial investigates whether there is a difference in the degree of pain during PVC insertion in patients who exercise their arms, and whether exercise improves vein status.

Participation involves:

* Everyone must have had their peripheral venous catheter (PVC) inserted at least five times in the DROP-IN, which is an outpatient clinic staffed by anesthesia nurses who are specialists in applying PVCs.
* Everyone will three times be asked to answer some questions in the DROP-IN, have their grip strength measured in both hands, and have the course of the veins in their arms clarified.
* The training group must do arm training exercises daily for at least eight weeks (training equipment is provided)
* Ten participants will at the end of the project period be invited to participate in a telephone interview about experiences of vein status during a cancer treatment course.
