Genetic Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients With Osteosarcoma
This clinical trial studies genetic biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with osteosarcoma. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer
Osteosarcoma
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Mapping and filtering of paired tags, Mapping of paired tags to reference genomes to identify aberrant pairs, caused by translocations, insertions, deletions and inversions., Up to 2 years
Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective: Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study Population Description: Samples from the COG Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To use PET sequencing to analyze DNA from ten human primary osteosarcoma samples, along with matched normal tissue where available.

OUTLINE:

Tissue samples are analyzed for translocations and deletions and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
