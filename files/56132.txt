RNA Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Infants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in RNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying RNA biomarkers in tissue samples from infants with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: RNA analysis|GENETIC: nucleic acid sequencing|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Sequence of the microRNAs present in 20 infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples|Comparison of microRNAs present in infant AML samples to infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples to identify lineage- and translocation-specific microRNAs
OBJECTIVES:

* Sequence the microRNAs present in 20 infant AML samples as a pilot study.
* Compare microRNAs present in infant AML samples to infant ALL samples that are being concurrently sequenced in a separate study to identify lineage- and translocation-specific microRNAs.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Previously collected cryopreserved cells from diagnosis are sequenced using reverse transcriptase-PCR.
