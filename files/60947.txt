Transcriptomic Study of IBD-associated Colorectal Cancer
Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in historical cohorts. The pathways of oncogenesis of these CRCs, which are very different clinically from de novo CRCs, are currently unknown. The aim of our work is to identify specific molecular signatures of CRC occurring in the setting of IBD.
