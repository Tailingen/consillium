Two histological types account for most malignant esophageal neoplasms: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas typically start in the lower esophagus, and squamous cell carcinoma can develop throughout  the esophagus. The epidemiology of these types varies markedly.
Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from esophageal cancer in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 22,070.
Deaths: 16,250.
The incidence of esophageal cancer has risen in recent decades, coinciding with
a shift in histological type and primary tumor location. Worldwide, squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histology, and was historically more prevalent in the United States. However, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has risen dramatically in the last few decades and  is now more prevalent than squamous cell carcinoma  in the United States and western Europe.[
2
-
4
] The incidence of adenocarcinoma has increased most notably among White men.[
5
] In the United States, the median age of patients who present with esophageal cancer is 68 years.[
6
] Most adenocarcinomas are located in the distal esophagus. 
The cause of the rising incidence and demographic alterations is unknown.
Anatomy
Enlarge
The esophagus and stomach are part of the upper gastrointestinal (digestive) system.
The esophagus serves as a conduit to the gastrointestinal tract for food.  The esophagus extends from the larynx to the stomach and lies in the posterior mediastinum within the thorax near the lung pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, and diaphragm.  As it travels into the abdominal cavity, the esophagus makes an abrupt turn and enters the stomach.  The most muscular segment of the gastrointestinal system, the esophagus is composed of inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers.  The upper and lower esophagus are controlled by the sphincter function of the cricopharyngeus muscle and gastroesophageal sphincter, respectively.  The esophagus has a rich network of lymphatic channels concentrated in the lamina propria and submucosa, which drains longitudinally along the submucosa.
Tumors of the esophagus are conventionally described in terms of distance of the upper border of the tumor to the incisors.  When measured from the incisors via endoscopy, the esophagus extends approximately 30 cm to 40 cm. The esophagus is divided into four  main segments:
Cervical esophagus (~15–20 cm from the incisors).
Upper thoracic esophagus (~20–25 cm from the incisors).
Middle thoracic esophagus (~25–30 cm from the incisors).
Lower thoracic esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (~30–40 cm from the incisors).
Risk Factors
Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus include:
Tobacco use.
Alcohol use.
Risk factors associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma are less clear.[
3
]  Barrett esophagus is an exception, and its presence is associated with an increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.  Chronic reflux is considered the predominant cause of Barrett metaplasia.  The results of a population-based, case-controlled study
from Sweden strongly suggest that symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux is a risk
factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.  The frequency, severity, and duration of
reflux symptoms were positively correlated with increased risk of esophageal
adenocarcinoma.[
7
] For more information, see
Esophageal Cancer Prevention
.
Prognostic Factors
Favorable prognostic factors include:
Early-stage disease.
Complete resection.
Patients with severe dysplasia in distal esophageal Barrett mucosa often have
in situ
or invasive cancer within the dysplastic area.  After
resection, these patients usually have excellent prognoses.[
8
]
In most cases, esophageal cancer is a treatable disease, but it is rarely curable.  The 5-year relative survival rate is 21.6%. 
Patients with early-stage disease have a better chance of survival; 18.2% of patients are diagnosed at the local stage and have a 5-year relative survival rate of 48.1%.[

Cellular Classification of Esophageal Cancer
Adenocarcinomas, typically arising in Barrett esophagus, account for at least
50% of malignant lesions, and the incidence of this histology appears to be
rising.  Barrett esophagus contains glandular epithelium cephalad to the
esophagogastric junction.
Three different types of glandular epithelium can be
seen:
Metaplastic columnar epithelium.
Metaplastic parietal cell glandular
epithelium within the esophageal wall.
Metaplastic intestinal epithelium
with typical goblet cells. Dysplasia is particularly likely to develop in the
intestinal-type mucosa.
Approximately 30% of esophageal cancers in the United States are squamous cell carcinomas.[

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors can occur in the esophagus and are usually
benign.  For more information, see
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment

Staging Evaluation
AJCC Staging System
Staging for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus
Staging for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
One of the major difficulties in allocating and comparing treatment modalities
for patients with esophageal cancer is the lack of precise preoperative
staging.  The stage determines whether the intent of the therapeutic approach will be
curative or palliative.
Staging Evaluation
Standard noninvasive staging modalities include:
Endoscopic ultrasonography.
Computed tomography
(CT) scan of the chest and abdomen.
Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT scan.
The overall
tumor depth staging accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography is 85% to 90%, compared with 50% to 80%
for CT. The accuracy of regional nodal staging is 70% to 80% for endoscopic ultrasonography and 50% to
70% for CT.[
1
,
2
]
One retrospective series reported  93% sensitivity and 100% specificity of regional nodal staging with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA).  Endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA for lymph node
staging is under prospective evaluation.[
3
]
Thoracoscopy and
laparoscopy have been used in esophageal cancer staging at some surgical
centers.[
4
-
6
]   An intergroup trial reported an increase in positive lymph node detection to 56% of 107 evaluable patients with the use of thoracoscopy/laparoscopy, from 41% (with the use of noninvasive staging tests, e.g., CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound), with no major complications or deaths.[
7
]
Noninvasive PET scan using the
radiolabeled glucose analog fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) for preoperative
staging of esophageal cancer is more sensitive than a CT scan or endoscopic ultrasound in detection of distant metastases.  A recent study of 262 patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer demonstrated the utility of 18F-FDG PET in identifying confirmed distant metastatic disease in at least 4.8% of patients after standard evaluation.[
8

12
]
AJCC Staging System
The AJCC has
designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define cancer of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction.[
13
] Tumors located in the gastric cardia within 5 cm of the gastroesophageal junction with extension into the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction are classified as esophageal cancer.  Tumors with the epicenter of the tumor located in the gastric cardia beyond 5 cm of the gastroesophageal junction or without extension into the esophagus are classified as gastric cancer.[
13
] For more information, see the
Stage Information for Gastric Cancer
section in Gastric Cancer Treatment.
The classification of involved abdominal lymph nodes as M1 disease
is controversial.  The presence of positive abdominal lymph nodes does not
appear to have a prognosis as grave as that for metastases to distant organs.[
14
] 
Patients with regional and/or celiac axis lymphadenopathy should not
necessarily be considered to have unresectable disease caused by metastases. 
Complete resection of the primary tumor and appropriate lymphadenectomy is attempted when possible.

For patients with minimally invasive resectable esophageal cancer, surgical resection alone offers the potential for cure.  In contrast, therapeutic management for patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal cancer has evolved significantly over the last few decades.  Because of the risk of distant metastases and local relapse, multimodality therapy with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical resection has become the standard of care.
The following combinations may provide effective palliation in individual cases:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy.
Radiation therapy.
Stents, photodynamic therapy, and endoscopic therapy with Nd:YAG laser. Self-expandable metal stent positioning is the recommended method for palliation of dysphagia from esophageal cancer.[

Surgery
Surgery (Barrett esophagus)
The prevalence of Barrett metaplasia in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
suggests that Barrett esophagus is a premalignant condition.  Endoscopic surveillance of
patients with Barrett metaplasia may detect adenocarcinoma at an earlier
stage that is more amenable to curative resection. Strong
consideration should be given to resection in patients with high-grade
dysplasia in the setting of Barrett metaplasia.[
7
]
Surgery (esophageal cancer)
The survival rate of patients
with esophageal cancer is poor.  Surgical treatment of resectable esophageal cancers results in 5-year survival
rates of 5% to 30%, with higher survival rates in patients with early-stage
cancers.[
8
]  Asymptomatic small tumors confined to the
esophageal mucosa or submucosa are detected only by chance.  Surgery is the
treatment of choice for these small tumors.  Once symptoms are present
(e.g., dysphagia, in most cases), esophageal cancers have usually invaded
the muscularis propria or beyond and may have metastasized to lymph nodes or
other organs.
In some patients
with partial esophageal obstruction, dysphagia may be relieved by
placement of an expandable metallic stent [
9
] or by radiation therapy if the
patient has disseminated disease or is not a candidate for surgery. 
Alternative methods of relieving dysphagia have been reported, including laser
therapy and electrocoagulation to destroy intraluminal tumor.[
10
-
12
]
In the presence of complete esophageal obstruction without clinical evidence
of systemic metastasis, surgical excision of the tumor with mobilization of the
stomach to replace the esophagus has been the traditional means of relieving
the dysphagia.
The optimal surgical approach for radical resection of esophageal cancer is not known.  One approach
advocates transhiatal esophagectomy with anastomosis of the stomach to the
cervical esophagus.  A second approach advocates abdominal mobilization of the
stomach and transthoracic excision of the esophagus with anastomosis of the
stomach to the upper thoracic esophagus or the cervical esophagus.  One study concluded that transhiatal esophagectomy was associated with lower morbidity than was transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy; however, median overall disease-free and quality-adjusted survival did not differ significantly.[
13
] Similarly, no differences in long-term quality of life (QOL) using validated QOL instruments have been reported.[
14
] More recently, minimally invasive approaches that offer potential advantages of smaller incisions, decreased intraoperative blood loss, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stays have emerged.  However, the ability to obtain negative surgical margins, the adequacy of lymph node dissection, and long-term outcomes have not been fully established with this approach.[
15
]
In the United States, the median age of patients who present
with esophageal cancer is 68 years.[
16
]  The results of a retrospective
review of 505 consecutive patients who were operated on by a single surgical
team over 17 years found no difference in the perioperative mortality, median
survival, or palliative benefit of esophagectomy on dysphagia when the patients older than 70 years were compared with their younger peers.[

Preoperative Chemotherapy Plus Anti-Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Therapy and/or Immunotherapy
Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab
Evidence (fluorouracil [5-FU], leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel [FLOT] chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab):
A multicenter phase II/III trial (
NCT02581462
) included patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (clinical T2 or larger or clinically node-positive). A total of 81 patients (61 with gastroesophageal cancer, 20 with gastric cancer) were enrolled during the phase II part of the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive four preoperative and postoperative cycles of either FLOT alone (arm A, n = 41) or FLOT combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab followed by nine cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab (arm B, n = 40). In the phase II part of the study, the primary end point was the rate of pathological complete response. The  trial did not transition to phase III. It closed prematurely, after results of the JACOB trial were reported, which demonstrated that adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival (OS) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with placebo.[
18
]
The 	pathological complete response rate was significantly improved for patients in arm B at 35%, compared with 12% for patients in arm A (
P
= .02).[
18
][
Level of evidence B3
]
The rate of pathological lymph node negativity was higher for patients who received trastuzumab and pertuzumab (39% for arm A vs. 68% for arm B).
The 	R0 resection rate was 90% for patients in arm A and 93% for patients in arm B. Surgical morbidity was also comparable, at 43% for patients in arm A and 44% for patients in arm B.
The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 26 months for patients in arm A and not yet reached for patients in arm B (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58;
P
=.14).
The 24-month DFS rates were 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38%–71%) in arm A and 70% (95% CI, 55%–85%) in arm B. The 24-month OS rates were 77% (95% CI, 63%–90%) in arm A and 84% (95% CI, 72%–96%) in arm B.
More grade 3 or greater adverse events were reported among patients who received trastuzumab and pertuzumab, especially diarrhea (5% of patients in arm A and 41% of patients in arm B) and leukopenia (13% of patients in arm A and 23% of patients in arm B).
Preoperative Chemoradiation Therapy
On the basis of several randomized trial results, chemoradiation followed by surgery is a treatment option for patients with stages IB, II, III, and IVA esophageal cancer.
Phase III trials have compared preoperative concurrent chemoradiation therapy with surgery alone for patients with esophageal cancer.[

Level of evidence A1
] The benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiation has been controversial because of contradictory results of early randomized studies.[
19
-
22
]  However, the Chemoradiotherapy for Oesophageal Cancer Followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) has definitively demonstrated a survival benefit for preoperative chemoradiation compared with surgery alone in locally advanced esophageal cancer.[
23
]
For early-stage tumors, the role of preoperative chemoradiation remains controversial.  Although the CROSS study included early-stage patients, the Francophone de
Cancérologie Digestive (FFCD) 9901 study (
NCT00047112
),[
25
] which included only early-stage (stage I or II) patients, failed to demonstrate a survival advantage in this group of patients.
Evidence (preoperative chemoradiation therapy):
The CROSS study randomly assigned 366 patients with resectable esophageal or junctional cancers to receive either surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (dose titrated to achieve an AUC [area under the curve] of 2 mg/mL/minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m
2
of BSA [body surface area]) and concurrent radiation therapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions) administered over 5 weeks. Most patients enrolled in the CROSS trial (75%) had adenocarcinoma.[

With a median follow-up of 84 months, preoperative chemoradiation was found to improve median OS from 24 months in the surgery-alone group to 48.6 months (HR,  0.68; 95% CI, 0.53–0.88;
P
= .003).  Median OS for patients with squamous cell carcinomas was 81.6 months in the preoperative chemoradiation group, compared with 21.1 months in the surgery-alone group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28–0.83; log-rank
P
= .008); for patients with adenocarcinomas, median OS was 43.2 months in the preoperative chemoradiation group, compared with 27.1 months in the surgery-alone group (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55–0.98; log-rank
P
= .038).[
26
]
Additionally, preoperative chemoradiation improved the rate of R0 resections (92% vs. 69%;
P
< .001). R0 is defined as complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of resection margins.
A complete pathological response was achieved in 29% of patients who underwent resection after chemoradiation therapy. A pathological complete response was observed in 23% of patients with adenocarcinoma, compared with 49% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (
P
= .008).
Postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality were equivalent in both groups. The most common hematologic side effects in the chemoradiation group were leukopenia (6%) and neutropenia (2%).  The most common nonhematologic side effects were anorexia (5%) and fatigue (3%).
With a median follow-up of 84 months, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 44% in the preoperative chemoradiation group, compared with 27% in the surgery-alone group (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47–0.78). Preoperative chemoradiation therapy reduced locoregional recurrence from 34% to 14% (
P
< .001) and peritoneal carcinomatosis from 14% to 4% (
P
< .001). There was a small but significant effect on hematogenous dissemination in favor of the chemoradiation therapy group (35% vs. 29%;
P

The study showed no improvement in OS and a significantly higher
postoperative mortality rate (12% vs. 4%) in the combined-modality arm.
In
patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, a single-institution phase III
trial was conducted in patients treated with induction chemoradiation therapy consisting of 5-FU,
cisplatin, and 40 Gy (in 2.67-Gy fractions) plus surgery compared with resection
alone.[

The results demonstrated a modest survival benefit of 16 months for combined modality therapy versus 11 months for
surgery alone.
A subsequent single-institution trial randomly assigned patients (75% with
adenocarcinoma) to 5-FU, cisplatin, vinblastine, and radiation
therapy (1.5 Gy twice daily to a total of 45 Gy) plus resection versus
esophagectomy alone.[

with respect to median survival (17.6 months vs. 16.9 months), OS rate (16% vs. 30% at 3 years), or DFS rate (16% vs. 28%
at 3 years).
An intergroup trial (
CALGB-9781
[NCT00003118])  planned to randomly assign 475 patients with resectable squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus to treatment with preoperative chemoradiation therapy (5-FU, cisplatin, and 50.4 Gy) followed by esophagectomy and nodal dissection or surgery alone. The trial was closed as a result of poor patient accrual; however, results from the 56 enrolled patients, with a median follow-up of 6 years, were reported.[
22

The median survival was 4.48 years (95% CI; range, 2.4–not estimable) for trimodality therapy versus 1.79 years (95% CI, 1.41–2.59) for surgery alone (
P
= .002), with a 5-year OS rate of 39% for trimodality therapy (95% CI, 21%–57%) versus 16% for surgery alone (95% CI, 5%–33%).
To further evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for early-stage disease, the FFCD 9901 study randomly assigned 195 patients with stage I or stage II esophageal cancer to receive surgery alone or neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions administered with two courses of 5-FU [800 mg/m
2
] and cisplatin [75 mg/m
2
]) followed by surgery.[

At interim analysis, accrual to the study was stopped early because of futility.
With a median follow-up of 94 months, there was no significant improvement in 3-year OS rates with chemoradiation (48% vs. 53%;
P
= .94); there was a significantly higher postoperative mortality rate of 11.1% versus 3.4% (
P

The
NRG Oncology/RTOG-1010
trial (NCT01196390) evaluated the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment (paclitaxel plus carboplatin and radiotherapy, followed by surgery) in patients with untreated HER2-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma. This phase III trial entered 606 patients for HER2 assessment. A total of 203 patients with HER2-positive disease were randomly assigned to receive chemoradiation therapy plus trastuzumab (n = 102) or chemoradiation therapy alone (n = 101). The primary end point was DFS.  The median duration of follow-up was 2.8 years.[
27
]
The median DFS was 19.6 months (95% CI, 13.5–26.2) for patients who received chemoradiation therapy plus trastuzumab and 14.2 months (10.5–23.0) for patients who received chemoradiation therapy alone (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71–1.39; log-rank
P

Level of evidence B1

Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 41 of 95 patients (43%) who received trastuzumab and  52 of 96 patients (54%) of patients who received chemoradiation therapy alone. Grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 20 patients (21%) who received  trastuzumab and 21 patients (22%) who received chemoradiation therapy alone.
There were five treatment-related deaths in the trastuzumab group (bronchopleural fistula, esophageal anastomotic leak, lung infection, sudden death, and death not otherwise specified), and three deaths in the chemoradiation therapy group (two multiorgan failure and one sepsis).
In conclusion, this trial confirmed that trastuzumab does not have a role in the preoperative treatment of HER2-positive esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer, either with chemotherapy alone or with chemoradiation therapy.
Preoperative Chemotherapy
The effects of preoperative chemotherapy are being evaluated in randomized trials.    Several studies have demonstrated a survival benefit with preoperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone.[
28
-
30
]  However, one large randomized study failed to confirm a survival benefit with preoperative chemotherapy.[
31
]  Compared with preoperative chemotherapy alone, preoperative chemoradiation therapy improves pathological response and may improve outcomes.[

Evidence (preoperative chemotherapy):
An intergroup trial (
NCT00525785
) randomly assigned  440 patients with local and operable esophageal cancer of any cell type to three cycles of preoperative 5-FU and cisplatin followed by surgery and two  additional cycles of chemotherapy versus surgery alone.[

After a median follow-up of 55 months, there were no significant differences in median survival between the chemotherapy-plus-surgery group (14.9 months)  and the surgery-alone group (16.1 months). The median 2-year survival rate was 35% in the chemotherapy-plus-surgery group and 37% in the surgery-alone group.
The addition of chemotherapy did not increase the morbidity associated with surgery.
The Medical Research Council Oesophageal Cancer Working Party randomly assigned  802 patients with resectable esophageal cancer, also of any cell type, to two cycles of preoperative 5-FU and cisplatin followed by surgery versus surgery alone.[

At a median follow-up of 37 months, median survival was significantly improved in the preoperative chemotherapy arm (16.8 months vs. 13.3 months with surgery alone; 95% CI), as was the 2-year OS rate (43% in the preoperative chemotherapy arm and 34% in the surgery-alone arm; 95% CI).
The interpretation of the results from the intergroup and preoperative chemotherapy  trials is challenging because  T or N staging was not reported, and prerandomization and radiation could be offered at the discretion of the treating oncologist.
The Japanese Clinical Oncology Group randomly assigned 330 patients with clinical stage II or III, excluding T4, squamous cell carcinomas to receive either two cycles of preoperative cisplatin and 5-FU followed by surgery or surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy of the same regimen.  A planned interim analysis was conducted after patient accrual. Although the primary end point of PFS was not met, there was a significant benefit in OS among patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy (

Additionally, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to postoperative complications or treatment-related toxicities.
The Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte contre le Cancer  and the FFCD randomly assigned  224 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or stomach to receive either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (n = 113) or surgery alone (n = 111).  Chemotherapy consisted of two or three preoperative cycles of intravenous (IV) cisplatin (100 mg/m

The Preoperative Chemotherapy or Radiochemotherapy in Esophago-gastric Adenocarcinoma Trial (POET) sought to evaluate the additional benefit of radiation therapy to preoperative chemotherapy.  Patients were randomly assigned to receive either induction chemotherapy (15 weeks) followed by surgery or chemotherapy (12 weeks) followed by chemoradiation therapy (3 weeks) and surgery.[

Perioperative Chemotherapy
A trial that included patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus randomly assigned 250 patients to receive perioperative chemotherapy and surgery  and 253 patients to receive surgery alone. Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of IV epirubicin (50 mg/m

An open-label, randomized, phase II/III trial compared the efficacy and safety of the docetaxel-based triplet FLOT regimen with the combination of epirubicin and cisplatin plus either 5-FU given as a continuous infusion or capecitabine given orally. The trial included 716 patients with adenocarcinoma in clinical stage cT2 or higher, node-positive stage (cN+), or both, or resectable tumors with no evidence of distant metastases. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either: (1) ECF/ECX (three preoperative and three postoperative 3-week cycles of epirubicin [50 mg/m
2
] and cisplatin [60 mg/m
2
] on day 1 plus either 5-FU [200 mg/m
2
] given as a continuous infusion or capecitabine [1,250 mg/m
2
] orally on days 1 to 21), or (2) FLOT (four preoperative and four postoperative 2-week cycles of docetaxel [50 mg/m
2
], oxaliplatin [85 mg/m
2
], leucovorin [200 mg/m
2
], and 5-FU [2,600 mg/m
2
] as a 24-hour infusion on day 1). The primary end point of the trial was OS (superiority) in the intention-to-treat population.[
34
]
OS was longer in the FLOT group than the ECF/ECX group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.94). The median OS was 50 months in the FLOT group (38.33–not reached) and 35 months in the ECF/ECX group (27.35–46.26).[

The number of patients with related serious adverse events (including those occurring during a hospital stay for surgery) was similar between the two groups: 96 patients (27%) in the ECF/ECX group and 97 patients (27%) in the FLOT group.
The number of deaths due to toxicity (two [<1%]) was similar in both groups. Hospitalization for toxicity occurred in 94 patients (26%) in the ECF/ECX group and 89 patients (25%) in the FLOT group.
The
ESOPEC
trial (NCT02509286) compared (1) perioperative FLOT  (four 2-week cycles of chemotherapy before surgery and four 2-week cycles of chemotherapy after surgery) and surgery with (2) neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy with the CROSS regimen (41.4 Gy of radiation therapy plus carboplatin and docetaxel) followed by surgery. The trial enrolled 438 patients with clinical (c)T1, cN+, cM0 or cT2–4a, any cN, cM0 resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients were assigned to the FLOT group (n = 221) or the CROSS group (n = 217). The primary end point was OS.[

With a median follow-up of 55 months, the 3-year OS rate was 57.4% (95% CI, 50.1%–64.0%) in the FLOT group and 50.7% (95% CI, 43.5%–57.5%) in the CROSS group (HR

The 3-year PFS rate was 51.6% (95% CI, 44.3%–58.4%) in the FLOT group and 35.0% (95% CI, 28.4%–41.7%) in the CROSS group (HR

, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.85).
Neoadjuvant treatment was given to 403 patients: 207 patients in the FLOT group and 196 patients in the CROSS group. In the FLOT group 193 patients (89%) received four full cycles of chemotherapy before surgery, and 118 patients (53%) received four full cycles of chemotherapy after surgery. In the CROSS group, 147 patients (68%) received five full cycles of chemotherapy.
Surgery was performed in 374 patients: 192 patients in the FLOT group and 179 patients in the CROSS group. R0 resection occurred in 182 of 193 patients (94.3%) in the FLOT group and in 172 of 181 patients (95.0%) in the CROSS group.
Pathological complete response after surgery, defined as a pathological stage of ypT0 ypN0 (no residual invasive cancer in the resected primary tumor and lymph nodes), was seen in 32 of 192 patients (16.7%) in the FLOT group and 18 of 179 patients (10.1%) in the CROSS group.
At 90 days after surgery, 3.1% of patients in the FLOT group and 5.6% of patients in the CROSS group had died.
The study noted grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of patients. In the FLOT group, those adverse effects included neutropenia (19.8%), diarrhea (6.8%), leukopenia (6.3%), and pneumonia (5.8%). In the CROSS group, those adverse effects included  leukopenia (9.7%) and pneumonia (9.2%).
In the ESOPEC trial, patients randomly assigned to the CROSS arm did not receive 1 year of adjuvant nivolumab. In the CheckMate 577 trial, 1 year of adjuvant nivolumab improved DFS when compared with placebo in patients who had resected specimens that did not show pathological complete responses. However,  OS data from CheckMate 577 have not been published.
Definitive Chemoradiation Therapy
For patients who are deemed either medically inoperable or have tumors that are unresectable, the efficacy of definitive chemoradiation has been established in numerous randomized controlled trials.[

Evidence (definitive chemoradiation):
A Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial (RTOG-8501)   randomly assigned patients to receive radiation therapy alone (64 Gy in 32 fractions) or chemoradiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions) with concurrent cisplatin (75 mg/m

chemoradiation therapy.
Intergroup-0123 (
RTOG-9405
[NCT00002631]) was conducted in an attempt to improve upon the results
of RTOG-8501. Intergroup-0123 randomly assigned  236 patients with
localized esophageal tumors to undergo chemoradiation with high-dose radiation therapy
(64.8 Gy) and four monthly cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin versus conventional-dose radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) and the same chemotherapy schedule.[

Although originally designed to accrue 298 patients, this trial  was closed in 1999 after a planned interim analysis showed that it was statistically unlikely that there would be any advantage to using high-dose radiation.
At a 2-year median follow-up, no statistically significant differences in median survival were observed between the high-dose and
conventional-dose radiation therapy arms (13 months vs.
18 months), 2-year survival rates (31% vs. 40%), or local and regional failure rates (56%
vs. 52%).
There was a higher treatment mortality rate in the higher-dose arm (9% vs. 2%). However, 7 of 11 deaths in the high-dose arm occurred in patients who had received 50.4 Gy or less.

There were no significant differences in grade 3 or 4 adverse events between treatment groups.  Among toxicities of all grades, paresthesia, sensory neuropathy, and increases in aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were more common in the FOLFOX group; increases in serum creatinine, mucositis, and alopecia were more common in the 5-FU and cisplatin group.
A phase III German trial also compared induction chemotherapy (three courses of bolus 5-FU, leucovorin, etoposide, and cisplatin) followed by chemoradiation therapy (cisplatin, etoposide, and 40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation therapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm B) for patients with T3 or T4 squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

Adjuvant Therapy
Evidence (adjuvant therapy):
A global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluated a checkpoint inhibitor as adjuvant therapy in 794 patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.  Adults with a performance status of 0 or 1 and R0 stage II or III disease who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and had residual pathological disease were included.  Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks) followed by nivolumab (480 mg every 4 weeks) (532 patients) or matching placebo (262 patients). Patients were enrolled regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. The maximum duration of the trial intervention period was 1 year. The primary end point was DFS. The median follow-up was 24.4 months.[

The median DFS was 22.4 months (95% CI, 16.6–34.0) among patients who received nivolumab,  compared with 11.0 months (95% CI, 8.3–14.3) among patients who received placebo. The HR
disease recurrence or death
was 0.69 (96.4% CI, 0.56–0.86;
P
< .001).
Median DFS was evaluated across a prespecified subgroup according to histological type. Among patients with adenocarcinoma, the median DFS was 19.4 months in the 376 patients who received nivolumab (95% CI, 15.9–29.4), compared with 11.1 months in  the 187 patients who received the placebo (95% CI, 8.3–16.8); the HR
disease recurrence or death
was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.59–0.96). Among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the median DFS was 29.7 months (95% CI, 14.4 to not estimable) in the 155 patients who received nivolumab, compared with 11 months (95% CI, 7.6–17.8) in the 75 patients who received the placebo; the HR
disease recurrence or death
was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.42–0.88).
HRs for disease recurrence or death were remarkably close between the 570 patients whose tumors expressed less than 1% of PD-L1 (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.92) and the 129 patients whose tumors expressed 1% or more of PD-L1 (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45–1.24).
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of any cause occurred in 183 of 532 patients (34%) in the nivolumab group and 84 of 260 patients (32%) in the placebo group, and serious adverse events of any grade occurred in 30% of the patients in each group (nivolumab: 158 of 532; placebo: 78 of 260). Adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to the trial regimen were more common with nivolumab than with placebo, including grade 3 or 4 events (nivolumab: 71 of 532 patients [13%]; placebo: 15 of 260 patients [6%]) and events leading to discontinuation of therapy (nivolumab: 48 of 532 patients [9%]; placebo: 8 of 260 patients [3%]).
OS data have not been reported for this study.
Given the positive results for the use of nivolumab after chemoradiation therapy and surgery in patients with esophageal cancer, an ongoing study will determine whether the adjuvant use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy improves outcomes in patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy without surgery (
KEYNOTE-975

Evidence (immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy for patients with squamous cell carcinoma):
In the
CheckMate 648
trial (NCT03143153), 970 adults with previously untreated, unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled, regardless of tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus chemotherapy with 5-FU and cisplatin (every 4 weeks), nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks), or chemotherapy alone. Primary end points for all groups were OS and PFS per blinded independent central review  in patients with tumor cell PD-L1 expression of 1% or more (observed in 49% of patients). Further analyses included all patients regardless of PD-L1 status.[
43

In patients with PD-L1-positive disease, the median  OS was 15.4 months for patients who received  nivolumab plus chemotherapy (95% CI, 11.9–19.5; n = 158), 13.7 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab  (95% CI, 11.2–17.0; n = 158), and 9.1 months for patients who received chemotherapy alone (95% CI, 7.7–10.0; n = 157). The corresponding HR (vs. chemotherapy) was  0.54 (99.5% CI, 0.37–0.8;

However, among patients whose tumors expressed less than 1% of PD-L1, OS was not significantly changed by the addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy (n = 329; median OS, 12.2 months with chemotherapy and 12 months with nivolumab plus chemotherapy) or by the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab (n = 330; median OS, 12.2 months with chemotherapy and 12 months with nivolumab plus ipilimumab).
Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 147 patients (47%) who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy, 102 patients (32%)  who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and 108 patients (36%) who received chemotherapy alone.  No new safety signals were observed.
The results of
ESCORT-1st
(NCT03691090), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial conducted in China, corroborated the positive impact of checkpoint inhibitors combined with first-line chemotherapy on patient survival. In this trial, 596 patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either the humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody camrelizumab (200 mg; n = 298) or placebo (n = 298). Patients in both groups also received up to 6 cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m
2
) and cisplatin (75 mg/m
2
). All drugs were given IV every 3 weeks. Co-primary end points were OS and independent review committee (IRC)-assessed PFS.[

With a median follow-up of 10.8 months, patients who received camrelizumab plus chemotherapy had significantly improved OS compared with patients who received placebo plus chemotherapy (median OS, 15.3 months [95% CI, 12.8–17.3] vs. 12.0 months [11.0–13.3]; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56–0.88; one-sided
P

Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 189 patients (63.4%) in the camrelizumab group and 201 patients (67.7%) in the placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 9 patients (3.0%) in the camrelizumab group and 11 patients (3.7%) in the placebo group.
Camrelizumab is only approved for use in China.
In
KEYNOTE-590

The 24-month OS rate in each of the above subgroups was double in the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy group compared with the placebo and chemotherapy group (approximately 30% vs. 15%).
Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 266 patients (72%) in the pembrolizumab group and 250 patients (68%) in the placebo group.
Notably, in an exploratory analysis in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of less than 10, median OS was 10.5 months in the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy group versus 10.6 months in the placebo and chemotherapy group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.68–1.10).
Immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy for patients with adenocarcinoma
In 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved nivolumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma after the publication of the results of the CheckMate-649 trial.[

Evidence (immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy for patients with adenocarcinoma):
In a randomized, open-label, international, phase III  study (
CheckMate-649
[NCT02872116]), 1,581 patients (including 955 with a PD-L1 CPS ≥5) with HER2-negative gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinomas were randomly assigned (1:1:1) (1:1 after enrollment in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group was closed). A total of 789 patients (473 with a PD-L1 CPS ≥5) were assigned to receive nivolumab and chemotherapy (nivolumab 360 mg with capecitabine and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks, or nivolumab 240 mg with FOLFOX every 2 weeks). A total of 792 patients (482 with a PD-L1 CPS ≥5) were assigned to receive chemotherapy alone (capecitabine and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks or FOLFOX every 2 weeks). Disease site of origin was as follows: 1,100 patients (70%) had gastric adenocarcinoma, 260 patients (17%) had gastroesophageal junction carcinoma,  and 211 patients (13%) had esophageal adenocarcinoma.[

The median follow-up for OS was 13.1 months (interquartile range [IQR], 6.7–19.1) for the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 11.1 months (IQR, 5.8–16.1) for the chemotherapy-alone group. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in improvements in OS (14.4 vs. 11.1 months; HR, 0.71; 98.4% CI, 0.59–0.86;
P
< .0001) and PFS (HR, 0.68; 98% CI, 0.56–0.81;
P

Grades 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 462 patients (59%) in the nivolumab group and in 341 patients (44%) in the chemotherapy-alone group.
The 3-year efficacy and safety results (minimum follow-up, 36.2 months for patients with a PD-L1 CPS ≥5) reported that the median OS and PFS were substantially unchanged. The OS rate was 21% in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 10% in the chemotherapy-alone group. The PFS rate was 13% in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 8% in the chemotherapy-alone group.[

In
KEYNOTE-590

The study enrolled patients with previously untreated (except for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy completed ≥180 days before recurrence), HER2-negative, unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer,  regardless of PD-L1 expression. Only 9% of enrolled patients had gastroesophageal junction cancer. Patients  were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² IV on day 1 plus either oral S-1 40 mg/m² or oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m², twice daily on days 1–14), in addition to either 360 mg nivolumab IV or placebo. The trial was conducted in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and assigned 724 patients to treatment: 362 patients to the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 362 to the placebo-plus-chemotherapy group. The primary end points were centrally assessed PFS and OS in the intention-to-treat population.[

At the time of data cutoff, with a median follow-up of 26.6 months, the median OS at the final analysis was 17.45 months (95% CI, 15.67–20.83) in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 17.15 months (15.18–19.65) in the placebo-plus-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75–1.08;

The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (observed in 20% of  patients in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group vs. 16% of  patients in the placebo-plus-chemotherapy group) and decreased platelet count (observed in 9% of patients in both groups).
Six treatment-related deaths occurred: three in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group (one each of febrile neutropenia, hepatic failure, and sudden death) and three in the placebo-plus-chemotherapy group (one each of sepsis, hemolytic anemia, and interstitial lung disease).
Tumor PD-L1 expression was at least 1% in 16% of patients randomized to the nivolumab arm and 15% of patients randomized to the placebo arm.
When the 3-year follow-up data were reported, the median PFS and OS remained substantially unchanged. The PFS rate was 27.4% in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 12.3% in the placebo-plus-chemotherapy group. The OS rate was 23.9% in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy group and 19.4% in the placebo-plus-chemotherapy group. No new safety signals or major late-onset treatment-related adverse events were observed in patients who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy.[

The multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III
KEYNOTE-585
trial  (NCT03221426) evaluated the role of combination neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition in patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment in the following order:
Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) or placebo plus cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy (main cohort, N = 804) every 3 weeks for three cycles.
Surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo, and chemotherapy for three cycles.
Adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles.
A small cohort (n = 203) was instead randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment in the following order:
Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo plus FLOT-based chemotherapy (FLOT cohort) every 2 weeks for four cycles.
Surgery, adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo, plus FLOT for four cycles.
Adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 11 cycles.
The primary end points were centrally reviewed pathological complete response, investigator-reviewed event-free survival (EFS), OS in the intention-to-treat population, and safety in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.[
50
]
In the main cohort of 804 patients, after a median follow-up of 47.7 months,  52 of 402 patients (12.9%; 95% CI, 9.8%–16.6%) who received pembrolizumab had pathological complete responses. In contrast, only 8 of 402 patients (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.9%–3.9%) who received placebo had pathological complete responses (difference 10.9%; 95% CI, 7.5–14.8;
P
< .00001).[

The median EFS was longer when patients received pembrolizumab (44.4 months, 95% CI, 33.0–not reached) when compared with placebo (25.3 months, 95% CI, 20.6–33.9) (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67–0.99;
P
= .0198). These values did not meet the threshold for statistical significance (
P
= .0178).
The median OS was 60.7 months (95% CI, 51.5–not reached) in the pembrolizumab group and 58.0 months (41.5–not reached) in the placebo group (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73–1.12;
P
= .174).
Grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 312 of 399 patients (78%) in the pembrolizumab group and 297 of 400 patients (74%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in patients who received pembrolizumab versus placebo were nausea (60% vs. 62%), anemia (42% vs. 40%), and decreased appetite (41% vs. 43%).
In this trial, meeting the primary end point of pathological complete response did not translate to improvement in  relevant primary clinical objectives like OS and EFS. Furthermore, no differential activity was demonstrated in the experimental group based on PD-L1 expression, according to CPS (cutoff, 1%). This was the first published trial evaluating the role of checkpoint inhibitors when given perioperatively to patients with operable gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Therefore, pending EFS and OS results from studies that used  durvalumab or toripalimab are imperative for understanding.
Immunotherapy  for patients who relapse after one prior line of standard therapy
Pembrolizumab or nivolumab can be given to patients with esophageal cancer who were previously treated with a chemotherapy regimen that did not include an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Pembrolizumab is appropriate for patients with squamous or adenocarcinoma histology and a CPS of 10 or more. Nivolumab can be given to patients with squamous or adenosquamous histology, regardless of PD-L1 expression.
Evidence (immunotherapy  for patients who relapse after one prior line of standard therapy):
The open-label phase II
KEYNOTE-181
study (NCT02564263) included 628 patients with advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (n = 401) or adenocarcinoma (n = 227) of the esophagus that progressed after one prior therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years) or chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan). Primary end points were OS in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, OS in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and OS in all patients (one-sided alpha, 0.9%, 0.8%, and 0.8%, respectively).[
51
]
At final analysis, conducted 16 months after the last patient was randomly assigned, OS was prolonged in patients with a CPS of 10 or more who received pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy (median OS, 9.3 vs. 6.7 months; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.93;
P
= .0074).[

Among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the median OS was 8.2 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and  7.1 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.96;
P
= .0095). Among all patients, the median OS was 7.1 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and  7.1 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75–1.05;
P
= .0560).
Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18.2% of patients who received pembrolizumab and 40.9% of patients who received chemotherapy.
Patients in this study had not received prior immunotherapy.
The
ATTRACTION-3
study (NCT02569242), a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, included 419 patients with squamous or adenosquamous esophageal cancer refractory or intolerant to one previous  fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) (n = 210) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel every 3 weeks) (n = 209). The primary end point was OS.[
52
]
At a follow-up time of 17.6 months, OS was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median OS, 10.9 months [95% CI, 9.2–13.3] vs. 8.4 months [95% CI, 7.2–9.9]) (HR

Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 38  of 209 patients (18%) in the nivolumab group and 131 of 208 patients (63%) in the chemotherapy group.
The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anemia (4 patients [2%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 patients [28%]) in the chemotherapy group. Five deaths were treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one of interstitial lung disease and one of pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one of pneumonia, one of spinal cord abscess, and one of interstitial lung disease).
Postoperative Radiation Therapy
Two randomized trials have shown no significant OS benefit
for postoperative radiation therapy compared with surgery alone.[

Capecitabine and Fluorouracil Dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
55
,
56
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
55
-
57
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[

]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
61
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

(for patients with stage IVA disease).
Chemotherapy, which has provided partial responses for patients with metastatic
distal esophageal adenocarcinomas.[

Clinical trials evaluating single-agent or combination chemotherapy.
The treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced, inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal cancer has improved with the introduction of chemoimmunotherapy as front-line therapy and immunotherapy for patients who relapse following one prior line of chemotherapy. First-line chemoimmunotherapy can now be considered the standard of care for patients with advanced esophageal cancer of squamous or adenocarcinoma histology and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (although the optimal cutoff still needs to be defined). For more information, see the
Immunotherapy and Chemoimmunotherapy
section.

The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above.
Treatment Option Overview for Esophageal Cancer
Revised
text
about the results of a trial that  compared (1) perioperative FLOT (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) and surgery with (2) neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy with the CROSS regimen (41.4 Gy of radiation therapy plus carboplatin and docetaxel) followed by surgery. The trial enrolled 438 patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma (cited Hoeppner et al. as reference 35).
Revised
text
about the results of a randomized, open-label, international, phase III  study that included 1,581 patients with HER2-negative gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinomas. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone (cited Janjigian et al. as reference 47).
Revised
text
about the results of a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial that enrolled patients with previously untreated, HER2-negative, unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks and  either 360 mg nivolumab or placebo (cited Boku et al. as reference 49).
Added
text
about the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-585 trial which evaluated the role of combination neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition in patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (cited Shitara et al. as reference 50 and level of evidence B3).
