The Role of CircDENND4C in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
circular RNAs (circRNAs), a newly discovered type of endogenous noncoding RNAs \[8\], are involved in the regulation of various biological functions. They act by sponging off certain microRNAs (miRNAs) and play a role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancers \[9-11\]. In addition, circRNAs are not com- monly degraded by RNA enzymes present in body flu- ids \[8\], and most of them possess expression specificity at the tissue, cell, and developmental stage level \[12,13\]. Thus, they can be ideal clinica
Ovarian Cancer
role of circDENND4c in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, by quality real time PCR we use the circDENND4c as a tumour marker for ovarian cancer, baseline
epithelial OC (EOC), the most common form of OC, accounts for 90% of all OC cases \[2\]. EOC has the highest mortality among all gynecologic tumors and poses a serious threat to women's life \[3\].herefore, early clinical diagnosis is crucial. Commonly used laboratory indicators for OC diagnosis
