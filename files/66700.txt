A Study of LP002 for the Treatment of Patients With Malignant Digestive System Neoplasms
LP002 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors. In this study, the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of LP002 for the treatment of malignant digestive system neoplasms will be evaluated.

Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, up to approximately 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Arm I-A, I-B, I-C, I-E, Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR).

R0 resection rate RFS pCR, up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) for Arm I-A, I-B, I-C, I-E, Disease Control Rate (DCR) refers to the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR and SD through imaging evaluation., up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR) for Arm I-A, I-B, I-C, I-E, Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first evidence of response (PR or CR) to the first evidence of PD or the date of death for any reason., up to approximately 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for Arm I-A, I-B, I-C, I-E, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first study drug treatment to disease progression (PD) or to death of the subject due to any reason., up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival (OS) for Arm I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D, I-E, Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the first study drug treatment to death due to any cause., up to approximately 24 months|R0 resection rate for Arm I-D, R0 resection rate refers to the rate of patients who have achieved curative resection of the tumor.(Curative resection refers to the absence of tumor after surgical treatment. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed.), up to approximately 12 months|pathological complete response rate (pCR rate), pathological complete response rate (pCR rate) refers to the rate of patients whose tissue samples show no cancer cells left under a microscope after the anti-cancer treatment., up to approximately 12 months|Terminal half life of LP002, up to approximately 12 months|Area under curve of LP002, up to approximately 12 months|Apparent volume of distribution of LP002, up to approximately 12 months|Systemic clearance of LP002, up to approximately 12 months|Cmax of LP002, up to approximately 12 months|Tmax of LP002, up to approximately 12 months|Serum concentration of the antibody against LP002 within 1 hour prior to each administration, up to approximately 24 months
