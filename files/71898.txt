Safety Study of Peptide Cancer Vaccine To Treat HLA-A*24-positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical efficacies of HLA-A\*2402 restricted epitope peptides URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced non-small cell lung cancers.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HLA-A*2402restricted URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A peptides
Evaluation of safety (NCI CTCAE version3): the number of adverse events of vaccination therapy., 2 months|Evaluation of tolerability (maximum tolerated dose, MTD and dose limiting toxicity, DLT) for the determination of the recommended dose for next phase trial., 2 months
Immunological responses including peptides specific CTL, antigen cascade, regulatory T cells, cancer antigens and HLA levels, 2 months (every time point(s) at which each course is completed)|Evaluation of clinical efficacy: Objective response rate (RECIST1.1), Tumor markers, Overall survival, Progression free survival., 2 months (every time point(s) at which each course is completed)
The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A\*2402-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer. In this phase I trial, the investigators examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A\*2402-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.
