[68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Impact of Multiparametric Dynamic Whole-body Imaging and Kinetic Modeling.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of multiparametric dynamic whole-body \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging in newly diagnosed HCC patients or in HCC patients with recent suspicion of refractory, residual, or recurrent disease.
HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11
Diagnostic performance, Sensitivity of qualitative assessment of dynamic whole-body \[68Ga\]Ga- PSMA PET/CT using standard imaging methods, pathological data if available data or imaging follow-up of at least 6 months as gold standard in two populations of HCC patients: at the time of initial diagnosis or upon detection of suspected refractory, residual, or recurrent relapse., 6 months
Kinetic parameters, Patlak's parametric reconstruction, which estimates the 68 Gallium blood input function from the image, will be employed to extract the Ki absorption coefficient., Baseline|Diagnostic performance of multiparametric image evaluation approach at the lesion level, Sensitivity value of D-WB \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA PET/CT and gold standard will be calculated and compared at the lesion level., 6 months|Diagnostic performance of multiparametric image evaluation approach at the patient level, Sensitivity value of static \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Choline-PET will be calculated and compared., 6 months|Diagnostic performance of multiparametric image evaluation approach at the patient level, Sensitivity value of dynamic \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Choline-PET will be calculated and compared., 6 months|Acceptability in terms of comfort, Acceptability will be measured by a comfort scale from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)., Baseline|Dynamic compared to static imaging, Target-to-background ratios (TBR) values were compared with Tumor normalized uptake values (SUV images) to evaluate lesions detection., Baseline
