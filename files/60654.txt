FET-PET/MRI Based Treatment Planning for Glioblastoma Multiforme in Post-Surgical Patients (FET-TREAT)
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represent the most common primary brain malignancy and prognosis remains poor. The most common subtype is glioblastoma which has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 5%. Despite advances in MRI techniques, accurately determining total extent of tumor remains a challenge. The result is incomplete treatment resulting in reduced survival or overtreatment resulting in avoidable treatment related morbidity. A more accurate means of assessing tumor extent is needed to guide management to improve patient survival and quality of life.
