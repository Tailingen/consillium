FOCUS ON US: Adapting the FOCUS Program for Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Cancer Patients and Caregivers
Our aim for this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability and explore potential outcomes of the adapted FOCUS On Us intervention in a two-arm pilot trial. The investigators will randomize 80 sexual and/or gender minority (SGM; e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, etc.) cancer patients and their ≥80 informal caregivers (total N≥160) to either FOCUS On Us (adapted from the evidence-based FOCUS program) or a waitlist control.

BEHAVIORAL: FOCUS ON US
Feasibility of Intervention, To assess retention feasibility, we will consider the intervention feasible if ≥75% of participants attend the majority of FOCUS On Us sessions (3 out of 5, 2 of which are longer content sessions), and ≥75% complete post-intervention and 3-month follow-up assessments. The feasibility estimates will be reported as a percentage +/- a 95% confidence interval., 3 months after randomization|Acceptability, We will consider the intervention acceptable if 80% of participants are highly satisfied with FOCUS On Us on our satisfaction questionnaire (average rating ≥4 out of a maximum of 5)., 3 months after randomization
