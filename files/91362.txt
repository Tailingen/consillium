Reducing Sedentary Behaviors Among Colorectal Cancer Survivors
Interview colorectal cancer survivors and use this input to create a brochure intended to guide reduction of sedentary behaviors in this population. Have colorectal cancer survivors review and comment on a draft of the brochure. A third group of colorectal cancer survivors will wear an Actigraph activity monitor for one week, then receive feedback on their activity level with the brochure. After one month this group will be surveyed by telephone regarding their use of the brochure, and their physical activity level.

Feasibility of the print brochure, as measured by Likert scale., Feasibility will be based in part on achieving higher (\>5) on the Likert scale on topics such as usefulness, clarity, understanding how to use the materials., Baseline|Change in number of minutes per day of light to strenuous physical activity., The means and variances of self-reported total minutes per day of light to strenuous physical activity will be computed and compared from the survey at baseline, to the survey at the 1 month time point., Baseline and 1 month|Change in number of minutes per day of bouts of sedentary behaviors., The means and variances of self-reported total minutes per day of sedentary behaviors, will be computed and compared from the survey at baseline, to the survey at the 1 month time point. Time per day will also be analyzed by type of activity., Baseline and 1 month
Covariation between baseline use of an ActiGraph, and self-reporting of sedentary behaviors, To assess the baseline reliability of self-report, we will calculate the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the self-report measure (total time and by each activity reported) and ActiGraph based on daily repeated measures for one week., Baseline and 1 week
