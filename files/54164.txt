A Study of Intravesical BCG in Combination With ALT-803 in Patients With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is a Phase Ib/IIb, randomized, two-cohort, open-label, multicenter study of intravesical N-803 plus BCG versus BCG alone, in BCG naïve patients with high-grade NMIBC.

The time from randomization until recurrence of high-grade Ta (excluding low grade Ta) or any grade T1, CIS, disease progression, cystectomy, change in therapy indicative of more advance disease or death (any cause), whichever occurs first., 36 Months|Cohort B: Disease Free Survival, DFS was assessed in the following groups:

1) All recurrent bladder cancer, including low grade Ta disease the time from randomization until recurrence of any grade Ta (including low grade Ta) or any grade T1, CIS, disease progression, cystectomy, change in therapy indicative of more advanced disease, or death (any cause), whichever occurs first 2) Patients who have high-grade Ta, low-grade T1, or CIS at 3-months and received re-induction, and have no evidence of \> low-grade Ta disease at 6-months will be considered disease-free from randomization until a second recurrence \> low-grade Ta 3) Patients who have high-grade Ta, low-grade T1, or CIS at 3-months and received re-induction, and have no evidence of any disease (including low grade Ta) at 6-months will be considered disease-free from randomization until a second recurrence ≥ low grade Ta., 13 Years and 3 Months|Vital signs and clinical laboratory assessment, Vital signs include heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiration rate, and body temperature. Labs include the following: complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic panel, and urinalysis., 36 Months|Long Term Follow Up(LTFU) data from subjects who were treated, Yearly collection of LTFU data, which includes the following: survival status, bladder cancer status (high or low grade), cystoscopy results including number of cystoscopies done for each subject, biopsy results, upper tract evaluations, posttherapies and responses and outcomes of posttherapies, urine cytology results, and other medical history or treatments, if available, related to bladder cancer., 10 Years after treatment period visits
Exploratory Endpoints- Immunogenicity: Serum level of anti-N-803 in patient samples, For phase Ib and IIb Measures the serum level of anti-N-803 in patient samples., 36 Months|Quality of Life Endpoint, Quality of Life (QoL) as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires for patients with cancer (QLQ-C30) and for patients with NMIBC (QLQ-NMIBC24)., 39 Months|Exploratory Endpoints- Whole Slide Images (Baseline and any on-study biopsy), For Phase IIb, 39 Months
The study includes a dose escalation phase (phase Ib) and an expansion phase (phase IIb).

In the phase Ib, patients will be treated with intravesical N-803 in combination with BCG. The purpose of the phase Ib portion of the study is to evaluate the safety, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of N-803 and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) level of N-803 in combination with BCG for the phase IIb expansion.

In the phase IIb expansion, patients will be randomized to receive either intravesical N-803 in combination with BCG or BCG alone. Patients will be enrolled into one of two study cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B). These will be two independent study cohorts, evaluated separately for treatment efficacy.
