Study of Tazemetostat in Lymphoid Malignancies
Tazemetostat is an oral EZH2 inhibitor which has been FDA approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapies, and for adult patients with R/R FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment option. We propose a study to evaluate the safety of tazemetostat in relapsed / refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
