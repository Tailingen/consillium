Proton Boost for Locally Advanced HEAD AND NECK TUMORS
The aim of this research project is to test the local response and the acute toxicity (which can be observed within 90 days).
Epithelial Tumor, Malignant|Neuroendocrine Tumors
RADIATION: external beam proton radiation therapy.
Local response, RECIST criteria, 90 days|Acute toxicity, According to CTCAE v4.0, 90 days
Local control, RECIST criteria on MRI evaluation, 5 years|Disease free survival, RECIST criteria on MRI evaluation - months from RT treatment to documented local relapse, 5 years|Overall survival, On MRI and total body CT evaluation - months from RT treatment to death, 5 years|Late toxicity, According to CTCAE v4.0 registered during follow up visits, 5 years
Local response and acute toxicity are primary endpoints of the trial. At CNAO a proton boost is delivered on the PTV1rx (area at high risk of relapse) up to at least 70 Gy \[RBE\] in 2-3 Gy \[RBE\] per fractions for 8-15 total fractions.

PTV2 rx (area at low or intermediate risk of relapse) will be irradiated with photon IMRT up to a total dose of 50-60 Gy \[RBE\].

Secondary endpoints of the trial are local control, relapse free survival, overall survival, tumor specific survival, intermediate and long term toxicity.
