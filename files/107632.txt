Study to Evaluate the Effects of Sorafenib if Combined With Chemotherapy (FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) in the Second-Line Treatment of Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy has a positive effect on time to progression of the tumor or death for the treatment of large bowel cancer that has already progressed during a first chemotherapy.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
To compare the PFS between patients receiving chemotherapy (FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) + sorafenib with chemotherapy + placebo, 6 to 12 months
Disease control rate, 6 to 12 months|Overall survival, 6 to 12 months|Response rates, 6 to 12 months|Safety, signature of informed consent until 30 days after end of treatment
Patients with metastatic CRC who received a first-line therapy with an Oxaliplatin- or Irinotecan based Fluoropyrimidine containing regimen Â± bevacizumab and had a progression subsequently, are eligible for this study. Patients will be randomized to receive chemotherapy (FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) + sorafenib 400 mg bid or chemotherapy + placebo. Patients who have received an Oxaliplatin based Fluoropyrimidine containing regimen in first-line will obtain FOLFIRI during this study. Patients who have received an Irinotecan based Fluoropyrimidine containing regimen in first-line will obtain FOLFOX6.

Primary objective of the study is to compare the Progression-free-survival (PFS) between patients receiving chemotherapy (FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) + sorafenib with chemotherapy + placebo.
