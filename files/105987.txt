Longitudinal Clinical Evaluation of the HPV Assay on the BD VIPER LT System With Cervical Specimens
The purpose of the study is to assess the cumulative disease detection of greater than or equal to Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2) and greater than or equal to Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) in the subjects over 3 years using the subject's HPV status and cytology status from the BDS-USHPV baseline results

DEVICE: BD HPV Assay on Viper LT|PROCEDURE: Colposcopy
Cumulative risk of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2 and 3 (CIN2 and CIN3) over three years in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Positive Patients., Cumulative risk is a measure of the total risk that a certain event will happen during a given period of time. In this longitudinal study, it refers to the risk of developing \>=CIN2 or \>=CIN3 in subjects over a three year period using the subjects' HPV status at baseline versus cytology status at baseline., 3 years|Absolute Risk of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2 and 3 (CIN2 and CIN3) over 3 years in Human Papillovirus (HPV) Positive Patients., Absolute risk will be calculated as: (number of disease cases)/(number of patients at risk)., 3 years|To evaluate different screening strategies using Human Papillovirus (HPV) results with 16/18/45 genotyping and cytology., The sensitivity and specificity of HPV primary screening algorithms for identifying ≥ CIN2 and ≥ CIN3 using genotyping and cytology will be calculated., 3 years
Cumulative Risk of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2 and 3 (CIN2 and CIN3) over 3 years in NILM (Negative for Intraepithelial lesion or malignancy) cytology and Human Papillovirus (HPV) Negative Patients., Cumulative risk is a measure of the total risk that a certain event will happen during a given period of time. In this longitudinal study, it refers to the risk of developing \>=CIN2 or \>=CIN3 over a three year period for the population of women negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy (NILM) cytology and with Human Papillovirus (HPV) negative results., 3 years|Absolute Risk of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2 and 3 (CIN2 and CIN3) over 3 years in NILM (Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy) cytology and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Negative Patients., Absolute risk will be calculated as: (number of disease cases)/(number of patients at risk)., 3 years|Evaluate Different Screening Strategies Using HPV Results with Genotyping (other than 16/18/45) and Cytology., The sensitivity and specificity of HPV primary screening algorithms for identifying ≥ CIN2 and ≥ CIN3 using genotyping and cytology will be calculated., 3 years
