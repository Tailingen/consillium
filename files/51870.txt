A Study of SY-3505 in Patients With Advanced LTK Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase Ib study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SY-3505 capsule in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, LTK fusion-positive solid tumor who have progressed on or are intolerant to prior standard therapy.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

Dose-escalation phase: Participants will be allocated to one of the three dose groups of 500mg, 600mg, or 800mg and receive a single dose of SY-3505 capsules, followed by a 7-day safety observation period and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. Subsequently, SY-3505 will be administered once daily in 28-day treatment cycles. This phase is designed to determine the DLTs (Dose-limiting toxicity) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of SY-3505 in patients with LTK fusion-positive solid tumors.

Dose-expansion phase: Participants will be assigned to one of the 1-2 dose groups determined during the dose-escalation phase, and receive SY-3505 capsules once daily in 28-day treatment cycles. This phase is designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity (ORR, DCR and DOR) of SY-3505 in patients with LTK fusion-positive solid tumors.
