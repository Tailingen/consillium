Low-Dose Radiation + SBRT + Tislelizumab Plus Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Stage ⅡA-ⅢB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase II study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose radiation + SBRT + Tislelizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy for stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Low-Dose Radiation(LDRT) + Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
pCR rate, pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of the resected lung specimen and lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy, From date of enrollment until one month after resection
MPR rate, mPR is defined as ≤10% viable tumor cells in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes., From date of enrollment until one month after resection|R0-resection rate, From date of enrollment until one month after resection|Event-free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from enrollment to radiographic disease progression, local progression precluding surgery, inability to resect the tumor, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause., up to 2 years
All eligible patients will receive LDRT combined with partial SBRT, followed by PD-1 inhibitors plus platinum-based chemotherapy, initiated within 7 days after completing radiation. PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy will be administered at the recommended doses according to the instruction manual every 3 weeks, with 3 cycles planned as neoadjuvant therapy. Surgery will be performed within 4 to 6 weeks (+7 days) after completing the final cycle of immunochemotherapy.

Main objective and endpoint: the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in the resected primary tumor and lymph nodes.
