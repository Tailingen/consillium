Anti-TNFα to Delay or Prevent Progression to Stage 3 T1D
This will be a study conducted as a placebo-controlled, double blind, 1:1 randomized controlled clinical trial testing a Tumor Necrosis Factor Blocker (Anti-TNFα) substance versus placebo in subjects with a 2-year 50% risk of progression to stage 3 T1D across multiple centers. The trial will investigate the ability of Anti-TNFα to prevent or delay progression to Stage 3 T1D in the targeted patient population.
