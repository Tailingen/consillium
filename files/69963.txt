Combined Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma >3-<5 cm
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) + microwave ablation (MWA) versus only TACE or MWA for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \>3-\<5 cm.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Combined therapy|PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation|PROCEDURE: Transarterial chemoembolization
Adverse events, Images were evaluated and compared for adverse events. The adverse events were recorded and classiﬁed following the guidelines of the Society of Interventional Radiology, Up to three years after procedure|Treatment Response, Tumor response was evaluated by CECT or dynamic MRI based on the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (m-RECIST) established by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases., One month|Recurrence rate, The recurrence rate was measured in relation to management lines., 12 months after procedure|Overall mortality rate, The mortality rate was measured in relation to management lines., Three years after procedure|Progression-free survival, The progression-free survival was measured in relation to management lines., Three years after procedure|AFP variation rate, The AFP variation rate (ΔAFP) was defined as the percentage of change between the AFP concentration at baseline and the postprocedure AFP concentration after 1-2 months as shown in the following equation:

ΔAFP (%) = \[(AFPbaseline-AFPpostprocedure) /AFPbaseline\] ×100%, Baseline and 1-2 months after procedure
This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE)+microwave ablation (MWA) versus only TACE or MWA for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \>3-\<5 cm.

This randomized controlled trial screened 278 patients with HCC \>3-\<5 cm. Patients were randomized into three groups: 90 underwent TACE (Group 1); 95 underwent MWA (Group 2); and 93 underwent combined therapy (Group 3). Patients were followed-up with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Images were evaluated and compared for treatment response and adverse events based on modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumor. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration was measured at baseline and during every follow-up visit.
