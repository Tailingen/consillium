Safety and Effectiveness Evaluations of the COLO-BT as an Treatment to the Proctectomy.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Colorectal Balloon Tube (hereinafter referred to as COLO-BT™) device, a single use, temporary intraluminal bypass device, intended to reduce contact of fecal content with an anastomotic site, following colorectal surgery (open or laparoscopic)

DEVICE: COLO BT™|OTHER: Stoma Creation
Study Success Case(Avoidance of ostomy), Study Success Case" is defined as a case which has met both the "Clinical Success" and "Technical Success" requirements throughout the 24 weeks (6 Months) monitoring period, following the initial surgical treatment with COLO-BT™ or temporary ileostomy, 24 Weeks
A primary diverting stoma is widely used by surgeons in order to bypass low rectal anastomosis and reduce morbidity associated with anastomotic leaks. Typically, a stoma is created for all high-risk patients which mean that many patients are exposed to potentially serious complications associated with the stoma itself without any clinical benefit.

COLO BT™ is a local, temporary bypass device that provides protection of the anastomosis and safely postpones stoma. COLO BT™ is designed to avoid stoma creation in all patients except those patients whose anastomoses have not healed after surgery, allowing the others to return to normal activity more quickly and safely.
