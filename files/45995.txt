Total Neoadjuvant Therapy in Rectal Cancer
In this phase 2 study, the efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy in Taiwanese patients with rectal cancer will be investigated. Patients with stage II or III middle/low rectal cancer will be prospective enrolled. The total neoadjuvant therapy with the short-course radiotherapy (5×5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days) followed by chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 for 9 cycles will be administered. The primary endpoint is the complete response (CR) rate which will take into account the patients with clinical and pathological complete response.
Rectal Cancer
RADIATION: Short-course radiotherapy|DRUG: mFOLFOX6
Complete response (CR) rate, The percentage of patients who achieve a complete response, The response will be assessed at the period of 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of total neoadjuvant chemotherapy
R0 resection rate, The percentage of patients who receive the surgery of total neoadjuvant therapy and achieve R0 resection, The R0 resection rate will be assessed at the period of 2 to 4 weeks after completion of the total neoadjuvant chemotherapy|Response rate, The percentage of patients who achieve a complete response or partial response, The response will be assessed at the period of 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of total neoadjuvant chemotherapy|Loco-regional failure rate, The percentage of patients who develop local recurrence after surgery, The loco-regional failure will be assessed from the date of surgical resection until the first documented local recurrence, up to 84 months|Rate of distant metastasis, The percentage of patients who develop distant metastasis, The distant metastasis will be assessed from the date of beginning short-course RT until the first documented distant metastasis, up to 84 months|Safety profiles, The occurrence and severity of adverse events which develop during the treatment of total neoadjuvant therapy, The safety profile will be assessed from the beginning of the short-course RT to the end of last cycle of FOLFOX chemotherapy, up to 24 weeks
This is a single center, single-arm, open-label, phase II study to investigate the efficacy and toxicities of total neoadjuvant therapy in patients with middle or lower rectal cancer. This study is planned to start after the approval by IRB, enroll patients for 2 years, and follow the clinical outcome for another 5 years. It will be conducted at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Forty-two subjects will be enrolled. Patients who have newly diagnosed stage II or III, middle or low rectal adenocarcinoma will be recruited to receive the TNT treatment. The TNT includes the short-course radiotherapy (5×5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days)) followed by chemotherapy with the regimen of mFOLFOX6 for total 9 cycles
