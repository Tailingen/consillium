Diagnostic Study to Predict the Risk of Developing Metastatic Cancer in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Melanoma
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures that analyze surgically-removed tumor tissue and lymph node samples may help doctors identify patients with melanoma who are at risk for developing metastatic cancer.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying tumor tissue and lymph node samples to see how well they work in predicting the development of metastatic cancer in patients with stage I or stage II melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
GENETIC: comparative genomic hybridization|GENETIC: cytogenetic analysis|GENETIC: fluorescence in situ hybridization|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method
Relapse-free survival, Up to 3.5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Correlate degree of melastatin gene expression with risk of developing local regional metastases in patients with primary stage I or II melanoma.
* Correlate melastatin expression prospectively with event-free survival of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Melastatin mRNA expression is determined by in situ hybridization using tissue from primary tumor and lymph nodes. Tissue is also examined by immunohistochemical staining using antibodies to S-100 and MART-1. Patients do not receive the results of these tests nor do the results influence individual therapy.

Patients are followed every 4 months for 3.5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
