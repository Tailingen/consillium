A Phase I/II Trial of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Subjects With Previously-Treated AL Amyloidosis
This study seeks to enroll patients with AL amyloidosis, for whom treatment with one of the standard melphalan chemotherapy-based regimens is either not recommended or is not their preference.

Pomalidomide (CC-4047) is a drug given by mouth, which can change or regulate the functioning of the immune system. So, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the production of the amyloid protein. Pomalidomide is not currently FDA-approved for AL Amyloidosis. Pomalidomide is chemically similar to thalidomide and lenalidomide, both of these drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), a disease similar to AL Amyloidosis.

Participants in this study will receive pomalidomide and dexamethasone. Phase I is a dose-escalation study and dose escalation will proceed through 3 dose-levels according to standard rules in which dose levels are started sequentially after complete evaluation of the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities. In the Phase II portion, participants will receive pomalidomide and dexamethasone using the defined maximum tolerated dose.

Assessing Dose-limiting Toxicity to Determine Maximal Tolerated Dosage at 2 Milligram Dose, Number of patients in Phase I cohort 1 experiencing dose-limiting toxicity at the 2 milligram dose of pomalidomide combined with dexamethasone in subjects with previously- treated light-chain amyloidosis, one month|Assessing Dose-limiting Toxicity to Determine Maximal Tolerated Dosage at 3 Milligram Dose, Number of patients in Phase I cohort 2 experiencing dose limiting toxicity in the 3 milligram dose level, cohort 2., One month|Assessing Dose-limiting Toxicity to Determine Maximal Tolerated Dosage at 4 Milligram Dose, Number of patients in Phase I cohort 3 experiencing dose-limiting toxicity at the 4 milligram dose for participants within the third dose cohort, One month
Response to the Maximal Tolerated Dose, Number of participants with a response to treatment at that maximal tolerated dose (including partial, very good, or complete responses), one year
Primary objective:

Determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide combined with dexamethasone in subjects with previously- treated light-chain (AL)-amyloidosis

Secondary objectives:

Determine the following at the MTD:

* Hematological complete (CR) very good partial (VGPR) and partial (PR) rates
* duration of response
* organ response
* Time-to-event
* Survival

Exploratory study objective:

To investigate the relationship of changes in the levels of the biomarkers B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I to frequency of specific adverse events and the occurrence of DLT
