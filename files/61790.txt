UNITy-BasED MR-Linac Adaptive Simultaneous Integrated Hypofractionated Boost Trial for High Grade Glioma in the Elderly
The usual standard of care for patients over 65 diagnosed with glioblastoma ("GBM") or Grade 4 astrocytoma, IDH-mutant is a 3-week course of radiotherapy, with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). This radiation dose and length of treatment are less than what would be given for younger patients, primarily due to unclear survival benefits from randomized trials. However, survival remains dismal, and may be partially due to the reduced radiation dose. Recent studies investigating this have found that increased radiation dose (to the equivalent of what is normally given over 6 weeks in younger patients) over 3 weeks is well-tolerated and has improved survival rates.

Additionally, with the advent of novel technology such as the MR-Linac, adaptive radiotherapy with this regimen using reduced radiation margins is possible. Use of the MR-Linac allows for daily MRI scans to be done prior to treatment, so plans can be adapted to tumour dynamics and anatomical deformations. In this trial, we will examine the outcomes of increased radiation dose, combined with reduced-margin adaptive radiotherapy in this patient population.
