Study Investigating the Interactions of Bone and Hematopoiesis in the Elderly
The prospective BoHemE study is designed to evaluate the correlation between bone marrow function and skeletal health in elderly patients (\>= 60 years) with or without pre-existing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
OTHER: Observational
T score of bone mineral density at the total hip and at lumbar spine L1-L4 in elderly patients with MDS and a control group without MDS. Osteoporosis is defined as a T score of <-2.5 at the hip and at lumbar spine L1-L4., five years
Time-dependent molecular patterns of clonality and their association with secondary malignancies and outcome in healthy and MDS individuals, Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Hematological profile of MDS patients (karyotype, immunophenotype, molecular characteristics, WHO and IPSS R classification, therapy), Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Sociodemographic parameters (age, sex, socioeconomic status), Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Disease characteristics (onset/date of diagnosis of MDS and osteoporosis, previous treatments and diagnostic results), Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Clinical osteoporotic fractures, five years|Quality of life (QLQ C30, SF 36), Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Medical care (Number of medical consultations/hospital admissions due to osteoporosis, medical professions, falls), Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Comorbidities (Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index), five years|Disease evolution of MDS (change of MDS subtype according to IPSS-R and WHO classification), Composite measures as part of a patient registry, five years|Disease evolution of osteoporosis (measured by number of fractures within the previous 24 months), five years|Overall survival, Duration from the day of study entry to the day of death, five years
