CAR T-cell Therapy Directed to CD70 for Pediatric Patients With Hematological Malignancies
The study participant has one of the following blood cancers: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL, T-ALL) or Lymphoma. Your cancer has been difficult to treat (refractory) or has come back after treatment (relapse).

Primary Objective

To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of intravenous infusions of escalating doses of CD70-CAR T cells in patients (â‰¤21 years) with recurrent/refractory CD70+ hematological malignancies after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

Secondary Objectives

To evaluate the antileukemic activity of CD70-CAR T cells. We will determine the anti- leukemic activity of the CD70-CAR T cells in the bone marrow and in the treatment of extramedullary disease.
Hematologic Malignancy|ALL, Childhood|AML, Childhood|Lymphoma|MDS
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: CD70-CAR T cell infusion (Autologous)|DRUG: Mesna
Maximum tolerated dose of CD70-CAR T cells, Phase I design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous, CD70-CAR T cells. Three (3) dose levels will be evaluated (1x10e6, 3x10e6, and 1x10e7 cells/kg)., 28 days after CD70-CAR T-cell infusion
The primary interventions are a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), followed by a single autologous infusion of CD70-CAR T cells.

Phase I study evaluating three (3) dose levels of CD70-CAR T cells.
