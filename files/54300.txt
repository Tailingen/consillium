General Anesthesia Combined With Epidural Anesthesia Mitigates the Surgical Stress-related Immunosuppression in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to prove whether general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia could better maintain body balance of Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 compared with general anesthesia, so as to reduce the surgical stress-related immunosuppression, and to improve the prognosis.
Colorectal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: epidural anesthesia|PROCEDURE: general anesthesia
