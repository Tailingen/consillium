Cold Knife Conization With and Without Lateral Hemostatic Sutures
The treatment of high grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) 2, 3 is defined according to the colposcopic evaluation of the patient. In case colposcopy findings are satisfactory (visible squamocolumnar junction), both ablative and excisional methods are adequate. In the middle of the 20th century, lateral hemostatic sutures were added to the cold knife conization surgical technique to reduce blood loss. Some authors recommend that these branches should be ligated, but it remains unclear whether these sutures are actually effective in reducing bleeding.This study compared blood loss during cold knife conization of the cervix with and without lateral hemostatic sutures.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Cervix Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Cold Knife Conization with stitches|PROCEDURE: Cold knife Conization without stitches
Intraoperatory vaginal bleeding, The intraoperatory bleeding will be measure by weigh the gauze in grams (g)., Intraoperatory
This is a study that will evaluate two groups of patients undergoing cold-knife conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia high grade where 50% will undergo hemostatic sutures in the lateral cervical and 50% of patients will not be subjected to these sutures. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the amount of intraoperative bleeding.
