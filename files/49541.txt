Photodynamic Therapy in Treating Patients With Lung Cancer
This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy using HPPH in treating patients with lung cancer. Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as HPPH, that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed.

DRUG: HPPH|DRUG: photodynamic therapy|PROCEDURE: therapeutic bronchoscopy
MTID, Defined as the dose at which =\< 1 out of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity., Up to 2 years|Systemic toxicity according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 2, Up to 6 months|PDT-related normal tissue toxicity, Assessed by a scale with grades 0-3 being acceptable, grade 4 being unacceptable, and grade 5 being stopping study., Up to 6 months
Objective tumor response, Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine maximally tolerated light dose (MTID). Identify systemic and normal tissue toxicity using 2-\[hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) for photodynamic therapy in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) or microinvasive carcinoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To study tumor response in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) or bronchogenic microinvasive carcinoma.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Patients then photodynamic therapy with laser light on day 3. Patients also undergo therapeutic bronchoscopy for endoscopic debridement on day 5.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and then periodically for at least 2 years.
