Evaluating the Addition of Elacestrant (oral SERD) to Olaparib (PARP-inhibitor) in Patients with Advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer
Trial design:

Phase II, prospective, multi-center, randomized, open label, parallel group study in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with gBRCA1/2 mutation, with 2:1 randomization into Arm A (olaparib + elacestrant) or arm B (olaparib). Treatment in either arm will be given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient´s consent to study participation, or end of study.

Trial population:

Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with gBRCA1/2 mutation, with an indication for standard-of-care PARP inhibitor therapy and planned treatment with olaparib, an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and life expectancy of \> 6 months, with normal bone marrow and kidney functions and no active or newly diagnosed central nervous system (CNS) metastases or symptomatic metastatic visceral disease at risk of life-threatening complications.

Interventions:

Patients randomized to Arm A will receive 600 mg olaparib daily and 400 mg elacestrant daily, while patients randomized to Arm B will receive 600 mg olaparib daily. Blood tests (hematology, biochemistry) will be performed at the beginning of every cycle, and imaging for tumor assessment (chest and abdominopelvic imaging) as well as QoL assessments will be performed every three months and in case of suspicion of progression/end of study.

Progression free survival (PFS), PFS, investigator-assessed. To evaluate the impact on PFS of elacestrant with olaparib compared to olaparib alone in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with gBRCA1/2 mutations., PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first progression as assessed by the investigator, or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 48 months.
Time-to-treatment failure (TTF), To compare TTF between treatment arms (i.e., elacestrant + olaparib vs. olaparib)., TTF is defined as time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment due to disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient´s preference, or death, assessed up to 48 months.|Overall survival (OS), To compare OS between treatment arms., OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any reason, assessed up to 48 months.|Patient reported outcome (PRO) in the form of quality of life (QoL) assessment, To assess and compare patient reported breast cancer-specific QoL as measured by FACT-ES questionnaire., At baseline, day 1 of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days), every 3 months starting from treatment start, and at end of treatment (an average of 12 months per patient).|PFS in stratified and exploratory subgroups, To compare PFS in the stratified subgroups: pre-treatment chemotherapy in the metastatic setting yes vs. no.

To compare PFS in the exploratory subgroups specified in the protocol., PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first progression as assessed by the investigator, or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 48 months.|TTF in the stratified subgroups, To compare TTF in the stratified subgroups: pre-treatment chemotherapy in the metastatic setting yes vs. no.

To compare TTF in the exploratory subgroups specified in the protocol., TTF is defined as time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment due to disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient´s preference, or death, assessed up to 48 months.|OS in the stratified subgroups, To compare OS in the stratified subgroups: pre-treatment chemotherapy in the metastatic setting yes vs. no.

To compare OS in the exploratory subgroups specified in the protocol., OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any reason, assessed up to 48 months.|Overall response rate (ORR), To compare ORR between treatment arms., ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved either a confirmed complete response or partial response, assessed up to 48 months.|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), To compare the CBR between treatment arms., CBR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved either a confirmed complete response or partial response, or stable disease for at least 24 weeks from randomization.|Numbers and types of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To assess and compare safety between treatment arms (frequency and severity of AEs graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0)., During treatment phase, an average of 12 months per patient.|Compliance between treatment arms as assessed by treatment delays, reductions, and interruptions, Frequencies of patients whose treatment had to be reduced, delayed, interrupted, or prematurely discontinued will be reported for both arms, together with reasons for such modifications, and comparisons between the two arms will be conducted with the χ2-test with continuity correction., During treatment phase, an average of 12 months per patient.
Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer and gBRCA1/2 mutations have a low progression-free survival (PFS) and represent a patient population with a high unmet need, hence further treatment options should be explored to improve patient outcomes.

Elacestrant is a novel, nonsteroidal, orally bioavailable estrogen receptor antagonist (SERD) that has shown efficacy in heavily pretreated patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, and in those with ESR1 mutations known to confer endocrine resistance, and has thus gained approval in 2023 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for postmenopausal women or adult men with ER-positive, HER2-negative, ESR1-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following at least one line of ET.

Olaparib is approved by the EMA for deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA-mutated, HER2-negative metastatic BC, based on positive outcomes in the phase III OlympiAD trial which showed improved median PFS, response rates, and less toxicity with olaparib compared to SOC.

The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate if the addition of elacestrant to standard olaparib therapy could potentially lead to an improvement in PFS compared to olaparib alone in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with gBRCA1/2 mutations.

ELEMENT is a phase II, prospective, multi-center, randomized, open label, parallel group study in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with gBRCA1/2 mutation, with 2:1 randomization into Arm A (olaparib + elacestrant) or arm B (olaparib). Treatment in either arm will be given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient´s consent to study participation, or end of study.
