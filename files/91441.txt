Evaluation of Oesogastroduodenoscopy With Vision to 245 ° (Full Spectrum Endoscopy) to View the Main Disc and Accessory
The monitoring and prognosis of patients with familial polyposis adenomatous rests on analysis of the transitional mucosa at the anal margin and especially on the tracking, characterization and resection of lesions of dysplasia type of high grade at the duodenal level, after total proctocolectomy. Currently, endoscopes with axial or lateral vision are used. The FUSE technology allows the simplification or even the improvement of patient surveillance with a 245° vision (versus150° in case of classical gastroscope). The use of a second screen to enlarge the field of view may allow both analysis of duodenum and the main and accessory papilla with one single endoscope and to decrease the number of omitted lesions .
