CD19 hsCAR-T for Refractory/Relapsed CD19+ B-ALL Patients
This Phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a CD19-targeting humanized selective CAR-T (CD19 hsCAR-T) in refractory/relapsed CD19+ B-ALL leukemia patients who have no available curative treatment options, have a limited prognosis with currently available treatments, and were previously treated with a B cell directed cell therapy.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 hsCAR-T
Overall response rate (ORR) within 3 months, Overall response rate (ORR) within 3 months after infusion of CD19 hsCAR-T, 3 months
Best overall response (BOR), Best overall response (BOR) of complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) within 3 months after CD19 hsCAR-T infusion, 3 months|Duration of remission (DoR), Duration of remission (DoR) within 1 year after CD19 hsCAR-T infusion (Duration of remission (DOR) is defined as the duration from the date when the response criteria of CR or CRi is first met to the date of relapse or death due to ALL), 1 year|Event free survival within 1 year, Event free survival within 1 year (Event free survival is defined as the time from start of the first infusion to the earliest of death from any cause or relapse), 1 year|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]), Safety and tolerability of CD19 hsCAR-T: frequency and severity of adverse events, including, but not limited to, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), 6 months
CD19+ B-ALL patients who have relapsed after murine-based CD19 CAR-T (CD19mCAR-T) treatment and/or have limited clinical response to CD19mCAR-T will be enrolled to receive CD19 hsCAR-T treatment.
