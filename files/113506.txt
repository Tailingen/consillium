Patients and Methods A randomized controlled trial is conducted by comparing effectiveness of sticking and massaging auricular points relieving hot flashes in women with breast cancer versus placebo auricular points. A total of 92 women(still recuiting) with breast cancer, who were under hormonal therapy were randomly assigned and the allocation ratio was 1:1. Both groups received a booklet with information about self-care indications, auricular points and its management, and patients can record their hot flash score each day for 12 weeks in the booklets.In addition, both group received 8 treatment sessions of sticking and pressing predefined auricular points or placebo auricular points treatments.

The primary outcome was hot flash score(HFS)at the end of treatment (week 12), calculated as the frequency multiplied by the average severity of hot flashes.The secondary outcomes were climacteric symptoms and quality of life, measured by the Greene Climacteric Scale(GCS)and Menopause Quality of Life scales(MenQoL)as well as serum estradiol(E2), follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH) and beta-endorphin(Î²-EP).Expectation and satisfaction of treatment effect and safety were also evaluated.
