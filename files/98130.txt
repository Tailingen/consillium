Treatment Patterns in Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients With Bone Metastases in a Medicare Population
The goal of the study is to provide a detailed description of treatments for CRPC (Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer) patients with bone metastases and the resource utilization and costs associated with that diagnosis and subsequent treatments.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223)
Overall survival of mCRPC patients, mCRPC: Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, Up to 24 months|Number of skeletal related events (SREs) of the mCRPC patients, Up to 30 months|Type of skeletal related events (SREs) of the mCRPC patients, Up to 30 months|Number of patients with mCRPC with bone metastases, Up to 24 months|Type of treatments associated with mCRPC, Treatments could include chemotherapy or bone radiation, Up to 24 months|Duration for each treatment identified, Up to 30 months|Distribution of providers by treatment, Distribution of treatments for mCRPC patients will be tracked by the type of provider (oncologist, versus urologist, versus radiation oncologist, etc), Up to 30 months|Clinical and demographic characteristics of the mCRPC patients, Gender, age, geographical region and race/ethnicity, Key comorbidities will also be documented using the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (DCCI); laboratory results for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) testing using laboratory claims; Rx utilization including opioid use, Up to 12 months|Treatment patterns of mCRPC patients with bone metastases, Up to 30 months|Progression of the disease of mCRPC patients, Up to 12 months
All-cause healthcare resource utilization for mCRPC patients, Using all post-index medical and pharmacy claims, compute the count of physician office visits, outpatient services, inpatient stay, length of inpatient stay, ancillary services, and count of pharmacy claims, Up to 30 months|mCRPC-specific healthcare resource utilization for mCRPC patients, Healthcare resource utilization will be measured using all post-index medical and pharmacy claims to create counts for physician office visits, outpatient services, inpatient stay, length of inpatient stay, ancillary services and counts of pharmacy claims, Up to 30 months|All-cause healthcare costs for mCRPC patients, Healthcare costs will be determined using all post-index medical and pharmacy claims. The all-cause total (medical + pharmacy), medical and pharmacy costs will be computed. A family of general linear model analysis will be performed (medical, pharmacy, and total costs), Up to 30 months|mCRPC-specific healthcare costs for mCRPC patients, Healthcare costs will be determined using all post-index medical and pharmacy claims where a diagnosis of mCRPC appears in any of the nine diagnosis positions. The mCRPC specific total (Medical + pharmacy), medical and pharmacy costs associated with these claims will be computed., Up to 30 months
