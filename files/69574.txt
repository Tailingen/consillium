SHR-A2102 Combined with Adebrelimab As Neoadjuvant Therapy for Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of of SHR-A2102 in combination with Adebrelimab in Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer(TNBC)
TNBC - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: SHR-A2102 ; Adebrelimab injection
PCR rate, Total pathological complete response (tpCR: ypT0-isï¼ŒypN0), At the time of surgery
EFS, Event-free survival (EFS), 3-10 years|DFS, Disease-free survival (DFS), 5-10 years|DDFS, Distant disease-Free Survival (DDFS), 5-10 years
This study plans to enroll patients with early-stage TNBC. The patients will first receive 8 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, with imaging examinations conducted every 2 cycles to evaluate the treatment response. Subjects who complete the 8 cycles and are suitable for surgery will undergo surgical treatment after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The postoperative adjuvant therapy will last for one year. Subjects will continue medication until surgery is completed, or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or when the investigator determines that medication must be terminated.
