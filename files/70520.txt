A Study of Erdafitinib Versus Investigator Choice of Intravesical Chemotherapy in Participants Who Received Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) and Recurred With High Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS) in participants treated with erdafitinib vs Investigator's Choice, for participants with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who harbor fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutations or fusions, and who recurred after bacillus calmette-guerin (BCG) therapy.
Urinary Bladder Neoplasms
DRUG: Erdafitinib|DRUG: Investigator Choice (Gemcitabine)|DRUG: Investigator Choice (Mitomycin C)
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the reappearance of high-risk disease, or death, whichever is reported first., Up to 4 years
Time to Progression, Time from the date of randomization until the date of first documented evidence of any of progression or death. Participants who are progression -free and alive or have unknown status will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment., Up to 4 years|Overall Survival, The time from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death resulting from any cause. Participants who are alive or have unknown vital status will be censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive., Up to 4 years|Recurrence-Free Survival, RFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the reappearance of high-risk disease, or death, whichever is reported first. Participants who are recurrence-free and alive or have unknown status will be censored at the last tumor assessment., Months 6 and 12|Plasma Concentration of Erdafitinib, Plasma concentration of erdafitinib will be reported., Cycle 1 Day 14, Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle is of 28 days)|Number of Participants with Adverse events, An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product, Up to 4 years
This study enrolls participants with high risk NMIBC and FGFR mutations or fusions. Erdafitinib is an oral pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-4 inhibitor with demonstrated clinical activity in participants with solid tumors, including urothelial carcinoma, with alterations in the FGFR pathway. In Cohort 1, participants will be randomized to erdafitinib or to Investigators Choice (intravesical gemcitabine or intravesical mitomycin C \[MMC\] or hyperthermic MMC). The study consists of screening period, treatment phase, follow-up phase, and long-term extension phase.
