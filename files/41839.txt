Comparison of AZD6244 in Combination With Dacarbazine Versus (vs) Dacarbazine Alone in BRAF Mutation Positive Melanoma Patients
To assess the efficacy in terms of overall survival of AZD6244 in combination with dacarbazine, compared with dacarbazine alone, in first line patients with BRAF mutation positive advanced cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma
Melanoma
DRUG: AZD6244|DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival, Following progression survival data was collected until documentation of death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up or the final data cut-off, whichever occurred first., From date of randomization until death, withdrawal of consent or the end of the study. The end of the study was defined as the date all AZD6244 patients had been followed for a minimum of 12 months, or the date of final analysis, whichever was later
Progression Free Survival, PFS is the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). Progression is defined using RECIST (v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm., From randomization until evidence of RECIST-defined objective disease progression or data cut off, for a minimum of 12 months since start of treatment|Objective Response Rate, ORR rate is defined as the number (%) of subjects with at least one visit response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) , as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI. CR, Disappearance of all target lesions; PR, â‰¥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Data obtained up until progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, was included in the assessment of ORR, From randomization until evidence of RECIST-defined objective disease progression or data cut off, for a minimum of 12 months since start of treatment|Change in Target Lesion Tumour Size at Week 12, randomization to week 12
