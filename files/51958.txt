Study to Demonstrate the Preliminary Safety and Effectiveness of IPBS in Performing MRI-Guided Targeting and Intervention of Breast Tissue in Female Patients Indicated for MRI-Guided Breast Biopsy
A preliminary demonstration of the Safety of IPBS in positioning a vacuum assisted biopsy (VAB) tool to enable an MRI-guided automated breast biopsy. This will consist of 10-15 biopsy procedures facilitated by the MRI-guided system. Patients will be followed after the procedure to assess clinical outcomes.
