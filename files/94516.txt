Comparator-Controlled Study for EGFR(+) Patients With Multiple BMs From NSCLC (BROKE) (EGFR-epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;BM-brain Metastases)
1. Compare the effect and safety of gefitinib alone with gefitinib plus concomitant WBRT(whole-brain radiotherapy ) in treatment of NSCLC patients harboring an EGFR mutation with multiple BM.
2. Verify the failure pattern of NSCLC patients harboring an EGFR mutation with multiple BM.
3. Explore the rescuable therapy after progression of disease.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Brain Metastases|EGFR Gene Mutation
DRUG: Gefitinib|RADIATION: WBRT
Time to progression, Compare the progression free survival(PFS) and safety in two arms,including intracranial PFS、extracranial PFS and overall PFS., 12-14 months
Overall survival, 3 years|Disease Progression Classification, intracranial or extracranial site, 3 years|Health-related quality of life, measured by ECGO(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) PS (Performance Status), 3 years|Mental Status, measured by scale of MMSE( Mini Mental Status Examination), 3 years
All patients will be randomized to receive gefitinib or gefitinib concurrent WBRT until progression of disease. Gefitinib concurrent WBRT, patients were given gefitinib 250mg per day concurrently with WBRT(whole-brain radiotherapy ). Dose reduction was allowed for intolerable adverse effects such as rash(grade 4)、diarrhea(grade 3-4) or non hematological toxicity(grade 3-4) from 250mg per day to 250mg every other day then to 250mg every three days if needed. WBRT was delivered in 3.0 Gy(Gray)fractions once per day 5 days per week to a total dose of 30Gy (10 fractions). Radiation was delivered as opposed lateral 6-MV(Micro Voltage) beams with Varian linear accelerator.
