Prediction of Peritoneal Metastasis for Gastric Cancer Based on Radiomics
Peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer is difficult to be detected in time, thus delaying treatment. Based on the conventional CT images of gastric cancer, this study plans to develop, improve and validate an intelligent analysis system based on radiomics. By extracting and combining the radiomics features related to peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer, the intelligent analysis system could predict the risk of peritoneal metastasis, and provide personalized decision suggestions for the treatment of gastric cancer.
