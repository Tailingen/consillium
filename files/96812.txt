Background \& Objectives: Various oncoplastic techniques have emerged over the years to preserve breast cosmesis and symmetry without compromising the principles of tumor excision. One of the newer techniques for breast volume replacement to achieve symmetry and cosmesis is the use of fasciocutaneous pedicled chest wall perforator flaps or local perforator flaps (LPF). The objectives of this study are to document the details of the surgical procedure as well as patient-reported satisfaction and well-being following the already performed surgical procedure using a validated BREAST-Q tool among Pakistani women.

Materials \& Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study will be conducted by enrolling all the 25 female patients who have undergone LPF for breast tumors at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Data related to the procedure will be collected on a pre-designed proforma. Cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction will be evaluated using 2 scales from BREAST-Q BCT domain version 2.0. The questionnaire will be self-administered by the patients during their routine follow-up in the clinic. Data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Mean (SD) / median (IQR) will be computed for quantitative variables and frequency and percentages will be calculated for qualitative variables. 2 sample t-test will be applied. P-value â‰¤0.05 will be considered significant.
