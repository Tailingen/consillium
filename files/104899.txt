Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Early CDT Lung blood test
to assess the effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test in reducing the incidence of patients with late-stage lung cancer at diagnosis, compared with standard clinical practice;, difference at 24 months after randomisation, between the number of patients with stage 3, 4 or unclassified lung cancer at diagnosis in the intervention arm, and those in the control arm;, 24 months
AIMS To assess the effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test in increasing early stage lung cancer detection, thereby reducing the rate of late stage (3 / 4 / U) presentation, compared to normal clinical practice; to assess the cost-effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test compared to normal clinical practice; to assess the effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test in reducing adverse outcomes including potential psychological and behavioural consequences.
