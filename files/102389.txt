Preoperative Proton Radiotherapy for Retroperitoneal Sarcoma
The goal of this study is to evaluate radiation treatment intended to increase the chance of curing your sarcoma and decrease the side effects of proton therapy.

This study will also look at the tumor tissue that was removed during your initial biopsy and your final surgery for information that may help to treat retroperitoneal sarcoma in the future.
Retroperitoneal Sarcoma
RADIATION: Preoperative proton therapy|PROCEDURE: Surgery
To assess treatment feasibility of preoperative proton therapy for resectable intermediate or high grade retroperitoneal sarcoma., 4-6 weeks post treatment
To evaluate the acute and late toxicity of preoperative proton therapy for resectable intermediate or high grade retroperitoneal sarcoma, Weekly during treatment, then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 4 years.|To determine the incidence of margin negative resection in patients compared to historic controls treated with photon therapy., 4-6 weeks post treatment|To determine the percent tumor necrosis and percent apoptosis compared to historic controls treated with photon therapy., 4-6 weeks post treatment|To assess the predictive value of CT and MRI in evaluating pathologic tumor response and margin negative resection following proton radiotherapy., 4-6 weeks post treatment|To compare the dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using dose volume histograms (DVHs) generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and a theoretical photon plan generated for comparison purposes., 4-6 weeks post treatment
Data collection will be obtained from the patient's medical records including initial evaluation, pathology report, dosimetry information, radiotherapy completion records and follow-up.
