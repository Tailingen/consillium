Comparison of Two Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for treating non-small cell lung cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare overall survival, response rate, and time to progression of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus gemcitabine and cisplatin.
* Compare the toxicities of each of these 2 regimens in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to weight loss in the past 6 months (less than 5% vs at least 5%) and disease stage (stage IIIB with pleural or pericardial effusion or pleural implants vs stage IV/recurrent). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1.
* Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 only.

Treatment continues in both arms every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-90 patients (20-45 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
