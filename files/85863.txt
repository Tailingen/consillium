Durvalumab and SNDX-6532 Following Chemo or Radio-Embolization for Patients With Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The purposed of this research is to study the safety and clinical activity of the combination of durvalumab and a CSF-1R inhibitor (SNDX-6352) in people with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.
Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: SNDX-6352
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per mRECIST (Modified RECIST), ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 8 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Study Drug-related Toxicities, Number of participants who experience treatment related adverse events â‰¥ grade 3 as defined by CTCAE 5.0., up to 1 year
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of months from the start of study treatment to time of death. Individuals are censored at the date of the last contact if no event occurs. The estimation method used was Kaplan-Meier., up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per mRECIST, PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of treatment to disease recurrence \[disease recurrence (DR) progressive disease (PD) or relapse from complete response (CR) as assessed using mRECIST criteria\] or death due to any cause. Per mRECIST criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 8 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Number of days from the start of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) by radiographic scans, whichever is recorded first, until the first date that progressive disease or death is documented. Per mRECIST, CR = disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions., 8 months
