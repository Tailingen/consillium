HPV prevalence, 1. To compare HPV prevalence in subjects with primary pterygium and with recurrent pterygium, 1 hour per participants which is on a day for collecting sample
HPV autoinoculation, To assess whether HPV autoinoculation is present, we evaluate whether there is an association between HPV ocular infection and genital infection., 1 hour per participants which is on a day for collecting sample|cytokine IL-6, IL-18 and VEGF levels, To compare cytokine IL-6, IL-18 and VEGF levels among various subgroups, including recurrent pterygium subjects with HPV positive and HPV negative status, primary pterygium subjects with HPV positive and HPV negative, and subjects without ocular diseases, 1 hour per participants which is on a day for collecting sample
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection in primary and recurrent pterygium and the association of HPV types collecting from conjunctiva swab and urine. The second purpose is to compare a quantity of cytokines including IL-6, IL-18 and growth factor including VEGF found in tears of patients with primary and recurrent pterygium to participants with free of ocular disease Primary hypothesis

- The prevalence of HPV infection in primary pterygium is difference with prevalence in recurrent pterygium patients.

Secondary hypothesis

* Ocular HPV infection has association with HPV genitalia infection.
* Tears cytokine and growth factor level (IL-6, IL-18 and VEGF) are higher in pterygium HPV infection than non-HPV infection and also more than normal population
