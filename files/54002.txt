Male Fertility Preservation Using Cryopreservation of Testicular Tissue Before Highly Gonadotoxic Cancer Treatment
Background:

Due to the remarkable improvement in treatments these last decades, long term survival can be expected in more than 80% of childhood cancer patients. Unfortunately, cancer treatments can be harmful to the gonads and can affect reproductive and endocrine functions. While loss of fertility is a major concern for most patients, sperm cryopreservation should be offered to all pubertal male patients. For prepubertal boys, only the experimental option of testicular biopsy in order to cryopreserve testicular stem cells can be proposed.

Primary aims

- To cryopreserve testicular tissue of prepubertal patient receiving highly gonadotoxic oncological treatment.

Secondary aims

* To cryopreserve testicular tissue after failure of sperm cryopreservation in pubertal patient with high risk of infertility
* To create a database in order to record clinical and biological follow-up data
* To create a research biobank for future research projects

Childhood Cancer|Fertility Disorders
PROCEDURE: testicular tissue biopsy
Number of pediatric cancer patient who will undergo testicular tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation, 0-20 years
Incidence of complications related to the testicular biopsy (safety), The safety will be assessed by recording the number of complications of the procedure (e.g. bleeding, infection, testicular atrophy), 0-20 years|Comparison of biochemical markers, Comparison of biochemical markers (e.g., FSH; LH, AMH; Inhibin B, SHBG and testosterone) between patients who undergo testicular biopsy and controls, 0-20 years
