Gene and Protein Expression Profiles After Treatment of Actinic Keratoses
The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, and melatonin for actinic keratosis on immunological gene, and protein expressions profiles. Secondarily, the aim is to assess the effect of the treatment on the histopathology of actinic keratoses.
