HPV-T in HPV-16 Positive Recurrent or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of HPV-T in HPV 16 positive recurrent or metastatic solid tumor patients.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: HPV-T|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Toxicity will be assessed within 4 weeks of the HPV-T transfer., Up to 24 months
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Participants displaying objective response associated with the treatment regimen per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1). The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Disease control rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DOR), Overall Survival(OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS) will be also evaluated., Up to 24 months
In this study, HPV-T cells will be cultured from mononuclear cells collected from participant's peripheral blood in the laboratory and they will be given back to the participant intravenously. The use of HPV-T cells involves a combination of IL-2, which is a drug used to help the body's response to treatment on the immune system. A medium dose regimen of IL-2 will be given after the participant receives the infusion of the T-cells.

Each HPV-T cell reinfusion is a treatment cycle, and each participant will receive a maximum of four cycles of HPV-T treatment. Whether the participant receives the next cycle of treatment depends on the efficacy of the previous HPV-T treatment, which is assessed by imaging.
