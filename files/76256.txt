The trial will initiate with a safety run-in of 20 pts with a ≥ 5 pts failing to engraft (or having a Grade 4 or higher infection rate) within 18 days as the flag for a potential safety signal.

After all 20 of the patients in the safety run-in have completed follow-up for delayed engraftment (18 days), if the trial is not stopped for a safety signal, then the trial will proceed to a randomized stage. 50 patients will be randomized to placebo and 50 patients will be randomized to budesonide.

Patients in both arms will report toxicities by responding to items from the Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE.) PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement system used to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials based on symptom frequency, severity, interference, amount, and presence/absence. PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 (absent) to 4 (very frequent, severe, etc.), or 0/1 for absent/present.
