A Safety Evaluation of MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Treatment for Palliative Pain Control of Bone Metastases
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of subjects receiving MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment for painful bone metastases. This study will evaluate treatment response and clinically significant adverse events. Other relevant data may be documented as well.
