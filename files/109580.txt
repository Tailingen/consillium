Evaluation of a Patient 'nudge' on Engagement in Lung Cancer Screening
The purpose of this quality improvement project is to conduct and evaluate the effect of sending an electronic reminder message to patients who qualify for lung cancer screening, haven't had a screening previously, and who have an upcoming scheduled appointment with their doctor.

United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung cancer screening (LCS) guidelines recommend LCS for those aged 50-80 with at least 20 pack-years smoking history, who currently smoke or quit within the last 15 years. In 2023, our study team found that there are approximately 6,000 - 8,000 Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) members who are unscreened and eligible for lung cancer screening (LCS). In support of KP's Population Health priority initiative to expand lung cancer screening participation for those who are eligible, our study team was selected to move this work forward in 2024 with feasible implementation opportunities for the KPCO LCS Operational/Institute for Health Research partnership at its core. The primary objective of this project is to conduct and evaluate a randomized quality improvement pragmatic intervention of a 2-arm electronic message outreach to unscreened LCS members who are eligible for LCS and who have an upcoming scheduled Primary Care Provider (PCP) visit.
