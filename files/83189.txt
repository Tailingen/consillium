Subventricular Zone (SVZ) and Temozolomide in Glioblastoma Multiforme
In this study patients will be treated with 6 weeks of radiation therapy plus temozolomide chemotherapy according to the standard of care. However, the radiation treatment plan will be modified to deliver an higher than routine radiation dose to the subventricular zone which is an area of the brain that contains stem cells that some scientists believe may contribute to glioblastoma recurrence. The purpose of the study is to see if the tumor is controlled for a longer period of time in patients treated with this modified radiation technique than it is in patients treated with standard radiation therapy plus temozolomide chemotherapy.

There is pre-clinical data to suggest that neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone may play a role in glioblastoma recurrence. Retrospective studies in humans suggest potentially improved survival in patients who received high doses of radiation to the subventricular zone when compared with patients who received lower radiation doses to this area. The purpose of this study is to prospectively examine progression free survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with adjuvant temozolomide plus a radiation treatment plan which intentionally prescribes radiation dose to both the tumor and the subventricular zone compared to patients treated with standard radiation therapy. 3 patients out of every 4 will be treated with the modified study radiation treatment and 1 patient out of every 4 will received a more standard radiation treatment plan.
