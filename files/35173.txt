RLY-1971 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study of RLY-1971 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Unspecified, Adult
DRUG: RLY-1971
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as a dose level immediately below that at which â‰¥2 of 6 subjects experience a DLT during the first cycle., Escalation Phase - 18 month Enrollment|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D may be the same dose level or lower than the determined MTD., Escalation Phase - 18 month Enrollment
Plasma concentration levels of RLY-1971, Blood samples may be taken at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8hrs on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 15, 24 hrs post dose on Cycle 1 Day 2, and pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1, At the beginning of Cycle 1 & Cycle 2 (Each Cycle is 21 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Evaluation by RECIST 1.1; ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects in the response evaluable population who achieve the best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR, Through study completion (an average of one year)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of response evaluable subjects who achieve a BOR of CR, PR or SD for at least 3 months, Through study completion (an average of one year)
Changes in phospho-ERK levels, Blood will be collected at pre-dose at baseline on Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1) and at 3 time points (pre-dose, 2 hours post-dose, and 4 hours post-dose) on Cycle 1, Day 15 (C1D15) to assess the extent of target engagement, At the beginning of Cycle 1 Day 1 post and predose (Cycle = 21 days)|Tumor mutations by sequencing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), Blood will be collected at screening and at End of Treatment on all patients, At the beginning of Cycle 1 Day 1|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to RLY-1971, to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Through study completion (an average of one year)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Through study completion (an average of one year)
Dose escalation/dose expansion study to assess the MTD, safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RLY-1971. Approximately 70 patients
