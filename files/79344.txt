Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Patients With Pathological High-risk Bladder Cancer (GETUG-AFU 30)
This is a randomized multicentre study in patients with high-risk MIBC to investigate adjuvant radiotherapy after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection.

The objective of the study is to provide evidence that adjuvant radiotherapy improves loco-regional control with potential benefits in survival. The study will also evaluate the quality of life of patients and the tolerance of the treatment.

INDICATION:

Patients with pathological high-risk muscle invasive bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph nodes dissection

METHODOLOGY:

Multicenter randomised phase II study in high-risk bladder cancer patients treated by radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph nodes dissection assessing :

* Experimental Arm: adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy consisting of 28 x 1.8 Gy fractions (total dose of 50.4 Gy), 5 days per week, 1 fraction /day (duration of RT is 38 days).
* Standard Arm: surveillance. Eligible patients will be randomised, in a 3:1 ratio, to receive either: adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (Experimental Arm), or surveillance (Standard Arm).

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with high-risk bladder cancer after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph nodes dissection. Efficacy will be assessed in terms of pelvic recurrence-free survival (PRFS) at 3 years.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

For each treatment arm (adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy \[Experimental Arm\], or surveillance \[Standard Arm\]), these objectives will be evaluated independently.

* To evaluate 5-year pelvic recurrence-free survival (PRFS)
* To evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 5 years.
* To evaluate overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years.
* To evaluate metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 3 and 5 years.
* To evaluate disease-specific survival (DSS) at 3 and 5 years.
* To evaluate the tolerance and safety of each treatment strategy.
* To evaluate patients' quality of life.

Ancillary studies Objectives:

* Investigation of individual predisposition to develop radiotherapy induced late digestive toxicity using the radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) assay
* The analyse of genomic and transcriptome correlation between different clusters and oncological outcomes
* Dosimetric banking to evaluate the correlation of Dose-Volume Histogram with:
* Gastrointestinal toxicity grade ≥2;
* Pelvic recurrence (radiotherapy volumes, mapping of recurrences).
