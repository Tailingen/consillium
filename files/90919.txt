Circulating " Cancer Cells / Macrophage " HYbrid Cells in Patients With Sarcoma, Part 2
Pilot, prospective, monocentric study aimed at evaluating the rate of patients with circulating "cancer cell/macrophage" hybrid cells in the peripheral blood and the evolution of this rate over time.

The study will be conducted on a population of patients with leiomyosarcoma and treated in the context of routine care. 20 patients will be included:

* 10 patients with localized disease.
* 10 patients with metastatic disease.

For each included patient, blood samples will be collected during baseline visit and up to 24 months after inclusion.
Leiomyosarcoma
OTHER: Blood samples will be collected at different times.
The longitudinal evolution of rate of patients with "cancer cell / macrophage" hybrid cells in peripheral blood., 24 months after the end of inclusions.
Quantification of circulating hybrid cells in peripheral blood by automatic measurement (Cell Counter Corning) and expressed in number of cells / millilitre of blood., 24 months after the end of inclusions.
