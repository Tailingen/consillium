This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of JYP0015 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors harboring specific RAS mutations.

The study consists of two parts:

* Phase 1 (dose escalation) - Evaluates the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of JYP0015 monotherapy, preliminarily assesses efficacy, and determines the recommended dose (RD) for further evaluation.
* Phase 2 (indication expansion) - Explores the therapeutic potential of JYP0015 monotherapy at the RD across four predefined cohorts:

  1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
  2. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  3. Colorectal cancer (CRC)
  4. Other advanced solid tumors Phase 2 will assess both efficacy and safety within these cohorts.

JYP0015 is a potent, orally bioavailable pan-RAS inhibitor that selectively targets the active (ON) form of wild-type and mutant RAS across all three isoforms-HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS.
