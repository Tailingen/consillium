Robust Evaluation to Measure Improvements in Nonadherence From Low-cost Devices
The aim of this study is to determine whether adherence to oral maintenance medications differs for patients randomized to receive a RxTimerCap, a Take-N-Slide, a standard pillbox, or none of these devices, with the hypothesis that low-touch devices improve adherence over control and that the increase in adherence is agnostic across devices.

Optimal medication adherence to all cardiovascular or non-depression chronic disease medications, Optimal adherence to all cardiovascular or non-depression chronic disease medications, defined as a Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) equal to or greater than 80% and assessed using administrative pharmacy claims, 12 months
Optimal adherence to antidepressants, Optimal adherence to antidepressants among subjects whose only targeted therapy is an antidepressant, calculated using Medication Possession Ratios (MPR) and assessed using administrative pharmacy claims, 12 months|Optimal adherence to the targeted therapies in each randomization block independently, Optimal adherence to the targeted therapies in each of the randomization blocks independently, calculated using Medication Possession Ratios (MPR) and assessed using administrative pharmacy claims, 12 months|Optimal adherence to cardiovascular medications among subjects who are suboptimally adherent to these medications at time of randomization, Optimal adherence to cardiovascular medications among subjects who are suboptimally adherent to these medications at time of randomization, calculated using Medication Possession Ratios (MPR) and assessed using administrative pharmacy claims, 12 months
Prior to randomization, all patients meeting the inclusion criteria stratified into two strata and two blocks within each strata. The first stratum will consist of all patients on 1 to 3 medications for cardiovascular or other non-depression chronic conditions who are suboptimally adherent to these therapies. The second stratum will include all patients whose only targeted medications are for depression and who are suboptimally adherent to this therapy. Given that the Take-N-Slide device only has a Yes/No toggle for each day of the week and can therefore only be used once per day, each stratum will be further stratified into two separate blocks based on the frequency with which the study participants' medications are (or could possibly be) taken. Patients who are on a medication that is used more than once daily will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the RxTimerCap, pillbox, or to continue with usual care. Patients for whom all medications are dosed once daily will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the Take-N-Slide, RxTimerCap, pillbox, or to continue with usual care.
