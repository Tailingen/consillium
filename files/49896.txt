A Novel CAR-T Combined Expression of IL-15 in the Treatment of Malignant Hematological Tumors
The is a multicenter, single arm, open label clinical study on the novel CAR-T combined expression of IL-15 in the treatment of malignant hematological tumors.Plan to recruit 45 subjects with malignant hematological tumors.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin|Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: chimeric antigen receptor gene modified T cells
monitor the survival time of CAR-T in vivo, The survival of CAR-T in vivo will be monitored periodically by flow cytometry after CAR T reinfusion., 6 months|Record antitumor effects after reinfusion of CAR-T, Determine partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) for subjects with active disease. In view of the small number of subjects, remission should be recorded in detail; For subjects treated with minimal residual lesion (MRD), MRD clearance results were recorded., 28 days
Disease-free survival, DFS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death, progression of the disease, relapse or gene recurrence, whichever came first, or last visit., 3 years|Overall Survival, OS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up, 3 years
The copy number of CAR-T cells, The copy number of CAR-T cells amplified in peripheral blood after administration, 12 months
The main objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel CAR-T therapy that co expresses IL-15 in malignant hematological tumors.

The secondary objective is to investigate the in vivo survival time of the novel CAR-T co expressing IL-15 and the activation and proliferation of a novel CAR-T co expressing IL-15 in vivo.
