Study to Investigate the Efficacy of Panitumumab in Platinum-resistant Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cancer
Phase II, multicenter, open labelled, uncontrolled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of panitumumab in patients affected by Head and Neck cancer after at least one cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. A translational research study is also planned to evaluate Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (EGFR) status by FISH, KRAS, B-RAF, HRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA mutation by DNA sequencing, PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) genotyping by reverse hybridization.

Panitumumab is administered iv on days 1 and 15 of a 28 days cycle, until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, or patient's refusal
Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab
Rate of tumor response in advanced platinum-resistant head and neck cancer, To evaluate rate of radiological tumor response in advanced platinum-resistant head and neck cancer, Radiological tumor evaluation every 8 weeks, minimum 12 weeks
Adverse Event according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3, To collect all adverse event occurred during the treatment, Collection of adverse event for at least the first 8 weeks|Analysis of tumor biomarkers, To identify the tumor biomarkers that can best predict response to panitumumab, 28 days (1 cycle)
