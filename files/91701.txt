A Study of IMP4297 as Maintenance Treatment Following First-line Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
IMP4297 is a PARP inhibitor. This is a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with advanced (FIGO Stage III or IV) ovarian cancer to evaluate Efficacy and Safety of IMP4297 for Maintenance Treatment
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: IMP4927|DRUG: Placebos
PFS, BICR-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), Approximately 42 months since the first subject enrolled
CFI, chemotherapy- free interval assessed by Investigators, Approximately 42 months since the first subject enrolled|PFS2, progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) assessed by Investigators, Approximately 42 months since the first subject enrolled|TFST, Time to first subsequent anti-tumor treatment (TFST), Approximately 42 months since the first subject enrolled|TDT, time from randomization to study treatment discontinuation or death (TDT), Approximately 42 months since the first subject enrolled|os, the time from the date of randomization to the date of death caused by any reason, Approximately 42 months since the first subject enrolled
A Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of IMP4297 Following First-Line Platinum-based Chemotherapy in the Monotherapy Maintenance Treatment of Subjects with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage III-IV Ovarian Cancer. Subjects with newly diagnosed III/IV high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) or other histological types of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer carrying breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation who have had a complete/partial response (CR/PR) after first-line platinum-based therapy will be randomly assigned to IMP4297 or placebo at a 2:1 ratio.
