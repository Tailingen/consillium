EUS-guided CDS vs ERCP as First Line in Malignant Distal Obstruction in Borderline Disease (CARPEDIEM-2 Trial)
The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate temporal delay (days) between biliary drainage (EUS-CDS vs ERCP as first line therapy) and chemotherapy start in patients with borderline distal malignant biliary obstruction.
Malignant Biliary Obstruction|Pancreatic Cancer|Biliary Tract Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic biliary drainage|DEVICE: Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS)|DEVICE: Lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) and double-pigtail plastic stent (DPPS)
Delay in days between endoscopic biliary drainage and chemotherapy treatment start, Number of days between intervention (T1-biliary drainage) and chemotherapy treatment start., 1 day to 12 months
Technical success, ERCP group: cannulation, cholangiogram, correct deployment of SEMS, day 0|Clinical success, In jaundice: decreasing \> 50% of bilirrubin or normalization of bilirrubin levels 14 days after endoscopic procedure., 14 days after BD|AE - biliary drainage, Adverse events rate related to biliary drainage according to the AGREE classification, 0 to 30 days after BD|AE - surgery, Adverse events rate related to surgery according to the Claiven and Dindo classification., 0 to 90 days after surgery|Delay in days between endoscopic biliary drainage and cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP), Number of days between intervention (T1-biliary drainage) and surgery, 6 to 12 months
Ecoendoscopy-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS) has been extended as a second line treatment in cases of ERCP failure in malignant distal biliary obstruction (MDBO). However, there are clinical trials which have compared it with ERCP as a first line treatment for MDBO in palliative patients, showing similar clinical and technical success and adverse events (AEs) rate between both techniques. Data about the benefit of this techique in borderline patients is still limited.

A recent retrospective study (Janet J et al, Ann Surg Oncol 2023) which included borderline patients, found that EUS-CDS group had significantly less delay (days) between biliary drainage and neoadjuvant chemotherapy start than the ERCP group with fewer endoscopy and surgery AEs.

Thus, our hypothesis is that EUS-CDS has benefits in terms of decreasing delay between biliary drainage and neoadjuvant chemotherapy start when compared to ERCP in MDBO in borderline patients.
