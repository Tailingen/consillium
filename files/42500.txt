Risk Adapted De-Intensification of Radio-Chemotherapy for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study builds on the results of several prior studies that we have been involved with to test the hypothesis that Risk-Adapted De-Intensification of Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy based on HPV subtype, plasma circulating free HPV DNA (cfHPV DNA) level, and cfHPV DNA clearance rate produces Local-Regional Control rates that are similar to what has been achieved with more aggressive therapy in patients with Favorable Prognosis Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC).
Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: Cisplatin
Local-Regional Control Rate, Determine the Local-Regional Control Rate, defined as the absence of recurrence of OPSCC at the primary site or in a neck node that was included in a radiation therapy target volume, 2 years
Local Control Rate, Determine the local control rate, defined as as the absence of recurrence of OPSCC at the primary site, 2 years|Regional Control Rate, Determine the regional control rate, defined as the absence of recurrence in a neck node, 2 years|Disease-Free Survival, Determine the disease-free survival, defined as the time from the first day of radiation to the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant), 2 years|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival, Determine the distant metastasis-free survival, defined as the time from the first day of radiation to the date distant metastases are confirmed, 2 years|Overall Survival, Determine the overall survival, defined as the time from the first day of radiation to the date of death, 2 years|Participant Quality of Life, Assess participant quality of life using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) instrument. The EORTC QLQ-C30 measures ability to perform everyday activities and whether the subject has experienced select physical symptoms on a scale of 1-4 (with 1 meaning "Not at all" and 4 meaning "Very much"), as well as overall quality of life and overall health over the past week on a scale from 1-7 (with 1 meaning "Very Poor" and 7 meaning "Excellent"). For questions measuring ability to perform everyday activities, overall quality of life, and overall health, a higher score means better functioning, quality of life or overall health. For questions related to symptoms, a higher score means that the subject has experienced that symptom more., 2 years|Swallowing Ability, Assess participant swallowing ability using the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) instrument. The EAT-10 instrument asks subjects to rate the extent to which ten scenarios related to swallowing are problematic for them on a scale of 0-4, where a score of 0 means "No Problem" and a score of 4 means "Severe Problem"., 2 years|Swallowing Ability, Assess participant swallowing ability using the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) instrument. The MDADI asks participants if they strongly agree, agree, have no opinion, disagree, or strongly disagree with twenty statements related to swallowing. Each response is given a score of 1 to 5 points and all the scores are summed to produce a composite score ranging from 20 to 100, where a higher score means better functioning related to swallowing., 2 years
