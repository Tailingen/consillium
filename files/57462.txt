4SC-201 (Resminostat) in Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 4SC-201 (Resminostat) in combination with FOLFIRI and whether 4SC-201 (Resminostat) is effective and safe in combination FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma.
