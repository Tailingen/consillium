Dose-finding Study of Empegfilgrastim for Neutropenia Prophylaxis in Patients With Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to compare safety and efficacy of a single dose of empegfilgrastimt a dose of 3 or 6 mg versus daily administration of filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg/day.

BCD-017-2 is an open-label randomized phase II clinical study to compare the incidence of CTCAE grade 3/4 neutropenia after a single administration of recombinant human pegylated filgrastim empegfilgrastim (Extimia®) at a dose of 3 or 6 mg versus daily administration of filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg/day for neutropenia prophylaxis in breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
