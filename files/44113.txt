Longitudinal Advanced Prostate Cancer Cohort (LAPCC)
This study examines information from patients with prostate cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). By collecting biological samples (like blood, urine, and tissue), and health information (such as treatment, diet, and quality of life) researchers hope to learn more about prostate cancer and ways to improve outcomes in the future.
