Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy Using 18F-FLT PET/CT
In the current study, advanced positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging methods will be used to validate the hypothesis that participants receiving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, who ultimately achieve clinical benefit, will show an increase, or "FLARE", in tumor FLT and/or FDG uptake from baseline, as seen after cycle#1 of treatment, and that after 2 cycles of treatment responders will have a decline in FLT and FDG uptake, in comparison to the participants classified as "non-responders".

Change in FLT uptake, * Participants will be designated as responders or non-responders based on follow-up RECIST 1.1 measurements
* Changes in FLT uptake will be compared between the two groups, Between pre-treatment PET/CT imaging and end of cycle 1 PET/CT imaging (estimated to be 1 month)|Change in FLT uptake, * Participants will be designated as responders or non-responders based on follow-up RECIST 1.1 measurements
* Changes in FLT uptake will be compared between the two groups, Between pre-treatment PET/CT imaging and end of cycle 2 PET/CT imaging (estimated to be 2 months)
Change in FDG uptake, * Participants will be designated as responders or non-responders based on follow-up RECIST 1.1 measurements
* Changes in FDG uptake will be compared between the two groups, Between pre-treatment PET/CT imaging and end of cycle 1 PET/CT imaging (estimated to be 1 month)|Change in FDG uptake, * Participants will be designated as responders or non-responders based on follow-up RECIST 1.1 measurements
* Changes in FDG uptake will be compared between the two groups, Between pre-treatment PET/CT imaging and end of cycle 2 PET/CT imaging (estimated to be 2 months)|Change in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI), From baseline to the end of second cycle of treatment (estimated to be 2 months)
