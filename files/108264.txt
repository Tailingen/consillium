Modified Versus Traditional Thoracic Drainage After Thoracoscopic Surgery
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Thoracoscopic pulmonary resection is a prevalent management for early stage of lung cancer. Placement of traditional chest tube is the standard procedure after surgery, which causes pain that cannot be ignored. We aimed to determine whether a modified thoracic drainage strategy based on pigtail catheter associated with better clinical results compared with traditional methods after thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer.

PROCEDURE: pigtail catheter
Chest tube drainage duration, The number of days from operation day to the day of chest tube removal, From date of operation until the date of chest tube removal, assessed up to 7 days|Volume of drainage, Total volume of thoracic drainage (ml), From date of operation until the date of removal of the chest tube and pigtail catheter, assessed up to 7 days.
Postoperative hospital stay, The numbers of days of patients stay in the hospital after surgery, From date of operation until the date of hospital discharge, assessed up to 30 days.
Postoperative pain scores, Postoperative pain is evaluated by pain scores (0 \[No pain\] to 10 \[Pain as bad as you can endure\]), Postoperative day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
