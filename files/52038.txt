Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response (rate) will be expressed as the percentage of patients with Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR). Per RECIST v1.1, Complete Response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD;Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable Disease is neither \>30% shrinkage nor \>20% growth of tumor., Up to 26 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Combined Study Population, Objective Response (rate) will be expressed as the percentage of patients with Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR).

Pixatimod is an investigational drug that activates the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway and is being evaluated in studies involving melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.

Cyclophosphamide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, chronic granulocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, mycosis fungoides, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian cancer, retinoblastoma. Low-dose (immunomodulatory) cyclophosphamide is being studied in combination with various types of immunotherapy including nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

This Phase llA trial hypothesizes that the nivolumab/pixatimod combination in PD-1 relapsed/refractory (R/R) cutaneous melanoma and NSCLC patients will be associated with anti-tumor effects, and that the nivolumab/pixatimod/cyclophosphamide combination in MSS mCRC patients will be associated with anti-tumor effect.

In the 1st stage, 13 patients will be enrolled in cohort 1 while 9 patients each will be enrolled in cohorts 2 and 3. Should the pre-specified efficacy boundary met, further patients will be enrolled to one or more cohorts in 2nd stage. The total enrollment for 1st stage across all 3 cohorts is 31 response-evaluable patients. The total enrollment for both stages across all 3 cohorts is 61 response-evaluable patients.
