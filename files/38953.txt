Study Evaluating HKI-272 (Neratinib) In Subjects With Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn whether neratinib is safe and effective in treating women with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms|Neoplasms
DRUG: neratinib
16-week Progression Free Survival, 16 week progression-free survival (PFS) rate of neratinib in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer, either with prior trastuzumab or no prior trastuzumab therapy, evaluated by independent assessment of tumor scans collected at baseline and then every 8 weeks., From first dose to 16 weeks
Objective Response Rate, Percentage of participants with Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) by independent assessment of tumor per Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From first dose date to progression or last tumor assessment, up to 46 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, Percentage of participants who experienced Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) â‰¥ 24 weeks by independent assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., From first dose date to progression or last tumor assessment, up to 46 months|Duration of Response, Number of weeks between Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) and the first date of disease progression (PD) or death per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, From start date of response to first PD/death, up to 46 months
Arm A: HER2 gene amplification and disease progression following at least 6 weeks of standard doses of Herceptin; Arm B: HER2 gene amplification and no prior Herceptin or HER2-targeted treatment.
