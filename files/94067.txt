Tissue and Functional Assessment of Myocardial Injury in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) Survivors
This study will test whether cardiac MRI can improve early detection of Hodgkin lymphoma associated heart disease compared to a stress echocardiogram. By doing both stress echocardiography and cardiac MRI, we will compare the ability of the two tests to detect heart disease.
