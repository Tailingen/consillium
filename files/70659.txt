A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Venetoclax on Participants Receiving a Covalent Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (cBTKi) for First-line Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (1L CLL) to Achieve Deep Durable Remissions to Allow Off-treatment Period.
The main purpose of the study is to evaluate if adding venetoclax to participants receiving cBTKi for the 1L CLL can achieve deep durable remissions of undetectable measurable residual disease \[uMRD \< or 10\^-4 in peripheral blood (PB)\] by end of combination treatment (EOCT) to allow off-treatment period.

The acronym BRAVE stands for Btki Responders to Achieve deep remission (or off-treatment periods) with VEnetoclax.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: cBTKi Monotherapy
Undetected Minimal Residual Disease at 10^-4 (uMRD4) PB Rates at EOCT, uMRD4 will be assessed using next generation sequencing (NGS) (sensitivity 10\^-4) from PB., Cycle 12 Day 28 (Cycle length= 28 Days)
CR/CRi Rate at EOCT as Determined by the Investigator According to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Guidelines, Complete response (CR) / complete response with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi) rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a CR or CRi, as determined by the investigator according to the iwCLL., Up to approximately 12 months|Partial Response (PR) Rate at EOCT as Determined by the Investigator According to iwCLL Guidelines, PR rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a PR, as determined by the investigator according to the iwCLL., Up to approximately 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) at EOCT as Determined by the Investigator According to iwCLL Guidelines, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a CR/CRi or PR, as determined by the investigator according to the iwCLL., Up to approximately 12 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse events including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and SAEs will be collected as part of this study at baseline and every clinical visit, until 30 days after the final dose of study treatment., Up to approximately 24 months|Number of Participants Who Withdrew Prematurely from the Study, Up to approximately 24 months
