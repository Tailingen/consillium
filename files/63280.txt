Evaluation Contact X-ray Brachytherapy for Rectal Preservation in Intermediate Substage Rectal Adenocarcinoma
Indication : Adult patients with intermediate low or mid rectal adenocarcinoma to be treated with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) potentially eligible for rectal preservation.

Primary objective is to assess efficacy of contact X-ray brachytherapy (CXB) in addition to TNT in order to increase survival with organ preservation (OP), in selected intermediate risk group of rectal adenocarcinomas (size from 3.5 to 6 cm, cT2N1 or T3N0-1, M0).
Adult With Intermediate Low or Mid Rectal Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: contact X-ray brachytherapy (CXB)
Survival with organ preservation, defined as a rectum intact, owing to:

* no radical TME,
* no locoregional regrowth unless amenable to limited curative (R0) salvage surgery by local excision (LE), and no permanent stoma (including a never reversed protective stoma, or a stoma owing to toxicities and/or poor functional outcomes)., at the end of the study,15 months after the first inclusion
It is an open label phase III randomized controlled clinical trial comparing 2 arms:

* Control arm A consists in TNT regimen, with an induction chemotherapy Modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) 6 cycles over 12 weeks, followed by nCRT 50 Gy over 5 weeks with concomitant capecitabine (CAP50 Gy).
* Experimental arm B consists in addition of three fractions of CXB every two weeks between end of mFOLFIRINOX and nCRT.

Clinical, endoscopic and radiological evaluation will be performed 7 weeks after the end of nCRT in both arms:

* In case of cCR, local excision or surveillance will be proposed to patients regarding center choice
* In the absence of cCR patients will be treated by TME, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (mFOLFOX 6 cycles or capecitabine 3 cycles over 12 weeks).
