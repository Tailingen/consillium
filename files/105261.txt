Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd, DS-1062a) in Advanced and/or Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DS-1062a in participants with metastatic, unresectable NSCLC having progressed on one, but not more than three previous standard therapies. Moreover, the immune effects, the predictors of resistance and response to treatment, the effect of the chemotherapy on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication will be assessed and will help identify the subgroups that will mostly benefit from the treatment. The pharmacokinetics of the product and the anti-drug antibody (ADA) will be also evaluated.

A total of 100 participants are planned to be included in the study. Participants will receive, every three weeks, a dose of DS-1062a equivalent to 6 mg/kg of body weight until progression or until unacceptable toxicity.

Tumor evaluation will be performed every six weeks by the mean of a computed tomography for the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (TAP CT-scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain and/or bone CT scans will be also performed throughout the study for participants with brain and/or bone metastasis.

The safety of the product will be assessed, through complete clinical exams, biological tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), cardiac echographies (ECHOs) and through the collection of ongoing toxicities or adverse events.

DRUG: DS-1062a
Evaluation of objective response rate (ORR) based on investigator assessment, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed on treatment and assessed by investigators, During treatment period, an average of 4 months
Evaluation of duration of response (DoR), Defined as the time from the first documented CR or PR until the date of disease progression, or until the date of death, From cycle 2 (Week 3) up to 3 years after the EoT, an average of 39 months]|Evaluation of progression free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time date of the first dose until progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From cycle 2 (Week 3) up to 3 years after the EoT, an average of 39 months]|Evaluation of clinical benefit ratio (CBR), Defined as the presence of at least a PR or CR, or a stable disease (SD) for more than six months under treatment, From cycle 2 (Week 3) up to 3 years after the EoT, an average of 39 months]|To evaluate incidence of adverse events (AEs), All adverse events (AEs), treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), During treatment (at each cycle), at EoT and up to 35 days after EoT, an average of 5 months]|To evaluate proportion of treatment modification, Treatment discontinuation, interruptions and dose reductions, During treatment, an average of 4 months|Incidence of abnormal laboratory test results, During treatment (at each cycle) and at EoT, an average of 4 months|To evaluate incidence of abnormal ECG readings, During treatment (at each cycle) and at EoT, an average of 4 months|To evaluate change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), During treatment and at EoT, an average of 4 months|To assess changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status [ECOG PS] based on a score from 1 to 5, where higher scores mean worse outcomes, During treatment (at each cycle) and at EoT, an average of 4 months
To assess physical functioning sub-scale score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) based on a scale from 1 to 4, where higher scores mean worse outcome, During treatment (Cycles 1, 2, 3 and then every 2 cycles), at EoT and then up to 3 years after EoT, an average of 40 months]|To assess global health sub-scale score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) based on a scale from 1 to 7, where higher scores mean better outcome, During treatment (Cycles 1, 2, 3 and then every 2 cycles), at EoT and up to 3 years after EoT, an average of 40 months]
