This trial is divided into two parts. Part 1 (combination therapy group) consists of Stage 1 (dose escalation) and Stage 2 (proof of conception study), in which Stage 2 adopts a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter design; Part 2 (monotherapy group) is SYS6002 monotherapy, divided into two cohorts with different dose groups. After completing the dose escalation of Part 1 (combination therapy group), and combining with the efficacy and safety data of SYS6002 monotherapy in Part 2 of this study and other clinical studies in participants with â‰¥2L HNSCC, the decision to enter Stage 2 in Part I (combination therapy group) will be made by discussion between the sponsor and the investigator.
