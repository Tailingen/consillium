A Study of Continued Treatment Among Participants Who Have Responded to Peginterferon Alfa-2a (Pegasys®) or Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2a (Roferon-A®) in Prior Clinical Studies
This open label extension study will give an opportunity to the participants that have responded to the treatment with Pegylated-Interferon Alfa-2a (Pegasys) or Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2a (Roferon-A®) in prior clinical studies NO15753 (NCT00003542) for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), NO15764 (NCT number not available) and NO16006 (NCT02736721) for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), and NO16007 (NCT number not available) for Malignant Melanoma (MM).
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Malignant Melanoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a|DRUG: Recombinant Interferon Alfa 2a
Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship to the study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; Life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); Persistent or significant disability or incapacity; and congenital anomaly., Baseline up to approximately 3 years
Number of Participants With Overall Tumor Response, Tumor response was assessed every 6 months using hematological evaluation or any other appropriate diagnostic techniques, as per standard of care practice. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) status were recorded from case report form., Baseline until disease progression, withdrawal or death, whichever occurred earlier (assessed every 6 months up to approximately 3 years)
