Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of KPG-818 in Hematological Malignancies Subjects
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of KPG-818 in subjects with hematological malignancies. Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled for dose escalation of 4 dose levels.

Indication: Hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma \[MM\], mantle cell lymphoma \[MCL\], diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \[DLBCL\], adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma \[ATL\], and indolent non Hodgkin lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma \[FL\] and chronic lymphocytic leukemia \[CLL\]/small lymphocytic lymphoma \[SLL\]).

This will be a dose escalation study in subjects with selected hematological malignancies. KPG-818 will be used in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with MM, and as monotherapy for other selected hematological malignancies. Each dose of KPG-818 will be administered orally until the completion of treatment cycles, or progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, the subject withdraws, or any other study withdrawal criterion is met.

The highest dose level which may be tested is 5 mg KPG-818 and dose levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 mg and/or intermediate dosing or alternative dosing schedule may be explored. Each dose level (1-4) will be tested using the standard 3+3 design. DLT will be assessed during the DLT evaluation period (Cycle 1) and the treatment of study is divided into 6 cycles.
