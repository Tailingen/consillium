Efficacy and Tolerability of Suprep With and Without Simethicone for Routine Colonoscopy for Colorectal Cancer Screening
The purpose of this study is to investigate Suprep bowel preparation, with and without the anti-gas medication simethicone, in terms of efficacy and patient tolerability in the preparation of patients undergoing routine colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Simethicone|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate solution
Overall bowel cleansing, To be assessed during removal of the colonoscope during the procedure and blinded endoscopist will score using a written questionnaire, During procedure
Number of patients with adverse effects, A written patient questionnaire will be used to assess patient acceptability and tolerability by recording any adverse effects experienced, including nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, bloating, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal cramps or any others., Day prior to and day of colonoscopy|Number of patients completing the bowel preparation, A written patient questionnaire will be used to assess compliance by asking if the total prescribed volume of solution was ingested and by recording number of evacuations., Day prior to and day of colonoscopy
Presence of bubbles, To be assessed during removal of the colonoscope during the procedure and blinded endoscopist will score using a written questionnaire, During procedure|Degree of haziness, To be assessed during removal of the colonoscope during the procedure and blinded endoscopist will score using a written questionnaire, During procedure
The study will investigate sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate (Suprep), with and without simethicone, in terms of efficacy and patient tolerability in the preparation of patients undergoing routine colonoscopy. Adult ambulatory outpatients who are scheduled for elective routine colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening will be recruited to participate in the trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either simethicone or placebo in addition to oral sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate solution (Suprep) and will receive verbal and written instruction on administration of solutions. During colonoscopy, three areas of the colon (right colon, transverse colon, and left colon) will be assessed during removal of the colonoscope for overall colon cleansing, presence of bubbles, and degree of haziness; this will be scored by a blinded endoscopist. A separate written patient questionnaire will be used to assess acceptability and tolerability of the preparation, as well as any adverse events.
