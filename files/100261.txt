Evaluating a Nonessential Amino Acid Restriction (NEAAR) Medical Food With Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (LARC)
This clinical study aims to assess feasibility, safety, tolerability, and compliance of a Nonessential Amino Acid Restriction (NEAAR) medical food in adult patients with locally advanced rectal cancer during standard of care short course radiotherapy followed by standard of care chemotherapy.
