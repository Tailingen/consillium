Surufatinib Combined With Tislelizumab in Advanced Lung Cancer With Neuroendocrine Differentiation
Currently, there are no standard treatment and relevant exploration for NSCLC patients with NED. The study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of surufatinib combined with tislelizumab in the treatment of NSCLC with NED, in order to provide a new treatment option for NSCLC patients with NED.
NSCLC
DRUG: Surufatinib|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), time from first-dose to the first documented disease progression or death, approximately 1 years
Objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response, using RESIST v1.1, approximately 1 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), the proportion of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease, using RESIST v1.1, approximately 1 years
This is a single-arm, open, single-center, prospective and exploratory clinical study. We planned to enroll 29 patients who would receive surufatinib plus tislelizumab until disease progression, intolerance, or withdrawal of consent. The study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of surufatinib combined with tislelizumab in the treatment of NSCLC with NED, in order to provide a new treatment option for NSCLC patients with NED.
