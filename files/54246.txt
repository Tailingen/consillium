A Phase 3 Study for the Efficacy and Safety of Radotinib in CP-CML Patients With Failure or Intolerance to Previous TKIs
In a multinational, multicenter, single-arm, open-label and Phase III Radotinib clinical study, chronic phase Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia patients with failure or intolerance to previous TKIs therapy including Imatinib will be recruited. In this phase 3 study, 173 subjects are expected to be enrolled in a single arm with the administration of Radotinib 400mg twice daily, which includes 10% of dropout rate.

DRUG: Radotinib HCl
Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR), MCyR is defined as 0\~35% CCyR+PCyR based on ≥20 metaphase myelocytes. Chromosome test results from \<20 metaphase myelocytes will be excluded from the analysis., at month 6
Cytogenetic Response (CCyR), CCyR is defined as complete loss of Ph chromosome based on ≥20 metaphase myelocytes. Chromosome test results from \<20 metaphase myelocytes will be excluded from the analysis., at month 12/24, by month 24|Major molecular response, MMR is defined as a ≥3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript level from the standardized reference or BCR-ABL1/ABL % of ≤0.1% according to the international reference when the level of BCR-ABL1 gene was measured by RQ-PCR, a standardized quantitative genetic method., at month 12/24, by month 24|Overall Survival(OS), OS is defined as the duration from the first day of Radotinib administration to the day of death for certain causes., by month 24|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the first day of Radotinib administration to the earliest day of disease progression or death for certain causes., by month 24
BCR-ABL1 point mutation, Incidence rate of BCR-ABL1 point mutations that are newly found during the course of radotinib treatment, up to month 24|correlation between the concentration of radotinib in blood and the response (efficacy and safety), To measure the concentration of radotinib in blood, up to month 24|Incidence of Radotinib-Adverse Events, Toxicities will be evaluated in all subjects treated with radotinib., up to month 24
