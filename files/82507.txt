Neoadjuvant TDM1 With Lapatinib and Abraxane Compared With Trastuzumab Plus Pertuzumab With Paclitaxel
This is a randomized, open label Phase II neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) plus lapatinib (L)followed by abraxane (A) versus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab followed by paclitaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

Pathological Complete Response (pCR) RCB-0 or RCB-1, To evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast after treatment with Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Lapatinib follow by Abraxane in women with HER2 Neu over-expressed breast cancer patients per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.", or similar definition that is accurate and appropriate.

Residual cancer burden (RCB)-0 was synonymous with pCR, indicating no residual disease present., From date of randomization until the date of surgery, approximately 16 weeks
Breast Imaging Response to Treatment: Number of Eventual Responders in Standard Arm, To determine the change in tumor size by MRI at 6 weeks post treatment using RECIST v1.0. Criteria. Since all patients in the experimental arm achieved RCB-0 or RCB-1 (pCR), changes in tumor size by MRI were only evaluated in patients on the standard arm., From date of randomization until 6 weeks post treatment
Determine Predictive Markers, To determine predictive markers for sensitivity and resistance to Trastuzumab Emtansine when combined with Lapatinib follow by Abraxane, approximately 1 year
This is a randomized, open label Phase II neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) plus lapatinib (L) followed by abraxane (A) versus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab followed by paclitaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms: arm 1, trastuzumab emtansine plus lapatinib for 6 weeks, followed by trastuzumab emtansine plus lapatinib plus abraxane for 12 weeks; arm 2, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab for six weeks, followed by trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus paclitaxel for 12 weeks. Patients will undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. All patients will have a core needle biopsy at baseline, after week 6, and at the time of disease progression. Surgical specimens will be obtained after week 18.
