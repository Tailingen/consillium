TOxicity After Radiotherapy in breAst CancEr Survivors (ThORACeS) - A Retrospective Cohort Study
Rationale:

The number of breast cancer (BC) patients at risk for long-term radiation-induced health problems is increasing, as their outcome is improving due to intensified treatment regimens, such as new systemic approaches and radiotherapy. Therefore, identifying BC survivors with the highest risk for radiation-induced health problems is crucial for developing strategies for primary and secondary prevention, which may contribute to healthy ageing.
Breast Cancer
