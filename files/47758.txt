Pediatric Prospective Personalized Immune and Target Identification Trial
PPROSPERITIT is a prospective clinical study assessing the use of comprehensive molecular profiling to define the best matching targeted and immune treatment for relapsed, refractory or very high risk pediatric CNS tumors.
Central Nervous System Neoplasms|Pediatric Cancer|GEN1 Gene Mutation|Tumor, Brain
DEVICE: FoundationOneHeme
The proportion of patients in which F1Heme molecular testing identified at least 1 clinically relevant alteration at the time of MTB decision., Evaluation of the feasibility of FoundationOneHeme, Diagnostic assessment is done within 28 days from enrolment patient in the study.
PPROSPERITIT will identify specific molecular changes by using genomic sequencing technologies in refractory/recurrent or very high-risk pediatric CNS tumors. The study will employ an analytically validated comparison of a selection of targeted agents/immune therapies on the basis of commercially available comprehensive genomic profiling FoundationOneHeme panel (F1Heme, comprising DNA and RNA analysis) vs selection of agents based on more complex DNA/RNA/Protein based analyses. This will be coupled to a computer algorithm that uses preexisting definitions and prioritization of target-agent pairs to assign patients by actionable mutation results to a targeted treatment. The selection of targeted agents will be performed by a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board, but the recommended treatment will not be a part of the PPROSPERTIT study.
