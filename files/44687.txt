Treatment Patterns and Outcomes Study in Patients With Unresectable Stage III and Metastatic (Stage IV) Melanoma in the United States
This study will collect real-world data from advanced melanoma diagnosis through most recent visit and data sourced from patient medical records following a 2-part study design consisting of a random sample (Part 1) and an oversample (Part 2).
