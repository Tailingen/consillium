Early Detection and Risk Stratification of Colorectal Cancer Based on miRNA Platform
This is a prospective, observational cohort study to establish the minimal residual disease (MRD) model for predicting relapse risk and identifying disease recurrence in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma based on the miRNA platform.

Blood miRNA markers will be evaluated. The study will enroll approximately 600 participants, including participants with malignancies or benign diseases, and healthy participants.
