Metronomic Chemotherapy in Wilms Tumor (MetroWilms-1906)
This is a multicenter, interventional, non-randomized study among patients with a relapsed or refractory Wilms tumor. The study will aim to assess efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy, in terms of disease control after two cycles of metronomic chemotherapy.
Wilms Tumor
DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cis-Retinoic acid
Disease control, Complete response, partial response or stable disease after 2 cycles of treatment, measured by the progression-free survival (PFS)., 6 months after inclusion
Progression-free survival, The time interval between study entry and date of progression (using RECIST 1.1), Up to progression, an average of 1 year|Overall survival, The time interval between study entry and death from any cause, Through study completion, an average of 12 months|Tumor response, Using CT-scan or MRI imaging (using RECIST 1.1), Immediately after each cycle of treatment, up to progression, an average of 1 year|Adverse events, The adverse events (AE) are collected to evaluate the safety of the study treatment., Through study completion, an average of 12 months (plus 30 days)|The feasibility of evaluated therapy, assessed in terms of frequency of dose reductions or temporary stops of treatment, Through study completion, an average of 12 months|Quality of life of the patient (KindL), Ravens-Sieberer and Bullinger Quality of Life Questionnaire will be used to measure the quality of life of the patients. The score can go from 0 to 100, and the higher score corresponds to a higher health-related quality of life, Baseline, week 7 and week 13
The main aim of this study is to assess efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy, in terms of disease control after two cycles of metronomic chemotherapy .

Other objectives of the study include:

* To evaluate disease control obtained with metronomic chemotherapy, in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
* Evaluating early response after one cycle of treatment of metronomic treatment;
* Evaluating best tumor response over the whole metronomic treatment duration;
* Evaluating safety of the proposed metronomic chemotherapy;
* Evaluating the feasibility of the proposed metronomic chemotherapy.
* To evaluate quality of life using KindlÂ® Quality of Life questionnaire at baseline (before start of treatment), and approximately at weeks 7 and 13 of treatment
