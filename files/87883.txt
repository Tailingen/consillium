Oral Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor 4SC-202 in Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies (TOPAS)
The purpose of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose, Dose Limiting Toxicities and optimal dosing schedule of 4SC-202 investigating its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics.
Advanced Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: 4SC-202
Determination of Dose Limiting Toxicities of 4SC-202, 6 weeks|Determination of Safety of 4SC-202, The safety and tolerability will be determined by occurrence of adverse events (AEs), vital signs (VS) \[body temperature, weight, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate\], electrocardiogram (ECG), performance status and clinical laboratory parameters., 6 weeks|Determination of Pharmacokinetic Profile of 4SC-202, The plasma concentrations of 4SC-202 will be determined at the following time-points:

Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-dose, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 8 h, 24 h p.a. Cycle 1 Day 5: Pre-dose, 0.5 h, 1h, 2h Cycle 1 Day 14: Pre-dose, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 8 h, 24 h p.a. Cycle 2 Day 1: Pre-dose, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 8 h, 24 h p.a. using AUC0-infinity, AUClast, Cmax, tmax, t1/2, CL/F, 3 weeks|Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose of 4SC-202, 6 weeks|Determination of Tolerability of 4SC-202, The safety and tolerability will be determined by occurrence of adverse events (AEs), vital signs (VS) \[body temperature, weight, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate\], electrocardiogram (ECG), performance status and clinical laboratory parameters., 6 weeks
Assessment of potential anticancer activity of 4SC-202, The assessment will be performed by assessment of tumor response, duration of response and progression free survival, 6 weeks|Histone deacetylase (HADAC) inhibition in peripheral mononuclear cells, 6 weeks|Histone acetylation in peripheral mononuclear cells, 6 weeks|Gene expression analysis in peripheral blood, 6 weeks|Cytokine and miRNA levels in plasma, 6 weeks
