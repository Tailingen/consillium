Establishing a Longitudinal Cohort Study of Lung Cancer Using Tissue and Peripheral Blood Metabolomics.
This study will utilize tissue and peripheral blood samples for metabolomics analysis and establish a longitudinal metabolomics cohort at multiple critical treatment time points to comprehensively investigate the role of metabolomics in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of lung cancer. By profiling metabolic alterations, this study aims to identify potential biomarkers for distinguishing benign and malignant lung nodules, predicting therapeutic efficacy, and assessing long-term prognosis. Key time points include initial screening for lung nodules, postoperative evaluation to predict treatment outcomes, and therapeutic monitoring to assess efficacy after medication or other interventions. Through these analyses, the study seeks to uncover underlying metabolic mechanisms and provide valuable insights into personalized lung cancer management.

Area Under the Curve, AUC, or Area Under the Curve, is a commonly used metric in statistical and machine learning models, particularly for evaluating the performance of classification models. It refers to the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings. An AUC value ranges from 0 to 1, where:

* 1 indicates a perfect model,
* 0.5 suggests a model no better than random guessing,
* \< 0.5 reflects a model performing worse than random., 3 Years
Differentially Expressed Metabolites, Differential metabolites, or differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), refer to metabolites that show significant changes in abundance between different biological or experimental conditions, such as disease vs. healthy states, treated vs. untreated groups, or across time points in longitudinal studies. These metabolites are identified through quantitative metabolomics techniques, including mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and analyzed using statistical or bioinformatics tools to determine significance., 3 years
