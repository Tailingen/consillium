Spanish Urological Association Registry of Patients on Active Surveillance
Description:

Multicentre observational study, not randomized. Ambispective character (retro and prospective). Opened to any member of the Asociación Española de Urología (AEU), public and private medicine.

Justification:

Active surveillance is a strategy proposed to control the overtreatment derived from the opportunist screening in prostate cancer (PCa).

Its development in our country is erratic and different in every Center. This database tries to include most of patients included in active surveillance in Spain with a few minimal inclusion criteria.

Multicentre registry and follow up of the active surveillance in Spain.

Hypothesis:

Mortality cancer specific for PCa includible in active surveillance to 15 years is lower than 5 %.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Registry
Cancer specific survival in patients in active surveillance, Global CSS will be recorded, independently of each Center protocol, from enrollment to death due to PRostate Cancer Estimated CSS will be analyzed at 5, 10 and 15 years from initiation of the protocol.

To this purpose, patients will be followed although they progressed and went into active treatment., up to 15 years|Overall survival, Global OS will be recorded, independently of each Center protocol, from enrollment to death of any cause Estimated OS will be analyzed at 5, 10 and 15 years from initiation of the protocol To this purpose, patients will be followed although they progressed and went into active treatment or if the kept in active surveillance till their death due to any cause., Date randomization-date death, or up to 15 years, whichever came first|Active treatment-free interval, Time to active treatment will be recorded, independently of each Center protocol, from enrollment to any other active due to prostate cancer progression or patient desire to receive any active treatment Estimated active treatment free survival will be analyzed at 2, 5 and 10 years from initiation of the protocol., Date start active surveillance-stop active surveillance due to active treatment, or up to 15 years, whichever came first|Characterization of pathologically agressive tumors by Gleason score, Characterization of pathologically agressive tumours will be done by analyzing the pathological reports of radical prostatectomy specimens derived from patients included in the protocol that went on to radical prostatectomy. This has no time frame, although time of radical prostatectomy will be a variable to take in account for comparisions among different timings of performace of radical prostatectomies., From the study start and stop until 15 years|Characterization of pathologically agressive tumors by TNM, Characterization of pathologically agressive tumours will be done by analyzing the pathological reports of radical prostatectomy specimens derived from patients included in the protocol that went on to radical prostatectomy. This has no time frame, although time of radical prostatectomy will be a variable to take in account for comparisions among different timings of performace of radical prostatectomies., From the study start and stop until 15 years
Quality of Life in patients with active surveillance, Assessed with CAVIPRESS-30 questionaires, up to 5 years|Quality of Life in patients with active surveillance, Assessed with EPIC-20 questionaires, up to 5 years
