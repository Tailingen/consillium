Trilaciclib Prevents Myelosuppression With Chemoradiotherapy
To evaluate the protective effect of Trilaciclib on myelosuppression in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer associated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and discuss the effect of gut microbiota changes on myelosuppression
Myelosuppression
DRUG: Trilaciclib
Occurrence of severe neutropenia, Grade 3/4 decline in neutropenia after the first cycle of chemotherapy during radiotherapy, 14 days|Duration of severe neutropenia, Duration of severe neutropenia after the first cycle of chemotherapy during radiotherapy (ANC\<1.0Ã—10\^9/L for more than 5 days), 5 days|Occurrence of hematological toxicity, Grade 3/4 decline in neutrophils, platelets, and red blood cells, 5 days
The occurrence of myelosuppression following chemotherapy, including severe neutropenia and hematological toxicity (Grade 3/4), as well as its association with dynamic changes in the gut microbiota, was investigated in conjunction with prophylactic administration of the CDK4/6 inhibitor Trilaciclib prior to the initiation of chemotherapy during radiotherapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer.
