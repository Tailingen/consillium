Phase I/II Study of Naxitamab and Sacituzumab Govitecan in Patients With Metastatic TNBC
This phase I/II trial tests the safety, best dose, and effectiveness of naxitamab in combination with sacituzumab govitecan in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic).
Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sacituzumab govitecan|DRUG: Naxitamab
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
1. Primary Objectives

   * To determine the safety and tolerability and establish the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of the combination of naxitamab and sacituzumab govitecan in participant s with metastatic TNBC.
   * To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of naxitamab in combination with sacituzumab govitecan per RECIST v1.1 criteria in participant s with metastatic TNBC at the MTD/RP2D.
2. Secondary Objectives

   * To determine the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival for participant s with metastatic TNBC treated with the combination of naxitamab plus SG:
   * To identify GD2-related biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of naxitamab and sacituzumab govitecan.
3. Exploratory/Correlative Objectives â€¢ Investigate potential resistance mechanisms to naxitamab and develop a pre-clinical rationale for future therapeutic strategies.
