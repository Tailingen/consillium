Cardiac Changes in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
Myeloproliferative neoplasms are heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasms with excessive proliferation of one or more of the erythroid, megakaryocytic, or myeloid lineages and relatively normal maturation resulting in increased numbers of red cells, platelets, and/or granulocytes in the peripheral blood. Constitutive tyrosine kinase activation appears to be a common pathogenetic mechanism.

According to worldwide study of prevalence of myeloproliferative neoplasms revealed:

Incidence of polycythemia vera ranged 0.01 to 2.61 per 100.000 population and the prevalence ranging from 0.49 to 46.88 per 100.000 population. Incidence of essential thrombocythemia is 0.21 to 2.27 per 100.000 population, prevalence ranging between 11.00 - 42.51 per 100.000 population.

Primary myelofibrosis incidence is 1.15 -4.99 per 100.000 population and prevalence ranging between 1.76 - 4.05 per 100.000 population.In previous studies, cardiac involvement including coronary arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, asymptomatic pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, intractable cardiac failure due to intraventricular stenosis and valvular stenosis that occur in myeloproliferative neoplasms. There is a few number of studies in which cardiac lesions were evaluated in myeloproliferative neoplasms by using transthoracic echocardiography but still inadequate, so we need to understand more about cardiovascular complications in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
