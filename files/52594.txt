A Study of AVE8062 in Advanced-stage Soft Tissue Sarcoma After Failure of Anthracycline and Ifosfamide Chemotherapies
The primary objective of the study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) in the 2 treatment arms

The secondary objectives of the study are :

* To compare the overall survival in the 2 treatment arms
* To compare the objective response rate in the 2 treatment arms
* To assess the safety profile of AVE8062 (in combination with the background cisplatin therapy)
* To assess the pharmacokinetics of AVE8062 and its main metabolite, RPR258063, using a population approach, in all patients enrolled in selected centers.
