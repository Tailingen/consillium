All in One Study: A Prospective Trial of Electromagnetic Navigation for Biopsy of Pulmonary Nodules
This is a multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, prospective trial to evaluate a staged sampling methodology designed to maximize the diagnostic yield of lung biopsy in a single procedure setting.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Veran System
Diagnostic Yield, Diagnostic yield associated with either EMN-bronchoscopy or EMN-TTNA, Up to one year post index procedure
Serious Adverse Events, All device and/or procedure related serious adverse events, 30 days post index procedure|Adverse Events, Rate of all device and procedure related events, 30 days post index procedure|Rate of procedure cancellation, Impact of same day CT scan on rate of procedure cancellations due decrease in nodule size, On procedure day|Procedural Factors, Number of instrument passes, type of instrument, site of biopsy, Intra-procedure
The objectives of this study are to evaluate diagnostic yield following biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules as identified on chest computed tomography (CT) utilizing (1) Electromagnetic navigation (EMN) bronchoscopy, and/or (2) EMN-transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA). Overall diagnostic yield will be evaluated to assess the combination of these approaches.
