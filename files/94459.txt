A Study of Lorigerlimab With Docetaxel or Docetaxel Alone in Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the amount of time before disease progression can be prolonged in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) who receive lorigerlimab in addition to the standard of care (SOC) of docetaxel and prednisone. About 150 participants with mCRPC will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive lorigerlimab with docetaxel and prednisone (experimental arm) or docetaxel and prednisone alone (standard-of-care arm).

Lorigerlimab+docetaxel or docetaxel will be administered intravenously (IV) in clinic on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Prednisone will be administered orally twice daily. Lorigerlimab will be administered for up to 35 cycles. Docetaxel and prednisone will be administered up to 10 cycles until treatment discontinuation criteria are met. Participants will undergo regular testing for signs of disease progression using computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their health and well-being. Routine examinations and blood tests will be performed and evaluated by the study doctor.

Participants who have disease progression standard-of-care arm have the option of continuing on the study to receive lorigerlimab monotherapy.

Median radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) determined by investigator review., The rPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented PD per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 3 more years
Objective response rate (ORR) per PCWG3 criteria, ORR is defined as the number of participants who have a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) without prior confirmed bone progression, Every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 3 more years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is the time from the date of initial tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 9 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks for up to 4 years|Time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first objective response (CR or PR)., Every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 3 more years|PSA50 response rate, PSA50 response is defined as a ≥ 50% decline in PSA from baseline with confirmation at least 3 weeks after the first documented reduction in PSA of ≥ 50%., Every 3 weeks up to 2 years, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 2 more years|PSA90 response rate, PSA90 response is defined as a ≥ 90% decline in PSA from baseline with confirmation at least 3 weeks after the first documented reduction in PSA of ≥ 90%., Every 3 weeks up to 2 years, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 2 more years|Time to PSA progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented PSA progression., Every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 2 more years|Duration of PSA response, Duration of PSA response is defined as the time from the date of first PSA response to the earliest date of PSA progression., Every 3 weeks up to 2 years, followed by every 23 weeks for up to 2 more years.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Throughout the study up to 4 years|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), Time to first SSE is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first occurrence of SSE from any cause., Throughout the study up to 4 years|Time to pain progression using the BPI-sf questionnaire, Time to pain progression is defined as the time interval from randomization to the first date a participant experiences pain progression. Higher scores indicate more severe pain., Every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks for up to 2 more years|Pain severity using the Brief Pain Index - short form (BPI-sf) questionnaire, The BPI-sf pain severity score consists of 4 items that assess pain at its worst, least, average, and current pain intensity. The pain severity score is the average of the 4 item scores. Higher scores indicate more severe pain., Every 3 weeks up to 2 years|Pain interference using the BPI-sf questionnaire, The BPI-sf pain interference score includes 7 items: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The pain interference score is the average of the 7 interference items. Higher scores indicate more interference from pain in daily life., Every 3 weeks up to 2 years|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire, The FACT-P consists of 27 items from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) that measure physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being and 12 items that compose the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS).
