Study of Lacutamab in Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label multicenter randomized non comparative phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal anti-KIR3DL2 antibody Lacutamab in patients with Refractory/Relapsing (R/R) KIR3DL2 positive Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) : Not Other Specified (NOS), PTCL-TFH (including Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (AITL), Follicular T-cell lymphoma, Nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma with TFH phenotype), Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL), Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma (MEITL), NK-T cell lymphoma (NKT) and Aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL).

The design is non comparative meaning that non comparison between arms will be performed as the control arm will ensure that the assumptions used for sample size calculation are verified. For that reason, randomization is unbalanced in favor of the experimental arm (2:1).

median modified progression-free survival (mPFS) - CT-based, time from randomization until one of the following events occurs, whichever comes first:

1. Disease progression (PD)
2. Administration of any additional unplanned anti-lymphoma treatment (except allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantations (HCT))
3. Relapse after achievement of CR
4. Death due to any cause. PD and relapse will be evaluated according to Lugano 2014 criteria (CT-based)., 5,5 years.
