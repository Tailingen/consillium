A Phase II Study to Determine Pembrolizumab as Frontline Treatment of Patients With Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective the research study drug, pembrolizumab is as a treatment for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who have not previously been treated for this disease and are unsuitable for standard treatment (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine ABVD).
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: pembrolizumab
Response using Lugano Criteria, Response will be assessed by Lugano criteria. Overall response is defined as achieving either CR or PR at any stage from time of commencement of protocol treatment to time of treatment cessation for whatever reason., At each treatment cycle 1 to 35 (each cycle is 3 weeks)
Response using LYRIC Criteria, Response will be assessed by LYRIC criteria, At each treatment cycle 1 to 35 (each cycle is 3 weeks)|Adverse Events, Adverse Events will be evaluated using CTCAE version 4.03 as worst grade per AE, Screening, Cycles 1-35 (each cycle is 3 weeks), end of treatment (2 years), 30 days from date of last dose, up until the first sign of progression through to study completion (3 years)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be measured from the date of treatment commencement to the date of first progression at any site or date of death from any cause, up until the first sign of progression through to study completion (3 years)|Overal Survival (OS), OS will be measured from the date of treatment commencement to the date death from any cause., up until the first sign of progression through to study completion (3 years)|Treatment Intensity, Treatment intensity will be defined as the actual total dose received divided by the actual treatment period, At each treatment cycle 1 to 35 (each cycle is 3 weeks)|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS will be measured from the date of treatment commencement to date of documented disease progression at any site, date of commencement of next-line treatment, or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first., up until the first sign of progression through to study completion (3 years)|Duration of response (DoR), DoR will be assessed on patients who responded to treatment and will be measured from the date of first documented disease response to the earliest recurrence or progressive disease. Deceased patients without recurrence or progressive disease will be censored at the last disease assessment date., up until the first sign of progression through to study completion (3 years)
The study is a single arm, open label, phase II, international, multi-centre study. Sample size will be 25 evaluable patients with a recruitment period of 2 years. Patients will be administered 200mg pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks up to 35 cycles or 2 years. Patients will be followed-up for 1 year.
