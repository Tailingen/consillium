A Study of Atezolizumab Versus Placebo as Adjuvant Therapy in Patients With High-Risk Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Who Are ctDNA Positive Following Cystectomy
This is a global Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab compared with placebo in participants with MIBC who are ctDNA positive and are at high risk for recurrence following cystectomy.
Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|OTHER: Placebo|DEVICE: Signatera
Investigator-assessed DFS, Investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a DFS event, defined as any of the following:

* Local (pelvic) recurrence of urothelial carcinoma (UC) (including soft tissue and regional lymph nodes)
* Urinary tract recurrence of UC (including all pathological stages and grades)
* Distant metastasis of UC
* Death from any cause, Randomization up to first occurrence of DFS event (up to approximately 40 months)
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization up to death from any cause (up to approximately 10 years)|Independent Review Facility (IRF)-Assessed DFS, Randomization up to first occurrence of DFS event (up to approximately 40 months)|Investigator-Assessed Disease-Specific Survival, Investigator-assessed disease-specific survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from UC per investigator assessment of cause of death., Randomization to death from UC (up to approximately 10 years)|Investigator-Assessed Distant Metastasis-Free Survival, Investigator-assessed distant metastasis-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the diagnosis of distant (i.e., non-locoregional) metastases or death from any cause., Randomization to diagnosis of distant metastases or death from any cause (up to approximately 10 years)|Time to Confirmed Deterioration of Function and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), Time to confirmed deterioration of function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), defined as the time from randomization to the date of a participant's first score decrease of \>= 10 points from baseline on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) physical function scale, role function scale, and the global health status (GHS)/QoL scale (separately), held for at least two consecutive time points or followed by death., Randomization to participant's first score decrease of >=10 points from Baseline on EORTC QLQ-C30 physical function scale, role function scale, and the GHS/QoL Scale (up to approximately 10 years)|ctDNA Clearance, ctDNA clearance, defined as the proportion of patients who are ctDNA positive at baseline and ctDNA negative at Cycle 3, Day 1 or Cycle 5, Day 1., Baseline, Cycle 3 Day 1 or Cycle 5 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Baseline up to approximately 10 years|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, At pre-defined intervals from first administration of study drug up to approximately 10 years|Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Atezolizumab, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to atezolizumab after initiation of study treatment (postbaseline incidence)., Baseline up to approximately 10 years|Prevalence of ADAs to Atezolizumab, Prevalence of ADAs to atezolizumab at baseline., Baseline
