Breast Cancer With Over-expression of erbB2-BRAINSTORM
This retrospective cohort study aims to improve our understanding of the current paradigm for treatment of brain metastases in erbB2+ breast cancer patients in the Asia Pacific region. We aim to identify approximately 300 erbB2+ breast cancer patients with brain metastases diagnosed between 2006-2008 in 6 countries. Medical records will be analyzed to determine the treatment pattern for brain metastases, including anti-erbB2 therapy. Additional objectives are to understand the impact of anti-erbB2 therapy on survival after brain metastases and to investigate the relationship between anti-erbB2 therapy for brain metastases and: 1) the time interval between diagnosis of erb2+ breast cancer and brain metastasis, and 2) the occurrence of brain metastasis as the first site of disease progression.
