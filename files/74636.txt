Autologous CAR-T/TCR-T Cell Immunotherapy for Malignancies
This is a single arm, open-label, uni-center, phase I-II study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T/TCR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with different malignancies patients.

BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T cell immunotherapy
Number of Participants With Adverse Events evaluated with NCI CTC AE, version 4.0, Safety evaluation, 60 months
Clinical response, Clinical response to T-cell infusion, especially change of tumor volume will be evaluated by comparing disease identified by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging., 60 months|CAR-T cells testing, The level of CAR-T cells will be tested regularly by Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Detecting System(qPCR) or Flow cytometry to evaluate the proliferation in vivo and long-term survival., 60 months
The study is a multi-target gene-modified immunotherapy. CAR-T/TCR-T cells include ten different tumor-specific antibody.They are as following:anti-CD19 antibody for B cell leukemia and lymphoma;anti-CD22 antibody for B cell leukemia and lymphoma;anti-CD33 antibody for myeloid leukemia;anti-BCMA antibody for multiple myeloma;anti-CD38 antibody for multiple myeloma;anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody for multiple myeloma,esophagus cancer,lung cancer,melanoma and synovial sarcoma;anti-DR5 antibody for hepatoma;anti-C-met antibody for hepatoma,colorectal cancer,ovarian cancer and renal carcinoma;anti-EGFR V III antibody for hepatoma,lung cancer and glioma;anti-Mesothelin antibody for gastric cancer,pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma.
