Personalized Second Chance Breast Conservation (PSCBC): A Prospective Phase II Clinical Study
The goal of the study is to investigate the feasibility of enabling a second chance for breast conservation in patients with in-breast recurrences after a previous lumpectomy and RT, investigators propose to test partial breast irradiation with the target volume encompassing the entire surgical bed with 1.0-1.5 cm margins.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: 600cGY x 5 fractions
Rate of treatment related adverse events as graded by CTCAE version 5.0, The primary endpoint of the study is to test the feasibility in terms of acute toxicity of a protocol of partial breast re-irradiation for breast cancer treatment in a previously irradiated whole breast, as defined by the rate of grade ≥ 3 treatment-related skin, fibrosis, and breast pain AEs, as graded by CTCAE version 5.0., up to 1 year from completion of radiation treatment
Number of participants with late toxicity will be measured as graded by CTCAE version 5.0, Late toxicity is defined as the adverse events experienced by patients after 90 days post radiation therapy., up to 60 months|Change in number of participants with skin changes, This count of participants will include patients who experience the following: skin hyperpigmentation, fibrosis, telangiectasia, skin induration and edema., baseline, approx. week 1- week 2 of radiation, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months.|Change in Quality of life as assessed by Breast Cancer treatment outcome scale (BCTOS), The Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) will be used to evaluate patient-reported cosmetic outcome, functional status, and breast pain. Each BCTOS subscale (cosmetic, functional status, and breast pain) is calculated by computing the arithmetic mean of the answers to each item relevant to a given subscale. The score is a continuous variable ranging from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating no difference between the treated and untreated breast, 2 indicating a slight difference, 3 indicating a moderate difference, and 4 indicating a large difference., baseline, approx. week 1- week 2 of radiation, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months.|Number of participants who demonstrate local control, Patients will be followed for recurrence of cancer in the treated breast., 60 months|Disease free survival (DFS) will be measured, 60 months|Overall Survival (OS) will be measured., 60 months|Number of participants who received subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, The investigators will track for enrolled patients the rate of subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, 6 months|Number of participants who received subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, The investigators will track for enrolled patients the rate of subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast., 12 months|Number of participants who received subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, The investigators will track for enrolled patients the rate of subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast., 24 months|Number of participants who received subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, The investigators will track for enrolled patients the rate of subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast., 36 months|Number of participants who received subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, The investigators will track for enrolled patients the rate of subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast., 48 months|Number of participants who received subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast, The investigators will track for enrolled patients the rate of subsequent mastectomy in the treated breast., 60 months
Patients will be treated with the fractionation of 30 Gy in 5 fractions over 1-2 weeks, which is the accelerated fractionation scheme of choice for Radiation Therapy (RT) naïve patients at New York Presbyterian using EBRT.

The main aim of the study is to evaluate the rate of early grade 3 toxicities with this approach.
