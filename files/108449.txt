Video Consultation to Reduce Drug Interactions Among Patients Initiating Oral Anti-Cancer Drugs
This is a non-randomized prospective pilot intervention study to assess the feasibility of a onetime pharmacist-led video consultation for medication review and patient education among patients initiating an oral anti-cancer drug. In addition, investigator will evaluate reductions in polypharmacy, potential DDIs, and patient self-efficacy by comparing these variables for each patient before and after the video consultation.

BEHAVIORAL: Video consultation
Proportion of subjects enrolled that complete the 30 minutes consultation and assessments, To determine feasibility of a one-time pharmacist-led video consultation among advanced cancer patients initiating oral anti-cancer drugs. Feasibility will be defined as significant evidence that 50% of enrolled patients will complete all components of the study., 30 minutes|Rate of absorption interaction, Based on the pre-consultation medication reconciliation, we will assess the characteristics (absorption interaction) of medication list inaccuracies identified by medication reconciliation among study participants., Baseline|Average of QTc prolongation, Based on the pre-consultation medication reconciliation, we will assess the characteristics ( QTc prolongation) of medication list inaccuracies identified by medication reconciliation among study participants., Baseline
Mean of medication list inaccuracies among study participants prior to the consultation, Based on the pre-consultation medication reconciliation, we will assess the mean number of medication list inaccuracies identified by medication reconciliation among study participants., Baseline|Change in assess factors associated with OACD-related potential drug-drug interactions and medication inaccuracies, We will assess patient-level factors associated with OACD-related potential DDIs and medication inaccuracies, such as age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cancer diagnosis, number of medications, and number of comorbidities., Within 30 days of the consultation|Number of medication changes recommended, The number of medication changes recommended to address polypharmacy and/or DDIs, Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in the proportion of patients with a mitigated DDI, The proportion of patients with a mitigated DDI, defined as a change in one involved medication within 30 days of the consultation, Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in proportion of patients with a reduction in total number of medications and/or supplements, The proportion of patients with a reduction in total number of medications and/or supplements within 30 days of the consultation, Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) before and after the consultation, The change in medication list complexity using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) within 30 days of the consultation, within 30 days of the consultation|Mean Score to Medication Self-Efficacy Scale (MASES) to assess patient confidence and competence regarding OACD administration before and after the consultation, The change in patient confidence and competence regarding OACD administration using a modified version of the Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (MASES-R) before and after the consultation, Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in mean score on the Satisfaction with Information about Medications Scale (SIMS) before and after the consultation, Patient reported outcomes as measured by the Satisfaction with Information about Medications Scale (SIMS), Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in mean score on the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) before and after the consultation, Patient reported outcomes as measured by the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in mean score on the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM) before and after the consultation, Patient reported outcomes as measured by the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), Within 30 days of the consultation|Change in mean score on the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) before and after the consultation, Patient reported outcomes as measured by the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM), Within 30 days of the consultation
In this study, the investigator will be evaluating a 30-minute pharmacist-led video consultation to provide education about patients new oral anti-cancer drug (OACD) and help identify and manage potential drug-drug interactions alongside your oncologist. While OACDs offer both clinical benefits and added convenience when compared to traditional intravenous chemotherapy, they also present a number of potential challenges. One critical challenge involves the increased risk of taking multiple oral medications daily. Patients taking multiple medications can result in harmful effects due to unexpected drug interactions, as well as patient confusion regarding when to take specific medications. Given the relatively recent rise in available OACDs, little is known about the extent of this issue
