Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Evaluation According to Pre-determined Drug-targeting Tumor Markers
Evaluate chemotherapy related tumor markers on non small cell lung cancer by fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, targets to be studied include EGFR, c-MET, topoisomerase II, p53, topoisomerase I, thymidylate synthase, ERCC1, tau, c-myc, RRM1, class III tubulin. These targets have been chosen because they are targets for chemotherapeutic agents that are currently used in clinical management of these diseases. In total 50 specimen will be studied, approximately one third have mutations/deletions of the EGFR gene.To attempt to establish a correlation between the pre-selected tumor markers and response to chemotherapy, and thus to be able to create a clinically useful classification that would provide clinical guidance for selection of the most effective chemotherapy for a individual patient, and thus be able to logically design more effective clinical trials for the future.
