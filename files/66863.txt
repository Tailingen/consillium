Currently, there is little experience in the application of targeted drugs combined with immunotherapy. Through this study, we hope to explore the optimal population for the use of carelizumab combined with regorafenib in the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as the efficacy and safety.

This research is a single-center trials phase II second-line, single arm, explore the clinical outcome of treatment.
