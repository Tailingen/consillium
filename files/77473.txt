Feasibility Study of Pemetrexed in Combination With Cisplatin or Carboplatin as Adjuvant Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized, parallel Phase 2 feasibility study of pemetrexed in combination with either cisplatin (Arm A) or carboplatin (Arm B) as adjuvant combination-chemotherapy in participants with completely resected, stage Ib or IIa/IIb non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

A two-stage design will be employed independently for both treatment arms, with the possibility of stopping each treatment early for lack of feasibility.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: carboplatin
The Feasibility of Post-Surgery Chemotherapy, Feasibility was measured by completion of 4 treatment cycles without remaining toxicities \>=Grade 3 at 30 days after last infusion., every 21-day cycle for 4 cycles up to 30 days after last infusion
Grade III/IV Adverse Events, Number of participants experiencing Grade III/IV hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events possibly related to study drug or protocol procedures in this study., every 21-day cycle for 4 cycles|Overall Survival at 3 Years, For each treatment arm, the Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate the 3 year survival rate. Results are presented as probability (%) of survival at 3 years. Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death. For participants not known to have died, overall survival was censored at the last known alive date., baseline to date of death from any cause, assessed at 3 years|3 Year Disease-Free Survival: Probability of Disease-Free Survival at 3 Years, For each treatment arm, the Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate the 3 year disease-free rate. Disease-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause. For participants not known to have died and to have had recurrent disease, disease-free survival was censored at the date of the last participant contact with No Recurrence status. Results are presented as probability (%) of disease-free survival at 3 years., length of time disease free, assessed at 3 years|Overall Survival at 6 Years, For each treatment arm, the Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate the 6 year survival rate. Results are presented as probability (%) of survival at 6 years. Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death. For participants not known to have died, overall survival was censored at the last known alive date., Baseline to date of death from any cause assessed at 6 years
