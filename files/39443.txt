Pembrolizumab in Combination with Bevacizumab and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in Patients with Ovarian Cancer
French multicenter, open-label, phase 1b, evaluating via the mTPI design the paired treatment of pembrolizumab and PLD (cohort A), pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (cohort B) and finally the combination treatment of the three drugs PLD plus bevacizumab and pembrolizumab (cohort C). Thanks to an expansion cohort C+ the ORR will be evaluated in a total of 19 patients at the RP2 D using an exact binomial one-step Fleming-type design.

Cohort A and B will be opened for inclusions at the same time. Once safety of the dual combinations confirmed in cohorts A and B,cohort C will be opened for inclusions.
