Endoscopic removal of Complex colon polyps (benign polyps \>=2cm) is a technically challenging procedure. Complex benign polyps have a greater chance of becoming cancerous if not removed.

The DiLumenâ„¢ Endolumenal Interventional Platform is a non-sterile, single-use, close-fitting sleeve that fits securely over a standard endoscope to stabilize it in the large intestine, and facilitates use of the endoscope for optical visualization, diagnosis, and treatment. The device is indicated to ensure complete positioning of an endoscope in the large intestine and assist with optical visualization, diagnosis, and endoscopic treatment.

The device received 510k clearance on Dec 6, 2016. The study will evaluate performance of the device during routine, scheduled, endoscopic polyp removal for these large polyps.
