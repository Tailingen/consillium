Endostar Combined With Concurrent Radiochemotherapy for Treatment of Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
The chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is still a standard treatment for the unresectabl stage III NSCLC.However, prognosis following this treatment is generally poor, with 5-year survival of 15-20%. The result of published HELPER study had showed that Endostar, a kind of angiogenesis agent, in combination with CCRT could improve the efficacy and safety. In order to verify the rusults, the investigators design the current study.
Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
PFS, progress free survival, 15 months
OS, Overall survival, 3 years|LRFS, Locoregional relapse-free survival, 2 years|DMFS, Distant metastasis-free survival, 2 years|AEs, adverse events, 3 years
The current study is a observation study in the real world setting. The 500 patients in compliance with Enrollment Criteria will be as the objects of observation. The procedure of study include the period of screening, treating and follow-up. The duration of study is about two and half year. The data entrying will be done by CRC, using the EDC system. CRA will audit the quality of data regularly.
