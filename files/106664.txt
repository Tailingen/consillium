Clinical Study of Cord Blood-Derived CAR-NK Cells in Gastric Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer
Main Objective: To study the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-dependent toxicity (DLT) of cord blood-derived CAR-NK cells (CB CAR-NK182) targeting Claudin18.2 in patients with advanced gastric cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer.

Secondary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of CB CAR-NK182 in patients with advanced gastric cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer: overall objective tumor response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), etc.

To evaluate the CAR-NK amplification and persistence of CB CAR-NK182 in the blood of patients with advanced gastric cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer;
