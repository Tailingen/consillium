Pre-operative Epirubicin, Cisplatin, and Capecitabine in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Localised Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma
To investigate the efficacy and safety of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine as neoadjuvant therapy prior to radical resection in patients with newly diagnosed operable oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
Adenocarcinoma of Oesophagus
DRUG: epirubicin, capecitabine, cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection
Pathological complete response rate
Progression free survival|Overall survival|Objective response rate assessed by CT and EUS|Treatment related toxicity including peri-operative complications|Time to improvement of dysphagia|Pattern of treatment failure|To assess the value of high resolution MRI to depict response to treatment and compare it with EUS and histopathology
