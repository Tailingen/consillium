Dose Dense Carboplatin, Taxotere and Herceptin As Primary Systemic Therapy in Breast Cancer
Dose dense therapy has been shown to increase survival in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer. It is unknown if dose dense therapy will improve survival in tumors that express her-2. This study evaluates a neoadjuvant regimen containing carboplatin, taxotere and herceptin when used in a dose dense manner in patients with large breast cancers. The endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a surrogate marker for survival.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: trastuzumab, docetaxel and carboplatin in dose dense regimen
Number of Patients With Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), pCR is defined as the absence of invasive tumor from the surgical specimen of breast and axilla which is obtained after the chemotherapy regimen has been delivered., determined at the time of surgery which is approximately 16 weeks from the beginning of treatment
Safety and Tolerability, the number of patients with grade 4 (severe) toxicities and or hospitalizations were measured to assess safety and tolerability, from the first dose of chemotherapy until surgery which was approximately 16 weeks.
