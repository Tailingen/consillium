DNA Analysis of Tissue Samples From Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at DNA in tissue samples from patients with head and neck cancer.

Assess common genetic mutations in tumor and germline DNA samples, Upon collection of final patient data|Viral DNAs related to demographics, tumor characteristics, and patient prognosis, Upon collection of final patient data|Novel viral sequences and cancer-associated gene mutations in young nonsmoking patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and in other distinct head and neck cancers, Upon collection of final patient data|Tumor suppressor gene mutations related to gene expression data, upon collection of final patient data|Validation of gene expression information using independent techniques such as real-time PCR on expressed sequences and immunohistochemistry, upon collection of final patient data
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess common genetic mutations in tumor and germline DNA samples from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
* Search for viral DNAs and relate this information to demographics, tumor characteristics, and patient prognosis.
* Search for novel viral sequences and cancer-associated gene mutations in young nonsmoking HNSCC patients and in other distinct head and neck cancers.
* Determine tumor suppressor gene mutations in HNSCC patients and relate this information to gene expression data.
* Validate gene expression information using independent techniques such as real-time PCR on expressed sequences and immunohistochemistry.

OUTLINE: Genetic mutation analysis and gene expression studies are performed on tissue samples from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Techniques used include real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
