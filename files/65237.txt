Safety and Efficacy of Obatoclax Mesylate (GX15-070MS) in Combination With Bortezomib for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
Defects in the apoptotic process can lead to the onset of cancer by allowing cells to grow unchecked when an oncogenic signal is present. Obatoclax is designed to restore apoptosis through inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby reinstating the natural process of cell death that is often inhibited in cancer cells.
