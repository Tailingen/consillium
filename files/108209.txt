Bladder Cancer|Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter|Urethral Cancer
DRUG: piritrexim
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the antineoplastic activity of piritrexim and its effect on the survival of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma previously treated with systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the toxicity of piritrexim in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive piritrexim by mouth 3 times daily, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Patients with responding or stable disease continue treatment every 4 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or progression intervenes.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be entered over 5-6 months if at least 1 response is observed in the first 14 evaluable patients.
