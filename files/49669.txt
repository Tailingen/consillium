The Plenaxis® Experience Study
Praecis is currently conducting a 2000 patient Experience Study; this is a Phase IV commitment postmarketing safety study in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated population of patients receiving Plenaxis®. The purpose of the study is to estimate the incidence of immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions in the indicated population receiving Plenaxis® and to determine whether the hazard rate changes over time.

Estimate the incidence of immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions in the indicated population receiving Plenaxis
This is a postmarketing patient safety study in the FDA indicated population of patients receiving Plenaxis®. On a quarterly basis, patients enrolled in the Plenaxis® Experience Study will have their charts audited to record the number of immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions that may occur while receiving Plenaxis®. The study will close when 2,000 patients have been enrolled. If immediate onset allergic reactions occur, patients may be eligible to enroll in a second protocol (skin testing in patients who experience an immediate onset allergic reaction). Collection of all immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions will continue for each patient enrolled in the study until the patient discontinues Plenaxis® for any reason, the patient withdraws consent to continue in the study or the patient is lost to follow-up.
