Real-time Interactive Digital Healthcare System in Post Operation Patients With Breast Cancer; Pilot Study
This study aims to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term rehabilitation therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare Homeplus) in post-operative patients with breast cancer. This is prospective pilot study. 20 breast cancer patients who underwent wide local excision-axillary lymph node diessection or modified radical mastectomy will be examined, and those with limited range of motion (ROM) of affected shoulder will be enrolled in the study. Shoulder ROM, Quick-DASH, pain evaluation with NRS, quality of life evaluation with FACT-B and EQ-5D will be evaluated on enrollment, 4-week, 8-week, and 12-weeks after enrollment.

The limited range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder occur often after receiving breast cancer surgery, which may be due to post-operative pain, stiffness of shoulder girdle muscle, and etc. Due to this limited ROM, the patients may suffer difficulty in activities of daily life and quality of life may be reduced.

Uincare Homeplus is software manufactured in Korea, which uses infrared, kinect camera and motion capture technology to track 3D motion of the patients' articulation. Using this technology, the patients can receive feedback of their motion immediately.

The objective of the study is to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term rehabilitation therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare Homeplus) in post-operative patients with breast cancer.
