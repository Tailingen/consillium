Esophageal Multisegmented FCSEMS for Malignant Strictures
Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility of the implementation of the esophageal multisegmented fully covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) for the palliation of patients with malignant dysphagia.

Study design: Prospective observational nonrandomized clinical study.

Study population: A total of 30 patients with malignant dysphagia will be included. Sample size calculation does not apply for this type of study.

Intervention: All patients will be treated with the esophageal multisegmented fully covered SEMS.

Primary end points:

* Safety: complications and adverse events during follow-up with special attention to stent migration rates;
* Efficacy: technical success of stent placement.

Secondary end points:

* Recurrent dysphagia including its cause;
* Functional outcome: Ogilvie dysphagia score and WHO performance score (measured at baseline, 2 weeks and every 4 weeks until death/stent removal, or until a maximum of 6 months follow-up);
* Tissue ingrowth or overgrowth (measured endoscopically every endoscopic evaluation during follow-up);
* Pain related to esophageal stent.
