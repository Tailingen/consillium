A Trial of Bevacizumab in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (Int-1, Int-2 and High Risk According to International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)) With Excess of Marrow Blasts
The objectives of this phase II trial are to test the efficacy and tolerance of Bevacizumab in MDS patients with excess of marrow blasts and to evaluate the impact of Bevacizumab on angiogenesis and erythropoiesis.

To limit the myelotoxicity observed in the preliminary phase II study, Bevacizumab will be administrated at the initial dose of 5 mg/kg.

The primary endpoint will be response: Complete Remission (CR), Partial Remission (PR) and hematological improvement (HI) according to IWG criteria (see appendix 3).

The secondary endpoints will be survival, response duration, side effects, evaluation of angiogenesis (bone marrow microvessel density, VEGF plasma level, VEGF mRNA expression, HIF-1alpha expression).

The design of this study consists of three study periods: pre-treatment (screening), treatment (loading and maintenance), and follow-up. All patients will participate in the study for at least 12 weeks of therapy, a 4-week follow-up visit, and long-term follow-up unless the criteria for planned or unplanned early discontinuation are met.
