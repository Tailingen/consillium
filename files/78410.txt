Breast Cancer - Navigate - Prospective Cohort
The Chrysalis Initiative (TCI) has with its technology partner Eversana/Intouch developed the BC-Navigate website/application to help guide women through care delivery during breast cancer treatment.

TCI a nonprofit, breast cancer education and navigation organization is developing methods to address health inequities in cancer care delivery. TCI and its new academic/clinical partner, The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, propose to apply TCI's developed patient navigation support techniques to enhance knowledge and self-advocacy among a cohort of Black and African American women, and other women of color (WOC), receiving care in Northwestern's breast cancer program.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to apply TCI's patient navigation-and-coaching program and its website/mobile app (Breast Cancer-Navigate) platform to improve timely initiation to patient adjuvant treatment among WOC breast cancer patients and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this approach.

BEHAVIORAL: BC-Navigate
Demand of BC-Navi: Recruitment Rate, We assess the demand for the BC-Navi application through study recruitment. Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, a 75% recruitment rate is considered adequate., 12 weeks|Demand of BC-Navi: Retention Rate, Another way we assess demand of the BC-Navi application is through participant retention. Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, a 75% retention rate is considered adequate ., 12 weeks|Acceptability of BC-Navi, To assess acceptability, all participants are asked to complete an exit interview on BC-Navi. This interview assesses the usefulness, satisfaction, learnability, and usability of the application. This exit interview was synthesized from validated measures assessing eHealth intervention acceptability, and was adapted for our study to better fit our target population and our application design. Above-average scores on the questionnaire are considered acceptable., 12 weeks|Preliminary Efficacy: Chemotherapy Initiation, Preliminary efficacy will be measured by time to chemotherapy initiation, which will be operationalized as chemotherapy treatment initiation within 90 days of completion of surgery., 12 weeks
