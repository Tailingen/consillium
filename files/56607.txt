A Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of BinD19 Treatment in Childhood R/R ALL and Lymphoma Subjects
This is a single arm, open-label, uni-center, phase I/II study to determine the safety and efficacy of an experimental therapy called BinD19 cells in childhood patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma, who are chemo-refractory, relapsed after allogeneic SCT, or are otherwise ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Relapsed B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Childhood|Refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Childhood|Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, Childhood
BIOLOGICAL: BinD19
Number of Participants With Adverse Events [Safety and Feasibility], To evaluate the safety and feasibility of BinD19 CAR-T cells in patients with refractory /relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma., Study treatment until Week 24
Overall Response [Efficacy], Efficacy assessments for ALL were performed based on bone marrow and blood morphologic criteria and physical examination findings. Efficacy assessments for Lymphoma were based on tumor load, B cell number and immunoglobulins., 5 years
