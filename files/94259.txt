Development of a Computer Assisted Survivor Screening For Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer
This study will compare two ways of having people respond to a questionnaire about health and emotional well-being: on a computer and with paper and pencil. We will see how long it takes using both methods. We will also ask you how you feel about using a computer to answer the questions.
Childhood Cancer
To determine feasibility of using the Computer Assisted Survivor Screening (CASS) as a routine screening measure for the survivor population. Specifically, to determine patient acceptance, time to completion, and burden associated with the CASS. To examine the potential utility of the CASS as a routine screening measure in the survivor population. To validate the CASS against the SCL-90-R screening measure. Calculate the sensitivity,specificity, positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic agreement and ROC curve of the CASS compared to the SCL-90. Determine the optimal cut-off scores to optimize agreement between the CASS and the SCL-90.
