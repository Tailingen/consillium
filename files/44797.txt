A Pharmacokinetics Study of the Effects of GSK2118436 on Warfarin, the Effects of Ketoconazole and Gemfibrozil on GSK2118436, and the Effects of Repeat Doses of GSK2118436 in Subjects With BRAF Mutant Solid Tumors
GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. This is a 4-part study (in 4 separate cohorts of subjects) designed to examine the interaction potential of GSK2118436, either as a perpetrator (i.e., effect of GSK2118436 on warfarin; Part A) or victim (i.e., effect of other drugs on GSK2118436; Part B: ketoconazole and Part C: gemfibrozil), as well as to evaluate the single and repeat dose pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK2118436 (Part D). A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to obtain approximately 12 evaluable subjects each for Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D. Following completion of this study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in the roll-over study, Protocol BRF114144.
