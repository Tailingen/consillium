Serum Vitamin D Levels and Peripheral Neuropathy Among Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is a prospective study investigating the relationship between vitamin D and peripheral neuropathy (PN) among multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with either bortezomib or thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of up to 14 days, followed by a single assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence and severity of PN, neuropathic pain, and markers of depression. Patient charts will also be utilized to assess the frequency of skeletal-related events.
Multiple Myeloma|Peripheral Neuropathy
Serum vitamin D levels, Correlation of serum vitamin D levels to the incidence and severity of anti-myeloma treatment-induced PN/ neuropathic pain among MM patients previously exposed to bortezomib and/or thalidomide, Day 1
Skeletal related event, Correlation between vitamin D levels and skeletal-related events (pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression or collapse, or surgery or radiotherapy to bone) among MM patients, Day 1
Markers of depression, Correlation between vitamin D levels and markers of depression for MM patients, Day 1
Approximately 10% of myeloma patients present at diagnosis with clinical neuropathy although studies reveal as many as 1/3 may have abnormal electrophysiological examinations. Baseline neuropathic abnormal findings are exacerbated by many myeloma treatments, especially bortezomib, thalidomide, and to a lesser extent lenalidomide. Several studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may help reduce the symptoms of neuropathy.In this prospective study, we will investigate the relationship between vitamin D and PN among MM patients treated with either bortezomib or thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of up to 14 days, followed by a single assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence and severity of PN, neuropathic pain, and markers of depression. Patient charts will also be utilized to assess the frequency of skeletal-related events.
