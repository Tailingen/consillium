Study of Dalotuzumab Alone and With Ridaforolimus in Pediatric Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-8669-062 AM1)
This is a study of dalotuzumab given as monotherapy and in combination with ridaforolimus for pediatric participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will have three parts. Part 1 will find a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and collect pharmacokinetic (PK) data for dalotuzumab alone. Part 2 will find an MTD and collect PK data for dalotuzumab in combination with ridaforolimus. Part 3 will be an expansion cohort at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) found in Part 2 to confirm the RPTD and look at the potential efficacy of the combination therapy.
