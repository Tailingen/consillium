Significance of Early Mobilization After VATS-L
The main endpoint is physiological rehabilitation after VATS-L under early mobilization. The secondary endpoints are exploring the effect of early mobilization on postoperative physiology.

Investigators hypothesis that early mobilization is clearly advantaged to advance the physiological recovery.

BEHAVIORAL: Early mobilization
Postoperative forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1 is the amount of air you can force from your lungs in one second. Participants will be examed via spirometer., Through study completion, an average of 3 days|Postoperative arterial oxygen saturation., Oxygen saturation is the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. Participants will be tested via oximeter., Through study completion, an average of 3 days
The quantization of activity counts, Through study completion, an average of 3 days|The quantization of pain, The numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (excruciating pain) is used to score postoperative pain., Through study completion, an average of 3 days|length of stay in hospital, Through study completion, an average of 3 days|Duration of chest tube, Through study completion, an average of 2 days|Postoperative complications, Pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumonia, empyema, bleeding, pulmonary embolism, prolong air leakage, re-intervention, re-surgery and re-admission will be recording specifically., up to 30 days
