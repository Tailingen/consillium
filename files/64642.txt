A Study of MRG003 in Combination With Pucotenlimab Versus Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety, and immunogenicity of MRG003 in combination with pucotenlimab in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: MRG003 + Pucotenlimab|DRUG: Gemcitabine, Docetaxel, or Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by BIRC, PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 33 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 48 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportions of patients with a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). ORR will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 48 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion (up to 48 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator, PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 33 months)|Immunogenicity (ADA), The proportion of patients with positive ADA results., Baseline to 14 days after the last dose.|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse events that are fatal, life-threatening, or result in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity/substantial disruption of the ability to lead a normal life, congenital anomaly/birth defect or major medical events or reactions., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
