MRSI to Predict Response to RT/TMZ Â± Belinostat in GBM
In the first phase of this study (Cohort 1), the investigators will determine the feasibility of adding MRSI to the evaluation of newly-diagnosed GBM patients treated with standard RT/TMZ and determine whether magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can predict for better outcomes in these patients. In the second phase of this study (Cohorts 2a and 2b), the investigators will find the maximum tolerated dose of belinostat for treating newly-diagnosed GBM patients with standard RT/TMZ and will determine whether MRSI can aid clinicians in the early determination of response to this new therapy.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Cohort 1), The investigators will use a support vector machine approach to determine an MRSI 5-metabolite profile at week 3 in Cohort 1 that is predictive of prolonged PFS at 9 months., 9 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose of Belinostat (Cohort 2a), The investigators will determine the maximum tolerated dose of belinostat (up to 1000 mg/day x 5 days q3weeks x 3) used with standard RT/temozolomide for newly diagnosed GBM patients., 9 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Cohort 2b), The investigators will determine if MRSI biomarkers at week 3 in GBM patients from Cohort 2b can distinguish belinostat responders from non-responders and predict improved PFS at 9 months., 9 months
Overall Survival, The investigators will determine whether changes in MRSI metabolite maps at day 8 (for Cohort 2 only), week 3 (for Cohort 1 and 2) and week 11 (for Cohort 1 and 2) predict for overall survival at 18 months., 18 months|Progression Free Survival, The investigators will determine whether changes in MRSI metabolite maps at day 8 (for Cohort 2 only) and week 11 (for Cohort 1 and 2) predict for PFS at 9 months., 9 months|IDS-SR score change, The investigators will determine whether changes in the MRSI metabolite map at week 11 predict for mood alterations as measure by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR), a validated instrument for depression assessment, in Cohorts 1 and 2., 11 weeks
QOL changes, The investigators will determine whether changes in MRSI metabolite maps correlate with changes in subjects' quality-of-life (QOL) as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30/Brain Cancer Module-20 (QLQ-C30/BN20) and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT), validated instruments for assessing QOL in brain tumor patients., up to 2 years|Neurocognitive function changes, The investigators will determine whether changes in MRSI metabolite maps correlate with changes in subjects' neurocognitive function as measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test and the Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A \& B, validated instruments for evaluating neurocognitive function in brain tumor patients., up to 2 years
Patients will be assigned to Cohort 1 (standard RT/TMZ) followed by entry to either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2a (standard RT/TMZ + dose finding for belinostat), followed by assignment to Cohort 2b (standard RT/TMZ + tolerable dose of belinostat).

Patients will undergo MRSI scans before beginning treatment and then at several time points during treatment to look for the early response of their tumor to treatment. Blood and tumor samples will be used to measure the levels of certain markers within the cancer cells. Patients will also be assessed for the side effects they experience. Progression-free and overall survival outcomes will be recorded. Patients will also have assessment of their depressive symptoms, quality-of-life and neurocognitive function at several time points during and after therapy course.
