Study of De_Intensified Postoperative Radiation Therapy for HPV Associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This research study is studying lowering the standard dose of radiation and chemotherapy after surgery, to minimize the side effects and improve the quality of life.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation therapy
Disease-free survival, Survival without any signs or symptoms of cancer after the treatment ends., 2 years
Overall Survival, The length of time from the start of treatment until death., 2 years|Toxicity Rate, Adverse events experienced by the participants., 2 years|Quality Of Life Questionnaire, Assesses the physical; social/family; emotional and functional wellbeing, using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Head and Neck (FACT-H\&N) on a scale of 0-4 (where 0 indicates the lowest quality of life and 4 indicates the highest quality of life)., 2 Years|Symptom burden:, Patient-reported symptom severity, using M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Head \& Neck (MDASI-HN) on a scale of 0-10 (where 0 indicates symptom is not present and 10 indicates the symptom is as bad as can be), 2 years|Dysphagia, Swallowing ability or difficulty. Dysphagia-related quality of life, assessed with the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) on a scale of 1-5 (where 1 indicates the patient strongly agrees and 5 indicates the patient strongly disagrees), 2 Years|Shoulder dysfunction, Shoulder function or dysfunction is measured with the "neck dissection impairment index" (NDII). This evaluates how much the patient's neck and/or shoulder affects them as a result of the treatment they received in their neck during the overall management of their cancer. This scale goes from 1-5 (1 being "not at all" and 5 being "a lot"), 2 Years
This research study is being done to study if less intensive treatments can be used after surgery for head and neck cancers that are due to the human papilloma virus (HPV). In general, these cancers have better cure rates than other types of head and neck cancers. Therefore, the investigators are studying whether we can safely reduce the amount of treatment after surgery, such as surveillance (instead of using radiation) or less radiation or less chemotherapy, while maintaining good cure rates. The investigators hope that by reducing the intensity of treatment, this will lead to less side effects during and after cancer treatment.
