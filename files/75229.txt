A Study of Valemetostat Tosylate in Combination With DXd ADCs in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of valemetostat tosylate in combination with DXd ADC in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Valemetostat tosylate|DRUG: T-DXd|DRUG: Dato-DXd
Number of Participants Reporting Dose-limiting Toxicities (Part 1 Dose Escalation), Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Day 21 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants Reporting Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Part 1 Dose Escalation), Screening up to 40 days after last dose|Objective Response Rate Based on Investigator Assessment (Part 2 Dose Expansion), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST v 1.1 criteria. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline (Screening), at every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 in the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or until the start of a new anticancer treatment, up to approximately 5 years
Overall Survival, Date of enrollment up to date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free Survival, Disease progression will be determined by investigator assessment of tumor scans and using RECIST v 1.1 criteria., Date of enrollment up to date of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DoR), CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Date of first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate Based on Investigator Assessment (Part 1 Dose Escalation), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST v 1.1 criteria. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline (Screening), at every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 in the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or until the start of a new anticancer treatment, up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants Reporting Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Part 2 Dose Expansion), Screening up to 40 days after last dose|Total and Unbound Plasma Concentration of Valemetostat, Cycle 1, Day 1: Predose, 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, 4 hr, and 5 hr postdose; Cycle 1, Day 8 and Day 15: Predose; Cycles 2, 3, 4, Day 1: Predose (each cycle is 21 days)|Plasma Concentration of DXd Antibody-Drug Conjugates, Cycle 1, Day 1: Predose, 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, 4 hr, and 5 hr postdose; Cycle 1, Day 8 and Day 15: Predose; Cycles 2, 3, 4, Day 1: Predose (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a 2-part study of valemetostat in combination with DXd ADCs in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, non-squamous NSCLC, or unresectable or metastatic HER2 low breast cancer. The study will begin with a Part 1 Dose-escalation Phase and will continue until the recommended dose for expansion "RDE" of valemetostat is determined and will then be followed by a Part 2 Dose-expansion Phase to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination.
