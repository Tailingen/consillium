Osimertinib With Chemotherapy as First-line Therapy for EGFR Mutation-positive NSCLC
To estimate parameters related to clinical outcomes in a real-world seeting, including investigator reported PFS and OS.

Real-World Progression Free Survival (rwPFS), rwPFS is defined as the time from the date of first-line initiation until disease progression or death by investigator report as recorded in the CRF, Follow up approximately 36 months after last patient in
Chemotherapy regimen, Chemotherapy information i.e. dose, number of induction chemotherapy cycles and duration of chemotherapy maintenance, any dose changes and reasons for these changes and date of last administration will also be recorded., Follow up approximately 36 months after last patient in|Duration of chemotherapy (induction and maintenance cycles), Duration of first-line Osimertinib plus chemotherapy, and duration of initial therapy prior to first-line Osimertinib plus chemotherapy (i.e., prior Osimertinib only, prior chemotherapy only)., Follow up approximately 36 months after last patient in|Response rate, Response rate (RR) is defined as the percentage of patients with the best response of "responding" by investigator report as recorded in CRF. Patients who discontinue treatment without progression, receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the RR calculation., Follow up approximately 36 months after last patient in|Duration of response, DoR: is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the PFS endpoint. The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward the first visit response. If a patient does not progress following a response, then his/her duration of response will use the PFS censoring time as the end point for their DoR calculation., Follow up approximately 36 months after last patient in|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first-line initiation until death due to any cause regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy., Follow up approximately 36 months after last patient in
The objectives of this study are to assess the effectiveness and safety of Osimertinib combined with chemotherapy in a real-world setting in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
