BReast CAncer Genes(BRCA) Expressions in Metastatic Gastric Cancer
The investigators evaluated the incidence of BRCA loss in patients with advanced gastric cancer and observed the treatment outcome and prognosis according to BRCA loss. And the investigators evaluated the possibility of BRCA loss as a predictive and prognostic factor.
BRCA Gene Rearrangement
GENETIC: BRCA 1|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Objective response rate, the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy; it does not include stable disease and is a direct measure of drug tumoricidal activity., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Progression free survival, the time from diagnosis to death by any cause and progression., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall survival, the time from diagnosis to death by any cause, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Stomach cancer is still the leading cause of cancer deaths globally and is reported to be the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Korea (18.7%). Although the number of radical resection has increased due to the development of early diagnosis, many patients experience recurrence after radical resection. It is also diagnosed as a non - resectable disease locally advanced at the time of initial diagnosis, or with a metastasis. In patients with recurrent / metastatic gastric cancer, conventional palliative chemotherapy is the best treatment, and in advanced gastric cancer, combination therapy with fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil, capecitabine, S1) and platinum (oxaliplatin, cisplatin). The progression-free survival was 3-5 months, and overall survival of 6-10 months in metastatic gastric cancer patients.
