PSMA-specific CAR-T Cell Therapy
The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of PSMA-specific CAR-T cell therapy in patients with PSMA positive tumor. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the function of the PSMA CAR-T cells and their persistency in the patients.
PSMA Positive Tumors or Tumor Tissues
BIOLOGICAL: 4SCAR-PSMA T cells
Number of patients with adverse events., Determine the toxicity profile the 4SCAR-PSMA cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects version 4.0, 3 year
Anti-tumor effects, Objective responses (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) are assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., 1 year|The expansion and persistence of 4SCAR-PSMA T cells, Scale of CAR copies and tumor burden (for efficacy), 1 year|Survival time of the patients, The survival time of the patients treated with the 4SCAR-PSMA T cells, including progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be evaluated., 3 year
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in normal prostate and is upregulated in prostate tumor. Therefore, PSMA is a promising target for antigen-specific immunotherapy in patients with prostate cancer. However, it has been reported that PSMA expression is not restricted to prostate cancer and PSMA is often enriched in the tumor stromal environment. By immunostaining, we found that PSMA is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including brain tumor, neuroblastoma and some lymphoma tumor tissues.

This study aims to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express PSMA-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells or tumor stromal tissues through the recognition of a surface antigen, PSMA. This study will evaluate the side effects and the best dose of anti-PSMA CAR-T cells to target PSMA positive tumors and tumor microenvironment.
