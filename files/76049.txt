Dose Escalation Trial of WT1-Sensitized T Cells for Residual or Relapsed Leukemia After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Transplantation
This study will test the safety of giving you specialized white cells from your donor. They are called WT1 sensitized T cells. They have been grown in the lab and are immunized against a protein. The protein is called the Wilms' tumor protein, or WT1. Your leukemic cells make too much of this protein. We want to learn whether the WT1 sensitized T cells will attack the protein and kill the leukemia cells.
Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
BIOLOGICAL: WT1-sensitized T cells
assess toxicity of in vitro expanded allogeneic WT1 peptide-specific T-cells derived from transplant donor,when given to patients with leukemia or other WT1+ hematologic malignancy having relapsed after transplant or persistent minimal residual disease, conclusion of the study
to assess the effects of the adoptively transferred T cells on the progression of disease, conclusion of the study|to quantitate the number of WT1 peptide-specific T cells in the blood at defined intervals post infusion in order to determine their survival and proliferation in the host., conclusion of the study
