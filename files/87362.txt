Correlation of Microbiome to Disease via Relative Abundance Found in Microbiome Sequencing, Relative abundance of bacterial classes within taxonomic phyla and, more broadly, within their domain will be analyzed by sequencing the gut microbiome. These data will then be categorized among specific gastrointestinal disease types., One year
Validation of Sequencing Methods, To validate the methods used to sequence samples, One year
The goal of this Research Study is to better understand how the genetic information in subject's microbiome correlates to the information provided in surveys and in medical records regarding colorectal cancer.
