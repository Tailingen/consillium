Real World Observational Study of Pembrolizumab for Chinese Advanced NSCLC
This observational study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab for the treatment of Chinese advanced NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Median Overall survival (OS) since start of pembrolizumab, OS was defined as the length of time from the administration of the first-dose until death from any cause., 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) since start of pembrolizumab, ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to irRECIST., 6 months|Rate of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) since start of pembrolizumab, Drug related AEs were evaluated using NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 3 months after the last dose
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) since start of pembrolizumab, PFS is defined as the time from the start of first-dose to first progression disease (PD) or death, whichever is earlier., 12 months|Median Time To Treatment failure (TTF) since start of pembrolizumab, TTF is defined as the time from the start of first-dose to discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient preference, or death., 12 months
Pembrolizumab is a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy.The NMPA(China) approved pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of certain patients with advanced NSCLC.

This is a multi-center non-interventional study, advanced NSCLC patients who treated with pembrolizumab and provide written informed consent will be included. The main objective of this study is to evaluate pembrolizumab efficacy and safety in the clinical practice and explore the prognosis-relevant factors of advanced NSCLC.
