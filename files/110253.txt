A Prospective Observational Study of Lymphedema in Breast Cancer With Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
Over the past few years, several studies have been made on various outcomes about the incidence of lymphedema. Because the outcomes can be came out differently each study by measurement, criteria, treatment period, treatment method and morbid extremities of lymphedema. Therefore it is required for understanding about the incidence, risk factor and physical progress for to be treated and prevented of lymphedema. Also it is necessary that to understand characteristics of lymphedema measurements and to establish diagnostic criteria of lymphedema through comparative study.

The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and risk factor of lymphedema through prospectively observation, and to determine effects on the quality of life of lymphedema after breast cancer surgery with ALND.
Breast Cancer
To evaluate the incidence of lymphedema in upper arm after ALND, In this study, we evaluated the incidence of lymphedema in upper arm using tape measurement, perometre and bioimpedance spectroscopy during pre,post-operative visit, 3, 6, 9month and 1year clinical follow-up., Up to 1year
To Evaluate quality of life using questionnaire, * European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC) the 30-item version of the core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30)
* EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Breast Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ BR23), Up to 1year|Physical assess, * Questionnaire: Disabilities of the arm shoulder and hand using (DASH)
* Physical examination, Up to 1year
Primary Objectives:

- To analyze incidence rate of lymphedema using tape measurements, perometre, bioimpedance, spectroscopy.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the risk factor of lymphedema in postoperative breast cancer.
* To understand that lymphedema has an effect on quality of life and physical function in postoperative breast cancer.
* To complete uestionnaire about physical and quality of life in postoperative breast cancer with ALND patients.
