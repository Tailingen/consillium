Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies with Alpha Beta TCell and B Cell Depletion Using the CliniMACS Device
This is a single arm pilot study for patients with hematologic malignancies with alternative donor sources receiving unrelated or partially matched related/Haploidentical mobilized peripheral stem cells (PSCs) using the CliniMACS system for Alpha Beta T cell depletion plus CD19+ B cell depletion to determine efficacy as determined by engraftment and GVHD, and one year leukemia free survival.
Hematologic Malignancies
DEVICE: CliniMACs
Evaluate the engraftment of patients receiving unrelated donor or partially matched related donor peripheral stem cells that have T cell depleted and CD19+ B cell depleted using the CliniMACS device., Engraftment will be defined using the standard CIBMTR definition of ANC \>500 for the first of 3 consecutive days., DAY 42
Assess the probability of one year leukemia free survival (LFS)., Leukemia relapse is defined as presence of malignant cells in the blood or other body site after initiation of conditioning in a patient previously in remission., 1 year|Estimate the incidence and extent of acute and chronic graft vs. host disease., Acute GVHD will be graded using the standard Glucksberg grading system., 1 year|Assess the incidence treatment-related mortality (TRM)., TRM is defined as death from non-disease related causes in the 100 days from stem cell infusion., 1 year
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new method of T cell depletion using the Miltenyi CliniMACS™ device for patients undergoing a peripheral stem cell transplant utilizing either a unrelated donor or partially matched/haploidentical related donor. This new method is called α/β (alpha/beta) T cell depletion and CD19+ B cell depletion. This pilot study will evaluate if this new method of T cell and B cell depletion is a more effective way of removing T cells thus reducing the risk of severe acute and chronic GVHD and result in a durable engraftment.
