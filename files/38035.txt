Phase II Study of Reuse of Oxaliplatin Hypersensitivity in Gastrointestinal Tumors
The incidence of oxaliplatin allergy reactions is between 12-15%, while the incidence of severe (grade 3-4) allergic reactions is between 0.5-2%. The purpose of this study is to prospectively investigate the incidence of oxaliplatin allergy and neurotoxicity, and to evaluate the use of effective anti-allergic and desensitization therapies to enable patients who are already allergic to oxaliplatin to complete their prescribed doses smoothly.

Patients with GI receiving oxaliplatin-containing regimens were prospectively observed, and patients with oxaliplatin grade I-III hypersensitivity reactions judged by clinicians based on clinical symptoms and signs entered the oxaliplatin reuse study . For patients with grade I-III oxaliplatin allergy, oxaliplatin skin test with 3 concentration gradients (0.01 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml) was performed, and 5% glucose Water served as a negative control. 15-20 minutes to read test results. If the largest diameter of the rash was greater than 3 mm of the negative control, it was judged as a positive result. Afterwards, interventions were performed in different ways according to the grade of oxaliplatin allergic reaction.
