Technetium [99mTc]-H7ND in Patients With Gastrointestinal Malignancies and Healthy Volunteers
The primary objective of this study is: to evaluate the safety of technetium \[99mTc\]-H7ND injection in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies and in healthy subjects. The secondary objectives of this study are: (1) to examine the pharmacokinetics of technetium \[99mTc\]-H7ND Injection in healthy subjects. (2) Detect the metabolic stability of technetium \[99mTc\]-H7ND injection in healthy humans. (3) Detect the biodistribution and estimate the absorbed dose of radiation from internal irradiation of technetium \[99mTc\]-H7ND injection in patients with malignant tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and in healthy humans.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Technetium [99mTc]-H7ND injection
Security Indicators, Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for the Evaluation of Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0, 1-7 days from time of injection
uptake value ratio, Measure the count ratio of technetium \[99mTc\]-H7ND tumor area to blood pool, surrounding normal tissue, liver, and muscle in the integrated region of interest., 3 days after injection|biodiversity distribution, SPECT/CT whole-body scans were performed at different time points after drug injection to obtain radioactivity counts (%ID) in each major irradiated organ at each time phase to reflect the biodistribution of the drug in the body, 3 days after injection|internal radiation dose, Plot the "time-activity count" curve for each major organ and calculate the area under the curve. Calculate the retention time of each major exposed organ and apply the software to estimate the absorbed dose of internal radiation for each major exposed organ., 3 days after injection|Concentration of technetium [99mTc] H7ND prototype and its radioactive metabolites, Blood samples were collected at different time points after drug injection, and urine samples were collected at different time intervals for detection of technetium \[99mTc\] H7ND prototype and its radioactive metabolites using either a radioactive HPLC detector or a radioactive TLC detector., Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, Cmax, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC(0-t), Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC(0-∞), Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, Tmax, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, T1/2, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC_%Extrap, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, CL, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, Vd, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, MRT, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetic parameters, λz, Predose and up to 72 hours postdose
