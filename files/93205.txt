1. Patients reaching CR with marrow MRD below 10-4 threshold will continue ibrutinib during 6 additional months.
2. Patients in PR or bone marrow MRD \> 10-4 will receive Ibrutinib during 6 additional months and 4 courses of FC+ GA101. At Day 1 Month 16, patients in CR but with MRD\> 10-4 will continue Ibrutinib until progressive disease.
