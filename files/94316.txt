Preoperative Chemoradiation Versus Short Term Radiation Alone With Delayed Surgery for Stage II and III Resectable Rectal Cancer
Trial compares two preoperative stage II and III rectal cancer treatment strategies: short term radiotherapy 5x5 Gy and delayed surgery after 6 weeks versus conventional chemoradiotherapy 50 Gy + 5Fu/Lv and surgery also after 6 weeks.
