Predictive Factors for Survival in Aggressive Meningiomas
The investigators plan to collect clinical and molecular data, including ICH, PCR, NGS and methylome, from patients operated on for grade 2 or grade 3 meningioma. The purpose of the study is to identify reliable and easy-to-assess predictive factors for recurrence and survival after surgery.
