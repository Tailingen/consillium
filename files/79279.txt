Biweekly Intraperitoneal Oxaliplatin With Systemic Capecitabine and Bevacizumab for Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Appendiceal or Colorectal Cancer
This study is to test escalating doses of intraperitoneal (IP) oxaliplatin in conjunction with systemic bevacizumab and capecitabine in patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC) from either appendiceal or colorectal adenocarcinoma that have been adequately cytoreduced and have undergone a peritoneal scan demonstrating patency of at least one of the intraperitoneal ports that were placed at the time of debulking.

To determine the maximum tolerated dose of IP oxaliplatin with systemic intravenous bevacizumab and oral capecitabine after surgical debulking and peritoneal scan documenting functional of intraperitoneal ports in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, Completion of enrollment (approximately 8 years)|Assess the safety and tolerability of IP oxaliplatin and intravenous (i.v.) bevacizumab and oral capecitabine after surgical debulking and functional intraperitoneal ports in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of appendiceal or colorectal etiology, 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 22 weeks)|Progression rate, -Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, Through 4-12 weeks post-treatment (estimated to be 30 weeks)|Progression-free survival (PFS), -Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years)|Overall survival, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years)
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of IP oxaliplatin with systemic intravenous bevacizumab and oral capecitabine after adequate surgical debulking and peritoneal scan documenting function of intraperitoneal ports in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of appendiceal or colorectal etiology.
* To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated delayed intraperitoneal chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and systemic intravenous bevacizumab and oral capecitabine after adequate surgical debulking and peritoneal scan documenting function of intraperitoneal ports in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of appendiceal or colorectal etiology.
* To describe the progression rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.
