Anastomotic Leaks in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients After Trimodal Therapy
To investigate the clinical factors and preoperative treatment to the future anastomotic location of cervical esophagus that were correlated with anastomotic leaks in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation and McKeown esophagectomy and to explore the prognosis of anastomotic leak.
Anastomotic Leak Esophagus
OTHER: neoadjuvant chemoradiation and McKeown esophagectomy
anastomotic leak rate, According to the consensus on standardization of data collection for complications associated with esophagectomy by the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG), anastomotic leak was defined as a full-thickness gastrointestinal defect involving the esophagus, anastomosis, staple line or conduit, which was diagnosed as extravasation of water-soluble contrast during a swallow study, postoperative esophageal barium X-ray or CT scan, visualization of anastomotic dehiscence or leak during endoscopy, or salivary fluid in the cervical region., Up to 1 month
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration from the date of pathological diagnosis to the date of death or censoring., From date of pathological diagnosis until the date of death from any cause or censoring, assessed up to 36 months
Pathologic complete response, Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no evidence of residual tumor cells in the primary tumors and resected lymph nodes of the operative specimens., Up to 1 month
The goal of this observational study is to investigate the clinical factors and preoperative treatment to the future anastomotic location of cervical esophagus that were correlated with anastomotic leaks in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation and McKeown esophagectomy and to explore the postoperative complications, mortality, and long-term survival of different types of anastomotic leak.
