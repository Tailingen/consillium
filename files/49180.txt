NIR Hypoxia Imaging of Breast Tumor Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Vivo
The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experimental alternative imaging method, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (abbreviated as NIR), can be used with a controlled respiratory system to examine the breasts for cancer. The NIR system uses light beams to produce an image or picture of the inside of the breast. The respiratory system will help researchers get more information about the breast tissue by changing the amount of oxygen the tissue receives during NIR imaging.
