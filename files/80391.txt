A Clinical Study of CHT101 in CD70-Positive Relapsed or Refractory Hematological Malignancies
Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of CHT101 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory T or B Cell Hematological Malignancies
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma|Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)|NHL (Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma)
DRUG: CHT101
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Safety, 28 days of first infusion of CHT101|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Tolerability, 28 days of first infusion of CHT101
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Adverse events post infusion of CHT101 infusion, 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after CHT101 infusion, 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), The period from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the first evaluation of PD or death of any cause, 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), The period from the day when the subject receives the infusion of cells to the first recorded tumor progression or death of any cause, which occurs first, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), The period from the first infusion to any cause of death, 2 years|Pharmacokinetics (PK), Concentration levels of CHT101, 2 years|Pharmacodynamics (PD), Concentration levels of cytokines, 2 years
3 planned dose cohorts will be evaluated during dose escalation phase. The dose expansion will be initiated after SRC (safety review committee) reviewing available safety, PK and preliminary efficacy data.
