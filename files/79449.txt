Non-inferiority Study of XM02 Filgrastim (Granix) and Filgrastim (Neupogen) in Combination With Plerixafor for Autologous Stem Cell Mobilization in Patients With Multiple Myeloma or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02 filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor.
Multiple Myeloma|Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: XM02 Filgrastim|DRUG: Filgrastim|PROCEDURE: Apheresis|DRUG: Plerixafor|PROCEDURE: Stem Cell Transplant
Comparison of the Mean Day 5 CD34+Cells/kg Yield Between the Two Arms, Day 5
Comparison of the Most Commonly Reported Adverse Events (Safety) Experienced by Participants Between the Two Arms, -Adverse events will be assessed using CTCAE version 4.0, Up to 20 days after last apheresis (Day 25-Day 28)|Comparison of the Time to Neutrophil Engraftment Between the Two Arms, Time to neutrophil engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive measurements of neutrophil count ≥ 500/µl following conditioning regimen-induced nadir. Patients who do not have neutrophil engraftment by Day 30 post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product will be considered a neutrophil engraftment failure., Up to Day 30 post-infusion|Comparison of the Time to Platelet Engraftment Between the Two Arms, Time to platelet engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive measurements of platelet count ≥ 50,000/µl without platelet transfusion support for 7 days. Patients who do not have platelet engraftment by Day 100 post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product will be considered a platelet engraftment failure., Up to Day 100|Comparison of the Readmission Rate Between the Two Arms, Readmission rate is defined as the frequency at which patients are readmitted (after initial post-transplant discharge) following post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product for reasons other than progressive disease/relapse, Up to Day 100|Comparison of the Percentage of Patients Who Collect > 2.0x10^6 CD34+Cells/kg Following PBSC Mobilization Between the Two Arms, Up to Day 8 (total collection)|Comparison of the Percentage of Patients Who Collect > 5.0x10^6 CD34+Cells/kg Following PBSC Mobilization Between the Two Arms, Up to Day 8 (total collection)|Comparison of the Percentage of Patients Who Collect > 2.0x10^6 CD34+Cells/kg in One Apheresis Procedure Following PBSC Mobilization Between the Two Arms, Day 5|Comparison of the Percentage of Patients Who Collect > 5.0x10^6 CD34+Cells/kg in One Apheresis Procedure Following PBSC Mobilization Between the Two Arms, Day 5
This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02 filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor. The FDA has determined that Granix is biosimilar to Neupogen, which means that they are similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy; however, Granix has not been tested in the context of stem cell mobilization to see how its effectiveness compares to that of Neupogen
