Retifanlimab (Anti-PD-1 Antibody) With Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This study is being done to find out whether the study drug Retifanlimab, a monoclonal antibody against the PD-1 protein, combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel, is a safe and effective treatment for your disease. Gemcitabine and docetaxel are chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used to treat soft tissue sarcoma. Retifanlimab is an experimental drug that boosts the immune system's ability to fight cancer cells. The study researchers think that Retifanlimab may help gemcitabine and docetaxel work better against soft tissue sarcoma that is either locally advanced or has spread beyond its original location (metastasized), and it cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable).

Phase II: proportion of patients that are progression-free at 24 weeks by RECIST v1.1, The primary objective of the phase II portion of this study is to determine the proportion of patients that are progression-free at 24 weeks by RECIST v1.1. Progressive disease is declared when there is an increase in sum of target disease ≥ 20%, stable disease when the change is \> -30% and ≤ 20%, partial response when there is a decrease in sum of target disease ≥ 30%, and complete response when all lesions have disappeared or all lesions have disappeared and all nodal disease is \< 10 mm each., 24 weeks
