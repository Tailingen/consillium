Efficacy of Apatinib in Radioactive Iodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC) is a great challenge in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), like sorafenib and lenvatinib which have been approved by food and drug administration (FDA), could not be affordable for most of the Chinese patients. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor and reduces the angiogenesis of tumor effectively, which is a proven and effective drug in many solid tumors. A phase II study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib in RAIR-DTC ,which enrolled 20 patients and 10 of them had obtained a shout-term efficacy, demonstrating the peculiar potential in treatment of RAIR-DTC. In this study, the investigators aim to further explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in RAIR-DTC.

DCR, Disease control rate, 24 months|ORR, Objective response rate, 24 months|DoR, Duration of response, 24 months|Changing trend of Tg and TgAb level in serum, Monitor the changes of Tg and TgAb level in serum regularly ( every 2\~8 weeks, and addition examinations were needed if the participants' condition changed ) and draw the relevant changing curve to monitor the change of disease., 24 months|OS, Overall survival, 24 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Record the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 24 months
Primary Outcome Measure: Progression free survival of apatinib in RAIR-DTC.

Secondary Outcome Measures: Disease control rate, objective response rate, duration of response, changes of Tg and TgAb level in serum, overall survival, side effects and quality of life.
