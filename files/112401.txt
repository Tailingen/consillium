MR-based Hypofractionated Adaptive IGRT of Prostate Cancer (M-base HyPro 2.0)
Single-centre single-armed, non-randomized interventional phase II-study of hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy "IGRT" with weekly magnetic resonance imagings "MRI" for personalized adaptation of the treatment plan depending on individual MR-anatomy of prostate/organ at risks "OAR" during course of IGRT.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Plan adaptation of Radiation Treatment in case of anatomical changes
Number of participants with gastrointestinal "GI" and genitourinary "GU" toxicity of >/= G2, Hypothesis: reduction of GI/GU-toxicity (CTC-criteria 4.0, RTOG) from 20% to 10% at 2 years, power 80%, 2 years
Number of participants completing at least 2 of 4 MRI-examinations during course of IGRT, Feasibility and tolerability of completing at least 2 of 4 MRIs during treatment, 6 months|Rate of participants achieving local control, In case of PSA progress: No evidence of local recurrence detected by MRI, 2, 5, 10 years|Rate of participants achieving regional control, In case of PSA progress: No evidence of regional recurrence detected by MRI, 2, 5, 10 years|Rate of participants achieving Distant-metastasis-free survival "DMFS", No evidence of distant metastases diagnosed by cross-sectional imaging including bone scan, MRI, CT and PET, 2, 5, 10 years|Number of Participants with biochemical no evidence of disease "bNED", biochemical no evidence of disease according to Phoenix definition: nadir + 2ng/ml, 2, 5, 10 years|Time without secondary treatment "TWIST", Time without secondary treatment calculated from start of IGRT, 2, 5, 10 years|CTC-Proctitis, CTC 4.0, 2, 5, 10 years|CTC-Incontinence, CTC 4.0, 2, 5, 10 years|Progression-free survival "PFS", progression-free survival is defined as any progression (biochemical or other recurrences) or death or initiation of secondary treatment, calculation from start of IGRT, 2, 5, 10 years|Overall survival "OS", Overall survival is calculated from start of IGRT, 2, 5, 10 years
IGRT-schedule: 20 fractions to a total dose of 60 Gy

Personalized adaption of treatment plan dependning on volume-/ and constraint-thresholds and evaluation of biomarkers (multiparametric MRI, blood, tissue, stool, urine).
