Clinical Evaluation of Tissue Sampling Bias in Histologic Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer
This is a study to evaluate the incidence of sampling bias during pathologic assessment of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) when they are cut at a certain thickness (1 mm) and the tissue slices are completely analyzed by histopathology (at 200 µm sections). The sponsor and investigators would like to determine how often small cancer deposits are present in one slice but not the other. The data will provide an empirical estimate of the incidence of tissue sampling bias inherent in using different tissue sections for analysis. The data will also show how varying degrees of detail in evaluating the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) with histopathology methods will impact the degree of agreement.
