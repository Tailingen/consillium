Study of HS-20093 Versus Gemcitabine in Combination With Docetaxel in Treatment of Osteosarcoma After Previous Second-line Treatment Failure
This is a randomized, controlled, open, multicenter phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HS-20093 for injection versus gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel in patients with osteosarcoma who have at least second-line treatment failure.
Osteosarcoma
DRUG: HS-20093|DRUG: Gemcitabine combined with docetaxel
PFS assessed by IRC as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, PFS is defined as the time interval from the randomization to disease progression as per ICR assessment or death due to any cause., From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years.
ORR assessed by IRC as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Confirmed ORR is defined as the sum of the complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate as per ICR per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|DCR assessed by IRC as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD (or non-CR/non-PD) per ICR per RECIST v1.1, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|DoR assessed by IRC as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|ORR assessed by the investigator as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Confirmed ORR is defined as the sum of the complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate as per investigator per RECIST v1.1, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|DCR assessed by the investigator as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD (or non-CR/non-PD) per investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|DoR assessed by the investigator as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|PFS assessed by the investigator as per RECIST 1.1 criteria, PFS is defined as the time interval from the randomization to disease progression as per investigator assessment or death due to any cause, From the date of randomization to documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant; Up to approximately 5 years|OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time interval from randomization to death due to any cause, From the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause; Up to approximately 5 years
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HS-20093 for injection versus gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel in patients (â‰¥ 12 years old) with osteosarcoma who have at least second-line treatment failure.

Eligible study participants shall be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the experimental group and the control group. Study participants in the experimental group received HS-20093 at 12.0 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (Q3W), and the study participants continued to receive treatment until objective disease progression or other criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. Study participants in the control group received standard chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel until disease progression or other criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. The efficacy and safety of the two groups were evaluated after follow-up as per the procedures.
