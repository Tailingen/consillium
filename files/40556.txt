A Registry for BRCA Mutation Carriers With Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to better understand why pancreatic cancer develops in some people who are known carriers of the gene mutation (an abnormality) called BRCA, or its close relative PALB2. The investigators hope to do this by establishing a BRCA/PALB2 mutation carriers Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (the common form of pancreatic cancer) Registry. A registry is a database of information.
