AVAREG Study: An Observational Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This multicenter, single-arm observational study will evaluate the clinical benefits of Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with paclitaxel in first-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have started Avastin treatment within 6 months prior to study start will also be eligible. Data will be collected from patients for up to 5 years.
Breast Cancer
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) was assessed based on time to tumour progression or death (whichever occurred first) from the start of bevacizumab treatment., Approximately 5 years
One Year Survival, The status of participants whether alive, dead, unknown or missing one year after the start of bevacizumab treatment is reported., Approximately 5 years|Time to Discontinuation (TTD) of Bevacizumab Treatment, Time to treatment discontinuation is defined as the time to change of therapy due to any cause (tumour progression, toxicity, or other causes) from the start of bevacizumab treatment., Approximately 5 years|Participants With Hormone Receptor Status at Diagnosis, The hormone receptor status for Oestrogen (ER), Progesterone (PgR) and Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) is reported as positive, negative, unknown or missing., Baseline (Day 1)|Progression Free Survival in Participants With Triple Negative Receptor Status at Study Entry, PFS was assessed based on time to tumour progression or death (whichever occurred first) from the start of bevacizumab treatment for participants with triple negative status and not triple negative status., Approximately 5 years|Participants With Tumor Stage at Diagnosis, Number of participants at each Metastatic breast cancer stage 0, I, II, III or IV, at the point of diagnosis is reported., Baseline (Day 1)|Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Status at Study Entry, The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status for participants was categorized as 0, 1, 2, or missing.
