Protein Molecular Characteristics and Prognosis of Cervical Neuroendocrine Tumors
The clinical diagnosis and treatment data of 300 cases of cervical neuroendocrine tumors were collected, including age, preoperative biopsy pathology results, postoperative histopathological results, TCT results, and colposcopy biopsy pathology results. At the same time, paraffin tissue specimens (remaining specimens after pathological diagnosis) from 100 cases of cervical neuroendocrine tumors from multiple centers across the country were collected to establish a cervical neuroendocrine tumor data follow-up database. Protein concentration and omics analysis were performed on the data results, to evaluate the molecular characteristics and prognosis of cervical neuroendocrine tumor proteins, and to preliminarily explore its clinical application value.

1. The clinical diagnosis and treatment data of 300 cases of cervical neuroendocrine tumors were used for prognostic analysis.

(1) The diagnosis and treatment information of cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma in multiple hospitals was collected, including clinical and medical data such as age, preoperative HPV genotyping, preoperative biopsy pathological results, postoperative histopathological results, FIGO staging, prognosis and survival information, and follow-up of patients.

2. Protein and other omics analysis was performed on paraffin tissues of 100 cases of cervical neuroendocrine tumors Paraffin samples collected from 100 cases of cervical neuroendocrine tumors were identified, processed and segmtioned, and protein concentration and proteome were determined to establish the molecular characteristics and prognostic targets of cervical neuroendocrine tumors.
