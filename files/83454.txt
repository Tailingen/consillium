Imatinib or Nilotinib With Pegylated Interferon-α2b in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) who have achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on imatinib (IM) or nilotinib (N) can then be treated with a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and interferon-α2b (PEG-IFN-a2b, \[IFN\]) for 2 years, subsequently have their therapy discontinued, and then maintain a durable molecular response off all therapy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate 1 year after discontinuation of the TKI and IFN will be the measurement of this objective.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: PEG-IFN-a2b
Relapse-free Survival (RFS) Rate 1 Year After Discontinuation of the TKI and IFN, To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) who have achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on imatinib (IM) or nilotinib (N) can then be treated with a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and interferon-α2b (PEG-IFN-a2b, \[IFN\]) for 2 years, subsequently have their therapy discontinued, and then maintain a durable molecular response off all therapy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate 1 year after discontinuation of the TKI and IFN will be the measurement of this objective., 3 years (2 years of treatment with TKI and IFN + 1 year of follow-up)
Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) for the Bcr-Abl Transcript., To determine whether the addition of PEG-IFN-a2b to a TKI (imatinib or nilotinib) improves upon the quality of the molecular remission seen with TKI alone, as measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the Bcr-Abl transcript., 3 years (2 years of treatment with TKI and IFN + 1 year of follow-up)
