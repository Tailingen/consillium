Autologous Natural Killer Cell Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study represents a phase I clinical trial that utilizes natural killer (NK) cell therapy for patients diagnosed with liver cancer, specifically those classified as Child-Pugh A and falling within the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages B or C. The expected results include determining the suitable treatment dosage, identifying any resulting side effects, and calculating the average duration of progression-free survival. The target group for the study consists of all individuals diagnosed with liver cancer. At the same time, the practical sample consists of those who received medical care for liver cancer at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) between May and December 2022. The chosen research sample comprises liver cancer patients who fulfill the predetermined participation criteria. The necessary sample size for discerning appropriate treatment dosages and the occurrence rate of potential side effects shall consist of 2-3 liver cancer patients who are administered autologous NK cells. The process for isolating these NK cells adheres to the guidelines established by Miltenyi Biotec.

DRUG: Autologous Natural Killer Cell Therapy|DEVICE: Clinimacs Plus
Optimal treatment dosage, To evaluate the safety of autologous NK cell infusion and discover dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). This evaluation will determine the recommended dosage for the next trial phase., Start of infusion of Autologous NK cells (Day 0) until up to 6 months
Tumor Shrinkage, CT scans will measure tumor size at baseline and specific post-infusion times. Tumor response will be assessed using mRECIST criteria., Up to 6 months|Immunological Responses, Flow cytometry will evaluate infused NK cells' biomarkers, such as CD45 and CD56, that persist in peripheral blood. These biomarkers will be evaluated pre- and post-infusion., Up to 6 months|Hematology Profile, Changes of Complete Blood Count (CBC), Differential Blood Count, Coagulation Profile, Mean Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), Aspartate Amio Transferase (AST) from baseline at each assessment time point, Start of infusion of Autologous NK cells (Day 0) until up to 6 months|Progression-free survival, This metric indicates the period during which a patient's condition shows no signs of progressing or deteriorating subsequent to the administration of autologous natural killer (NK) cell therapy, Start of infusion of Autologous NK cells (Day 0) until progressive disease or death, whichever comes first, up to 2 years
