Apatinib for Advanced Sarcoma: Results From Multiple Institutions' Off-label Use
Anti-angiogenesis Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been proved to show promising effects on prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) for advanced sarcoma after failure of standard multimodal Therapy. Methylsulfonic apatinib is one of those TKIs which specifically inhibits VEGFR-2. This study summarizes the experience of three Peking University affiliated hospitals in off-label use of apatinib in the treatment of extensively pre-treated sarcoma.

The investigators retrospectively analysed files of patients with advanced sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment, who were receiving an apatinib-containing regimen between June 1, 2015 and December 1, 2016. Fifty-six patients were included: 22 osteosarcoma, 10 Ewing's sarcoma, 3 chondrosarcoma and 21 soft tissue sarcoma.
