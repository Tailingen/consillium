Image-guided Thermal Ablation vs. Lobectomy for Solitary Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma
To evaluate the clinical outcomes of image-guided thermal ablation versus thyroid lobectomy for the treatment of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma
Papillary Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: thyroid lobectomy|PROCEDURE: image-guided thermal ablation
disease progression, cervical lymph node metastases, recurrent tumors and persistent tumors, more than 5 years|disease-free survival, disease-free survival calculated from treatment initiation to disease progression or the last follow-up date, more than 5 years
complications, complications after surgery or ablation, 1 week|procedure time, Ablation procedure time was defined from US evaluation for the design of insertion way to treatment terminated. Lobectomy procedure time was defined from incision to closure, not including the anesthesia time., 1 hour after treatment|cost, The ablation cost included preoperative examinations, treatment, local anesthesia and ablation needle costs. The lobectomy cost included preoperative examinations, treatment, general anesthesia, hospital bed, nursing and postoperative medication, 1 week|estimated blood loss, estimated blood loss after surgery or ablation, 1 hour|hospitalization, hospitalization for surgery or ablation, 1 week
