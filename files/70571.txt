A Study for Participants Who Participated in Prior Clinical Studies of ASTX727 (Standard Dose)
Extension study to provide ongoing long-term treatment with ASTX727 for participants who were benefitting from ASTX727 treatment in a previous Taiho (formerly Astex)-sponsored clinical study of ASTX727 (including, but not limited to ASTX727-01 \[NCT02103478\], ASTX727-02 \[NCT03306264\], ASTX727-04 \[NCT03813186\]), ASTX727-06 \[NCT04093570\] food effect substudy, ASTX727-17 \[NCT04953897\], and ASTX727-18 \[NCT04953910\] to obtain long-term safety information.

The purpose of the Food Effect Substudy was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of decitabine and cedazuridine when ASTX727 was given under fed (high-calorie/high-fat meal or low-calorie/low-fat meal) versus fasted conditions. Food Effect Substudy has now completed.

DRUG: ASTX727
Main Extension Study: Safety: Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal finding in laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. TEAEs are defined as events that first occur or worsen on or after the date of the first study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or the start of an alternative anticancer treatment, whichever first., From date of transition into this extension study until 30 days following the last dose, up to approximately 2 years|Food Effect Substudy: AUC0-last: Area Under the Plasma

Food Effect Substudy: Percentage of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), by Severity, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal finding in laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. TEAEs are defined as events that first occur or worsen on or after the date of the first study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or the start of an alternative anticancer treatment, whichever first. Severity of TEAEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03)., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose (Up to approximately 65 days)|Food Effect Substudy: Percentage of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormal Laboratory Values, The laboratory parameters of hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis were assessed., From Day 1 up to Day 28 in Cycle 1 (Up to 28 days)
Main Extension Study: Participants will attend clinic visits on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle to undergo study procedures and to be given ASTX727 tablets for Days 1-5 of that dose cycle. Participants should continue to receive the same ASTX727 dose and regimen they were receiving in the last cycle of the parent study in which they were originally enrolled. Subsequent treatment delays and/or dose reductions are at the discretion of the investigator as guided by the dose adjustment guidelines of the parent study protocol.

Food Effect Substudy: Participants received ASTX727 once daily on Days 1 through 5 followed by a 23-day treatment-free period in a 28-day cycle (Cycle 1). Participants received either a high-calorie, high-fat breakfast meal (Arm A) or a low-calorie/low-fat breakfast meal (Arm B) predose on Day 4. Participants in Arms A and B received ASTX727 on Days 1, 2, 3, and 5 in the fasted condition. Participants may continue treatment with ASTX727 in Cycle 2 onwards in the ASTX727-06 study at the Investigator's discretion, where they continued to receive ASTX727. This substudy consists of a 21-day Screening Period, a 1-cycle (28 days) Treatment Period, and a 30-day (+7 days) Safety Follow-up Period (only if the participant discontinues from the ASTX727-06 food effect substudy and does not continue to receive ASTX727 in the ASTX727-06 study).
