Intratumoral Injection of PV-001-DV Plus DC in Patients With Melanoma
The purpose of this arm of the study is to evaluate the safety of PV-001-DC (autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate) when given in combination with PV-001-DV (Dengue Virus-1 strain #45AZ5) at the dose levels that were identified in the prior 2 arms and to determine if the combination can treat advanced melanoma.

Patients will have a prescribed amount of PV-001-DV injected into one of their melanoma tumors. Patients will go to the clinic and have a needle placed in a vein. The PV-001-DC product will be infused into the patient's vein. Approximately every 3 weeks, for a total of 4 treatments, patients will receive additional infusions of PV-001-DC Patients will be at the clinic for at least 1 hour following the end of each PV-001-DC infusion and if they feel fine, they may go home.

Approximately 49 days after the first infusion, patients will have a scan to see if their tumors have changed in size. Other scans may be performed during the study at different times. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested for changes to the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that patient.

BIOLOGICAL: Dengue Virus-1 #45AZ5 (PV-001-DV)|BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Monocyte-derived Lysate Pulsed Dendritic Cells (PV-001-DC)
Incidence and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event Incidence of patients receiving intratumoral injection of PV-001-DV in combination with IV infusion of PV-001-DC, 365 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Tumor response will be measured per investigator's assessment according to RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 365 days|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time during the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse, up to the end of the study, 365 days|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is measured from the date of enrollment to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date, up to the end of the study, 365 days
