Phase 1 Study of LOP628 in Adult Patients With cKit-positive Solid Tumors and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
LOP628 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of an anti-cKit humanized IgG1/κ antibody conjugated to a maytansine payload via a non-cleavable linker.

LOP628 provides an opportunity to target cKit overexpressing tumors.
