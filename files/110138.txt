A Study of Sintilimab Compared With Docetaxel or Pemetrexed as Second-line Treatment for Patients With Stage IV Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Failure With Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy
This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab compared with docetaxel or pemetrexed as second-line treatment for patients with stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type EGFR after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Treatment may continue as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression.
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for participants who were not reported as dead at the time of analysis was censored at the date when they were last known to be alive., Approximately 21 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed objective tumor response, complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Approximately 21 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was determined based on investigator assessment using response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Approximately 21 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR was defined as the duration from the first tumor assessment that supports the participant's objective response (CR or PR, whichever is first recorded) to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 21 months|Emergence of adverse events(AEs), AEs graded using CTCAE (Version 4.0) criteria., Approximately 21 months
