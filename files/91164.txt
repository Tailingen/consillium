Value of the Combination Ultrasonography With Ti-RADS Score / Dual Tracer Scintigraphy MIBI-Tc99m/Iodine-123 in the Detection of Malignancy of Thyroid Nodules (≥15 mm) Classified Bethesda III or IV on Cytology
The main objective of the study is to show that the addition of ultrasonography to the dual tracer scintigraphy MIBI-Tc99m/Iodine-123 will increase (at least +5%) the negative predictive value compared to the dual tracer scintigraphy alone in detection of malignancy in thyroid nodules ≥15 mm classified as Bethesda III-IV on cytology.
