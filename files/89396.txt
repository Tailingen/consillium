It has been shown that women who undergo diagnostic tests or screening of their mammary glands present symptoms associated with anxiety, concerns regarding a possible positive result for malignancy, as well as emotional distress. It is important to generate psychological programs aimed at reducing the psychological consequences of the diagnostic evaluation and/or screening of mammary glands because there are few approaches on the subject.

In Mexico there are breast clinics of the Mexican Social Security Institute, designed to perform screening tests and diagnostic evaluation of mammary glands, with the aim of identifying cases of breast cancer in early stages. However, few psychological interventions have been reported during the diagnostic process, so it is important to know the psychological affectations presented by women who undergo these tests. Given this, this intervention has the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of an online psychological care program to reduce psychological distress and increase the sense of coherence in the process of diagnostic evaluation of mammary glands in women who attend a breast clinic.

In the intervention there will be two groups: a) experimental group and b) control group.

The experimental group will receive online psychological care through the virtual platform and the patients in the control group will be given visual material with the information.

All participants will be invited to attend the breast clinic and undergo screening studies and/or diagnostic evaluation. For the assignment of the experimental and control group, it will be carried out through a randomization process through the Excel program.
