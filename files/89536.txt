Study to Evaluate Progression Free Survival in Cancer Patients With Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma With AMT2003
The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of AMT2003 in cancer patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.

The primary endpoint is progression free survival rate at 18 weeks after registration
Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: AMT2003
Progression free survival;at 18 weeks after registration, 2010
Best overall response rate (ORR, CR and PR) within 18 weeks after registration, 2010|Progression Free survival time (PFS), over complete observation period, 2010|Overall Survival (OS) time, 2010|Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Performance Status (Karnofsky Index), 2010|Safety and Tolerability, 2010
The study will include patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy exists. Eligible patients must have had at least second-line chemotherapy.
