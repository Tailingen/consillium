The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of satri-cel as consolidation therapy after postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint is the frequency, type, severity and outcome of AE/SAE/AESI, which is the routine assessment indicators for evaluating the safety and tolerability of the investigational product in clinical trials.
