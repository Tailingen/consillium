Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Surgery in Stage IIB Cervical Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and radical surgery (RS) may have a possible better outcome to concurrent chemoirradiation (CCRT) in stage IIB cervical cancer. We try to verify such a hypothesis in terms of survival and treatment related morbidity.
Cervical Carcinoma Stage IIB
RADIATION: Concurrent chemoirradiation|DRUG: Paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: Radical Surgery|DRUG: Cisplatin
Disease free survival, 5 years
Overall survival, 5 years
Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB cervical cancer are eligible for our study. They will receive cisplatin based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) 3 cycles followed by radical surgery (RS) (type III to V radical hysterectomy plus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy) (arm A) or external beam radiation (EBRT) with concurrent weekly platinum 40mg/m2 followed by brachyradiotherapy (arm B).
