Molecular Imaging of DNA Damage Response by [18F]-Olaparib PET
This is a single-centre, non-randomized, two-stage design, proof-of-concept study evaluating the radiolabelled PARP inhibitor \[18F\]-olaparib als potential tracer for imaging of tumour PARP expression by PET.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: [18F]-olaparib PET scan
Dosimetry assessment, Assess dosimetry, most optimal time point for imaging (Stage I), and safety of \[18F\]olaparib PET (Stage I + II), 6-12 months|Correlation between tumour uptake and expression, Determine the correlation between tumour \[18F\]-olaparib uptake and tumour PARP-1 expression levels on tumour biopsy (Stage I + II)., 12-18 months
Evaluation of changes in tumour uptake, Evaluate changes in tumour \[18F\]-olaparib uptake, as a read-out of DNA damage, during treatment with platinum-based chemoradio-therapy, and its correlation with changes in PARP protein expression (Stage II)., 12-18 months
