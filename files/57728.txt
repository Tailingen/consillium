Cisplatin and RT With or Without Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced NPC
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy my kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well giving cisplatin together with radiation therapy works compared with giving cisplatin and radiation therapy together with gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in treating patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To compare the 5-year overall survival of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer treated with concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy with vs without induction chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.

Secondary

* To assess and compare the disease-free survival, distant metastases rate, toxicities, and quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by N-stage (N0-1 vs N2-3) and are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours once weekly on weeks 1-8 and undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 1-7 (6Â½ weeks for a total of 33 fractions).
* Arm II: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, carboplatin IV over 1 hour, and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Beginning at least 3 weeks after the last dose of induction chemotherapy, patients receive cisplatin and undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.

Quality of life is assessed periodically.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
