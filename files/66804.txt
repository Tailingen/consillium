Study of S 95005 in Combination With Oxaliplatin in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of S 95005 given in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Antitumor activity assessed by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen), through study completion, an average of 9 months|Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab or nivolumab., Adverse event reporting will be graded following the National Cancer Institute of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03, through study completion, an average of 9 months|Changes in standard hematology as a measure of safety and tolerability for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab or nivolumab., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Changes in biochemistry as a measure of safety and tolerability for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab or nivolumab., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Changes in coagulation as a measure of safety and tolerability for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Changes in urinalysis as a measure of safety and tolerability for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab or nivolumab., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Changes in vital signs as a measure of safety for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab or nivolumab., Vital sign measurements will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Changes in ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status as a measure of safety and tolerability for S95005-oxaliplatin + bevacizumab or nivolumab., through study completion, an average of 9 months|PDL-1 expression, tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cell density, for S95005-oxaliplatin + nivolumab, Tumour biopsy at baseline and at the end of Cycle 4, up to 8 weeks after the first treatment administration
Circulating protein biomarkers analysis, Samples collected at C1D1 (day 1 of cycle 1) and at withdrawal will be subjected to proteomic analysis for identification of potential predictive and resistance biomarkers for S 95005 and/or oxaliplatin response or biological activity., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Circulating tumour DNA analysis, Samples collected at C1D1 will be subjected to genomic analysis to study mutations currently observed in colorectal cancer, day 1 of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Circulating protein biomarkers in relation to ICD (immune cell death), Samples collected at C1D1, C2D1, C3D1 and C5D1 pre-dose then every 4 cycles will be subjected to proteomic analysis to measure immune cell death (ICD) biomarkers potentially induced by the treatment S95005-oxaliplatin + nivolumab., through study completion, an average of 9 months|Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Samples collected at C1D1 and C5D1 will be subject to analysis for identification of lymphocytes cells phenotypes, for S95005-oxaliplatin + nivolumab, up to 10 weeks after the first treatment administration
This is a one-arm study, which will be conducted in 2 parts:

* A dose-escalation part to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of S 95005 in combination with oxaliplatin.
* An expansion part in patients treated at the recommended dose defined in the dose escalation part of this study to evaluate the safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of S 95005 in combination with oxaliplatin and either bevacizumab or nivolumab.
