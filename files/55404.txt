A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Antitumor Activity of X4P-001 in Combination With TNBC
Objectives Phase 1b

Primary Objectives:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of X4P-001 combined with toriplimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC

Secondary Objectives:

1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of X4P-001 alone or combined with toriplimab
2. To characterize the antitumor activity of X4P-001 in combination with toriplimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC(according to RECIST 1.1)
3. To characterize the overall survival of X4P-001 in combination with toriplimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC
4. To characterize the immunogenicity of toriplimab when administrated in combination with X4P-001
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: X4P-001
CT, resist 1.1 evaluation, Screening|CT, resist 1.1 evaluation, C3D1 (12 weeks)
Exploratory Objectives:

1. To explore selected biomarkers in peripheral blood and tumor samples that potentially correlate with clinical response to X4P-001 and toriplimab combination treatment
2. To characterize the antitumor activity of X4P-001 in combination with toriplimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC(according to iRECIST 1.1)
