Clinical Study of GT201 in the Treatment of Advanced Gynecological Tumors
This study is an early exploration clinical study with one arm. The study consists of two stages, namely the dose escalation stage and the dose extension stage:
Adult Gynecological Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte injection（GT201）
Objective Response Rate, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, 3 years|Incidence and severity of adcersed events per CTCAE 5.0, To characterize the safety profile of autologous TIL injection（GT201) in patients with relapsed/metastatic advanced solid tumor as measured by the incidence and severity of adcersed events per CTCAE 5.0, 3 years|Progression-Free Survival, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, 3 years
