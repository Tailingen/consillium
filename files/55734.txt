Protective Effect of Pentoxifylline Against Chemotherapy Induced Toxicities in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
This study aims to:

- Evaluate the possible protective effect of pentoxifylline against oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy and chemotherapy induced mucositis in patients with stage II and stage III colorectal cancer.

This study will be a randomized placebo controlled parallel study.48 patients with colorectal cancer will be randomized to 2 groups:

Group I (control group; n=24) which will receive 12 cycles of FOLFOX-6 regimen plus placebo tablets twice daily. Group II (Pentoxiphylline group; n=24) which will receive FOLFOX-6 regimen in addition to pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily.

Blood sample collection and biochemical assessment:

* Malondialdehyde (MDA) as oxidative stress marker (colorimetry).
* Tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α) as pro inflammatory marker (ELISA).
* Neurotensin (NT) as a potential marker for neuropathic pain (ELISA).
* Citrulline as a biomarker for mucositis (ELISA).

Clinical assessment of oxaliplatin induced neuropathy will be done through:

The assessment of the severity of neuropathic pain through "Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form" at baseline and by the end of every two chemotherapy cycles.

The implication of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, Version 5, 2017) for grading of neuropathy every 2 cycles. The use of Neurotoxicity- 12 item questionnaire score (Ntx-12) from the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group at baseline and by the end of every two chemotherapy cycles).

Mucositis will be assessed at baseline and by the end of every two chemotherapy cycles through the use of common terminology criteria for adverse events "CTCAE, version 5.00, 2017

percentage of patients with peripheral sensory neuropathy grade ≥ 2, Grading according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology. there are 5 grades; Grade (1) is asymptomatic may be accompanied by loss of tendon reflex or paresthesia. Grade (2) is moderate symptoms which limit instrumental activities of daily life Grade (3) is severe symptoms which limit self-care activates of daily life. Grade (4) is life threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade (5) is death.

Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, Version 5, 2017), 6 months|variation of 12-item neurotoxicity questionnaire (Ntx- 12) total score, the Ntx-12 questionnaire is comprised of 12 statements intended to measure the severity and impact of peripheral sensory neuropathy on patients' lives. Patients will be instructed to complete the Arabic version of the Ntx-12 and choose the number corresponding to how true each statement was for them using a likert-type scale, with 0 indicating not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; and 4, very much, 6 months|variation in grades of mucositis, Mucositis will be assessed through the use of common terminology criteria for adverse events "CTCAE, version 5.00, 2017". Grade (1) is Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; intervention not indicated. Grade (2) is Moderate pain or ulcer that does not interfere with oral intake; modified diet indicated. Grade (3) is Severe pain, interfering with oral intake. Grade (4) is Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade (5) is Death., 6 months

Mucositis will be assessed at baseline and by the end of every two chemotherapy cycles through the use of common terminology criteria for adverse events "CTCAE, version 5.00, 2017. Assessment of participants' adherence, side effects and tolerability Pentoxiphylline will be provided on biweekly basis and the participants' adherence will be assessed through counting the returned tablets. Participants will be followed-up by weekly telephone calls and direct meetings during chemotherapy cycles to assess their adherence and to report any drug related adverse effects. The adverse effects will be collected and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events "NCI-CTCAE; version 5, 2017". Participants will be considered non- adherent and excluded from the study if not consumed the provided tablets or lost the follow-up meeting at any time of intervention or changed regimen.

The primary and secondary endpoints:

The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with peripheral sensory neuropathy grade ≥ 2, the variation of 12-item neurotoxicity questionnaire (Ntx- 12) total score and the variation in grades of mucositis. The secondary endpoint is the change in the serum concentrations of the measured biological markers.

Sample size calculation:

According to the results of previous studies, the total number of subjects required to detect the effect of neuro-protective drugs in patients received neuro- toxic chemotherapy was 41 patients with 5% significance, 80% statistical power and an attrition of 15 %. In this context, during the current study, a total sample size of 41 patients in both arms will be sufficient to detect the effect. Assuming that the attrition rate will be 15 %, the initial sample size will be 48 patients in both arms with 24 patients in each arm.

Ethical approval:

The study will be performed in accordance with the ethical standards of Helsinki declaration in 1964 and its later amendments. The study will be approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tanta University. The study will be registered as a clinical trial at ClinicalTrials.gov. All participants will be informed about the benefits and risks of the study. Any unexpected risks that will appear during the course of the research will be clarified to the participants and to the ethical committee on time. The data of the enrolled patients will be confidential. All enrolled patients will give their written informed consents. The study will be conducted between October 2022 and October 2024.
