DS-1205c With Osimertinib for Metastatic or Unresectable Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

The primary objectives are:

* For Dose Escalation, to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1205c when combined with osimertinib in the study population and to determine the recommended dose for expansion of DS-1205c when combined with osimertinib in the study population
* For Dose Expansion, to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1205c when combined with osimertinib in the study population

In Dose Escalation, after a 7-day run in period (Cycle 0), there will be 21-day cycles (Cycle 1 onward). In Dose Expansion, there will be 21-day cycles.

The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants will continue study treatment until they decide not to (withdraw consent), their disease gets worse \[progressive disease (PD)\], or side effects become unacceptable (unacceptable toxicity).
