Predicting Adenomatous Polyps in the Colon Using Images of a Human Tongue
This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical investigation designed to evaluate the accuracy of the Gixam™ System in identifying subjects with colorectal adenomas compared to optical colonoscopy. Subjects arriving for a standard of care colonoscopy at the investigation site will be offered to participate in the study. Following an informed consent process, images of the subjects' tongue will be obtained with the Gixam™ System and a prediction score will be generated by the Gixam™ AI model. Subjects will thereafter proceed to their SOC colonoscopy, and the Gixam™ score will be compare with colonoscopy findings to evaluate its performance.
Colorectal Neoplasms|Gastrointestinal Microbiome
DEVICE: Gixam
Primary Safety Endpoint - Number of device related adverse events and serious adverse events, 1 day|Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Gixam's diagnostic accuracy, Gixam's diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of adenomatous colorectal polyps.

The Gixam's predictive value will be compared to the patient's colonoscopy + pathology (if any specimens are collected) findings as ground truth on a binary basis (YES/NO for adenomatous and sessile serrated polyps)., 14 days (till pathology report is received)
