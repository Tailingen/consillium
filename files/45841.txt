Efficacy and Safety Trial of Topical Resiquimod Gel (0.06%) in Patients With Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma
The primary objective is the observation and description of the preliminary efficacy of resiquimod gel 0.06% on a single nodular basal cell carcinoma (nBCC) in a small group of patients.
Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: 0.06% Resiquimod Gel - A|DRUG: 0.06% Resiquimod Gel - B|DRUG: 0.06% Resiquimod Gel - C
Histological Cure Rate, 8 weeks after a maximal treatment period of 4 weeks
Complete Clinical Clearance Rate, 8 weeks after the 4 weeks treatment period|Evaluation of Local Tolerability by Means of 5-point Scales, local skin reactions as erythema, edema, erosion/ulceration, exudate, dryness, encrustation judged by investigator by means of 5-point scales (0 = absent, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe)., up to 12 weeks|Evaluation of Systemic Tolerability Based on Haematology and Blood Chemistry Values and Vital Signs, up to 12 weeks|Global Judgment of Tolerability by Investigator by Means of a 6-point Scale, 8 weeks after a maximal treatment period of 4 weeks
efficacy assessments:

* Histopathological findings based on the biopsies of the primary tumor location and the tissue excision at the end of trial (histological cure).
* Description of the clinical-therapeutic effect of resiquimod on nBCC (nodular-basal cell carcinoma) by visual inspection (clinical evaluation of treatment area and assessment of complete clinical clearance)
* RNA-analysis (analysis of gene expressions for cytokines, cytotoxic and apoptotic signals)
* Investigator's global judgment of efficacy by means of a 7-point scale

Safety assessments:

* Evaluation of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
* Evaluation of local tolerability (local skin reactions as erythema, edema, erosion/ulceration, exsudate, dryness, encrustation) by means of symptom scoring scales (0 = absent, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe).
* Evaluation of systemic tolerability \[hematology (erythrocytes, leucocytes including neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes), blood chemistry (alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (ASAT), alanine transaminase (ALAT), serum creatinine), vital signs\]. The thresholds concerning laboratory abnormalities that determine patient's discontinuation from trial were predefined upfront.
* Evaluation of the number of patients withdrawn from the trial
* Investigator's global judgment of tolerability by means of a 6-point scale
* Photographic documentation of the treatment area

Exploratory parameter:

* C-reactive protein (CRP)
* Interferon-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha (up-regulation of gene expression)
* Immunohistochemistry and characterization of cell types (CD8, T-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells)
* In addition, blood serum samples will be preserved and frozen for later tests that will be specified to the patients. The preserved material will be stored for a maximum of 2 years.
