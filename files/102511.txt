This is a prospective, multi-center open-label dose escalation, dose expansion study of \[212Pb\]VMT-α-NET in up to 160 adult subjects with unresectable or metastatic SSTR2-expressing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) who have not received prior peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

The radioactivity dose escalation period (Phase I) tests up to 4 escalating radioactivity dose cohorts of up to 8 subjects (administered at approximately 8-week intervals) at the assigned cohort radioactivity dose.

Pre-specified dose adjustments and individual stopping rules for repeat treatment cycles are based on observed dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and adverse events (AEs).

Additionally, up to 40 subjects may be enrolled in each of the cohorts.

The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined based on observed DLTs within 42 days of the first treatment cycle.

The recommended expansion (Phase IIa) dose(s) will be determined following a holistic analysis of observed DLTs, AEs, estimated cumulative organ radiation exposure, and efficacy signals over the course of all treatment cycles for all dose cohorts.

If MTD can not be identified within the 4 radioactivity dose cohorts, a Maximum Feasible Dose (MFD), incorporating manufacturing and logistical considerations for \[212Pb\]VMT-α-NET production, may be determined.

Up to 120 subjects will be considered for enrollment in the dose-expansion phase (Phase IIa) with approximately 100 subjects with GEP-NETs, approximately 10 subjects with bronchial NETs \[small cell lung cancer\], and approximately 10 subjects with pheochromocytoma or paragangliomas)

Reno-protective amino acids will be co-administered in a separate IV line prior to each \[212Pb\]VMT-α-NET dose in all subjects. Escalation will be based on a modified toxicity probability interval design \[mTPI-2\] until MTD is identified or the pre-specified rules are met.

A lead-in dosimetry sub-study will be conducted during the dose escalation period in which all subjects in the first two dose cohorts will undergo dosimetric evaluation prior to receiving the therapeutic agent.
