Phase II Trial of Zanubrutinib, Obinutuzumab, Bendamustine (ZGB) as First-Line Therapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Single-Center Study
This is a single arm, open label, national multicenter clinical study included patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The treatment combines three medications: Zanubrutinib , Obinutuzumab and Bendamustine . Together, these drugs aim to achieve deep remission (no detectable cancer cells) and allow a shorter treatment duration compared to lifelong therapies.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Bendamustine
Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease (uMRD) Rate, Proportion of participants achieving uMRD (defined as \<1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes \[\<0.01%\] via 8-color flow cytometry) in peripheral blood after 6 cycles of therapy., Assessed at the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle = 28 days).
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or partial response with lymphocytosis (PR-L) per iwCLL 2018 criteria., Assessed every 2 cycles during treatment and confirmed at Cycle 6 (each cycle = 28 days)|Complete Response Rate (CRR), Proportion of participants achieving CR (normalization of blood counts, lymph nodes/spleen size, and bone marrow with \<30% lymphocytes)., Assessed every 2 cycles during treatment and confirmed at Cycle 6 (each cycle = 28 days)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from enrollment to disease progression (per iwCLL 2018) or death from any cause., Evaluated every 3 months post-treatment for up to 3 years.|Overall Survival (OS), Time from enrollment to death from any cause., Follow-up until study completion (3 years).|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Frequency and severity of adverse events graded per NCI CTCAE v5.0., From first dose to 30 days after last dose.
