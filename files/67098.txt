Neoadjuvant Nimotuzumab Plus Gemcitabine and Carboplatin in Unresectable Stage III Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is studying induction nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. Nimotuzumab, a human anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, has shown its efficacy in the treatment of head/neck squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma as well as lung cancer. This study is studying neoadjuvant nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung carcinoma.
