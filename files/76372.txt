A Study of ASP2215 in Combination With Erlotinib in Subjects With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Activating Mutation-Positive (EGFRm+) Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Who Have Acquired Resistance to an EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)
The purpose of the Phase 1b part of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP2215 in combination with erlotinib and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP2215. The purpose of the Phase 2 part of the study was to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of the RP2D of ASP2215 in combination with erlotinib.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Gilteritinib|DRUG: Erlotinib
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Cycle 1 and Cycle â‰¥2 (up to 141 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event (AE) that started after administration of the study drugs and occurred within 30 days of the last dose of the study drugs. If a participant experienced an event both during the preinvestigational period and during the investigational period, the event was considered a TEAE only if it worsened in severity., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study (maximum study drug exposure 114 days)

Only patients with measurable disease at baseline were to be included in the analysis of ORR., End of treatment (approximately 4 months)
No patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study. Phase 2 endpoints were not analyzed.
