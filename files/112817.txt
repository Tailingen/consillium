A Phase I Study of BR790 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BR790 tablets as an oral monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and to determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II clinical trial dose (RP2D) .The study is divided into two phases: dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase.
