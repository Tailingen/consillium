A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Weekly Procrit Given to Gastric or Rectal Patients
To demonstrate the effectiveness of epoetin alfa on reduction in red blood cell transfusions in gastric and rectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery.
Gastrointestinal Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Procrit (epoetin alfa)
Number of Patients with Reduction in Red Blood Cell Transfusions, 2 years|Patient Iron Levels, Iron stores drawn at baseline and every four weeks., Every 4 weeks
Anemia and fatigue are common problems in gastric and rectal cancer subjects at the completion of chemoradiation therapy and surgery. Results of several studies in cancer subjects suggest that treatment with epoetin alfa may be effective in maintaining hemoglobin levels, thereby reducing fatigue, decreasing transfusion requirement, and potentially improving quality of life.
