Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export, Selinexor (KPT-330) in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Patients With Advanced Ovarian or Endometrial Cancers
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the investigational drug, selinexor (KPT-330), in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy, where paclitaxel will be given at two different dosing schedules and selinexor will be given at two different dosing schedules. Carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy is a commonly used therapy for the treatment of advanced or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, selinexor has on the patient and the cancer.
