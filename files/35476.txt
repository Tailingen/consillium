Personalized Trial in ctDNA-level-relapse Glioblastoma
Tumor in situ fluid (TISF) refers to the fluid within the surgical cavity of patients with glioblastoma. Postoperative serial TISF is collected for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis and identifying ctDNA-level relapse driven by one or a set of specific genomic alterations before overt imaging recurrence of the tumor. This single-arm open-label prospective pilot feasibility trial recruiting 20 adult patients with ctDNA-level-relapse glioblastoma who are assigned to receive the personalized study treatment based on the genetic profile of their serial TISF ctDNA. It will be aimed to test whether the personalized intervention can prolong the progression-free and overall survival and the feasibility of conducting a full-scale trial.
Glioblastoma
OTHER: Individualized intervention based on genomic alterations
Progression-free survival at 6 months, The proportion of participants in the analysis population who remain progression-free for at least six months following initiation of study therapy., Up to six months after beginning treatment|Overall survival rate at 18 months, OS-18 is the proportion of participants in the analysis population who remain alive for at least twelve months following initiation of study therapy., Up to 18 months after beginning therapy
Overall survival, overall survival, as defined as time from beginning of treatment to death., Up to 3 years after beginning treatment|Progression-free survival, Median time from allocation to first documented disease progression as per the response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years after beginning treatment
