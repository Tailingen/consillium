Lenvatinib in Combination With Carboplatin Pemetrexed and Pembrolizumab for NSCLC With EGFR Mutations
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pemetrexed + carboplatin + pembrolizumab (MK-3475) with lenvatinib (MK-7902/E7080) in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR according to RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 18 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1., ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 18 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 30 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the time of death from any cause. OS will be presented., Up to approximately 30 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1., For participants who demonstrated CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 30 months|Number of Participants with One or More Adverse Events, An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to approximately 30 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1., ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or Stable Disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 18 months
