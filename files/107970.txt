A Phase I/II Study of CP-4055 in Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies
Patients with refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies will receive CP-4055 intravenously(IV) on Day 1-5 every three weeks until complete response or disease worsening/progressing
Hematologic Malignancies|AML
DRUG: CP-4055|DRUG: CP-4055
Phase I: Determine the MTD and PK properties of CP-4055 single agent., Q4 2007|Phase II: Determine the efficacy of CP-4055 single agent in AML, Q4 2007
Phase I: Evaluate the safety profile of CP-4055 single agent., Q4 2007|Determine the MTD and PK of CP-4055 in combination with idarubicin., Q2 2008|Phase II: Extended evaluation of the safety profile of CP-4055 single agent in AML, Q2 2008
This is a multicentre clinical study conducted in the USA and in Europe. It is an open label, dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of CP-4055 as a single agent when administered as a 2 hours intravenous (IV) or a continuous IV (CIV) infusion administered daily for 5 days in a 21-day cycle, either alone or with idarubicin IV, in patients with refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies who have either failed potentially curative therapy or are considered unsuitable for standard therapy.

In a second phase of the study the efficacy of single agent CP-4055 in patients with AML may be assessed.

It is intended that patients receive a minimum of two cycles of therapy in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or significant disease progression.
