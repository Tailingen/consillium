Procalcitonin Test for Differentiation of the Cause of Pneumonia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin test for differentiation of the cause of pneumonia in patients with cancer.
Procalcitonin|Pneumonia|Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: procalcitonin test
Procalcitonin level according to the cause of pneumonia in patients with cancer, bacterial pneumonia vs. radiation pneumonitis vs chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis, procalcitonin level is checked within 24hours after visiting hospital
Influence of neutropenia on procalcitonin level in patients with baterial pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia with neutropenia vs. without neutropenia, procalcitonin level is checked within 24hours after visiting hospital|procalcitonin level in patients with atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia vs tuberculosis vs fungal infection, procalcitonin level is checked within 24hours after visiting hospital
Serum procalcitonin test is currently used as the biomarker for bacterial infection. Especially, procalcitonin test has been reported to be helpful in differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia, acute exacerbations of interstitial pneumonitis or chronic obstructive lung disease. However, it is not known whether procalcitonin test can help distinguish bacterial pneumonia from non-bacterial pneumonia such as radiation pneumonitis or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis in patients with cancer.

The aim of this prospective cohort study is to observe the clinical benefits of procalcitonin test for differentiation of the cause of pneumonia in patients with cancer.
