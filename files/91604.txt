ORR is defined as the sum of obtained PR and CR and the CBR is defined as the sum of PR, CR and SD maintained for at least six months. DCR is defined as the sum of PR, CR and SD., From the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of death from any cause or last follow-up (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)|PFS rate in eribulin-treated breast cancer participants comparing early (≤ third line) to late (≥ fourth line) use, PFS is defined as the time from the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Participants without progression will be censored, progression free at the date of late follow-up., From the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of disease progression or death from any cause (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)|OS in eribulin-treated breast cancer participants comparing early (≤ third line) to late (≥ fourth line) use, OS is defined as the time from the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of death from any cause or last follow-up., From the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of death from any cause or last follow-up (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)|TTF in eribulin-treated breast cancer participants comparing early (≤ third line) to late (≥ fourth line) use, TTF is defined as a time from first treatment with eribulin to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death., From the first treatment with eribulin to discontinuation of treatment for any reason (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)|TRR in eribulin-treated breast cancer participants comparing early (≤third line) to late (≥ fourth line) use, TRR will be evaluated by medical records. ORR is defined as the sum of obtained (PR) and CR and the CBR is defined as the sum of PR, CR and SD maintained for at least 6 months. DCR is defined as the sum of PR, CR and SD., From the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of death from any cause or last follow-up (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)|Number of participants with the indicated action to TEAEs, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous., 6 months|Number of participants with TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of eribulin, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous., 6 months|Number of participants using supportive drugs to treat AEs, Treatment of adverse events will be collected retrospectively., 6 months|Median number of eribulin cycles, Data will be collected to observe a treatment pattern of eribulin in the real world., 6 months|Number of participants experiencing a dose reduction, Data will be collected to observe a treatment pattern of eribulin in the real world., 6 months|Mean duration of treatment, Duration of treatment is defined as the time from documentation of the start of eribulin treatment to the date of permanent discontinuation., 6 months|Mean duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause., 6 months|Mean dose intensity, Dose intensity is defined as the amount of drug milligrams per meters squared (mg/m\^2) delivered to a participant in a week of treatment., 6 months|Number of participants with the indicated reason for treatment discontinuation, Data will be collected to observe a treatment pattern of eribulin in the real world., 6 months
