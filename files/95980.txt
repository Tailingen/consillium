TRial to EvaluAte Tranexamic Acid Therapy in Thrombocytopenia
The purpose of this study is to test whether giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving treatment for blood cancers reduces the risk of bleeding or death, and the need for platelet transfusions. Patients will be randomised to receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously through a drip, or orally) or a placebo.

DRUG: Tranexamic acid (TXA).|DRUG: Placebo
The proportion of patients who die or have bleeding of WHO grade 2 or above by WHO criteria during the first 30 days from the first dose of trial treatment, or planned first dose for those participants who do not receive treatment., The proportion of patients who die or have bleeding of WHO grade 2 or above by WHO criteria during the first 30 days from the first dose of trial treatment, or planned first dose for those participants who do not receive treatment.

A time-to-event analysis will be used to determine this proportion to ensure that all patients are included in the primary outcome analysis, not just those who are followed up for the full 30 days. Any patients lost to follow-up will be included in the analysis and censored at the time that they were lost., The first 30 days from first dose of trial treatment

All-cause mortality during the first 30 days and 120 days after the first dose of trial treatment is administered, Measured by calculating number of deaths in first 30 days and 120 days after Treatment Day 1 i.e the first day that the IMP is administered., Up to and including 120 days from the first administration of IMP.|Death due to thrombosis during the first 120 days after the first dose of trial treatment is administered., Measured by calculating number of deaths due to thrombosis during the first 120 days after Treatment Day 1 i.e the first day that the IMP is administered., Up to and including 120 days from the first administration of IMP.|Death due to bleeding during the first 30 days after the first dose of trial treatment is administered., Measured by calculating number of deaths due to bleeding during the first 30 days, Up to and including 30 days from the first administration of IMP.|Number of serious adverse events (SAE) from first administration of trial treatment until 60 days after the first dose of trial treatment is administered., Measured by calculating the total number of SAE's reported from first administration of IMP., Up to and including 60 days from the first administration of IMP.

Patients with cancers of the blood often develop low blood cell counts either as a consequence of the disease or the treatment by chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Platelet transfusions are commonly given to raise any low platelet count and reduce the risk of clinical bleeding (prophylaxis) or stop active bleeding (therapy). But recent studies have indicated that many patients continue to experience bleeding, despite the use of platelet transfusions. Tranexamic acid is a type of drug that is called an antifibrinolytic. These drugs act to reduce the breakdown of clots formed in response to bleeding. These drugs have been used widely in both elective and emergency surgery and have been shown to decrease blood loss and the use of red cell transfusions. The purpose of this study is to test whether giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving treatment for blood cancers reduces the risk of bleeding or death, and the need for platelet transfusions. Patients will be randomised to receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously through a drip, or orally) or a placebo. The investigators will measure the rates of bleeding daily using a short structured assessment of bleeding and will record the number of transfusions given to patients.
