A Phase I Study of the Chimeric Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibody ChiLob 7/4 to Treat Advanced Malignancies Refractory to Conventional Anti-cancer Treatment
The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and the biological effects of the chimeric anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody Chi Lob 7/4, given intravenously, weekly for 4 weeks in the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies refractory to conventional anti-cancer treatment.

DRUG: Chi Lob 7/4 (A chimeric monoclonal antibody)
1. To establish the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of ChiLob 7/4 ;, Defined as the dose below the dose at which no more 30% (2 of up to 6 patients in the cohort) , experienced a DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) due to ChiLob 7/4 occurring during the treatment period and up to 4 week's post treatment.|2. To determine the Biologically Active Dose of Chi Lob 7/4, which is defined as the dose level at which peripheral blood B-cells are reduced by the end of therapy to 10% or less of the starting number.|3. To determine the toxicity profile of Chi Lob 7/4 (CTCAE version 3.0) and to identify the dose limiting toxicity|4. To propose a safe dose for Phase II evaluation
1. To examine the Biological effects of ChiLob 7/4 Treatment|2. To examine the Pharmacokinetics of ChiLob 7/4 treatment: (Measurement of Serum Chi Lob 7/4)|3. To examine the Possible Anti-Tumour activity of Chi Lob 7/4 (RECIST 1.0 criteria)
The primary objective of the study is to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose of Chi Lob 7/4. In line with other established antineoplastic, chimeric monoclonal antibody therapies such as Rituximab, Chi Lob 7/4 will be given by slow intravenous infusion once every week for a total of four weeks. This treatment regimen will facilitate early, rapid and dose dense administration of antibody to a patient group with advanced malignancy refractory to conventional treatment. The starting dose for each infusion of Chi Lob 7/4 will be 0.5mg (giving a total dose per patient of 2mg divided over 4 weeks). Escalation from one treatment dose level to another will only be permitted when at least 3 patients have completed treatment without dose limiting toxicity.
