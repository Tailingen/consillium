Phase II Study of Afatinib Plus Bevacizumab in the Treatment Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon G719X, S768I, and L861Q Mutation Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
There is no report afatinib plus bevacizumab in the treatment of EGFR G719X, S768I, and L861Q single or compond mutation of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study is to study afatinib combined with bevacizumab in the management of it.
PFS
DRUG: afatinib
progression-free survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), up to 18 months
overall survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of participant's death due to any cause., Up to 48 months ]|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., up to 18 months
Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is the most common cause of death from cancer (almost 20 percent \[%\] of cancer deaths); NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancers. The hypothesis is that afatinib plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC characterized by EGFRuncommon mutations with G719X, S768I, and L861Q. Efficacy assessments will include disease assessment, symptomatic progression and patient-reported outcome. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and clinical safety laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).
