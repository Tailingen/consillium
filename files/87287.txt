Adaptive Radiation for Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided adaptive chemoradiation therapy to improve response to treatment.
Rectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen
Feasibility of MRI guided dose adaptive chemoradiation therapy, Investigators will demonstrate if MRI guided dose-adaptation based on MR morphologic objective measurements during primary chemoradiation is feasible. Feasibility will be recorded for each patient as an indicator variable (1=feasible; 0=not feasible), Up to 6 weeks
Number of Participants with Complete Clinical Response (cCR), Complete Clinical Response is defined as the absence of clinically detectable tumor after treatment., Up to 6 months|Number of Participants with Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Pathological Complete Response (pCR) is defined as the lack of all signs of cancer in tissue samples after treatment., Up to 6 months
Number of Participants with Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival is defined as the length of time after primary treatment ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of cancer., Up to 5 years
The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided adaptive chemoradiation therapy to improve response to treatment.
