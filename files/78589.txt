Emergency Medicine Palliative Care Access
This is a two-arm, multi-site randomized controlled trial of 1,350 older adults (50+ years) with either advanced cancer (defined as metastatic solid tumor) or poor prognosis end-stage organ failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), defined as Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) \< 15 ml/min/m2 or dialysis ; or Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Stage III or higher, or oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who present to the Emergency Department (ED), along with 675 of their informal caregivers. Investigators will compare the effectiveness of two distinct palliative care models: a) nurse-led telephonic case management; and b) facilitated, outpatient specialty palliative care.
Advanced Cancer|End Stage Organ Failure

* measured by change from enrollment to 12 months, Baseline, Month 12|Change in Caregiver Physical Health Quality of Life, as Measured by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS-10), * Quality of life for informal caregivers will be measured using the 10-item Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS-10), an instrument designed to measure perceptions of health using global health items. It contains a global physical health scale and a global mental health scale.
* Scored by reverse coding with a raw score ranging from 0-20; 0 points represent the patient's most severe physical and/or mental impairment, while 20 points represent the best possible state of health. Scales are scored using the raw sum to T-score tables for physical health and mental health. T-scores range from 0-100; higher scores reflect better functioning.
