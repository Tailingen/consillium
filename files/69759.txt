An Open-Label, Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of Mosunetuzumab in Combination With Tiragolumab With or Without Atezolizumab in Participants With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in combination with tiragolumab, with or without atezolizumab, in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two previous lines of systemic therapy.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Mosunetuzumab SC|DRUG: Tiragolumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|OTHER: Tocilizumab
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events - Phase 1b, From the start of treatment until 90 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 36 weeks)|Best Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by the Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria - Phase 2, Up to Cycle 17 (cycle length = 21 days)
Best ORR as Determined by the Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria - Phase 1b, Best ORR is defined as the fraction of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time as determined by the investigator using Lugano 2014 criteria., Assessed at screening and then every 3-6 months until disease progression, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or withdrawal (through Cycle 8; cycle length = 21 days)|Serum Concentration of Mosunetuzumab - Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1 - Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle length = 21 days)|Best Complete Response (CR) Rate as Determined by the Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria - Phase 1b, Assessed at screening and then every 3-6 months until disease progression, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or withdrawal (through Cycle 8; cycle length = 21 days)|Duration of Response (DOR) as Determined by the Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria - Phase 1b and Phase 2, From the first occurrence of a documented response (CR or partial response (PR)) to disease progression or relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria - Phase 2, From the first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)|Event-Free Survival (EFS) as Determined by the Investigator Using Lugano 2014 Criteria - Phase 2, From the first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)|Overall Survival (OS) - Phase 2, From the time of first study treatment to death from any cause (up to approximately 4 years)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events - Phase 2, From the start of treatment until 90 days after the final dose of study treatment
