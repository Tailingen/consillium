A Study of Chidamide With AZA in MRD Positive AML After Transplant
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant tumor of the hematopoietic system with high heterogeneity in cytogenetics and molecular biology.Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is still the primary treatment option for patients with AML and the most effective method for radical treatment of AML.Despite considerable progress in allo-HSCT over the past decade, 30%-40% of patients still relapse, and post-transplant relapse remains the leading cause of death in patients with AML.
AML, Adult|Minimal Residual Disease
DRUG: chidamide and azacitidine
the rate of RFS in 6 months, relapse-free survival, 6 months
the rate of MRD turn negative in 6 months, minimal residual disease turn negative, 6 months|the time length of MRD negative, minimal residual disease negative, 24 months|the 1 year/2 year RFS, relapse-free survival, 24 months|the 1 year/2 year OS, overall survival, 24 months|the rate of GVHD, graft-versus-host disease, 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Grade 1 to Grade 4 ,according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, versions 5.0, 24 months
T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) level before and after treatment, T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) are released upon rearrangement of the T cell receptor., 24 months|the rate of MRD turn negative in molecular genetic abnormality subtype, minimal residual disease, 24 months
Investigators proposed Chidamide combined with azacitidine as the prospective treatment for MRD-positive AML patients before and after transplantation, hoping to reduce the recurrence rate of transplantation and improve the transplantation effect. The efficacy and safety of the method will be verified by this clinical study.
