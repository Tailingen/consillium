Pharmocokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Study of the Combination Cetuximab/Gefitinib
This is an open-label, phase 1, non-randomised, non-controlled trial, carried out in two centres on patients with advanced cancer expressing EGFR. Primary objective is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of the combination of intravenous Cetuximab and oral Gefitinib.
Colorectal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Cetuximab/Gefitinib combination and/or monotherapy
The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of the combination intravenous Cetuximab/oral Gefitinib.
To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the combination Cetuximab/Gefitinib|To determine the pharmacogenomic profile of study patients and to correlate the different profiles with efficacy|To determine the possible correlation between activity and the polymorphisms of the EGFR measured in the blood and in the primary tumour|To assess the possible immune response related to cetuximab|To estimate signs of clinical activity (response rate according to the RECIST criteria)
Between 36 and 66 patients will be enrolled depending on the number of dose levels which can be completed. Patients will have histologically confirmed EFGR-expressing solid malignant tumours (colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and NSCLC), which did not respond to standard therapy or for which no suitable therapy exists.
