Disease control rate (DCR) (Phase I and II), The DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed BOR of CR or PR or stable disease (SD) per Investigator review according to RECIST 1.1 at or prior to initiation of the use of new anti-cancer therapy. This is assessed to evaluate preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of ALE.P02 (Phase I and II)., From ALE.P02 treatment initiation until at or prior to initiation of the use of new anti-cancer therapy (Up to 3.5 years)|Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 6 and 12 Months (Phase I and II), The PFS is defined as time from first study treatment to a documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, as determined by the Investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier. This is assessed to evaluate preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of ALE.P02 (Phase I and II)., At 6 and 12 months after initiation of ALE.P02 treatment|Median Overall Survival (OS) at 6, 12, and 24 Months (Phase I and II), The OS is defined as time from first study treatment to death due to any cause. This is assessed to evaluate preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of ALE.P02 (Phase I and II)., At 6, 12, and 24 months after initiation of ALE.P02 treatment|Blood Concentration of ALE.P02 Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC), Concentrations of ALE.P02 ADC in blood will be measured at each scheduled time point per arms to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at end of treatment visit (EoT) (Up to 3.5 years)|Blood Concentration of Total Antibody, Total antibody in blood will be measured at each scheduled time point per arms to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Blood Concentrations of Payload, Concentrations of payload in blood will be measured at each scheduled time point per arms to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau), The AUCtau of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Area under the concentration-time curve from pre-dose (time 0) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast), The AUClast of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Area under the concentration-time curve from pre-dose (time 0) extrapolated to infinite time (AUCinf), The AUCinf of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax), The Cmax of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02. It is determined directly from the concentration-time profile., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Minimum concentration (Cmin), The Cmin of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02. It is determined directly from the concentration-time profile., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|Concentration at the end of a Dosing Interval (Ctrough), The Ctrough of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02., Phase I and II: Cycle 1 Day 1 until at EoT (Up to 3.5 years)|The terminal elimination rate constant (KeL), The KeL of ALE.P02 will be measured to assess the PK profile of ALE.P02.
