DEB-TACE, Lenvatinib and Anti-PD(L)1 Antibody as Conversion Therapy for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The aim of this study is to the efficacy, prognosis, adverse effects, and factors for predicting therapeutic effects and clinical prognosis of combined therapy of Drug-eluting Beads-transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE), lenvatinib, and anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 antibody for patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who were initially unsuitable for the radical therapy, including resection, transplantation, or ablation.
Cholangiocarcinoma Non-resectable
PROCEDURE: drug eluting beads-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization|DRUG: envatinib plus anti-PD(L)1
Number of Patients Amendable to Curative Surgical Interventions, Number of patients amendable to curative surgical interventions defined as number of patients receiving curative surgical resection, transplantation, or ablation after successful down-sizing of tumor(s) by intervention., from the date of first treatment to the date of last treatment, an average of 3 years
overall response rate (ORR) measured by mRECIST criteria, Complete response (CR): Disappearance of any intra-tumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions; Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions; Stable disease (SD): Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease; Progressive disease (PD): An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions recorded since treatment started., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years]|Overall survival (OS), measured from date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause. Participants alive or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last visit., from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). Participants alive and without disease progression or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last radiographic assessment., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years|Time to progression (TTP), measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented intrahepatic tumor progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented intrahepatic tumor progression according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Incidence of Study-Related Adverse Events, Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the United States National Cancer Institute The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE 5.0), from the date of first treatment to 90 days after last treatment, around 3 years and 90 days|Pathological complete response (pCR), Pathological response is assessed as the percentage of surface with non-viable cancer cells (represented by necrosis or fibrosis, the ultimate stage of necrosis) in relation to the total tumor area and will be equal to: 100% - viable cancer cells (%). If there are multiple tumors, the mean percentage will be used., from the date of first study treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), percentage of patients with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) â‰¥6 months based on mRECIST., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented response according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Duration of response (DoR), Defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause., from the date of first documented evidence of CR or PR to first documented sign of PD or death from any cause according to mRECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) after treatment, The life quality of every subject is assessed every 3 months during follow up according to the 45-item FACT-Hep questionnaire, which assesses generic HRQL concerns and disease-specific issues., assessed form the date of first followup to radiographically documented progression or or death from any cause, up to 3 years
The multicenter, non-random, open and prospective real-world cohort study is conducted at 4 research centers, including 3 centers (Hankou, Sino-French New District, and Optical Valley) of Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China) and one in the second affiliated hospital of Fujian Medical University (Quanzhou, China). It is estimated that 100 patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will be enrolled in these 4 research centers. And it is planned to complete the enrollment within 2 year and it is expected that all enrolled subjects will reach the observation end point in 3 years. Radiological assessments are performed every two cycles over the course of treatment, then every 3 months within the first two years following the completion of treatment and every 6 months thereafter, until PD were recorded. All subjects are followed until death or lost to follow up.
