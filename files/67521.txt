Yliver as a Test to Early Diagnose HCC
Liver cancer (HCC) is the second cause of death related to cancer worldwide, with about 750,000 deaths from this cause in 2012. Although the early diagnosis of liver cancer increases the available treatment options, the methods currently used for screening are not sufficiently sensitive for this purpose.

The investigators provide a high-performance and highly reliable in vitro platform that allows the identification and quantification of autoantibodies in serum for use as biomarkers of liver cancer, using an ELISA test (Yliver).

The aim of the study is to demonstrate whether the Yliver test can be used as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with a collection of samples from 58 patients diagnosed with HCC, 42 cirrhosis, 40 normal controls and the inclusion of 25-50 patients with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis.
