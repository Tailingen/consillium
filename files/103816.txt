Coxsackie Virus A21 Administered Intravenously (IV) for Solid Tumour Cancers (PSX-X04)
Coxsackie A21 (CVA21) virus is to be administered by IV infusion to patients with Stage 4 melanoma, prostate and breast cancer. This is a dose escalation, safety study.
Melanoma|Breast Cancer|Prostate Cancer
DRUG: CVA21
The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of CVA21 given by intravenous infusion in multiple escalating doses., Days 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 42, 56, 84
To obtain preliminary efficacy data, determine the time course of viraemia and its elimination post-administration of CVA21, Days 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 42, 56, 84|To characterise the time course of the anti-CVA21 antibody response, Days 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 42, 56, 84
This is a phase I, multiple dose, dose escalation, open label, cohort study of three intravenous doses of Coxsackie virus A21 in patients with stage IV solid tumours. Prospective patients will attend the study centre for initial screening within 28 days prior to commencement of treatment. They will have the nature of the study and its procedures and risks fully explained. Patients must then sign an informed consent form giving permission for tumour testing before initial screening can be commenced.

Patients whose tumours test positive for ICAM-1 with or without DAF will attend the study centre for a further screening visit within 14 days prior to commencement of treatment. They will sign a full study informed consent form before any further screening procedures are carried out.

Patients who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will commence the treatment stage, which consists of one or more doses of CVA21 administered by intravenous infusion as per the dosage escalation chart. The first 4 cohorts will be treated as in-patients. The follow up period will consist of 12 weeks, during which time patients will attend the trial centre for up to13 follow up visits to collect safety and efficacy data.
