Study of ABT-767 in Subjects With Breast Cancer 1 and Breast Cancer 2 (BRCA 1 and BRCA 2) Mutations and Solid Tumors or High Grade Serous Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
This is a Phase 1, dose escalation trial evaluating the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ABT-767 in subjects with advanced Breast Cancer 1 or 2 gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2)-mutated solid tumors and high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
Fallopian Tube|Primary Peritoneal Cancer|Solid Tumors (e.g. Breast, Ovarian, Prostate, or Pancreatic) and Ovarian
DRUG: ABT-767
Pharmacokinetic profile, Blood samples for pharmacokinetics of ABT-767 will be collected at designated time points, Various time points from Cycle 1 Day -4 to Day 8
Safety (number of subjects with adverse events and/or dose limiting toxicities), Adverse events, laboratory results, physical exams and vital signs will be evaluated throughout the study., Weekly for the first two months, every other week for the third month, and monthly there after. An expected average is 5 months.
This is a Phase 1, dose escalation trial evaluating the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ABT-767 in subjects with advanced BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutated solid tumors and high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. ABT-767 is a potent oral inhibitor of the enzymes poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP-1 and PARP-2). Malignancies with deficiencies in homologous repair, such as BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 deficient tumors, are more dependent on PARP for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair than normal cells and, thus, are thought to be more sensitive to PARP inhibition. The study design is a single-arm dose escalation study to determine dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of orally administered ABT-767 in subjects with BRCA mutations and malignancies. In order to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABT-767 at the RPTD, 20 additional subjects will be enrolled in an expanded safety cohort consisting of BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated Breast cancer and Ovarian cancer.
