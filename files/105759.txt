R-Dose-adjusted (DA) - EPOCH-21 Versus R-modified Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-90 Program (mNHL-BFM-90) and Autologous Stem Cells Transplantation (Auto-SCT) in DLBCL With Poor Prognosis
Purpose: to evaluate an efficacy of chemotherapy regimens R-DA-EPOCH-21 and R-mNHL-BFM-90 with and without autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (auto-SCT) in newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL with intermediate and high risk.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

complete response, (physical examination, standard blood tests, including assessment of LDH level, thoracic and abdominal computerized tomography (together with any other anatomic site, as clinically indicated), bone marrow biopsy in case of bone marrow involvement and 18F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) (not mandatory) in case of residual measurable disease at the end of the chemoimmunotherapy)., 168 day

Patients initially are randomized into 4 arms:

1. st arm R-DA-EPOCH-21
2. nd arm R-mNHL-BFM-90
3. rd arm R-DA-EPOCH-21 + auto-SCT
4. th arm of R-mNHL-BFM-90 + auto-SCT

Patients who achieved complete remission after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or R-mNHL-BFM-90 immunochemotherapy continue to be under observation (1st and 2nd arms) or continue treatment with Rituximab + BCNU+Etoposid+Ara-C+Melphalan (R-BEAM) followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th arms). Patients who achieved partial remission after 6 cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or R-mNHL-BFM-90 immunochemotherapy continue treatment with 2 cycles of Rituximab+Dexamethasone+Ara-C+Cisplatin (R-DHAP), continue to be under observation (1st and 2nd arms) or continue treatment with R-BEAM, followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th arms).
