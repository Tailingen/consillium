Efficacy of 68Ga-DOTATOC Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT in Children and Young Adults With Brain Tumors
This pilot clinical trial studies gallium Ga 68-edotreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in finding brain tumors in younger patients. Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT imaging, may help find and diagnose brain tumors.

Change in standardized uptake value (SUV) uptake after gallium Ga 68-edotreotide, The endpoint is a binary outcome (+ or -) of SUV uptake (after gallium Ga 68-edotreotide) and a binary outcome confirmed at biopsy (+ or -)., Baseline up to 30 days|Proportion of discordance and concordance between gallium Ga 68-edotreotide and biopsy, Up to 30 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if 68Ga-DOTATOC (gallium Ga 68-edotreotide) PET when combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will differentiate embryonal tumors such as medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) from the low and high grade gliomas.

II. To determine if 68Ga-DOTATOC PET will aid in the identification of residual tumor post operatively in those patients who were 68Ga-DOTATOC PET positive prior to surgery.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT at baseline and 1-30 days after surgery.
