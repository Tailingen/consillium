SHR-1210 Combined With Albumin-bound Paclitaxel and Epirubicin Neoadjuvant for Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 negative, accounts for 10-20% of all breast cancers and usually occurs in young women. It is an aggressive and worst prognosis breast cancer subtype, which urgently requires effective treatment.The pathological complete response (pCR) of neoadjuvant therapy is associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of breast cancer. The correlation between pathological response and long-term survival in patients with early-stage breast cancer is the strongest among patients with triple-negative breast cancer.
Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1210+Albumin-bound paclitaxel + epirubicin
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), TpCR (ypT0 / is, ypN0) assessed by pathologists participating in the research center: defined as the pathological evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin-stained resected breast cancer samples and all ipsilateral lymph node samples after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery there is any residual invasive cancer., At time of surgery
Disease-free survival (DFS), Time after R0 resection to disease recurrence or death Time after R0 resection to disease recurrence or death Time after R0 resection to disease recurrence or death Defined as the time interval from the first day of disease-free (ie, the date of surgery) to the first recording of related events, which include recurrence of postoperative disease and death from any cause, up to 2 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), CR+PR, up to 1 year
