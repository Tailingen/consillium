Safety and Efficacy of AEB071 and EVEROLIMUS in Patients With CD79-mutant or ABC Subtype Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Study of the safety and efficacy of AEB071 and EVEROLIMUS in patients with CD79-mutant or ABC subtype Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.

The trial did not progress into Phase II due to the suboptimal tolerability of the combination treatment of sotrastaurin and everolimus in the Phase Ib part of the study. There were no serious safety concerns associated with this combination.
CD79 Mutant or ABC-subtype Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: AEB071|DRUG: Everolimus
Phase Ib- Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first cycle, Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the AEB071and EVEROLIMUS combination therapy in patients with DLBCL., 12 months|Phase II- Overall response rate (ORR) = complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) according to the non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma International Working Group criteria, Assess the preliminary evidence for anti-tumor activity at RP2D for AEB071 and EVEROLIMUS in patients with a CD79 mutation and those wild-type for the mutation but of the ABC subtype, 12 months
Occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) assessments of clinical laboratory values and vital sign measurements., Safety and tolerability of AEB071 and EVEROLIMUS, including acute and chronic toxicities, 24 months|Best Overall Response (BOR), Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity for AE071 and EVEROLIMUS, 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity for AE071 and EVEROLIMUS, 24 months|Progression Free survival (PFS), Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity for AE071 and EVEROLIMUS, 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity for AE071 and EVEROLIMUS, 24 months|Concentration-time profiles of Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters - Phase Ib, To characterize the PK profiles of AEB071 and EVEROLIMUS, 24 months
This is a Phase Ib dose escalation and Phase II study in patients with DLBCL harboring mutations in CD79A/B or of the ABC subtype. Pre-screening for mutations in CD79A/B or the ABC subtype will be required, as it is anticipated that both patient groups may receive clinical benefit from the combination of AEB071 and EVEROLIMUS.
