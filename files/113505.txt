Study Of Cadonilimab Combined With Radiotherapy In The Treatment of Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Cadonilimab（AK104）is a humanized IgG1 bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and CTLA-4.

This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, phase II study, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cadonilimab plus radiotherapy in participants with locally advanced cervical cancer who do not tolerate chemotherapy.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Cadonilimab（AK104）|RADIATION: EBRT|RADIATION: BT
ORR assessed by Investigator, The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR per RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years
DCR, The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for ≥8 weeks) based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years|PFS, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 30 months|OS, OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause, Up to approximately 40 months|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status Score and Physical Function Score., The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Global scores are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 40 months|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 40 months
