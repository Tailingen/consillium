The study will comprise:

* A screening period of maximum 21 days;
* A fixed sequence of 3 treatment periods: Treatment Period 1: Capivasertib only, Treatment Period 2: Itraconazole pre-treatment (run-in) period, and Treatment Period 3: Capivasertib and itraconazole in combination.
* A Follow-up Visit at 7 to 14 days after the last capivasertib PK sample in Treatment Period 3.

There will be no washout between Treatment Period 2 and Treatment Period 3. Each subject will be involved in the study for up to 7 weeks.
