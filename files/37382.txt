An Open Label Extension Study of the Efficacy of MORAb-003
An open label extension of the MORAb-003-002 study in order to continue the active patients in the MORAb-003-002 study on maintenance MORAb-003 infusions after the main study is closed.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: MORAb-003
Duration of Ovarian Tumor Marker (Cancer Antigen 125 [CA125]) Response, The duration of CA125 response, was defined the time from the date of the initial CA125 response (i.e., prior to enrollment in the parent study, was the starting point for assessment) to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) by either Gynecologic Cancer Inter Group (GCIG) criteria for CA125 level or by the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Disease progression per CA125 was defined as the first of 2 consecutive CA125 values greater than (\>) twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) (i.e. 35 kilo unit per liter \[kU/L\]) on two occasions. C= data censored at earlier non-PD assessment if PD did not occur., From screening of parent study (NCT00318370) until the current study was terminated (up to a maximum of 78.2 months including the parent study, or 37.7 months in this study only)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by GCIG, PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication during the parent study MORAb-003-002 (NCT00318370) to the date of disease progression (either by GCIG for CA125 criteria or standard RECIST v.1.0 criteria) or to the date of death due to any cause in this study. PD per CA125 was defined as the first of 2 consecutive CA125 values \>2\*ULN (35 kU/L) on two occasions. Participants who were alive with no disease progression were censored at either the date of last CA125 assessment or date of last objective tumor evaluation, whichever was later. PFS was also censored if a participant received a non-study anticancer therapy or procedure, with censoring occurring at the date of the last RECIST or CA125 assessment prior to the start of a non-study anticancer therapy or procedure (whichever was earlier). C= data censored at earlier non-PD assessment if PD did not occur., From the first dose of study medication in the parent study (NCT00318370) until the current study was terminated (up to a maximum of 78.2 months including the parent study, or 37.7 months in this study only)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined from the date of first dose of farletuzumab during the parent study MORAb-003-002 (NCT00318370) to date of death due to any cause. Participants who were alive had their OS time censored at the date they were last known to be alive. C= data censored at date participant was last known to be alive., From Baseline (Day 1) in the parent study (NCT00318370) until date of death from any cause in this study, or until the current study was terminated (up to a maximum of 78.2 months including the parent study, or 37.7 months in this study only)|Duration of Second Remission, The prolongation of second and subsequent responses to chemotherapy plus farletuzumab relative to initial remission was assessed. Length of first remission was determined in the parent study MORAb-003-002 (NCT00318370). The length of second remission (i.e., the first remission in this study) was calculated using the following formula: '(carboplatin/taxane start date in this study - carboplatin/taxane start date in NCT00318370 +1/30.4'. The length of second remission was censored at the date of study discontinuation if the participant did not receive any carboplatin/taxane therapy during this study. C = censored data., From Baseline (Day 1) in the parent study (NCT00318370) until date of death from any cause in this study, or until the current study was terminated (up to a maximum of 78.2 months including the parent study, or 37.7 months in this study only)|Duration of Third Remission, The length of third remission (i.e., second remission in this study) was calculated using the following formula: '(subsequent carboplatin/taxane start date in this study - carboplatin/taxane start date in NCT00318370 +1)/30.4'. The length of third remission was censored at the date of study discontinuation if the participant did not receive subsequent chemotherapy (carboplatin/taxane) during this study. Censored data is reported for all participants., From Baseline (Day 1) of this study until date of death from any cause, or until the study was terminated (up to a maximum of 37.7 months)
Number of Participants With Best Overall Response as Evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.0 Criteria, Best overall response was the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Participants were assigned to one of the following categories of change in disease status: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). CR was defined as CR in both target and non-target lesions with no new lesions. PR was defined as CR in target lesions and incomplete response or SD in non-target lesions with no new lesions, or PR in target lesions and non-PD in non-target lesions with no new lesions. SD was defined as SD in target lesions and non-PD in non-target lesions with no new lesions. PD was defined as PD in target lesions, any non-target lesions with either absence or presence of new lesions, or any target lesions, PD in non-target lesions with either absence or presence of new lesions, or any target or non-target lesions with new lesions., From the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (up to approximately 37.7 months)
