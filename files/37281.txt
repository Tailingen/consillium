Selumetinib Sulfate in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer With KRAS G12R Mutations
This phase II trial studies how well selumetinib sulfate works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer with Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) G12R mutations that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other places in the body. Selumetinib sulfate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Proportion of Participants With an Objective Response (Partial Response + Complete Response), Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10mm (\<1 cm). Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Approximately 1-8.2 months

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the objective response rate to selumetinib sulfate (selumetinib) administered as 75 mg orally twice daily on a continuous schedule in patients with advanced pancreas cancer harboring Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) G12R mutations.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the progression free survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable and stage IV pancreas cancer treated with selumetinib monotherapy.

II. To evaluate the safety of selumetinib in patients with advanced pancreas cancer.

III. To determine the impact of additional genetic alterations on the response to selumetinib in pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

IV. To develop a clinically applicable biomarker predicting response to selumetinib in pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 27 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 52 weeks.
