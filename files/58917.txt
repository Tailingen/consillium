This is a multicentre, Phase III, randomised, open-label study to investigate the efficacy and safety of savolitinib administered orally in combination with osimertinib versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in participants with EGFR mutated, MET-overexpressed and/or amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on first- or second-line treatment with osimertinib as the most recent therapy.

Approximately 324 participants with EGFR mutated, MET-overexpressed and/or amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be randomly assigned to study intervention with 1:1 ratio.

Patients will be treated until either objective progression of disease (PD) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) is assessed by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn, or another discontinuation criterion is met.
