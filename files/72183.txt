Aprepitant in the Management of Biological Therapies-related Severe Pruritus
Itch is a common side effect of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Investigators designed a pilot single-center phase II study evaluating the effects of Aprepitant, a neurokinin receptor inhibitor, in managing biological therapy-induced pruritus.
ITCH
DRUG: Aprepitant|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Fexofenadine
Severity of ITCH, Patients is asked to grade the intensity of their itch on the VAS, with the strongest possible itch marked at the right end of the line (10) and no itch marked at the left end (0). The VAS score is registered in a diary supplied 7 days before starting the study and every week throughout the study period.

Pruritus intensity is evaluated by VAS score once before Aprepitant administration, once 7 days after the first dose of Aprepitant and once a week until the end of biological therapy or the pruritus recurrence. Response (evaluated one week after the first Aprepitant dose) is defined as \> 50% reduction of pruritus intensity compared to the baseline value., once before aprepitant administration; 7 days after the first dose of aprepitant, and once a week until the end of biological therapy
Investigators enroll patients affected by solid tumors which present itch refractory to standard treatment ("refractory group") and patients who did not receive any treatment for pruritus ("naïve group"). The intensity of itch will be evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. In the refractory group Aprepitant (125 mg on day 1; 80 mg on day 3; 80 mg on day 5) will be administered after at least 1 week of standard systemic treatment. In the naïve group, Aprepitant will be administered after the first onset of severe pruritus. The primary end point is to evaluate the effect of aprepitant in managing pruritus both in naive and refractory group.
