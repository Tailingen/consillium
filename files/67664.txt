Transabdominal Gastric Contrast Ultrasound
In this study, the clinical data of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer who were ready for surgery were examined by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and gastric-enhanced CT before surgery. Based on the results of postoperative pathological examinations, the diagnostic accuracy of gastric filling contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and gastric contrast-enhanced CT in different stages of gastric cancer was compared and analyzed. Provide better guidance for follow-up clinical practice.
