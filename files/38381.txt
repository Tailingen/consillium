Cetuximab and Radiation Therapy for Surgically Resectable Esophageal and Gastroesophageal (GE) Junction Carcinomas
The interaction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitory agents such as cetuximab combined with radiation shows promising results. EGFR inhibitory agents also enhance radiation-induced apoptosis and inhibit radiation induced damage repair. These interactions may represent the principle effects that contribute to the synergy between EGFR and radiation.

This trial will investigate the feasibility and activity of this combination in patients with surgically resectable disease.

OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

* Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes Day -14 (Loading Dose)
* Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes, day -7.
* Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV over 60 minutes, days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36.
* External beam radiation therapy, beginning on day 1, 4500 cGy to esophagus with boost of 540 cGy at 180 cGy per fraction for 6 weeks.
* Surgical resection of primary tumor and adjacent mediastinal and/or celiac lymph nodes by a transthoracic approach after satisfactory hematologic and functional recovery within 8 weeks of completion of radiation therapy.
* For patients who give their consent, fresh frozen tissue will be obtained per EUS at baseline, per EUS 2 weeks after the initiation of cetuximab, and at the time of surgery for pathology submission.
