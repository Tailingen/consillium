A Study to Determine the Effect and Safety of an Oral Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)-Inhibitor (Ruxolitinib; INBC018424) in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study was to determine clinical efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib (INCB018424), a small molecule Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-inhibitor, in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Ruxolitinib 25 mg|DRUG: Dexamethasone 40 mg
Number of Responders According to the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, A responder is defined as a patient with a complete response (negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow) or a partial response (≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 h)., Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4 and then every 3 months thereafter (up to 25 months).
Time to Disease Progression According to the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, Progressive Disease requires 1 or more of the following:

Increase of ≥ 25% from baseline in:

Serum M-component and/or (increase ≥ 0.5 g/dL).

Urine M-component and/or (increase ≥ 200 mg/24 h).

In patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels increase must be \> l0 mg/dL.

Bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥ 10%.

Definite development of new or increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.

Development of hypercalcemia., Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4 and then every 3 months thereafter (up to 25 months).
The protocol was originally designed as a Simon two stage but after it was determined that the initial 13 patients enrolled did not meet the definition of a 'responder' according to the International Uniform Response Criteria for multiple myeloma the protocol was amended to allow patients who had disease progression at any time or stable disease for 3 cycles and did not meet a withdrawal criterion or had withdrawn consent to have 40 mg of dexamethasone added to their dose of ruxolitinib.
