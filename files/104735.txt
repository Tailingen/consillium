Retrospective Study of Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel in Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
This is a retrospective, multicenter, non-interventional study for the evaluation of real-world efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma as part of the establishment of hospital medical record collection system to evaluate drug effectiveness by Health Insurance Review \& Assessment Service (HIRA). The medical records in approximately 1400 patients with locally-advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, who have received ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy will be collected.

Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy has shown a survival benefit in patients with previously treated gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. However, the real-world efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy in Korea have only been evaluated once outside of controlled clinical trials. Therefore, this large multicenter retrospective analysis was designed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel under the Korea National Health Insurance System. The medical records in approximately 1400 patients with locally-advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, who have received ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy between May 2018 and December 2018 will be collected. Eligibility criteria included age â‰¥ 19 years, histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease, and previous first-line systemic therapy including fluoropyrimidine and platinum. Efficacy was evaluated by overall survival, progression free survival, time to progression, objective response rate, disease control rate, and duration of response. Safety was evaluated by hematologic or non-non hematologic toxicities and adverse events of special interest with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy.
