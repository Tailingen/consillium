Relationship Between Methods of Bladder Tumor Extraction and Local Recurrence Rate
According to clinical guidelines, endoscopic surgery (mono- or bipolar TURBT, laser resection, en bloc resection) is a standard treatment option for patients with primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (excluding carcinoma in-situ). However, more than half of patients will experience local recurrence after surgery. It is believed that one of the main causes for this local recurrence is the reimplantation of tumor cells during endoscopic surgery. It is crucial to limit contact between the resected tumor and the bladder wall during the operation and to extract the specimen as quickly as possible. In the case of a small tumor, the surgeon can immediately remove it using an endoscopic instrument. There are a number of methods available for removing large tumors, but it is not yet clear which one is most optimal. Therefore, comparing the oncological results from evacuating bladder tumors using various methods is very timely.

Based on the previously mentioned studies, the investigators assume that the rate of bladder cancer relapse out site of the resection area would be lower in the morcellation group compared with piecemeal resection of the tumor. In order to prove this, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized study comparing the relapse rate in these two groups.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: en bloc resection, morcellation|PROCEDURE: piecemeal resection, tissue removal by loop
Recurrence free survival, Absence of the tumor in the bladder during the follow-up cystoscopy, 3 months
Relapse-free rate in-site of previous surgery, Absence of the tumor in the place of resection of the bladder wall during the follow-up cystoscopy, 3 months|Relapse-free rate out-site of previous surgery, Absence of the tumor out of the place of resection of the bladder wall during the follow-up cystoscopy, 3 months|Duration of surgery, Time frame from the beginning of the procedure till the end of the procedure, Intraoperatively|Adverse events, Adverse events according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 3 months
