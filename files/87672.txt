Taking AIM at Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research is to determine whether a 16-week exercise program for individuals with breast cancer and have completed treatment (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) for breast cancer will decrease inflammation in fat tissue.

Decrease in adipose tissue levels of inflammation., Adipose tissue inflammation will be assessed by measuring: M1 and M2 adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), 16 Weeks|Decrease in adipose tissue levels of inflammation., Adipose tissue inflammation will be assessed by measuring: leptin, adiponectin, IL-6 and IL-8, 16 weeks|Decrease in adipose tissue levels of inflammation., Adipose tissue inflammation will be assessed by measuring: hs-CRP and TNF-a, 16 weeks
4-month CARE intervention on sarcopenic obesity., sarcopenic obesity will be assessed via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry using a validated equation., 16 Weeks
This study is about using different types of exercise to reduce inflammation in fat tissue in an effort to minimize the risk of cancer recurrence related to being overweight or obese. The investigators hope to learn whether participating in a specific exercise program can cause inflammation in the fat tissue to decrease.

The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

* Circuit-style aerobic and resistance exercise (CARE)
* Traditional aerobic and resistance exercise (TARE)

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

The study treatment will be for 4 months and participants will followed for 8 months.

The total time for participation in this study will be about 12 months. It is expected that about 300 people will take part in this research study.
