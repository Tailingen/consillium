A Feasibility Study of Oral Adjuvant Chemotherapy With S-1
The investigators confirm the feasibility of 1-year administration of oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 as an adjuvant chemotherapy for the patient who received complete resection of non-small cell lung cancer. The investigators presume they can achieve high completion rate with low toxicity.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: S-1
Completion rate, One year
Incidence and grade of adverse reactions, One year
Chemotherapy comprised eight courses (4-week administration, 2-week withdrawal) of S-1 (FT, gineracil, oteracil potassium; Taiho Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) at 80-120 mg/body/day according to body surface area (BSA): BSA \<1.25 m2, 80 mg/day; BSA \>1.25 m2 but \<1.5 m2, 100 mg/day; and BSA \>1.5 m2, 120 mg/day.
