Global Real World Data in Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancer on Standard of Care and Specialized Interventions- Registry of Oncologic Outcomes With Testing and Treatment.
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the barriers in the real world to accessing treatments for ATC. And to learn about how patients with ATC tolerate and respond to the commercially available medications for treatment of this disease, outside of a clinical study.
Thyroid Cancer
Overall Survival, Prospective real-world, large-scale, comprehensive data on these patients who are unable to access traditional clinical trials but are treated with MDA regimens, assigned by stage and BRAF-status., Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

The primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) between ATC patients treated at MDA versus outside of MDA using treatment regimens offered at MDA based on BRAF status and stage of the disease. We will gather prospective real-world, large-scale, comprehensive data on these patients who are unable to access traditional clinical trials but are treated with MDA regimens, assigned by stage and BRAF-status.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To evaluate effect of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy on the quality of life for ATC survivors
2. To evaluate how factors such as health insurance and lack of coverage, adherence, and other sociodemographic characteristics influences patient outcomes.
