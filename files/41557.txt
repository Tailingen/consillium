EssaiClinique_CBSM
The CBSM is a program combining cognitive and behavioral therapies, relaxation provided in groups of 8 to 10 patients. This program has demonstrated benefits in stress management skills, adaptive strategies, anxiety, quality of life, social inclusion, medication adherence, depression, therapeutic alliance, and general well-being. It would also improve breast cancer survival after adjuvant therapy. This program has been put in place at the center of pain for patients with cancer pain in any stage. This study aims to evaluate the benefits of this technique on a patient population suffering from chronic pain related to cancer.
