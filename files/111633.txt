Using Microbiome to Predict Durvalumab Toxicity in Post- Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy (CCRT) NSCLC Patients
This phase IV study is hoping to determine if examining the microbiome in non-small cell lung cancer participants who will receive durvalumab can predict treatment toxicity.
NSCLC, Stage III|Locally Advanced Lung Carcinoma
Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AE's), CTCAE 5.0, Up to 18 months|Longitudinal changes in Microbiome, Metagenomic sequencing and taxonomic analysis, Up to 18 months from study start|Longitudinal changes in bacterial metabolic pathway, Metagenomic sequencing and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping, Up to 18 months from study start
Time-to-treatment withheld due to AEs, Time measured by days, Up to 18 months from study start|Time to immune-mediated AEs requiring systemic intervention, Time measured by days, Up to 18 months from study start|Progression free survival, Time measured by months, Up to 36 months from study start
