Evaluation of OE-MRI in Patients With H&N Cancer
Assessment of the use of oxygen enhanced MRI scanning in a cohort of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas to identify areas of hypoxia with tumours and relate this to treatment outcomes.

Oxygen-enhanced MRI (OE-MRI) is a technique being actively investigated for imaging hypoxia within cancer tissues. Preliminary clinical data demonstrates the feasibility of using this methodology to study patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The investigators wish to investigate using this methodology to identify hypoxic subvolumes within HNSCC that may have greater resistance to standard radiotherapy treatment and investigate the association of such hypoxic regions with treatment outcomes.
