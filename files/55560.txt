Haplo HCT vs Haplo-cord HCT for Patients With AML
Patients who have acute myeloid leukemia and will undergo haplo-identical donor hematopoeitic cell transplantation (haplo HCT) are potential candidates of this trial. Participants will randomized into two arms: Arm A will undergo a typical haplo HCT, while Arm B will receive an coinfusion of an unrelated cord blood unit (haplo-cord HCT) in addition to Arm A. Progression-free survival, overall survival, cumulative incidence of relapse and nonrelapse mortality will be recorded as endpoints.
