Induction Chemotherapy,Radiochemotherapy, Consolidation Chemotherapy in Preoperative Treatment of Rectal Cancer
The use of capecitabine based preoperative chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy is standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. It has reduced local recurrence rate to less than 10%, but has only had limited effect on overall survival due to the constantly high (more than 30%) rate of distant metastasis.

Complete eradication of the primary tumour observed in the histopathological specimen (pathological complete response, pCR) correlates with a favourable overall prognosis so obtaining a pCR might be beneficial. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the addition of capecitabine based chemotherapy before preoperative chemoradiation and also before the operation improves pathological complete remission rate in locally advanced rectal cancer with acceptable toxicity. Secondary objectives are to evaluate pathological downstaging rate, histopathological R0 resection rate,sphincter preservation rate, perioperative surgical complication rate, local control, DFS, OS, late toxicity and quality of life.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: intensified preoperative chemotherapy
Pathological complete remission rate (pCR), after the pathological examination of surgical speciments ie within 14 days after the operation
Toxicity, Number of patients with adverse events and the grade of adverse events, According to NCI-CTC (version 3.0): every week for 16 week preoperative, perioperative (0-30 days postoperative), early (30 days - 6 months postoperative), and late (more than 6 months postoperative)|Histopathological R0 resection rate, after the pathological examination of resected speciments ie within 14 days after the operation|Loco-regional failure rate, after 3y and 5y of operation|Disease-free survival, after 3y and 5y of operation|Overall survival, after 3y and 5y of the operation|Quality of life, We will use EORTC questionnaires QLQ C30 and C38, before the treatment, after 1,and 3 years of the operation
