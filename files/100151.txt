A Phase 2 Study of Panitumumab in Patients With Cetuximab-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess if panitumumab is active enough to warrant comparative studies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after treatment with cetuximab.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab
number of patients alive and without disease progression, progression of disease within 2 months from registration according to RECIST criteria, and death for any cause within 2 months from registration, 2 months
response rate, Response assessed per patients at weeks 8,16,24,32,40 and every 3 months thereafter, using RECIST criteria, up to 40 weeks|progression free survival, 9 months|overall survival, one year|worst grade toxicity per patient, worst grade toxicity (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3) per patient, every 2 weeks for up to 6 months
gene expression on tumor tissue, exploratory analysis of tumor-tissue for biological or genomic determinants of outcome of BRAF and P13K mutation status, EGFR and PTEN expression status, one year
The study was amended with modification of inclusion criteria (from wild-type tumor KRAS gene to wild-type RAS gene, including KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4)

RAS mutational status of tumors of patients enrolled before amendment 1 approval will be centrally revised. Patients whose tumors will result RAS mutated at the biomarkers central revision, will be replaced. Therefore, the overall sample size at both the stages may be higher than the one initially planned.
