An Inpatient Advance Care Planning Intervention for Older Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
This is a pilot study to assess the preliminary efficacy of an inpatient advance care planning intervention on outcomes in older patients with hematologic malignancies
Hematologic Malignancies
BEHAVIORAL: Inpatient serious illness care program
Completion of advance directives, Data on completion of advance directives will be collected via the electronic medical record. This will include explicit statement of the patient's medical preferences for end of life care in a note, scanned medical order for life sustaining treatment (MOLST) form that was completed with their clinician, and/or scanned healthcare proxy form that was completed with their clinician. This will be expressed as a percentage., 12 weeks
End of life quality indicators, End of life quality indicators will be extracted from the electronic medical record. These metrics will include hospice enrollment, palliative care referral, chemotherapy administration within the last 2 weeks of life, emergency department visits in the last 30 days of life, intensive care unit admissions in the last 30 days of life, hospitalizations in the last 30 days of life, use of life-sustaining treatments in the last 30 days of life, transfusions in the last 7 days of life, and place of death. These will be expressed as percentages., Up to 5 years following their participation in the study or death
Older adults with hematologic malignancies receive more aggressive inpatient care at the end of life compared to patients with solid tumors. Advance care planning may promote early serious illness conversations for patients with hematologic malignancies, leading to less aggressive healthcare utilization at the end of life. This pilot aims to assess the preliminary efficacy of an inpatient advance care planning intervention on outcomes in older patients with hematologic malignancies.
