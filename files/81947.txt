Rebeccamycin Analog in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rebeccamycin analog in treating children who have relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: becatecarin
Response (complete response, very good partial response, or partial response)|Freedom from progression|Time to treatment failure
Toxicity
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate to rebeccamycin analogue in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.
* Identify and establish in vitro biologic correlates of clinical responses and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour once on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 30 patients within 1.5 years.
