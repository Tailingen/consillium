Post-transplant PT/FLU+CY Promotes Unrelated Cord Blood Engraftment in Haplo-cord Setting in Childhood Leukemia

PTCy is a well-established haploidentical transplant regimen strategy. Moreover, unrelated cord blood (UCB) plays a critical role in the effects of GVL. However, the engraftment of grafts is unpredictable in the setting of a haplo-cord subsequent transplant. Therefore, applying a novel post-transplant regimen of PT/CY+FLU may selectively promote UCB engraftment in the setting of haplo-cord transplant.
