P53 in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
In clinical practise patients with negative radioiodine scan with positive tyhroglobulin is considered as radioiodine resistant or in another words in the process of dedifferentiation. The aim of the present study was to search a simple blood test that could lead to early identification of patients with dedifferentiation. In this respect, we investigate whether the serum level of anti-p53 antibody has the diagnostic value in the follow-up of patients with high levels of thyroglobulin (tg) and negative I-131 scan.
Thyroid Neoplasms
There was not any risk for patients., with in the first 8-10 months after surgery
In the present study enrolled were 171 patients with mean age of 47.7±13.5 yrs (range; 16-80yrs) and 28 healthy subjects with an age range of 18-52 yrs (mean: 36.0±9.8 yrs). 134 (78.4%) patients were female and 37 (21.6%) patients were male.
