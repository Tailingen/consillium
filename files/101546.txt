Phase I Safety Study of DMXAA in Refractory Tumors
This was a phase I study aimed at identifying safe doses of DMXAA (now known as ASA404) to be used in future combination studies with chemotherapy.
Refractory Tumors
DRUG: DMXAA
To identify a range of doses for DMXAA where there was either no effect or an acceptably small effect on QTc
To investigate and describe the relationship between QTc prolongation, plasma levels of DMXAA and time from start of infusion.|To further investigate the safety profile of DMXAA|To further investigate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of DMXAA|To further characterise the ophthalmic effects of DMXAA|To document anti-tumour activity and/or clinical signs of efficacy in patients|To assess the effects of DMXAA on tumour blood flow using dynamic MRI
This was a multi-centre randomized, double blind study to further characterize the effect of DMXAA on QTc interval, ophthalmic safety and pharmacodynamic effects on tumour blood flow.

Patients with refractory tumors were to each undergo six doses of treatment at weekly intervals, receiving each of six doses of DMXAA (300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400 and 3000 mg/m2)
