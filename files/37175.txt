A Phase I/IIa Clinical Trial to Investigate BVAC-E6E7 in Subjects with HPV Positive HNSCC.
BVAC-E6E7 is an immunotherapeutic vaccine designed to treat unresectable recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma positive to HPV 16 or 18. This clinical trial for BVAC-E6E7 consists of two phases: PhaseⅠfocuses on safety and tolerance to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), while Phase Ⅱ evaluates its efficacy.

[Part A] Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) after BVAC-E6E7 administration, The DLT assessment criteria are based on NCI-CTCAE v5.0. The assessment includes individual criteria for hematologic/non-hematologic toxicities and other toxicities.

DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) is defined as adverse events or abnormal laboratory values that limit the IP's dose-escalation and are not related to disease progression or intercurrent disease., On day 1 of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)|[Part B] Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ratio of subjects assessed with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as a best overall response., During entire clinical trial, an average of 18 months.|[Part B] Disease Control Rate (DCR), The ratio of subjects assessed with CR or PR or stable disease (SD) as a best overall response., During entire clinical trial, an average of 18 months.|[Part B] Duration of Response (DOR), Duration from objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death in subjects assessed with CR or PR as a best overall response., From the date of objective response (CR or PR) to the date of disease progression or death, assessed up to 18 months.|[Part B] 6-month Progression Free Survival rate (PFS rate) or PFS, 6-month PFS rate is defined as the ratio of subjects assessed with no disease progression or death at 6 months after the first IP administration.

PFS is defined as the duration until disease progression or death in subjects from the first IP administration., 6-month after the first IP administration for 6-month PFS / From first IP administration to disease progression or death for PFS|[Part B] 12-month Overall Survival rate (OS rate) or OS, 12-month OS rate is defined as the survival rate at 12-month after the first IP administration.

OS is defined as the duration until death in subjects from the first IP administration., 12-month after the first IP administration for 12-month OS rate / From first IP administration to death for OS
[Part A] Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ratio of subjects assessed with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as a best overall response., During entire clinical trial, an average of 18 months.|[Part A] Disease Control Rate (DCR), The ratio of subjects assessed with CR or PR or stable disease (SD) as a best overall response., During entire clinical trial, an average of 18 months.|[Part A] Duration of Response (DOR), Duration from objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death in subjects assessed with CR or PR as a best overall response., From objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death, assessed up to 18 months.|[Part A] 6-month Progression Free Survival rate (PFS rate) or PFS, 6-month PFS rate is defined as the ratio of subjects assessed with disease progression or death at 6 months after the first IP administration.

PFS is defined as the duration until disease progression or death in subjects from the first IP administration., 6-month after the first IP administration for 6-month PFS rate / From first IP administration to disease progression or death for PFS|[Part A] 12-month Overall Survival rate (OS rate) or OS, 12-month OS rate is defined as the survival rate at 12-month after the first IP administration.

OS is defined as the duration until death in subjects from the first IP administration., 12-month after the first IP administration for 12-month OS rate / From first IP administration to death for OS|[Part A/B] Adverse event, Every adverse event collected from the entire clinical trial is categorized by severity, causality, treatment, or outcome of each adverse event., During entire clinical trial, an average of 18 months.|[Part A/B] A number of subjects demonstrating abnormal CS in clinical laboratory test, Clinical laboratory test including hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, virus test (only at screening visit)., At screening visit, day 1 of every cycle, day 2 of cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days).|[Part A/B] A number of subjects demonstrating abnormal CS in vital sign, Vital sign including measure blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature, At screening visit and every visit from the first IP administration day, assessed up to 18 months.|[Part A/B] A number of subjects demonstrating abnormal CS in physical examination, The physical examination including examination of the appearance, skin, head/neck, chest/lungs, heart, abdomen, genitourinary/reproductive system, extremities, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, lymph nodes, and other organ., At screening visit, day 1 of cycle 1, Day 2 of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days). If necessary, it can be conducted according to judgement of investigator at other visits from the first IP administration day, assessed up to 18 months.|[Part A/B] A number of subjects demonstrating abnormal CS in 12-lead ECG, At screening visit, day 2 of cycle 6 (1 cycle is 21 days). If necessary, it can be conducted at other visits after first IP administration day until day 1 of cycle 6.|[Part A/B] Detection of E6E7 recombinant gene, Assesses whether the E6E7 recombinant gene is detected in peripheral blood by BVAC-E6E7 monitoring, At screening visit, day 1 of cycle 1 and day 2 of every cycle (each cycle is 21 days).|[Part A/B] T cell response, Spot Forming Units (SFU) counts, At day 1 of cycle 1, day 2 of every cycle, and week 24, 42, 60 after first IP administration (each cycle is 21 days).|[Part A/B] Cytokines in the blood, Concentration changes of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, At day 1 of cycle 1, day 2 of every cycle (each cycle is 21 days).|[Part A/B] Concentration changes of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) in lesion, (optional) at screening visit, day 2 of cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days).
