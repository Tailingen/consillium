Does Perioperative Goal Directed Therapy Using Flotrac Improve Outcomes in Esophagectomy Patients
The objective of this prospective, randomized controlled study is to ascertain whether the perioperative use of the FloTrac device to guide fluid and vasopressor management during esophagectomy improves patient outcomes. The primary outcome is cardiopulmonary complications; however, the secondary outcome of decreasing patient morbidity (acute renal injury, anastomotic leak, and overall length of both ICU (intensive care unit) and hospital stay.
