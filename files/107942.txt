Trial of Loncastuximab Tesirine in High Risk Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Post Transplant
Study of loncastuximab tesirine administered intravenously (IV) for maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplant in patients with relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma
Relapsed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: loncastuximab tesirine
Efficacy Outcome Measure, Progression-free survival (PFS) assessments will be determined according to Lugano Response Criteria. The distributions of time to event data will be graphically summarized using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and their median and confidence intervals will be estimated using KM estimates., From the start date of treatment initation until the date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 1-year following autoSCT|Safety Outcome Measure, Evaluate the safety and tolerability as defined by CTCAE 5.0 criteria, Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment
This is a Phase II, multicenter, open label study of loncastuximab tesirine for maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) in patients with relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients with relapsed DLBCL confirmed through core biopsy and meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients can be enrolled up to 4 weeks prior to autoSCT. Patients will start loncastuximab tesirine between day 30 and 60 after autoSCT as determined by the treating physician. Since majority of the relapses occur early after autoSCT, offering maintenance therapy for a finite duration might be of therapeutic benefit without posing excessive toxicity. Loncastuximab tesirine will be administered intravenously (IV) at every 3 weeks (Q3W) for a total of 6 months (8 cycles).
