Abraxane With Bevacizumab Biosimilar in Patients With Recurrent, Platinum-resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The study is a multi-center, prospective, one-arm, phase II clinical trial. It is tend to examine the safety and efficacy of combining abraxane(albumin-bound paclitaxel） and bevacizumab to treat patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant primary epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or peritoneal carcinoma.
Objective Response Rate
DRUG: albumin-bound paclitaxe combined with bevacizumab biosimilar
objective response rate, Radiologic imaging was scheduled to be performed at baseline, after every third treatment cycle, and at the end of treatment or time of progression unless it was done in the previous four weeks. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; objective response rate (ORR) = CR+PR, Assessed at the end of 6 cycle(each cycle is 21 days)
6-month progression-free survival rate, the percentage of participants with no progression event at 6 months after starting study treatment, assessed up to 6 months|progression-free survival, PFS was measured from day 1 of treatment until time of progression (assessed every 12 weeks) or death, whichever came first, up to 3 years|overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|Disease control rate, the percentage of complete and partial response as well as stable disease, Assessed at the end of 6 cycle(each cycle is 21 days)
