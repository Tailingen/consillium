A Study of TNFeradeâ„¢ Biologic With Concomitant Radiotherapy, Fluorouracil, and Hydroxyurea (TNF-FHX) in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The primary objective of the first phase is to determine the safety, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of TNFerade in combination with the previously studied combination of Fluorouracil (5FU), Hydroxyurea (HU) and standard daily radiotherapy in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (RHNC). All chemoradiotherapy is administered on a "week-on/week-off" schedule. The primary objective of the second phase II is to determine the locoregional control rate at 24 months.

locoregional control at 24 months
Locoregional control at 3, 6 and 12 months, as well as tumor response rate, progression-free survival at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, and the rate of metastases at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months will also be assessed.
