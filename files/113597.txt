Proof-of-Concept Study in Cancer Patients to Assess Efficacy of Elsiglutide in Preventing Chemotherapy-Induced Diarrhea
The main objective of this study will be to obtain data on the efficacy of elsiglutide in preventing Chemotherapy Induced Diarrhea (CID) in patients with colorectal cancer receiving 5-FU based chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI regimen) in comparison to placebo.
Diarrhea
DRUG: Elsiglutide|DRUG: Placebo
Number of Patients experiencing Diarrhea, Severity of Diarrhea will be classified according to the NCI-CTCAE., Day 1 to Day 14
Safety and tolerability of the administered repeated doses of elsiglutide (ZP1846) will be evaluated, Safety will be evaluated by monitoring:

* Physical examination
* Vital signs
* Clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis)
* 12-lead ECG
* AEs
* Immunogenicity testing in a subset of patients, Day 1 to Day 32|PK of elsiglutide will be evaluated, The followin standard PK parameters will be evaluated:

Tmax, Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-24, AUC0-∞, t1/2Z, λZ, CL/F, VZ/F, the effect of multiple dosing will be evaluated (accumulation ratio). Blood sampling for PK will be performed at: pre-dose, 2h, 4, 6, 12, 24 h post-dose, Day 1 to Day 5
The main objective of this study will be to obtain data on the efficacy of elsiglutide in preventing Chemotherapy Induced Diarrhea (CID) in patients with colorectal cancer receiving 5-FU based chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI regimen) in comparison to placebo.
