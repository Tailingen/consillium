Assessment of the Effect of Tumor Thickness and Site on Level IV Cervical Lymph Nodes in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Tongue and Floor of the Mouth: A Case Series Study
Regarding oral cavity cancer, the high incidence of neck metastasis along with its impact on survival and prognosis are in favor of elective neck dissection. Moreover, occult metastases could develop at lower levels in the neck (levels IV-V) Regarding the tongue, the rate of skip (occult) metastasis involving unremoved level IV cervical lymph nodes in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue ranges from 0 % - 11.4 %. However, no data is available or a correlation between the risk of level IV involvement and the affection of specific tongue subsites or a certain cutoff value of tumor thickness.
Tongue Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: removal of primary tumor, neck dissection
tumor thickness in mellimeters, histological assessment of tumor thickness of the resected tumor and assessment of level IV lymph nodes, one week: specimens are submitted immediately after surgery|Number of affected level IV cervical lymph nodes, In each case the specimen will be assessed for level IV lymph nodes affection, One week : submitted immediately after surgery
affected tongue site in relation to level IV cervical lymph nodes, histological assessment of level IV lymph nodes to determine if it is affected with tumor site on the tongue (lateral border, dorsum, ventral ....) which will be documented before surgery during examination, One week
