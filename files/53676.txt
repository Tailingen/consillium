A Comparison of FDG-PET Versus MRI Based Target Volume Delineation in Glioblastoma and the Role of FDG-PET/CT in the Alteration of MRI Based Target Volumes.
HYPOTHESIS AND SAMPLE SIZE The tumor delineated by FDG-PET is significantly different from the delineation achieved by MR T1 contrast weighted images in glioblastoma; expecting a standard error of 12.5 % (a confidence interval of 25%), with a confidence level set at 95%, a sample size of 15 patients would be accrued in the study.
