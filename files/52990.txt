Study to Evaluate Efficacy of PDR001 in Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus
Single arm phase II PDR001( 300mg, IV) will be treated every 3 weeks
Histologically Confirmed Unresectable or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus Who Failed on Standard Treatment
DRUG: PDR001
To evaluate efficacy of PDR001 by Objective Response rate by RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), In the first stage of the trial, 22 patients will be recruited, and their tumor response will be assessed RECIST criteria, which is widely used tumor assessment criteria in immuno-oncology agent trials. The best response until 6 months according to irRECIST will be evaluated, and this trial will proceed to second stage if three or more respondents (irPR or irCR) are observed among 22 patients. The response (PR or CR) should be confirmed by next disease assessment(6 weeks/2cycles after initial response).

Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than recurrence will move into the Follow-Up Phase and should be assessed every 16 weeks (Â± 14 days) by radiologic imaging to monitor disease status., Repeated tumor imaging will be performed every 2 cycle (each cycle is 21 days) after baseline imaging
To evaluate antitumor efficacy of PDR001: PFS(Progression-Free Survival), PFS is defined as the time between the day of first cycle and the date of first documentation of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. Documentation of progression will be defined as per RECIST criteria based on investigator assessment. Patients without documented progression or death will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment (or, if no tumor assessments are performed after the baseline visit)., Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)|To evaluate antitumor efficacy of PDR001: OS(Overall survival), OS is defined as the time between the day of first cycle and the date of death. Patients without documented death will be censored at the date of last contact., Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)|To evaluate antitumor efficacy of PDR001, DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents. RECIST will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT or MRI may be utilized, as per RECIST, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study., Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)
