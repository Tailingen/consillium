Evaluation of the Association Between CYP2D6 Genetic Polymorphisms and the Treatment Effect of Tamoxifen
Primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on time to progression after tamoxifen treatment in pre- or postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, we will evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on clinical benefit and response duration to tamoxifen administration in pre- or postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer and also evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on the steady state plasma concentration of tamoxifen and its metabolites
