Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel works better with or without bevacizumab in treating breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is to see if paclitaxel works better with or without bevacizumab in treating patients who have locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression-Free Survival, Assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the time to treatment failure in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab.
* Compare the objective response rate, duration of response, overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease-free interval (no more than 24 months vs more than 24 months), number of metastatic sites (less than 3 vs 3 or more), treatment with prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative vs unknown). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.
* Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on day 1 of weeks 17 and 33.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 316-650 patients (158-325 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 31 months.
