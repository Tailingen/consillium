Studying T Cells in Blood and Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about T cells and plan better treatment for multiple myeloma.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at T cells in blood and bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm
OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: immunoenzyme technique|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Percentage of Myeloma-specific T Cells ex Vivo Expanded Using Flow Cytometry, Collection of PBMCs over a period of 9-12 months, and the laboratory component will be performed over another year.
Cell Counts of Myeloma-specific T Cells ex Vivo Expanded Before and After CD3/CD28 Stimulation, Collection of PBMCs over a period of 9-12 months, and the laboratory component will be performed over another year.
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the feasibility of expanding myeloma-specific T cells using autologous ex vivo expanded B cells loaded with myeloma antigens as antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma.

Secondary

* To examine the feasibility of selecting and expanding myeloma-specific T cells ex vivo using interferon γ release and CD3/CD28 stimulation.

OUTLINE: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed to assess the feasibility of expanding autologous B cells ex vivo using CD40L and IL-4; the antigen-presenting phenotype of autologous B-cell antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) using flow cytometry; and the antigen-presenting function of B-APCs using ELISPOT and chromium-release assay. Myeloma-specific interferon γ secreting T cells are isolated and selected using Miltenyi beads. The selected myeloma-specific T cells are expanded ex vivo using anti CD3/CD28 beads.
