A Phase II Trial of Proton Pump Inhibitors With Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to standard chemotherapy can improve progression free survival in patients with head and neck cancer.
Cancer of Head and Neck
DRUG: Omeprazole|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: 5FU|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Time to progression, The primary aim, progression-free survival, will be defined from start of treatment to date of first progression and will be tested using a Cox proportional hazard regression model with treatment arm as the only predictor., 6 months post treatment
Median overall survival, Overall survival be evaluated with Cox models and will be defined from the first date of treatment to date of death., 6 months post treatment|Proportion of patients that experience a response to treatment, Estimate the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), objective response (CR+PR) and clinical benefit (CR+PR+Stable disease) and compare responses between the group receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and the group not receiving PPIs., 6 months post treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to standard chemotherapy can improve progression free survival in patients with head and neck cancer.
