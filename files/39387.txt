Irinotecan in Treating Aging Patients With Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Aging may affect the way these drugs work.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the relationship between aging and the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who have solid tumors.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
overall survival, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether there is a relationship between the pharmacokinetic characteristics of irinotecan and aging in patients with non-hematologic malignancies.
* Determine whether there is a relationship between the toxic effects of this drug and aging in these patients.
* Determine whether the relationship between genotype (UGT1A1, CYP3A, and other relevant genes) and phenotype (pharmacokinetics, toxicity) is affected by aging in these patients treated with this drug.
* Analyze data collected on the co-morbid conditions and concurrent medications in these patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (18 to 55 vs 70 and over).

Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
