Multimodal Connectome Study of Brain Tumor-operated Patients
In this pilot study, the investigators propose a multimodal evaluation of the brain connectivity of brain tumor patients, in order to better understand the effects induced by focal lesions on brain structure and function, as well as brain plasticity mechanisms that may occur in such condition. The investigators aim at drawing a multimodal brain connectivity map of focally brain-damaged patients, with a view to improve onco-functional neurosurgical practices.
Tumor, Brain
OTHER: dMRI, fMRI and electrocorticography
Correlations between tumor topography, cortical electrical conduction rates measured in electrocorticography, and microstructural measurements of white substance from diffusion MRI, 1 month
Correlations between neurological disorders, tumor topography and network disruption identified in functional rest MRI, 1 month
Patients included in the present study will first perform the pre-operative MRI (dMRI and fMRI) with a specific High Resolution Angular Diffusion (HARDI) sequence and a functional acquisition at rest. Then, the investigators will record their cortico-cortical evoked potentials elicited by direct electrostimulation during the surgery, just before the tumor removal, following our usual protocol. Finally, all data (clinical, diffusion, electrical and functional connectivity) will be processed and correlated to each other.
