XCHT for Irinotecan-Induced Gut Toxicities (Run-in Study)
Run-in safety study, to determine the safety of co-administration of irinotecan, raloxifene, and Xiao Chai Hu Tang (XCHT), and to optimize the blood collection time points for pharmacokinetic (PK) study for another randomized control trial.
Malignant Tumor|Diarrhea
DRUG: Xiao Chai Hu Tang (XCHT)|OTHER: Raloxifene|DRUG: FOLFIRI regimen
Average trajectory of irinotecan, raloxifene, XCHT and their metabolites (14 compounds), Plasma concentration for each compounds will be tested at 8 points for each Round., The blood samples (2.0 ml) will be collected at 8 points for each Round (hour 0, hour 0.5, hour 1, hour 2, hour 4, hour 6, hour 8, and hour 24 after raloxifene administration)
incidences of grade ≥3 diarrhea, The diarrhea severity will be evaluated following standard criteria in NCI-CTC AE 5.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 months|occult blood test for stool, occult blood test for stool, reported as negative, weak positive, and positive., Through study completion, an average of 2 months|incidence of other chemo-related adverse effects, Other adverse reactions will be evaluated following standard criteria in NCI-CTC AE 5.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 months.|incidence of diarrhea (grade ≥2), The diarrhea severity will be evaluated following standard criteria in NCI-CTC AE 5.0 Grade 2 is defined as Stool is increased by 4-6 times each day relative to baseline; discharge from stoma moderately increased., Through study completion, an average of 2 months.
There will be two cohorts with a total of 24 patients in this study. Cohort A will enroll 6 naïve postmenopausal female patients who have never received irinotecan treatment before. Patients in this group will have 4 rounds of studies following different protocol to determine (1) the impact of XCHT on raloxifene PK (Round 0, co-administration of XCHT and raloxifene); (2) the impact of XCHT on irinotecan PK (Round 1, co-administration of XCHT and standard FOLFIRI); (3) the safety of co- administration of XCHT, raloxifene, and FOLFIRI and evaluation of raloxifene as a probe for XCHT treatment to prevent irinotecan-induced severe delayed-onset diarrhea (Round 2 and 3, co-administration of XCHT, raloxifene, and standard FOLFIRI). The reason to recruit postmenopausal women is that these patients usually take raloxifene to prevent osteoporosis and the risk of raloxifene is expected to be limited.

Cohort B will recruit 18 patients who were treated with irinotecan previously and have at least one diarrhea episode with a severity of ≥grade 2. The reason we propose to recruit patients who had diarrhea induced by irinotecan is that these patients are supposed to be sensitive to irinotecan so that we can determine the PK changes and safety. Patients in this group will have 3 rounds of FOLFIRI chemotherapy to determine (1) the impact of FOLFIRI on raloxifene PK (Round 1, co-administration of FOLFIRI with raloxifene); (2) the complete PK profile of SN-38, SN-38G, raloxifene, raloxifene-glucuronide, and XCHT components (Round 2, co- administration of FOLFIRI with XCHT and raloxifene); and (3) the safety of co-administration of XCHT, raloxifene, and FOLFIRI in sensitive patients and evaluation of raloxifene as a probe for XCHT treatment to prevent irinotecan-induced diarrhea (Round 3, co-administration of XCHT, raloxifene and standard FOLFIRI).
