An Open-label, Dose-escalation Safety and Tolerability Trial Assessing Anti-KIR (1-7F9) in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
Development of new treatments for diseases such as multiple myeloma is a focus for research. The research being conducted is on treatment called Anti-KIR (1-7F9), which activates the body's own cells to kill tumor cells. This is different from many other treatments where chemicals are given to kill tumor cells. The purpose of the study is to determine a safe dose of Anti-KIR (1-7F9) to administer in humans and to gain information about its effectiveness in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Anti-KIR (1-7F9)
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of IPH2101 as Determined by Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Related to IPH2101 Treatment, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest dose level below the maximum administered dose (MAD) where none or 1 out of 6 subjects have a DLT., From start of the treatment to end of study
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IPH2101 After Cycle 1 Administration, Cmax was obtained from the plasma concentration versus time data after IV administration of IPH2101., Anti-KIR (1-7F9) concentrations were measured prior to infusion at 0.167, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then on Days 7, 14 and 21 after the start of the first dose administration|Area Under the Plasma-concentration-time Curve [AUC (INF)] of IPH2101 After Cycle 1 Administration, AUC(INF), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last time of the last quantifiable concentration within the dosing interval was calculated for Cycle 1., Anti-KIR (1-7F9) concentrations were measured prior to infusion at 0.167, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then on Days 7, 14 and 21 after the start of the first dose administration|Number of Evaluable Patients With Stable Disease. "Evaluable" is Defined as 2 Consecutive M Protein Assessments, Disease Response Assessment by Principal Investigator and Sponsor(Efficacy Population).Stable Disease was defined as not meeting criteria for complete response, very good partial response, partial response, or progressive disease, From start of the treatment to end of study or disease progression
Trial Design:

The trial is an open-label, dose-escalation trial to determine the safety and tolerability of Anti-KIR (1-7F9) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). A 3+3 design will be employed for the first dosing cycle at each dose level. The 7 planned dose levels are 0.0003 mg/kg, 0.003 mg/kg, 0.015 mg/kg, 0.075 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg. The subjects will receive up to a total of 4 administrations of Anti-KIR (1-7F9) with a dosing interval between each administration of 4 weeks. Safety, toxicity, PK (pharmacokinetic) and PD (pharmacodynamic) obtained in the first 4 weeks after dosing per group will be the basis for dose-escalation decisions. There will be follow-up visits every week the one month after the first administration and every two weeks following the second, third and fourth administrations. After the last administration there will be follow-up visits every month until KIR occupancy is no longer detected.
