Breast Mesh Used in Two-staged Breast Reconstruction
This is the first prospective randomized and controlled study on the efficacy and safety of TiLOOP® Bra mesh in patients with expander-implant breast reconstruction. The investigators hypothesize that incoporating TiLOOP Bra mesh with tissue expanders will reduce the rates of capsular contraction, improve the efficiency of expansion and provide better aesthetic result.

PROCEDURE: TiLoop Bra mesh in expander-implant breast reconstrution|PROCEDURE: sub-pectoral expander-implant breast reconstruction
Complication Rates, complications related to the reconstructed breast, including flap complications, capsular contracture, surgical site infection, prosthetic malposition/extrusion, reconstruction failure, etc., up to 24 months after surgery|Expansion Efficiency, percentage of average injected saline volume to total volume (E=average volume/ total volume）through study completion, an average of 1 year, through study completion, an average of 1 year
number of revision surgery, To record the rate of surgical revision events on the breast including but not limited to fat tranplantation, reduction mammoplasty/mastompexy, contralateral augmentation,, from the completion of expander exchange up to 24 months after surgery|aesthetic outcome graded by Harris evaluation score and Breast-Q questionaire, Harris evaluation score was used to evaluate the aesthetic outcome of patients' reconstructed breasts, which was scored as "excellent," "good," "fair," "poor".

Breast-Q questionaire was also used to evaluate the aesthetic outcome of patients' reconstructed breast., from the completion of expander exchange up to 24 months after surgery|psychological evaluation by Breast-Q questionnaire, We use the Breast-Q questionnaire to evaluate patients' satisfaction via the reconstruction module of BREAST-Q., from the completion of expander exchange up to 24 months after surgery|total cost, total cost in RMB per captia, from expander implation up to the completion of expander exchange,through study completion, an average of 1 year|number of occurrence of deep venous thrombosis, post-operative occurrence of deep venous thrombosis, from expander implation up to the completion of expander exchange, through study completion, an average of 1 year|number of occurrence of non-surgical site infection, post-operative occurrence of non-surgical site infection including but not limited pneumonia, urinary tract infection, etc., from expander implation up to the completion of expander exchange, through study completion, an average of 1 year
