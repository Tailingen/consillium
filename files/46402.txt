Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Inoperable Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with inoperable stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy
Local Control at 2 Years, Local control is defined as absence of local failure, which is defined as the combination of primary tumor failure (PTF) or involved lobe failure (ILF). PTF was defined based on meeting two criteria: 1. Local enlargement defined as ≥ 20% increase in the longest diameter of the gross tumor volume (GTV) per computerized tomography (CT), and 2. Evidence of tumor viability. Tumor viability could be affirmed by either demonstrating positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with uptake of a similar intensity as the pretreatment staging PET, or by repeat biopsy confirming carcinoma. PTF included marginal failures occurring within 1 cm of the planning target volume (PTV). ILF is defined as failure beyond the primary tumor but within the involved lobe. Local control time is defined as time from start of treatment to the the date of local recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local failure (censored). Rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From the start of treatment to 2 years
Proportion of Subjects With Specified Adverse Events, Specified adverse events are defined as any treatment-related adverse events that are grade 4, grade 5, or any of the following treatment-related grade 3 adverse events:

* Gastrointestinal: dysphagia, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, esophageal ulceration;
* Cardiac: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction;
* Neurologic: myelitis, neuropathy (cranial and motor)
* Hemorrhage: pulmonary or upper respiratory
* Pulmonary: decline in pulmonary function as measured by pulmonary function tests, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, hypoxemia, pleural effusion.

Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE., From randomization to last follow-up. Analysis occurred after all patients had been on study for at least 2 years. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 4.2 years.|Rate of Local Recurrence at 2 Years, Local failure is defined as the combination of primary tumor failure (PTF) or involved lobe failure (ILF). PTF was defined based on meeting two criteria: 1. Local enlargement defined as ≥ 20% increase in the longest diameter of the gross tumor volume (GTV) per computerized tomography (CT), and 2. Evidence of tumor viability. Tumor viability could be affirmed by either demonstrating positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with uptake of a similar intensity as the pretreatment staging PET, or by repeat biopsy confirming carcinoma. PTF included marginal failures occurring within 1 cm of the planning target volume (PTV). ILF is defined as failure beyond the primary tumor but within the involved lobe. Time to local recurrence is defined as time from start of treatment to the the date of local recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local recurrence (censored)., From the start of treatment to 2 years|Rate of Regional Recurrence at 2 Years, Regional recurrence is defined as hilar, mediastinal, and supraclavicular nodal failure.Time to regional recurrence is defined as time from start of treatment to the date of first regional recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death without regional recurrence (competing risk). Rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From the start of treatment to 2 years|Rate of Disseminated Recurrence at 2 Years, Disseminated recurrence is defined as uninvolved lobe failures and failures beyond the lungs and regional lymph nodes. Time to disseminated recurrence is defined as time from start of treatment to the the date of disseminated recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death without disseminated recurrence (competing risk). Rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From the start of treatment to 2 years|Rate of Disease-free Survival at 2 Years, Disease is defined as local or regional progression or development of distant metastases. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from start of treatment to the date of disease, death, or last known follow-up (censored). Disease-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From the start of treatment to 2 years|Rate of Overall Survival at 2 Years, Overall survival time is defined as time from start of treatment to the date of death from any cause. Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact., From the start of treatment to 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine whether treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy results in acceptable local control (i.e., ≥ 80%) in patients with medically inoperable stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer.

Secondary

* Determine treatment-related toxicity in patients treated with this therapy.
* Determine disease-free survival, overall survival, and patterns of failure in patients treated with this therapy.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy over 8-14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 26 months.
