A First-in-human Study of 3HP-2827 in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors With FGFR2 Alterations
The study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 3HP-2827 in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with FGFR2 alterations. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: dose escalation stage (Stage I) and expansion stage (Stage II).
Solid Tumors With FGFR2 Alterations, Adult
DRUG: 3HP-2827
Dose Escalation Stage- incidence of adverse events (AEs), From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Dose Escalation Stage- incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Days 1-28 of Cycle 1 (a cycle is 28 days)|Dose Escalation Stage -Percentage of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Targeted Vital Signs, From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Dose Escalation Stage -Percentage of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Targeted Clinical Laboratory Test Results, From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Dose Escalation Stage -Percentage of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Targeted ECG Parameters, From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Dose Escalation Stage -determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose (RD) for expansion stage or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of 3HP-2827, Initiation of study drug until study discontinuation, (up to approximately 24 months)|Expansion stage -Objective response rate（ORR）, Initiation of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 36 months)
Plasma Concentration of 3HP-2827 and/or its major metabolites, Initiation of study drug until study discontinuation（up to 45 months）|Duration of Response (DOR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1, Up to 45 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by RECIST v1.1, Up to 45 months|Overall survival, Up to 48 months|Dose escalation stage - Objective Response Rate (ORR), Up to 45 months|Expansion Stage- incidence of adverse events (AEs), From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Expansion Stage -Percentage of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Targeted Vital Signs, From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Expansion Stage -Percentage of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Targeted Clinical Laboratory Test Results, From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose|Expansion Stage -Percentage of Participants With Changes From Baseline in Targeted ECG Parameters, From baseline up until 28 days after the final dose
