Clinical Trial Protocol to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Laparoscopic Surgical Systems for Gynaecological Surgery
Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of thoracic and abdominal endoscopic surgical systems manufactured by Shenzhen Cornerstone Robotics Technology Co., Ltd. for use ingynaecological surgical procedures.
Cervical Cancer|Endometrial Cancer
DEVICE: Robot-assisted surgery
Surgical non-referral rate, Surgical untransferred is defined as not converted from an experimental medical device assisted method to another surgical device control system assisted, laparoscopic surgery or open surgery., During the surgery
The surgeon's operating time, Operative time（minutes）, During the surgery|Intraoperative blood loss, Estimated blood loss（milliliters，ml）, During the surgery|Length of postoperative stay, Total number of days the patient was in hospital from the day of surgery to discharge., up to 12 weeks
The trial was designed using a prospective, single-centre, single-group target value approach.

For subjects who intend to undergo gynaecological surgery assisted by the Thoracic and Abdominal Endoscopic Surgical System.
