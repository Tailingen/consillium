Integrative Proteomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
A large-scale, high-throughput, multi-dimensional comprehensive study of PDAC multiomics will be carried out. In this study, clinical specimens of resected PDAC collected by our research group from 2017 to 2019 will be selected as research objects.Tumor tissues and their adjacent non-tumor tissues from more than 200 PDAC patients are expected to be used for genome, transcriptome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of proteome and phosphorylated proteome.Combined with the data results of multiomics, bioinformatics analysis and network database information, we will clarify the relationship between multiomics of pancreatic cancer and established the new subtyping of pancreatic cancer proteome. A molecular landscape of the progression of pancreatic cancer at the genome-transcriptome-proteome level provides new therapeutic targets to improve the prognosis of this deadly disease.
