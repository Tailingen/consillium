Socioeconomic Status, Secondary Prevention Activities and Recurrence After a Myocardial Infarction
This is a nationwide cohort study on real-world patients (n≈30,000) surviving a first myocardial infarction (MI) 2006-2013 and alive to attend a routine 1-year follow-up. Associations between Socioeconomic Status (SES) and secondary preventive actions (SPAs) throughout the first year is studied and assessed as possible mechanisms underlying the increased risk of a first recurrent hard cardiocvascular (CV) outcome, recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (rASCVD), in patients with low Socioeconomic Status during long-term follow-up (2006-2018).
