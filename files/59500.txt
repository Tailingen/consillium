A Phase Ib Dose Escalation Study of the Combination of LEE011 With Letrozole and Dose Expansion of LEE011 With Hormonal Therapy for the Treatment of Pre-(With Goserelin) and Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2-negative, Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of the Phase Ib is to:

1. determine the recommended dose of LEE011 in combination with a standard dose of letrozole as well as to provide additional safety and anti-tumor activity data in Asian non-Japanese patients
2. determine the recommended dose of LEE011 in combination with a standard dose of letrozole as well as to provide additional safety and activity data in Japanese patients
3. evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of LEE011 at the RP2D established in the dose escalation part in combination with a standard dose of letrozole, fulvestrant or tamoxifen plus goserelin in Japanese patients.

DRUG: LEE011|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: goserelin
Phase Ib Dose escalation - Frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs at each dose level associated with administration of LEE011 and letrozole, first cycle (28 days)|Phase Ib Dose Expansion: Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), This will be defined by changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs and ECGs, frequency and duration of AEs, lab abnormalities and other safety parameters.

For LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Phase Ib Dose Expansion: Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs), This will be defined by changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs and ECGs, frequency and duration of SAEs, lab abnormalities and other safety parameters.

For LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) - Phase Ib dose escalation, This will be defined by changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs and ECGs, frequency and duration of AEs, lab abnormalities and other safety parameters.

For LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) - Phase Ib dose escalation, This will be defined by changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs and ECGs, frequency and duration of SAEs, lab abnormalities and other safety parameters.

For LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Phase Ib dose expansion, Anti-tumor activity for LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - Phase Ib dose expansion, Anti-tumor activity for LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Composite Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of LEE011 (and relevant metabolites) and letrozole - Phase Ib, As assessed by PK parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-24hours, accumulation ratio and Ctrough for LEE011 (and relevant metabolites) and letrozole, tamoxifen and fulvestrant, C1D1, C1D2, C1D8, C1D15, C1D21, C1D22, C2D15, C3D15|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as per RECIST v1.1- phase Ib dose expansion, Anti-tumor activity for LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Overall Survival (OS) - Phase Ib dose expansion, Anti-tumor activity for LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) - Phase Ib dose expansion, Anti-tumor activity for LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months|Duration of Response (DOR) - Phase Ib dose expansion, Anti-tumor activity for LEE011 and letrozole or tamoxifen or fulvestrant, 18 months
