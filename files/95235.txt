The aim for this study is to investigate the ability of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT to detect recurrence of prostate cancer
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Cancer Patients With Detectable PSA Following Prostatectomy|Prostate Cancer Recurrent|Prostate Cancer Patients Who Have Brachytherapy Seed Implant|Prostate Cancer Patients Treated by Radiotherapy|Cryotherapy
DRUG: 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA
Ability of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT to detect recurrence of prostate cancer, Co-primary endpoints of participant-level CDR and region level PPV assessed independently for Day 1 and Day 2:

* Participant-level CDR, defined as the proportion of TP participants scan out of all participants
* Region-level PPV, defined as the proportion of TP regions out of all positive regions., Up to 52 Weeks
To investigate the safety and tolerability of 64-CuSAR-bisPSMA, Incidence and severity of TEAEs and SAEs following the administration of 64CuSARbisPSMA, Up to 52 Weeks|To assess the participants-level PPV of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT, Participant-level PPV, defined as the proportion of participants with a TP scan out of all participants with a true or false positive scan., Up to 52 Weeks|To assess the participant-level DR of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT, Participant-level DR, defined as the proportion of participants with a positive scan out of all participants., Up to 52 Weeks|To determine the efficacy of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT in participants with negative or equivocal conventional imaging at baseline, Detection Rate in participants with a negative or equivocal conventional imaging at baseline., Up to 52 Weeks|To determine the effect of the composition of Reference Standard on the performance of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT, Positive Predictive Value (participant- and region-level) assessed in subgroups based on the type of evidence and with/without histopathology., Up to 52 Weeks|To evaluate the consistency among readers and the reproducibility of the 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT readings, Inter-reader variability expressed with kappa statistics for the 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT interpretation by the three central readers., Up to 52 Weeks|To evaluate the consistency among readers and the reproducibility of the 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT readings, Intra-reader variability expressed with kappa statistics for the 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT interpretation by the three central readers., Up to 52 Weeks|To determine the efficacy of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT in participants with negative or equivocal conventional imaging at baseline, Positive Predictive Values (participant and region level) in participants with a negative or equivocal conventional imaging at baseline., Up to 52 Weeks|To determine the effect of the composition of Reference Standard on the performance of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT, Correct Detection Rate assessed in subgroups based on the type of evidence and with/without histopathology., Up to 52 Weeks
