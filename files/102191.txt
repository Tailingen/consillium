mFOLFIRINOX With or Without Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) is the standard of care for patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While radiotherapy has been investigated for the management of resectable or locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, its role in the era of modern chemotherapy is not clear. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is the novel technique of radiotherapy to enhance the dose of radiotherapy to the target tumor lesion. This trial aims to compare the efficacy and safety of mFOLFIRINOX with or without SBRT in patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma
