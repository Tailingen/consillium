Risk Factors for Shoulder Joint Motion Restriction
In breast cancer patients, limitation of shoulder joint movement may occur following cancer treatment. Shoulder limitation causes a significant decrease in the patient's participation in activities of daily living. The aim of the study is to define these limitations, to evaluate in detail all the structures that cause the problem, and to determine the causes of the limitations in patients with shoulder joint movement limitation developed after breast cancer survivors.
Breast Cancer Survivors
OTHER: measurement of tissue stiffness (N/m)|OTHER: measurement of passive muscle tone (Hz)|OTHER: measurement of creep of tissue|OTHER: measurement of the range of shoulder joint motion|OTHER: measurement of skin temperature|OTHER: measurement of pain|OTHER: measurement of pain pressure threshold|OTHER: measurement of grip strength
measurement of tissue stiffness (N/m), Stiffness values will be measured with myotonPro on centers of coordination located along the myofascial chain, Baseline|measurement of passive muscle tone (Hz), muscle tones will be measured with myotonPro on centers of coordination located along the myofascial chain, Baseline|measurement of creep of tissue, creep of tissue will be measured with myotonPro on centers of coordination located along the myofascial chain, Baseline|measurement of the range of shoulder joint motion, The range of shoulder flexion, abduction, extension and external-internal rotation movements will be measured with a universal goniometer., Baseline
measurement of skin temperature, measurements will be taken from the area covering 3 cm of the surgical incision with a P45 thermographic camera with high thermal sensitivity, Baseline|measurement of pain, Pain will be evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS). In the scale, the patient is asked to mark the most appropriate pain intensity on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (tolerable pain). The higher the score, the greater the pain intensity., Baseline|measurement of pain pressure threshold, Pain pressure threshold will be evaluated by a digital algometer, Baseline|measurement of grip strength, The grip strength of both hand will be evaluated by "hand-held" dynamometer., Baseline
