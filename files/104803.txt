A Single-center Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Bone Marrow-derived DCs(CellgramDC-WT1) and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Who Have Failed First-line or More Standard Chemotherapy
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of immune cell therapy using autologous bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed at least one standard anticancer treatment.
Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: dentritic cell infusion and immunecheckpoint inhibitor
treatment related adeverse event, for 1yr
overall response rate, treatment response, for 1yr
After a test subject agrees in writing to participate in a clinical study, if he or she is determined to fit the selection criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria through a screening process, he or she is enrolled in the clinical study.

After consenting to the study, subjects set a bone marrow collection date within 7 days of registration, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is administered the day before bone marrow collection. After bone marrow collection (approximately 30-50 ml) on the day of bone marrow collection, autologous bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (Cellgram-DC-WT1) made by isolating CD141+ cells from the bone marrow are administered intravenously together with pembrolizumab, at 3-week intervals. After repeating the test drug administration 3 times at 3-week intervals, a radiological response evaluation of the tumor is performed, and a decision is made to continue or terminate the test drug administration according to the response evaluation results. If the response evaluation results for the tumor fall into a complete response, partial response, or stable disease, administration of the test drug is continued, and the response evaluation is repeated three times at three-week intervals. If the response evaluation result for the tumor is progressive disease, administration of the test drug is terminated.
