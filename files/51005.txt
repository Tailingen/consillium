Analysis of Immediate Urinary Continence Predictors After RS-RARP
This study is a retrospective, single-center clinical trial. It aims to retrospectively analyze the immediate postoperative urinary continence recovery in prostate cancer patients who underwent Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the investigators' center. Based on the general conditions of patients, relevant perioperative clinical indicators, and parameters related to the sphincter and prostate gland measured by MRI, it explores the influencing factors of immediate urinary continence recovery after Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients and constructs a relevant prediction model, thereby providing clinical guidance value for predicting immediate postoperative urinary continence recovery.
