A Study of GFH925 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With KRAS G12C Mutations
Phase Ia:

To evaluate the safety/tolerability of GFH925 in subjects with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced solid tumors; To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GFH925.

Phase Ib:

To evaluate the efficacy of GFH925 in subjects with KRAS G12C mutant advanced colorectal cancer or other tumors.

Phase II:

To evaluate the efficacy of GFH925 in subjects with KRAS G12C mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
