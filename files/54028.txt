Prognostic Factors Affecting Survival of Gastric GIST
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common non-epithelial mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgical treatment is the only curative therapy for primary localized GIST. This study aimed to identify the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric GISTs and to study the predictive factors for recurrence in Tunisian patients.
Gastric GIST
OTHER: total or subtotal gastrectomy
number of patients operated for gastric GIST, the patient having adenocarcinoma or other histopathological type are excluded, 30 days
The prognosis of gastric GIST depends on various tumor factors with the most important being the mitotic index and tumor necrosis. Imatinib therapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced GIST.

They have been the subject of much controversy in terms of their histogenesis, classification, treatment and prognosis. GISTs are histologically similar to smooth muscle and nerve tumors such as leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas or schwannomas. Currently they are well characterized with the recent discovery of the C-KIT gene mutation and the expression by tumor cells of the C-KIT protein.

Moreover, the discovery of this receptor is at the origin of the introduction of a "targeted therapy": an anti-tyrosine kinase molecule having revolutionized the therapeutic management of these tumors. However, the standard curative treatment of GIST remains complete surgical resection with negative margin from the tumor.
