Multi-Site Trial of Navigation vs Treatment as Usual to Improve Initiation of Timely Adjuvant Therapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of a navigation-based multilevel intervention (ENDURE) with treatment as usual to improve the initiation of guideline-adherent postoperative radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer. The main questions the trial aims to answer are:

* Does ENDURE improve initiation of timely PORT relative to treatment as usual?
* Does ENDURE improve initiation of timely PORT in regards to racial disparities relative to treatment as usual?
* What are the mechanisms through which ENDURE improves timeliness to treatment?
Head and Neck Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Oropharynx Cancer|Oral Cavity Cancer|Larynx Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: ENDURE
Initiation of Timely PORT, The initiation of PORT \> 6 weeks (42 days) following definitive surgery for HNSCC., 3 months
Time-to-PORT, The number of days from the date of definitive surgery for HNSCC to the date of initiation of PORT., 4 months|Pre-Surgical consultation with radiation oncology, Consultation with a treating radiation oncologist prior to definitive surgery for HNSCC., 1 month|Pre-radiation therapy dental extractions, The removal of indicated carious/non-restorable teeth prior to or during the surgery for HNSCC., 1 month|Time to postoperative scheduling with radiation oncology, The time from definitive surgery to the placement of the postoperative referral (or follow-up appointment) with the treating radiation oncologist., 3 months|Time to postoperative appointment with radiation oncology, Time from definitive surgery to the attendance at an appointment with the treating radiation oncologist., 3 months
In this hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study, the investigators will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with cancer centers (n=4; 484 patients) randomized to sequentially deliver treatment as usual (TAU) then ENDURE to patients with head and neck cancer undergoing surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (PORT). The trial will assess the effect of ENDURE vs TAU on improving initiation of timely PORT (primary objective) and the underlying mechanisms of ENDURE (secondary objective). The investigators will concurrently conduct a mixed-methods study with quantitative measures of implementation outcomes and qualitative data about implementation determinants from semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and site visits (exploratory objective).
