A Study of Tagraxofusp in Combination With Venetoclax and Azacitidine in Adults With Untreated CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Cannot Undergo Intensive Chemotherapy
This study will be divided into 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 will evaluate 2 doses of tagraxofusp (9 and 12 micrograms/kilogram/day \[μg/kg/day\]), used in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine, to determine the dose for Part 2. This determined dose, in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine, will then be further evaluated in Part 2 in 2 cohorts (TP53 mutated and TP53 wild type). Both parts will be conducted in participants with previously untreated CD123+ AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Tagraxofusp|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine
Part 1: Determination of Part 2 Selected Dose of Tagraxofusp When Administered in Combination with Venetoclax and Azacitidine, Cycles 1-4 (up to 112 days; 28 days/cycle)|Part 2: Number of Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Remission (CR), Cycles 1-4 (up to 112 days; 28 days/cycle)
Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants Achieving a BOR of CR, Cycles 1-6 (up to 168 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Time to First CR, The time to first CR will be defined as the time from randomization (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the date of first documented CR., Cycles 1-6 (up to 168 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Duration of Response, Cycles 1-6 (up to 168 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants Achieving a BOR of CR, CR with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi), or CR with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh), Cycles 1-4 (up to 112 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Time to First Composite CR, The time to first composite CR will be defined as the time from randomization (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the date of first documented CR, CRi, or CRh., Cycles 1-4 (up to 112 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants Achieving a BOR of CR or CRi, Cycles 1-6 (up to 168 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Time to first CR/CRi, The time to first CR/CRi will be defined as the time from randomization (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the date of first documented CR or CRi., Cycles 1-6 (up to 168 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS will be defined as the time from the date of randomization (Cycle 1, Day 1) until the date of treatment failure, hematologic relapse after CR/CRi/CRh, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 6 years|Parts 1 and 2: CR with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative, Defined as the number of participants with a presence of marrow MRD of less than 0.01% at the time of CR., Cycles 1-6 (up to 168 days; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants Who Bridged to Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) Through Study Treatment, Up to approximately 6 years|Parts 1 and 2: Plasma Concentration of Free Tagraxofusp, Venetoclax, and Azacitidine, Predose, up to 8 hours post dose (Days 4, 5, 6, 7, 14; Cycles 1-6; 28 days/cycle)|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Serum Anti-drug Antibodies for Tagraxofusp, Venetoclax, and Azacitidine, Day 4 of each cycle (each cycle is 28 days) up to the end of study (approximately 6 years)|Parts 1 and 2: Exposure-response of Free Tagraxofusp When Administered in Combination with Venetoclax and Azacitidine, The exposure-response relationship will be assessed utilizing the CR rate/composite CR rate and the number of participants experiencing adverse events of interest. This model-based analysis will be conducted to compare the exposure and response of free tagraxofusp, venetoclax, and azacitidine with venetoclax and azacitidine. Results will be reported as percent probability, wherein changes in the percent probability would indicate corresponding changes in the response rates with changes in exposure., Up to approximately 6 years
