Ramucirumab and Atezolizumab After Progression on Any Immune Checkpoint Blocker in NSCLC
Data suggests that combining ramucirumab with immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have previously received immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) may be more effective than traditional therapy. The investigators propose a pilot study to test the combination of ramucirumab and atezolizumab in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC patients previously treated with ICB.

DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draw|PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Overall Response Rate (ORR), * ORR: percentage of participants with a complete or partial response
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., At 6 weeks
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), * CBR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved responses (complete or partial) or stable disease.
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., At 6 weeks|Toxicity and Tolerability as Measured by Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events, -Measured by NCI-CTCAE version 5.0., Through 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Through 2 years after completion of treatment (median length of follow-up 16.3 months, full range=2.3-45.6 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), -PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Through 2 years after completion of treatment (median length of follow-up 16.3 months, full range=2.3-45.6 months)
