Evaluation of HIFU in TREATMENT OF LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER and OF RECURRENCE AFTER RADIOTHERAPY
to compare the efficacy of HIFU treatment with standard treatment in two situations:

1. as first-line cancer treatment, HIFU is compared to radical prostatectomy.
2. for patients with recurrence after external beam radiotherapy, HIFU treatment is compared to radical prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer|Ultrasound Therapy
PROCEDURE: Radical Prostatectomy|PROCEDURE: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Treatment
Recurrence-free survival, The main objective for patients is to compare recurrence-free survival (i.e., the rate of salvage therapy by external beam radiotherapy and/or hormone therapy) in patients treated by HIFU and those treated by radical prostatectomy. The implementation of salvage therapy will be decided according to several non-exclusive criteria (positivity of margins (for patients with radical prostatectomy), PSA at 3 months, biologic recurrence (increase in PSA \> 0.2 ng/ml after radical surgery, \> Nadir +2 after HIFU), control biopsies positive, the appearance of metastases, 30 months
