A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Adverse events were graded according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) criteria as 1=mild AE, 2=moderate AE, 3=severe AE, 4=life-threatening or disabling AE, 5=Death related to AE. The most severe grade was used in case of multiple occurrences of the same event., Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline) up to 28 days after last dose of palbociclib|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Relationship to Study Medication: Phase 2, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study medication in a participant who received study medication. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study medication until 28 days after the last dose of study medication that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. All causality AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs, without regard to relationship to the study medication, which occurred during the trial. Treatment-related were adverse events (serious as well as non-serious adverse events) considered related to study medication by the investigator. Number of participants with treatment related TEAEs and all causality TEAEs were summarized., Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline) up to 28 days after last dose of palbociclib|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities: Phase 2, Laboratory parameters included hematology (hemoglobin, platelets, leukocytes, total neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes); liver function (total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total protein); renal function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid); electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium and phosphate); urinalysis (protein and immunology \[C reactive protein\]), and clinical chemistry (glucose). Total number of participants with laboratory abnormalities was reported., Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline) up to 28 days after last dose of palbociclib|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30): Phase 2, EORTC QLQ-C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores for functional scales, global health status and symptom scales were calculated as an average of individual items, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning, health status or greater degree of symptoms. Score of the single items were transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=greater degree of symptom/difficulty., C1D1 (baseline), C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C5D1, C6D1, C7D1, C8D1, C9D1, C10D1, C11D1, C12D1, C13D1, C14D1, C15D1, C16D1, C17D1, C18D1, C19D1, C20D1, C21D1, C22D1, End of Treatment (assessment at early withdrawal occurring up to Cycle 22)|Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma Module (QLQ-MY20): Phase 2, The QLQ-MY20 consisted of 20 items addressing 4 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) important to participants with multiple myeloma: future perspective (2 items), pain/disease symptoms (6 items), social support /body image (2 items), and treatment side-effects (10 items). All items used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). Scores for HRQoL domains were calculated as an average of the individual items, transformed to 0 to 100 range. Higher scores on symptom scales (disease symptoms and side effects of treatment) indicated a higher level of symptoms/problems. Higher scores on functional scales (future perspective and body image) indicated a higher level of QoL/functioning., C1D1 (baseline), C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C5D1, C6D1, C7D1, C8D1, C9D1, C10D1, C11D1, C12D1, C13D1, C14D1, C15D1, C16D1, C17D1, C18D1, C19D1, C20D1, C21D1, C22D1, End of Treatment (assessment at early withdrawal occurring up to Cycle 22)|Modified Version of Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (m-BPI-sf) Questionnaire: Phase 2, m-BPI-sf was a questionnaire designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. m-BPI-sf contained questions that assessed pain severity (worst, least, average, right now) and pain interference (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life). Each question was answered on a scale ranging from 0 "No pain" to 10 "Pain as bad as you can imagine". The 4 pain severity questions were averaged to derive an index of pain severity and the 7 function questions were averaged to derive an index for pain interference. Total score range for pain severity and interference indices: 0 to 10, where higher score indicated higher severity/interference., C1D1 (baseline), C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C5D1, C6D1, C7D1, C8D1, C9D1, C10D1, C11D1, C12D1, C13D1, C14D1, C15D1, C16D1, C17D1, C18D1, C19D1, C20D1, C21D1, C22D1, End of Treatment (assessment at early withdrawal occurring up to Cycle 22)
