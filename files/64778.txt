HCQ on PAR-4 Levels in Patients With Resectable Solid Tumors
Baseline levels of PAR-4 secreted by normal cells are generally inadequate to cause massive apoptosis in cancer cells and drugs that bolster the secretion of PAR-4 would constitute an important therapeutic advance.The apoptosis sensitizing features of hydroxychloroquine enhance the anti-tumor effects of a broad range of cancer therapeutics. The investigators hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine will induce at least 2-fold increase in systemic (plasma) PAR-4 levels compared to pre-treatment plasma levels in patients with resectable solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine, 200mg twice dailiy|DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine, 400mg twice daily
Patients With Elevated Par-4 Levels, Number of patients with 2-fold change in Par-4 levels from baseline to day 14, Baseline and day 14|Optimal Biologic Dose of Hydroxychloroquine, Dose (mg twice daily) wherein 70% of patients exhibit a 2-fold increase in Par-4 levels with a dose-limiting toxicity of no more than 30%., Day 14
