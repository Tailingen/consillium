Dexamethasone for the Prevention of Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy
Recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction and hypoparathyroidism are well-recognized important complications of thyroid surgery. The duration of convalescence, after non complicated thyroid operation, may depend on several factors of which pain and fatigue are the most important. Nausea and vomiting occur mainly on the day of operation. Glucocorticoids are well known for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immune modulating and antiemetic effects. The investigators therefore undertook the present study to investigate whether preoperative dexamethasone could improve surgical outcome in patients undergoing thyroid surgery.
