Phase 1 Trial of the TQB2928 Injection in Patients With Advanced Cancers
TQB2928 is a promising new molecular entity that mediates blockade of CD47 and SIRPα and enhances the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages. In preclinical in vivo models, TQB2928 was active against a wide range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This is the first-in-human phase 1 trial of TQB2928 in patients with advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
Advanced Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: TQB2928 Injection
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be assessed during the first 28 days of treatment for dose-escalation and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle (28 days) of treatment., During the first 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dosing schedule cohort level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)., During the first 28 days
