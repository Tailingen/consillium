Risk Assessment Model of Trastuzumab-related Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer Patients
According to the existing clinical data in our hospital, retrospective study was conducted to screen the risk factors with predictive value for TRC(trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity) risk, and to construct the risk prediction model for TRC.
Cardiac Toxicity|Antitumor Drugs|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab
Cardiac toxicity, The asymptomatic LVEF decreases â‰¥ 10% of the baseline value or to an absolute value \< 50%, 12 months|Cardiac toxicity, acute or chronic heart failure, 12 months|Cardiac toxicity, New or aggravated arrhythmias or coronary heart disease, 12 months|Cardiac toxicity, Myocardial infarction or other cardiac death, 12 months
The breast cancer patients with cardiotoxicity caused by trastuzumab were selected as the case group, and the breast cancer patients without cardiotoxicity were selected as the control group. The clinical baseline data, echocardiographic parameters and serum markers of the case group and the control group were compared to find out the risk factors that may have predictive value for the risk of TRC. The target factors were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate Logistic regression analysis, and the TRC risk prediction model was established.
