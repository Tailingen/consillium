A Comparison of Continuous Bevacizumab (Avastin) Treatment or Placebo in Addition to Lomustine Followed by Standard of Care After Disease Progression in Participants With Glioblastoma
This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab treatment to lomustine (in 2nd-line \[2L\] treatment) and SOC (in 3rd-line \[3L\] and subsequent lines of treatment) following first-line disease progression (PD1) in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. All enrolled participants will receive 1L treatment with radiotherapy, temozolomide, and bevacizumab. At PD1, eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive 2L treatment with either bevacizumab plus lomustine or placebo plus lomustine. After second-line disease progression (PD2), participants will receive 3L treatment and will continue blinded bevacizumab or placebo with the addition of an SOC agent. Following third-line disease progression (PD3), participants will receive subsequent lines of treatment and will either continue blinded bevacizumab or placebo (at the discretion of the investigator), or switch to open-label bevacizumab (at the choice of the participant).
