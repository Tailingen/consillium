ITIL-168 in Advanced Melanoma
DELTA-1 is a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ITIL-168 in adult subjects with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with a PD-1 inhibitor. ITIL-168 is a cell therapy derived from a patient's own tumor-infiltrating immune cells (lymphocytes; TILs).
