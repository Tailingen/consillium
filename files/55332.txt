Protocol for the Treatment of Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This research study will look at the effects (good or bad) of administering cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rituximab. Clinical studies with combination therapy have shown higher response rates than using single drugs, and this study will evaluate the side effects and effectiveness of this combination.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Rituximab
Tolerability of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine in Patients With Previously Untreated CLL/SLL, The number of patients who experience any grade 3-5 toxicity., Duration of treatment on study|Efficacy of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine in Patients With Previously Untreated CLL/SLL, The number of patients who experience a complete clinical response., Three months after the sixth cycle (9 months)
Overall Survival Rate, The percentage of participants who are still alive., Five years after starting rituximab, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine|Duration of Response, The length of time for which the complete response is maintained., From complete response to the time of progressive disease, death or last clinical examination
This study is designed to expand on the highly successful combination of rituximab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with previously untreated CLL. Responses in the range of 90-98% with 55% complete responses are reported. However, bone marrow toxicity has been a significant problem. This trial is designed to reduce the bone marrow toxicity by decreasing the doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, but doubling the dose of rituximab with a maintenance dose of rituximab for up to two years, to maintain or even enhance efficacy.
