Trail Evaluating Particle Therapy With or Without Apatinib for H&N Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
It is a randomized phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of particle therapy with or without apatinib as induction therapy for the treatment of head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma. Participants will be randomized to arm 1: receiving apatinib for 6 weekly followed by particle radiotherapy; arm 2: particle radiotherapy alone.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib|RADIATION: Particle Therapy
Short-term treatment response of all patients, Three months after completion of particle therapy.
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.03, Time interval from start to 3 months after completion of particle therapy.|Overall survival of all patients, From the diagnosis of H&N adenoid cystic carcinoma, a median of 3 years.|Progression-free survival of all patients, From the completion of the particle therapy, a median of 3 years.|Local progression-free survival of all patients, From the completion of the particle therapy, a median of 3 years.|Distant metastasis-free survival of all patients, From the completion of the particle therapy, a median of 3 years.
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of particle therapy with or without apatinib as induction therapy for the treatment of head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma. It is a randomized phase II clinical trial with single phase and 2 experimental arms. Participants will be randomized to arm 1, receiving apatinib (0.5g, daily) for 6 weekly followed by particle radiotherapy (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15 GyE/5 Fx for boost); arm 2: particle radiotherapy alone (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15 GyE/5 Fx for boost). The short term response will be evaluated using RECIST criteria. And the acute and late toxicities will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE v4.03.
