Evaluating The Antitumor Activity Of MEDI-522 With Or Without Dacarbazine In Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
The primary objectives of this study are:

* To explore the antitumor activity of MEDI-522 ± DTIC in patients with metastatic melanoma.
* To determine the safety of MEDI-522 ± DTIC in this patient population.
Melanoma|Malignant Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: MEDI--522|BIOLOGICAL: Integrin + Dacarbazine
Explore antitumor activity of MEDI-522 in patients with metastatic melanoma., Screening and after every 2 cycles of treatment until disease progression. At least 4 weeks after a patient demonstrates response.
Determine the safety of MEDI-522 and/or DTIC in this patient population., Every week until disease progression, and 30 days after disease progression.
This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label, two-arm, multicenter study of MEDI 522 ± DTIC in previously untreated (other than adjuvant immunotherapy) patients with Stage IV metastatic melanoma (AJCC staging).
