Recombinant Human Endostatin in Combination With mFOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
To investigate safety and tolerance of dose-escalation of infusional recombinant human endostatin in combination with mFOLFOX6 as initial therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Neoplasm
DRUG: recombinant human endostatin (Endostat)
Dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerance dose of continous intravenous Endostar in combination with mFOLFOX6, 14 days
Parameters of human pharmacokinetics of continous intravenous Endostar in combination with mFOLFOX6, 11 days
Recombinant human endostatin(Endostar) is commonly used through intermittent intravenous adminstration in routine clinical practice in China. It is very difficult to maintain steady-state of plasma concentration of this agent due to this manner of application. Continous infusional Endostar was designed to alter the imblance of concentration to avoid compromising efficacy of anti-angionesis therapy.The strategy of dose-escalation was used in this study in order to obtain the optimal dosage of Endostar for the next phase â…¡ trial.
