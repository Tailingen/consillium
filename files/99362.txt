Ph II of a Novel Anti-angiogenic Agent in Combination With Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of CT-322 comparative to bevacizumab, both in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of chemonaive subjects with recurrent or advanced non-squamous NSCLC
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: CT-322|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab placebo (ie saline solution)
Progression free survival based on tumor assessments (CT scans/MRI), every 6 weeks until documented progressive disease , death or initiation of subsequent therapy for NSCLC
Overall survival (OS) between 2 arms, every 12 weeks|Objective tumor response rate (ORR) between 2 arms, every 6 weeks|Safety in the CT-322 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel arm, weekly
