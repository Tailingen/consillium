Open-label Phase 2 Study of Avutometinib (RAF/MEK Clamp) in Combination With Defactinib (FAK Inhibitor) and Cetuximab in Patients With Unresectable, Anti-EGFR-Refractory Advanced Colorectal Cancer
To learn if avutometinib in combination with defactinib and cetuximab can help to control unresectable, anti-EGFR-refractory, advanced colorectal cancer.
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Defactinib|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Avutometinib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
The primary objective is to assess the antitumor activity of the treatment combinations based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Assess impact of treatment combinations on survival
2. Characterize the safety profile of the treatment combinations (DLTs)
3. Evaluate the pharmacodynamics of the avutometinib combination with defactinib plus cetuximab.
4. Evaluate for pERK and Ki67 inhibition

Exploratory Objectives

* Assess blood- and tissue-based predictive biomarkers of activity upon treatment with cetuximab plus avutometinib plus defactinib
* Demonstrate feasibility of establishing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in matched patients with cetuximab-refractory mCRC to evaluate for biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance.
* Explore mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab plus avutometinib and defactinib
