Endocrine Therapy With or Without Cryoablation for Stage IV Prostate Cancer
This trial is going to evaluate tumor control and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer treated with endocrine therapy with or without cryoablation.
Stage IV Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: cryoablation|DRUG: Bicalutamide|DRUG: luteinizing-hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist
Median biochemical progression-free survival, It measures the time to biochemical progression (PSA progression)., Within 12 months after treatment|Quality of Life impact of treatments' side effects measured by change in EORTC QOL-C30 from baseline to 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC), 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment
Overall survival, 5 year|Disease Specific Survival, 5 year
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the tumor control in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy or cryoablation
* To determine the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≥ 8 vs 7 vs ≤ 6), persistent prostatic specific antigen (PSA) at allocation (\> 0.5 ng/mL vs ≤ 0.5 ng/mL), participating center. Patient are allocated to two treatment arms.
