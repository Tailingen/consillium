EXPRESS: EXcePtional RESponSe - Exceptional and Unexpected Response to Targeted Therapies
Adult patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid malignancies (including but not limited to breast, cancer, lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, renal clear cell cancer, skin cutaneous melanoma), presenting or having presented an exceptional and unexpected response to an antineoplastic targeted therapy.
Metastatic Cancers
OTHER: Blood sampling
The primary endpoint is the rate of patients with tumors harboring a low level of genomic alteration (mutation, amplification or deletion) in genes (i.e. mutation, amplification, deletion) identified as causally implicated in cancer, 42 months
The secondary endpoint is the rate of tumors with low level of genomic alterations between the EXPRESS cohort and control cohorts of patients., 42 months|Exploratory analyses will be performed to compare the profiles between the EXPRESS and the control cohorts of patients, to identify novel candidate somatic molecular profiles, 42 months
The primary endpoint is the rate of patients with tumors harboring a low level of genomic alteration (mutation, amplification or deletion) in genes (i.e. mutation, amplification, deletion) identified as causally implicated in cancer. A low level of genomic alteration is defined by the presence of less than the 5th quantile of genomic alterations to be expected in the given tumor type. Conversely, a high level of genomic alteration is defined by the presence of more than the 5th quantile of genomic alterations to be expected in the given tumor type.

The list of genes for which alterations are identified as causally implicated in cancer is defined by the Cancer Gene Census. This is an ongoing effort to catalogue those genes for which mutations, amplifications or deletions have been causally implicated in cancer. It is constantly updated by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (UK) and available at: http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census (n=571 genes in September 2015)
