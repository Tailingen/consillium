Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach|Gastroesophageal Junction Expressing Guanylyl Cyclase C
DRUG: MLN0264
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions., Day 21, every other cycle, starting with Cycle 2 until disease progression, death or study closure (up to 17 months)
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator., From the first dose through 30 days after the last dose of study medication (Up to 10.7 months)|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Laboratory Evaluation Findings, Participants with at least one post-baseline potentially clinically significant serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation or urinalysis result. Clinically significant results are those that were assessed by the investigator to be Grade 3 or higher using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life threatening or disabling and Grade 5=Death., From the first dose through 30 days after the last dose of study medication (Up to 10.7 months)|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Vital Signs Findings, Participants with at least one potentially clinically significant post-baseline vital sign finding including measurements of diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and oral temperature., Day 1 of each 21 day cycle and 30 days after the last dose of study medication (Up to 10.7 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time in days from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Time Frame: Day 21 of every other 21-day cycle starting with Cycle 2, 30 days after the last dose of study medication, and then every 12 weeks for up to an additional 6 months (Up to 16.7 months)|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time in days from the date of first documentation of a confirmed response to the date of first documentation of disease progression. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions., From first documented response until disease progression (Up to 16.7 months)|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with a minimum of 12 weeks' duration. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, no new lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and no new lesions. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started and no new lesions. Investigator response is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1., Day 21 of every other 21-day cycle starting with Cycle 2, 30 days after the last dose of study medication, and then every 12 weeks for up to an additional 6 months (Up to 16.7 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time in days from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death., Until death or 6 months after the last patient completes treatment-whichever occurs first (Up to 17 months)|Cmax: Maximum Observed Serum Concentration for MLN0264, Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) is the peak serum concentration of a drug after administration, obtained directly from the serum concentration-time curve., Cycles 1-3 predose and 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 3, 4, 8 and 15 days postdose. Cycles 4+ predose, 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 4 and 8 days postdose.|MLN0264 Serum Concentrations, Blood samples were collected and sent to a laboratory to be tested for serum concentrations of MLN0264., Cycles 1-3 pre-dose and 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 3, 4, 8 and 15 days post-dose; Cycles 4-9 and 11-14 pre-dose and 10 minutes post-dose; End of Treatment.|Serum Concentration of Total Antibodies (Conjugated and Unconjugated), Blood samples were collected and sent to a laboratory to be tested for conjugated and unconjugated antibodies., Cycles 1-3 pre-dose and 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 3, 4, 8 and 15 days post-dose; Cycles 4-9 and 11-14 pre-dose and 10 minutes post-dose; End of Treatment.|Serum Concentration of Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE), Blood samples were collected and sent to a laboratory to be tested for MMAE., Cycles 1-3 pre-dose and 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 3, 4, 8 and 15 days post-dose; Cycles 4-9 and 11-14 pre-dose and 10 minutes post-dose; End of Treatment.|Number of Participants With Reduction From Baseline in Tumor Size, The number of participants with the best percentage of tumor reduction from baseline in the sum of the diameter was calculated., Day 21 of every other 21-day cycle starting with Cycle 2, 30 days after the last dose of study medication, and then every 12 weeks for up to an additional 6 months (Up to 16.7 months)|Guanylyl Cyclase C (GCC) H-score Assessed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Analysis of GCC protein expression levels in tumor tissue (fresh biopsy pretreatment and whenever a biopsy is considered medically safe and technically feasible) was performed using a semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and the total GCC H-Score was determined. GCC H-score is based on the sum of the 0 to 300 H-score for cytoplasmic staining and the 0 to 300 H-score for apical staining for a total possible H-score 0 to 600. Separate consent was required to obtain archival tumor specimens for GCC expression assessment prior to screening., Approximately 20 months|Number of Participants With Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATA), Blood samples were collected to assess the immunogenicity of MLN0264 (ATA development) using a laboratory test. Neutralizing ATA assessment was performed for ATA-positive samples only., Pre-dose of each 21 day cycle and 30 days after last dose of study medication (Up to 10.7 months)
The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0264. MLN0264 is being tested to treat tumors in people who have metastatic or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction malignancies expressing guanylyl cyclase C (GCC). Participants will be analyzed in cohorts based on GCC expression: low=combined H-score 10-109, intermediate=combined H-score 110-249, high=combined IHC H-score \>250. This study will assess tumor size reduction in patients who are administered MLN0264.

The study enrolled 38 patients. All participants will be administered MLN0264 at 1.8 mg/kg as a single, 30-minute, intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle, followed by a rest period of 20 days. Participants will continue to receive MLN0264 for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 19 months. Participants will make 3 to 6 visits to the clinic per treatment cycle, an end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study medication, and follow-up assessments every 12 weeks until death or 6 months after the last patient completes treatment - whichever occurs first.
