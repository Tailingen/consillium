Benefit of Roux-en-Y (R-Y) Reconstruction After Pancreaticoduodenectomy
One of the most common complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is delayed gastric emptying (DGE), otherwise known as "gastroparesis," which is not fatal but results in prolonged hospital stay and increased hospital costs. Delayed gastric emptying is defined as nasogastric decompression after postoperative day (POD) 10 or a failure to tolerate a regular diet after POD 14. The incidence of DGE has been reported to range from 5% to 72%.
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: R-Y reconstruction
the incidence of DGE, 3-6 months
the incidence of other complication associated with reconstruction, 3-6 months
We hypothesized that the hand-sewn, two-layered, or continuous suture, could induce anastomotic edema to indeed the afferent peristalsis, which is one of the causes of DGE.
