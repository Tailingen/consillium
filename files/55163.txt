The patients enrolled in the study will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with combination therapy, monotherapy, or SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, based on cisplatin eligibility). Patients will be treated with MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) or MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) with tremelimumab, or treated with SoC until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years.
