OCT-angiography as a Pronostic Marker for Visual Impairment in Patients Undergoing Neurosurgery for Compressive Macroadenoma : a Prospective Study.
The aim of the study is to assess accurancy of OCT angiography as a pronostic marker for patients undergoing neurosurgery for compressiver macroadenoma as compared with visual acuity, visual field and OCT.
