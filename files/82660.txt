B003 in Patients With HER2-positive Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
To assess the safety and tolerability characteristics of B003 in HER2-positive patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is assessed and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is explored.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody conjugate for injection.R&D code: B003.
Maximum Tolerated Dose, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is operationally defined in toxicology as the highest daily dose of a chemical that does not cause overt toxicity in subjects, through study completion, an average of 2 years|Dose-Limiting Toxicity, Some of the major toxic side effects are the main reasons limiting the continued increase in the dose of chemotherapy drugs, which are the dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy drugs., From day 1 to day 21 of treatment|Immunogenicity assessment, Sample positive rate and Individual positive rate of Anti-drug antibody(ADA), through study completion, an average of 2 years|Titer of ADA positive sample, a test to determine the level or degree of ADA positive samples and analyse the effect on the plasma concentration., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Pharmacokinetics measurement A, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

Peak Plasma Time (Tmax), through study completion, an average of 2 year|Pharmacokinetics measurement B, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), through study completion, an average of 2 year|Pharmacokinetics measurement C, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

half-life time, through study completion, an average of 2 year|Pharmacokinetics measurement D, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

Mean Residence Time( MRT), through study completion, an average of 2 year|Pharmacokinetics measurement E, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), through study completion, an average of 2 year|Pharmacokinetics measurement F, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

elimination rate constant, through study completion, an average of 2 year|Pharmacokinetics measurement G, According to the detection of the serum concentration of B003 in plasma sample, the diagram of drug concentration-time for individual and each dose group could be concluded.

clearance rate(CL/F), through study completion, an average of 2 year|Therapeutic Efficacy A, Objective Remission Rate (ORR): to be defined as the percentage of patients with complete response or partial response. Patients with CR or PR for the first evaluation will be confirmed after 4weeks. Patients without any evaluations are regarded as none-response., from date of start from the infusion of the first subject until the date after two treatments of the last subject, assessed up to 14 months.|Therapeutic Efficacy B, Disease Control rate(DCR): to be defined as the percentage of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease., from date of start from the infusion of the first subject until the date after two treatments of the last subject, assessed up to 14 months.|Therapeutic Efficacy C, Duration of response(DOR): to be defined as the duration from the first evaluation time when the patient has CR or PR to the first evaluation time when the patient has disease progression or death., from the date when he patient has CR or PR to the first evaluation until the date when the patient has disease progression or death, assessed up to 14 months.|Therapeutic Efficacy D, Progression-free survival:to be defined as the duration from the time of first infusion to the first recording time when the patient has disease progression or death., from the date when he patient has CR or PR to the first evaluation until the date when the patient has disease progression or death, assessed up to 14 months.
