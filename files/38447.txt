Imaging the Uterine Cervix - UltraSightHD™
The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance ability of the UltraSightHD™. The instrument will be assessed on characteristics such as focus quality, ability to image the entire cervix, and illumination. The information gathered from this study will provide data that will be used to determine which settings provide the best imaging outcome for the cervix for a simple screening instrument. Further, this information will serve as the foundation in the development of more advanced follow-on imaging devices.

The primary objectives of this study are to:

* Determine if the light source provides sufficient illumination of the cervix.
* Assess focus and overall image quality.
* Assess the functionality and ergonomics of the instrument's design.
