A Phase I/II Trial of AEZS-108 in Urothelial Cancer Patients Who Failed Platinum-chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the appropriate dose of AEZS-108 to treat patients with a tumor of the urinary system.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: AEZS-108|DRUG: AEZS-108 at MTD
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Toxicity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Day 1 of each 21-day cycle
Objective tumor response, Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria., Within 5 days of cycle 4, then every 3 cycles|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time elapsed from the start of treatment to the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first., last cycle|Pharmacokinetics (PK), To evaluate PK parameters of a single dose AEZS-108 and explore whether the PK parameters are associated with cardiac effects as measured by electrocardiography., cycle 1|Overall survival, Time elapsed from the start of treatment until death., last cycle|Circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels, To quantify tumor cells and attempt to correlate their presence and response to the outcomes of this study., last cycle
AEZS-108 is an investigational drug, combining luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), an hormone and doxorubicin (a drug approved to treat different types of cancer).

Some tumors, such as those found in the urinary system (also called urothelial carcinomas), have LHRH hormone receptors to which the LHRH hormone part of AEZS-108 is attracted.

AEZS-108 is expected to work by accumulating mostly on the surface of cancer cells that have LHRH hormone receptors and by delivering doxorubicin more directly into the cells to kill them. This would allow the use doxorubicin at lower doses and thus would cause less toxicity.

In the first part of the study, the appropriate dose of AEZS-108 will be determined based on its side effects. The best dose will be the highest one without severe side effects.

In the second part of the study, this best dose of AEZS-108 will be given to determine its efficacy to stop the tumor from progressing.
