Image Guided Intensity Modulated Reirradiation (IG-IMRT) With Cetuximab for Locoregionally Confined Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The standard treatment for head and neck cancer relapses in previously irradiated patients is controversial. Reirradiation has had some success, but many patients still die from their disease. Cetuximab is helpful in relapsed head and neck cancer, and it improves the effectiveness of radiation in some head and neck cancer patients. But, it has not been studied with reirradiation. The purpose of this study is to see the effects, both good and bad, of reirradiation with cetuximab.
