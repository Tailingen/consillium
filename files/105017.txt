Omentectomy for Metabolic Syndrome in Gastric Cancer Patients
Many features of the metabolic syndrome are associated with insulin resistance. And, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are related to visceral obesity. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that visceral fat removal (omentectomy) can make favorable results for the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. As the omentectomy is optional procedure during a surgery for early gastric cancer, the investigators will divide patients randomly into two groups, total omentectomy group and omentum preserving group.
Metabolic Syndrome|Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Omentum preserving|PROCEDURE: Total omentectomy
HOMA-IR change, HOMA-IR change after operation, pre-operative and post-operative 12months
prevalence of metabolic syndrome, check the presence of metabolic syndrome, pre-operative and post-operative 12months|Complication, short-term any complication related to surgery, within 30days|HOMA-IR change according to anastomosis type, comparison between Billoth-II and Roux-en-Y, pre-operative and post-operative 12months
The investigators will compare the change of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and improvement of metabolic syndrome between total omentectomy and omentum preserving group.
