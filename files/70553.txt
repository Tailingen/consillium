Combining Ipilimumab, Degarelix, and Radical Prostatectomy in Men With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer or Ipilimumab and Degarelix in Men With Biochemically Recurrent Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking ipilimumab with degarelix before surgery to remove the prostate, followed by more degarelix and ipilimumab after the surgery, will have on prostate cancer.

The goal of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of a multimodality approach combining hormones and immunotherapy in prostate cancer populations that are considered incurable and standardly treated with hormones alone, and represent clinical states prior to development of castration-resistant disease. There are 2 cohorts. The first will use ipilimumab and degarelix prior to and following radical prostatectomy in men with newly diagnosed, oligometastatic, castration-sensitive disease. The second cohort will include men who have already received definitive local therapy with radical prostatectomy but have since experienced biochemical and/or metastatic recurrence.
Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Degarelix|DRUG: Ipilimumab|PROCEDURE: Radical Prostatectomy
undetectable PSA, An undetectable PSA at 12 and 20 months (weeks 52 and 84, respectively) from the start of treatment among patients with non-castrate (\> 150 ng/ml) levels of testosterone. An undetectable PSA is defined as PSA â‰¤0.05 ng/mL., at 12 and 20 months
progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is a composite endpoint defined as disease progression in bone or soft-tissue, symptoms, or death measured from study entry. Progression in soft tissue will be measured by modified RECIST per PCWG2.., 2 years|overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as death from any cause measured from study entry., 2 years|Toxicity, Toxicity will be evaluated for all treated patients using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov)., 2 years
