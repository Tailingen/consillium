Efficacy and Safety Study of SyB L-0501 for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The study objectives of this study are to determine the effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of bendamustine for multiple myeloma to a regimen of bendamustine and prednisolone.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: SyB L-0501|DRUG: prednisolone
Complete Response (CR) Rate [Based on the Modified Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Criteria], The proportion of subjects evaluated as CR was calculated.

CR (modified SWOG) requires all of the followings:

1. Decline in serum myeloma protein by ≥75% to ≤25 g/L
2. Reduction in 24 h urinary protein by ≥90% to ≤200 mg/24 h
3. No increase in skeletal destruction
4. Serum calcium within normal range
5. No blood transfusion required in the previous 3 months, Up to 36 weeks
CR Rate [Based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria], The proportion of subjects evaluated as CR \[strict CR (sCR) + CR\] was calculated.

sCR (IMWG): CR as defined below plus Normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence

CR (IMWG): Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow, Up to 36 weeks|Response Rate (Based on the IMWG Criteria), The proportion of subjects evaluated as response \[sCR + CR + very good partial response (VGPR) + Partial Response (PR)\] was calculated.

VGPR (IMWG): Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg per 24 h

PR (IMWG): ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg per 24 h, Up to 36 weeks|CR Rate Based on the (Bladé) Criteria, The proportion of subjects evaluated as CR was calculated.

CR (Bladé) requires all of the followings:

1. Absence of the original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine by immunofixation, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks. The presence of oligoclonal bands consistent with oligoclonal immune reconstitution does not exclude CR.
2. \<5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and also on trephine bone biopsy, if biopsy is performed. If absence of monoclonal protein is sustained for 6 weeks it is not necessary to repeat the bone marrow, except in patients with non-secretory myeloma where the marrow examination must be repeated after an interval of at least 6 weeks to confirm CR.
3. No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response)
4. Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas, Up to 36 weeks|Response Rate (Based on the Bladé Criteria), The proportion of subjects evaluated as response (CR + PR) was calculated.

PR (Bladé) requires 1. or all of the others:

1. Some, but not all, of the criteria for CR are fulfilled
2. ≥50% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
3. Reduction in 24 h urinary light chain excretion either by ≥90% or to \<200 mg, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
4. For patients with non-secretory myeloma only, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and on trephine biopsy, if biopsy is performed, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
5. ≥50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas (by radiography or clinical examination).
6. No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response)., Up to 36 weeks|Response Rate (Based on the Modified SWOG Criteria), The proportion of subjects evaluated as response (CR + PR) was calculated.

PR (SWOG) requires the followings:

1. Decline in myeloma protein of ≥25%-\<74% in serum myeloma protein
2. Reduction in 24h urinary myeloma protein of ≥25%-\<89%
3. No increase in skeletal destruction
4. Serum calcium within normal range, Up to 36 weeks|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the period from patient registration to either the date of recurrence, exacerbation, progression or death.

Recurrence, exacerbation, progression were assessed from serum M-protein, urine M-protein, serum free light chain (FLC), the percentage of marrow plasma cells, disappearance of clonal plasma cells, plasma cell tumor in soft tissue, and bone lesion., Up to 2 years|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF is the period from patient registration to either the date of recurrence, exacerbation, progression, death or discontinuation of treatment., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is the period from the date of achieving CR or PR to either the date of recurrence, exacerbation, progression or death., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the period from the date of patient registration to the date of death., Up to 2 years|Number of Subjects With Adverse Event, Related Adverse Event, Serious Adverse Event, and Related Serious Adverse Event, Adverse events were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.02, Japan Clinical Oncology Group/Japan Society of Clinical Oncology (JCOG/JSCO) version, and were encoded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)., Up to 2 years|Number of Adverse Events, Related Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Related Serious Adverse Events, Adverse events were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.02, Japan Clinical Oncology Group/Japan Society of Clinical Oncology (JCOG/JSCO) version, and were encoded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)., Up to 2 years|Number of Subjects With Abnormality (Grade ≥3) in Laboratory Test Values, Abnormalities in laboratory test values in overall study period were analyzed. Severity of abnormalities were evaluated using CTCAE.

grade 1 : mild

grade 2 : moderate

grade 3 : severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening

grade 4 : life threatening or disabling

grade 5 : death related to AE, Up to 2 years|Number of Abnormalities (Grade ≥3) in Laboratory Test Values, Abnormalities in laboratory test values in overall study period were analyzed. Severity of abnormalities were evaluated using CTCAE., Up to 2 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Cmax), Plasma pharmacokinetics (Cmax) of unchanged bendamustine, On Day 1 only|Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Tmax), Plasma pharmacokinetics (tmax) of unchanged bendamustine, On Day 1 only|Pharmacokinetic Parameters (AUC), Plasma pharmacokinetics (AUC) of unchanged bendamustine, On Day 1 only|Pharmacokinetic Parameters (t1/2), Plasma pharmacokinetics (t1/2) of unchanged bendamustine, On Day 1 only
The study objectives of this study are to determine the effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of bendamustine for untreated and maladjustment to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) multiple myeloma to a regimen of bendamustine and prednisolone.
