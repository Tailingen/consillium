Endometrial Lesions Predictions
To explore the risk factors of endometrial lesions in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding and establish prediction models which can discriminate between different endometrial etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding(AUB).
Endometrial Neoplasms
OTHER: no intervention
pathology of endometrial lesions, Endometrial tissue was curettaged and sent for pathological examination in 10% formalin. A senior pathologist who was not blinded to clinical and ultrasound information examined the samples and determined the final diagnosis. The outcomes of histology are classified as normal endometrium and endometrial lesions, which include 1)endometrial polyps,2)endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, 3)endometrial atypical hyperplasia and 4) endometrial carcinoma., 1 year
Ultrasonographic Examination, VS examinations were performed by an experienced physician with a vaginal probe of 5.5 MHz of a GE VolusonE10 Ultrasound device to look for endometrial thickness and abnormal echoes. Endometrial thickness (ET) was measured at the thickest part with double layers, 1 year
