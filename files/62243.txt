A Study of AK117/AK112 in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
This trial is a Phase II study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of AK117/AK112 administered with chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (mBC).
