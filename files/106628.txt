A Study of Zimberelimab(GLS-010) Combined With AVD for Newly Diagnosed Early-stage Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a multicenter, open-label single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zimberelimab (GLS-010) combined with AVD for newly diagnosed early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma under the guidance of PET/CT.

Despite achieving good disease control and long-term survival rates for over 80% of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients who receive first-line therapy, approximately 10% of early-stage and 30% of advanced cHL patients experience disease relapse or refractoriness after initial treatment, and only half of the patients can be cured through high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Meanwhile, the current standard first-line treatment still centers around conventional chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents. As such, the clinical challenge of cHL first-line treatment lies in striking a balance between efficacy and toxicity, and developing low-toxicity, high-efficiency treatment strategies to achieve the optimal treatment goal of maximizing efficacy while minimizing short- and long-term toxicities.
