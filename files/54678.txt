Immunotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Cancers and CDK12 Mutations
This study will attempt to determine the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy followed by nivolumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and other tumor solid tumor histologies harboring loss of CDK12 function as well as monotherapy nivolumab treatment in patient with metastatic prostate cancer harboring loss of CDK12 function.

The Proportion of Patients With CDK12 Loss of Function Metastatic CRPC That Respond to Treatment., The primary objective is overall response rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic CRPC. Response will be defined as a 50% decline in PSA (prostate specific antigen) from baseline as determined by PCWG3 criteria., Up to 24 months post treatment
The Proportion of Patients That Respond to Treatment in Cohort B., Overall response will be defined as patients that achieve either a partial response or complete response using RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Complete response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.

Partial response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions., Up to 104 weeks after start of therapy|Radiographic Progression Free Survival Time (rPFS), Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of radiographic progression. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 104 weeks after start of therapy|Progression Free Survival Time (PFS), Progression is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progression is defined as:

Either, Radiographic progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions OR, PSA Progression: For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks., Up to 24 months post treatment|Duration of Therapy (DOT), Defined by the time interval from the start of treatment to the day of permanent discontinuation of treatment (including death)., Up to 104 weeks after start of therapy|Progression Rate at 6 Months, Progression is defined as: Either, Radiographic progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions OR, PSA Progression: For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks., 6 months|Overall Survival Time, Defined as the time from the start of treatment until death from any cause. Patients alive or lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored at their last date of follow-up., Up to 24 months post treatment|PSA Progression Free Survival Time, PSA Progression: For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks., Up to 24 months post treatment|Time to PSA Progression, PSA Progression: For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks., Up to 24 months post treatment
This study investigates the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer with CDK12 mutations. The study includes three cohorts: Cohort A consists of metastatic prostate cancer patients being treated with combination nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment followed by monotherapy nivolumab treatment. Cohort B consists of other solid tumor patients being treated with combination nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment followed by monotherapy nivolumab treatment. As of an amendment approved 03FEB2021 a third cohort was added, Cohort C, which consists of metastatic prostate cancer patients being treated with monotherapy nivolumab treatment.

As of an amendment approved 21JUN2020 the maximum duration of treatment, as well as the anticipated timing for some of the studies outcome measures, were updated from 52 weeks to 104 weeks.
