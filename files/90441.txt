A Study of Rapamycin Combined With Intravesical BCG in Patients With Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This study is looking at the effects of Sirolimus (Rapamycin) on BCG-specific immunity during treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with maintenance BCG.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Sirolimus
Percentage change in systemic (whole blood) gamma-delta T cells frequency, Change will be evaluated by comparing percentage increase or decrease following rapamycin or control (no therapy) against baseline measures, 4 weeks and 3 months after therapy|Percentage change in systemic (whole blood) gamma-delta T cell proliferation in response to BCG-specific antigens, Change will be evaluated by comparing percentage increase or decrease following rapamycin or control (no therapy) against baseline measures, 4 weeks and 3 months after therapy|Percentage change in systemic (whole blood) Ag85 peptide-specific CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes measured using human IFN-gamma release., Change will be evaluated by comparing percentage increase or decrease following rapamycin or control (no therapy) against baseline measures, 4 weeks and 3 months after therapy
This study will evaluate change from baseline in gamma-delta T cell numbers and function and Ag85 peptide-specific T cell responses following treatment.
