PROTECT: On-line Adaptive Proton Therapy for Cervical Cancer
This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized phase-II-trial investigates in clinical practice the differences between intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the effects on dose-volume parameters and treatment-related morbidity for women with locally advanced cervical cancer undergoing chemoradiation.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with concurrent chemotherapy followed by brachytherapy is a highly effective treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). However, treatment-related toxicity is common and reduces the patient's quality of life (QoL) and may affect ability to complete treatment or undergo adjuvant therapies. Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) enables a significant dose reduction in organs at risk (OAR), when compared to that of standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). However, clinical studies evaluating whether IMPT consequently reduces side effects for LACC are lacking. The PROTECT trial is a nonrandomized prospective multicenter phase-II-trial comparing clinical outcomes after IMPT or IMRT/VMAT in LACC. Thirty women aged \>18 years with a histological diagnosis of LACC will be included in either the IMPT or IMRT/VMAT group. Treatment includes EBRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy), concurrent five weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2), and 3D image (MRI)-guided adaptive brachytherapy. The primary endpoint is pelvic bones Dmean and mean bowel V15Gy. Secondary endpoints include dosimetric parameters, oncological outcomes, health-related QoL, immune response, safety, and tolerability. This study provides the first data on the potential of IMPT to reduce OAR dose in clinical practice and improve toxicity and QoL for patients with LACC.
