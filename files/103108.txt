A Study of Obinutuzumab in Combination With CHOP Chemotherapy Versus Rituximab With CHOP in Participants With CD20-Positive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (GOYA)
This open-label, randomized, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone or prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy versus rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) with CHOP in previously untreated participants with cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Participants will be randomized to receive either obinutuzumab 1000 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) every 21 days or rituximab 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m\^2) IV every 21 days for 8 cycles, in addition to 6-8 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy IV every 21 days. Participants randomized to the obinutuzumab arm will receive an additional two doses on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. Anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.
