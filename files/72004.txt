Masks Against Surface-Scanning for Radiation Therapy Immobilisation in Head and Neck Cancer (MASSC)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using open masks or no masks in combination with optical surface scanning for radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Neoplasm
RADIATION: Radiotherapy with Closed Mask|RADIATION: Radiotherapy with Open Mask and Surface Scanning|RADIATION: Radiotherapy with No Mask
Positional Deviation, Patient positioning and movement during treatment will be assessed using cone-beam computed tomopgraphy (CBCT). The position of the patient and target volumes measured by CBCT will be compared to computed tomography (CT) scans made during the initial simulation of treatment. CBCT-scans are made right before administering radiation and after radiation has been administered. Translational and rotational deviations will be measured and expressed in millimeters (for translational deviation) and degrees (for rotational deviation)., Positional Deviation will be assessed from start of treatment period to end of treatment period (up to 7 weeks).
Patient Distress, Patient Distress, measured every week using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDs), a scale of 0-10 where a higher number indicates a worse outcome., Patient distress will be assessed from start of treatment period to end of treatment period (up to 7 weeks).|Duration of Treatment, Duration of treatment (in minutes), registered in radiotherapy software., Duration of treatment will be assessed from start of treatment period to end of treatment period (up to 7 weeks).|Radiotherapy Technician Satisfaction, Personnel satisfaction, questioned weekly using a personnel satisfaction scale from 0 to 10, where a higher number indicates a better outcome., Radiotherapy technician satisfaction will be assessed from start of treatment period to end of treatment period (up to 7 weeks).|Radiation Dose, In vivo dosimetry will be used to asses the accuracy of treatment. Using PerFRACTIONâ„¢ in vivo dosimetry. Administered radiation doses will be measured for the target volume and expressed in Gray (Gy)., Radiation dose will be assessed from start of treatment period to end of treatment period (up to 7 weeks).
