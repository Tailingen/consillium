Predictive Biomarkers for IGF1R Targeted Therapy in Ovarian Cancer: a Retrospective Study
The main goal of this study is to employ a novel proteomic approach to identify predictive tumor biomarkers that will increase the efficacy of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1R) targeted therapy in epithelial ovarian cancer. It is expected that these predictive biomarkers will be applied to increase the response rate in selected groups of patients.
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: Immunohistochemistry staining method
Responsive to IGF1R therapy, Mean tumor volume will be calculated and growth inhibition will be reported as the percentage decrease of tumor volume compared with the control., One year
