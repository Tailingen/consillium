Lurbinectedin Monotherapy in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study of lurbinectedin monotherapy in participants with advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Solid Tumor|Urothelial Cancer|Poorly Differentiated Neuroendocrine Carcinomas|Homologous Recombination Deficient-Positive Malignancies Agnostic
DRUG: Lurbinectedin
Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, The ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response (BOR) is investigator-assessed confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria. BOR is defined as the best response recorded between the date of first dose and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST v1.1, or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy, death due to any cause, loss to follow-up, or study discontinuation, whichever occurs first., Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.
Investigator-Assessed Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks|Investigator-Assessed Time-To-Response (TTR) as Assessed Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, TTR is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of the first confirmed response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]), as assessed by the investigators., Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks|Investigator-Assessed Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the first confirmed response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks|Investigator-assessed Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, DCR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response (BOR) is confirmed complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria., Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Treated With Lurbinectedin, OS is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of death from any cause. A participant who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date, Baseline and every 3 months, up to 16 months
This phase 2, multicenter, open-label study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of lurbinectedin monotherapy in 3 cohorts of participants with high-unmet medical need: advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) urothelial cancer (UC), poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD-NEC), and a homologous recombination deficient-positive malignancies agnostic cohort.
